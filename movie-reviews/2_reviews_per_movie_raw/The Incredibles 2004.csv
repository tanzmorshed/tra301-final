","Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired ""Shark Tale"", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with ""The Incredibles"". And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.<br/><br/>First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.<br/><br/>Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.<br/><br/>Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.<br/><br/>Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>****1/2 of ***** stars"
"Rich B","10","360","451","21 November 2004"," Wonderful, beautiful to watch, all in all, incredible.
","WOW! What a movie. I can honestly say this is in my top ten movies of all time, how do Pixar continue to out do themselves at every movie release?<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a story of a man encountering a mid life crisis and leaping headlong into it without a care or a thought for his family, proving exceedingly selfish and failing to see the good in his life. Meanwhile the wife is left to try and look after the family. Really, that's the story. Now, what Pixar have done is drop in the idea that the parents are Superheroes, banned from being Super many years previously by the Government and the people, trying to live a normal life. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie.<br/><br/>I can't begin to convey how wonderful the animation is, it's perfect. I mean you'll always be looking at it knowing it's animation, but when the story takes you along you'll suddenly realize you're still watching animation. The subtle difference is that you forget, and there are parts (for instance when the father is cheering his son during the race) that you actually think it is real. The effects for water, fire (two of the hardest things to recreate in animation) and lava are wonderful to watch and caught me drawing a breath when I first saw them.<br/><br/>The characters and acting are wonderful, and you will find yourself caring about them as real people. At some points I could feel a big swallow coming up and a wavering adams apple, obviously due to the food earlier, nothing to do with the movie.<br/><br/>I often find that movies aren't paced well, that they either have too long or too short an introduction to the characters, or the events that lead up to the pivotal point of the movie are unbalanced against the climax, all sorts of combinations. Not here, this move is perfect and well balanced, the story takes you along just when you are ready, and there were no points where I wished we could move on, or something could happen quicker. My only frustration were at the kids, and this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see the comparisons and links to other famous Superheroes through comic-lore. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. My only concern is that there is so much similarity to The Watchmen that those who haven't read the graphic novel will be saying ""That's the Incredibles movie"" when Watchmen finally comes to fruition.<br/><br/>The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. Excellent, and once again, outdoes every short that they've produced before. Boundin' was beautifully animated and wonderfully told. Guaranteed to bring a huge big smile to your face.<br/><br/>All in all I think this movie is perfect and truly incredible."
"Quinoa1984","10","249","311","5 November 2004"," My favorite film from Pixar in over five years- Bird and company produce a triumph of a family film
","Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system. <br/><br/>It's a film that takes on a type in society that we all know well (in the past they've done toys, bugs, monsters, undersea life, and now comic book archetypes) and transforms it superbly to the imaginative computer-animated landscape. This is also in credit due to Brad Bird, who proved five years ago with his sleeper The Iron Giant that he could transcend the genre and appeal with heart and vigor for almost every age bracket.<br/><br/>So what little touches make The Incredibles so appealing? How it starts to deconstruct the idea of a superhero, perhaps, as well as how the family unit is shown in the usual conventions under unusual and funny circumstances. As an example, one of our heroes Mr. Incredible, a.k.a. Bob Parr (voiced wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson), goes to visit a woman who fixes and creates the uniforms of superheroes. In one scene she explains why a cape is not a good idea. This is the kind of scene that might not make it into most Hollywood movies, and would sometimes if not often be discredited as being too 'smart' for kids to get. But by appealing to a kind of level late teens and adults can relate to, it reaches a higher, far more intelligent plane. In fact, many of the best scenes in the film take on what we all know in films displaying the 'family unit' and morph it with the power and imagination of superheroes.<br/><br/>I won't go too much into the plot as some may already have, except to say that what makes the story in and of itself appealing is how it is a fully formed story, and doesn't try and sell itself short like other animated films (i.e. Sharktale for example). It also uses it's PG-rating perimeter wisely, and Bird and company create action sequences that are as exciting, if not more so, than in the action films that have been released this year (in fact, some of the scenes in the climax, for my money, could rival a couple of those in Spider-Man 2). By setting up the right emotional bases with the characters- Bob, his wife Elasti-girl (Holly Hunter), their kids, and with supporting characters voiced finitely by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, by the time the high-charged, internally fantasy scenes take off, they take off with great conviction and excitement.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredibles is a film that is, in a way, what audiences wish they could get and rarely do- it's a film with wit and observance, a kind of video-game where the results are not as expectable as can be. Some kids may not get it as much as adults might, which is just as well, as it sometimes operates on a level like Antz did, only through the sphere of Disney. In other words, if you say the teaser trailer, which involved the out-of-shape Mr. Incredible trying with all his might to buckle his tights, you'll know what the film could bring. Personally, I can't wait to see it again."
"ThePedofinderGeneral","9","187","234","23 December 2004"," Amazing! Brilliant! Fabulous! Wonderful! Astonishing! I'm not avoiding using a certain word!
","The Incredibles is a great film, and probably my favourite Pixar picture (Toy Story is the best, but that's different to favourite). It takes a while to properly get into the action, but when it does, it delivers it in spades.<br/><br/>And that's exactly it. I would actually call The Incredibles an animated action film, because to be honest, I don't think there was enough comedy to call it an animated action comedy film. There are quite a few funny moments, but the gags don't come as fast as Finding Nemo or Toy Story.<br/><br/>That being said, it does have truly amazing action set-pieces, brilliant voice acting, a fabulous script, wonderful characters and the animation is simply.....well....incredible.<br/><br/>The music is definitely a stand-out. It actually made me smile, with it's jazzy tones and James Bond type scores.<br/><br/>One of the greatest things about The Incredibles is that it's not a kiddies film; it's completely different to all the other Pixar films. They bring out tommy guns in the second scene, for crying out loud! If you want to see a more adult animated film, then go see The Incredibles, and enjoy every minute. But I wouldn't bring someone younger than 4 maybe, because it isn't really aimed at them, and they probably would find it quite scary.<br/><br/>This is a great film, one of the best of 2004 in my opinion. If it just had a slightly higher gag rate, than this would be an absolutely perfect picture.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Mr Parker","10","314","400","7 November 2004"," Dahling, dahling, dahling.... this movie is incredible
","I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.<br/><br/>The movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.<br/><br/>Even though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. <br/><br/>In fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, ""The Iron Giant"", which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.<br/><br/>All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar's movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.<br/><br/>RATING: ***** out of *****."
"Sargebri","Null","129","161","13 November 2004"," A Truly, Pardon the Pun, Incredible Movie
","This is one of the finest animated films I have ever seen. Not only is it a fine animated film, it is a great film period. The film obviously takes its cue from several real life super hero comic books, especially The Fantastic Four and the Justice Society of America. The Fantastic Four comparison is obvious due to the fact that Elatigirl and Violet were obviously inspired by Mr. Fantastic (aka. Reed Richards) and the Invisible Woman (aka. Sue Storm Richards) respectively. The J.S.A. influence is a little more obscure. Several years ago, DC Comics issued a mini-series that attempted to explain the demise of the Justice Society by claiming that the group was forced to disband after their loyalty to America was questioned during the 1950's. In this film, all the heroes were forced into hiding after the government refused to pay for wrongful legal claims brought against the super heroes of this film. Also, there are many in jokes that the casual viewer might not get, but that made it enjoyable for comic book fans. This the island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many of the series produced by Gerry Anderson of the 1960's (eg. the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet).<br/><br/>Another thing that made this film unique was its look. If you notice, the city where the story takes place looks like a fairly modern metropolis. However, if you look at the cars in the film, most of them look as if they would have been more at home in the mid to late 1960's. Also, the way that many of the characters were dressed also could have put them in that time.<br/><br/>However, the thing that I really loved about this film was the fact that even though it was geared primarily to children, it was dark enough in theme to appeal to adults. In fact, there are a couple of scenes that you wouldn't normally associate with a film geared towards children.<br/><br/>This film is definitely a classic of animation and once again Pixar shows why they are the masters of computer animation."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","151","198","19 December 2004"," Truly Incredible
","I finally saw Pixar/Disney's ""The Incredibles"" after several scheduling glitches. Writer and Director Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is truly incredible. It is one of the best movies of the year. The CGI animation is both cutting edge and simply stunning, and like all Pixar projects it has a solid story as it's foundation. Bird uses the Superhero mythology to tell a funny and poignant story: that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness, we are not being true to ourselves, and more importantly it is a disservice to those around us. As the story begins, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) was the superhero's Superhero. As voiced by Nelson, Mr. Incredible, is very confident, on the verge of cocky. He uses his super strength and powers for good. He marries super, Elasticgirl (Holly Hunter). However, Mr. Incredible soon falls victim like his fellow ""Supers"" to the plight of our litigious society-- the people they save are suing them. Instead of getting malpractice insurance (which would have been a different movie), the persecuted... and prosecuted Supers assume their secret identities in a covert government relocation program. They also promise never to use their powers again even for good.<br/><br/>We catch up 15 years later with Mr. Incredible, now just Bob Parr, insurance claim adjuster. He is suffering. His wife Helen, the former Elasticgirl, is busy getting settled in their new home with their kids, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and little Jack Jack. Violet and Dash have super powers, and Jack Jack is not yet toilet trained. Bob is totally frustrated by his job, and really the lie he is forced to live. Every week he and fellow Super, Lucius Best aka Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), on their ""bowling"" night, listen to the police radio band so that they can save people in danger. Mild mannered life is killing Bob. He tells Helen regarding Dash's 4th grade graduation, that they keep ""creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity"".<br/><br/>One day Bob is contacted by the mysterious, Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), enlisting his super powers for an undisclosed benefactor. Bob, still super strong, no longer has the six pack abdominals. He proceeds to train and trim the waistline. He sees his suit designer, Edna 'E' Mode (Brad Bird), to fix his super suit. In a hilarious exchange, E enrolls Mr. Incredible in a new suit, sans cape. It is disclosed that the benefactor is villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee). Turns out that Mr. Incredible was the one responsible for Syndrome's genesis when he invalidated the young Syndrome 15 years ago. Thus, we have the classic Superhero tale of conflict and revenge.<br/><br/>What also distinguishes ""The Incredibles"" along with the story about reclaiming greatness, is that it is about family. In a very touching scene when Mr. Incredible is about to do battle with the seemingly invincible Omnidroid, he admits to Helen ""...I'm not strong enough..."" Having super powers is great. Having the love of family is truly powerful. Craig T. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible. He is bold, funny, and endearingly vulnerable. Holly Hunter is solid and folksy as Helen, who also projects a quiet power. Jason Lee is at his annoying best as Syndrome. Brad Bird as 'E' steals every scene that she is in. Director Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is amazing to look at, and also has something special and touching to say."
"coloradokatchoo","9","57","74","16 December 2004"," An Amazing Message Over Looked
","I am tired of reading reviews about how an animated film is too violent for children, deals with mature issues like segregation or death, or is simply ""too grown up"" for small children. Since when did we decide to water down the truth for children, and when exactly are they old enough for certain issues, and why is it animation means it's suppose to be for children. Animation has allowed movie makers to break molds, has allowed them to do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations. We use CGI to accomplish effects we otherwise couldn't do, why is the art of illustration not considered on the same level as the art of computer graphics? I don't feel that just because something is made for children it should be dumbed down and I don't believe that an adult is too superior to watching something that is animated. Stories geared toward children such as Aesop's Fables or the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson, were told to teach life lessons; don't cry wolf, be happy with what you have and don't trust strangers. These are lessons, and stories, that were not watered down, that showed to what evil depths greed, slothfulness and envy, just to name a few, could take hold of in a person.<br/><br/>The Incredibles does not shy away from being real; it has an amazing message for both adults and children. The message I saw over and over again in the movie but could not find in a single review was how society was oppressing people to be no better than someone else. We seem to be headed towards embracing mediocrity, Harrison Bergeron, the short story by Kurt Vonnegut that was later turned into a film with Sean Astin, is the perfect example of someone smart being held back because it would hurt the dumb kids feelings to know there was someone better than them. The Incredible's attacks this head on, in one scene the villain Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), who has no real super powers but invents rocket shoes and remote controlled robots, tells Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) that he plans on killing all the truly empowered people and, using his inventions, become the only super hero until he's had his fun, at which time he will sell his inventions allowing everyone to become special ""which of course means no one will be"".<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have three children. Daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) can make herself invisible but only uses it to hide from a boy she likes, she's been broken down in spirit to feel like there is something horribly wrong with her and that she should be ashamed for being empowered with this amazing gift, to her it is a curse. Violet's younger brother Dash (Spencer Fox) on the other hand is angry with not being allowed to play in sports, because of his super speed, even though he promises not to show off. Their character development is some of the most in depth I've seen for ""children"" in a film, in part because it's real, they face death and failure and they rise above their shame and anger to become real heroes.<br/><br/>This movie is funny, it was honest, and it was one of the best films of the year. There is real development, there are real issues and real messages and at the end of the film I wanted to find the super hero in myself. I don't see why we should deny younger people, our children, the right to see something that is so beautiful just because of its honesty."

","This was somewhat of a surprise hit when it came out in 2004. Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it's excellent entertainment.<br/><br/>The visuals and sound are very impressive, but it's the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action. The action, as in many modern-day films, was overdone in the last half hour of the movie but overall....the DVD is a good investment since people 3 to 63 should enjoy this.<br/><br/>As an adult, it's not always easy to keep my attention for two hours with animation but the fact this movie does, tells you how good the story is presented. There are wonderful colors in here, too, and a good 5.1 surround system with a sub-woofer would probably blow the roof off!"

","Wow. This isn't just the best animated movie I've seen in a long time; it's one of the best movies, period. For sheer giddy enjoyment, stunning visuals, engaging characters. When the industry makes films with this much action and special-effects wizardry and a couple of big-name faces up front, they generally don't spend money on niceties like writing and character development. But Pixar, since they have something to prove with their computer-generated actors, has done the hard and loving work to infuse these cartoon characters with a humanity that most big-budget live-action movies don't match. Go see this one. Go see it for:<br/><br/>Visuals. There is a reality to this picture that hasn't been present in previous feature-length CG movies. Hair, foliage, rust, water-all are executed very convincingly. You know these characters aren't human beings, but it's hard to believe that they aren't somehow real.<br/><br/>Acting. The voice work is excellent, particularly Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson. The animators have done a great job capturing the subtleties of those performances in the motions of the on-screen avatars. If you saw the ill-fated Final Fantasy movie (of technical interest only, not really for the general public)-these cartoonish characters don't look as real, but they seem much more human.<br/><br/>Bond References. There is an secret lair in this movie the likes of which Dr. No and Blofeld could only dream. Every Bond homage is pitch perfect, and we found ourselves laughing in an otherwise quiet theatre at the wonderful invention of the production design. Hey, we're movie geeks; apparently the others weren't. This movie is worth ten bucks for the modern architecture alone.<br/><br/>Edna Mode. This character is the manic love child of 007's ""Q"" and Edith Head, and will surely be remembered as one of the great animated characters. She is voiced by the director, Brad Bird.<br/><br/>I know I'm not exactly going our on a limb here; the Tomatometer shows 96% as of this writing. But I wanted to see this movie again as soon as I left the theatre.<br/><br/>Notes: This one is for older kids and adults, as the PG rating indicates.<br/><br/>There are no ""outtakes"" in the end credits.

Dreamworks' titles compared to Pixars are not too peculiar, but they seem to rip all their titles from Pixar and create a fake illusion of originality. Now that Pixar has created another chef-d'oeuvre, no doubt Dreamworks will once more rip the idea and create a title relating to superheroes. 9.5/10"

Despite the film being an animation featuring a story line that was extremely fantastical, not once did I remember it was a movie. The actions scenes were spell bounding and highly imaginative. But most importantly, I really believed in these characters that spat witty sharp dialogue at each other at a furious pace, not just because they were funny, but because the characters were so believable and relatable. Subsequently it should come as to no surprise that film was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, which is a rarity for an animated film, but this ain't just your average animated film, it's an Incredible animated film"
"nycritic","10","16","25","22 December 2005"," Another Smash Hit for Pixar
","It's tough to be a superhero and not be allowed to manifest your prowess due to a lawsuit which has made you go into a ""superhero protection program"" and live the life of an Average Joe.<br/><br/>This is the case of Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible as he is also known. Living in marital complacency in suburbia with his wife Helen, also known as Elastigirl and his three kids, he works as a mindless office drone who needs to support his family and occasionally gets together with his buddy Lucius Best/Frozone and tries to fight small crime.<br/><br/>Until one day when he gets called on a special assignment in a remote location which leads him smack into the lair of a former fan, now turned arch-nemesis, Syndrome, who has an interest in destroying the world and also destroying his family.<br/><br/>What could have been a by-the-numbers story is enhanced by much of the ""performances"", or rather, the way the characters are made to interact to one another as per the screenplay. Bob and Helen are clearly in love even though their glory years as superheros (they believe) are over. Bob frets that he's become this paunchy bear of a man, Helen now has to multi-task since she is raising three children, each with a personality of their own, each with superpowers of their own.<br/><br/>I find it interesting to see how their kids also are given distinct personalities: Dash has the restless spark that his superpowers will require him to have and Violet is as close to channeling Lydia Dietz from Beetlejuice as possible -- shy, goth, and starting to develop her powers of invisibility and create force fields but beset by feelings of insecurity. Even Jack-Jack, the baby, has his moments, mainly caused by typical baby tantrums and in a crucial point, sheer fear. And this is where the script works: it never forgets that they are essentially kids who have these powers and would treat them as any kid would.<br/><br/>Brad Bird has in his hands an excellent, humanized tale of superheroes that borrows liberally from the Fantastic Four and takes it into an Ozzie and Harriet setting. He's created a movie that is tricky: while animated, it has some elements that will not be understood or suitable for children, such as Bob Parr going through his identity crisis, for example. At the same time, this is the first time that a film has broken grounds in its background animation. While the people are seen as cartoons, the locations are something else and have the look and feel of actual scenery. It's the first time water looks like water; that made me almost feel like reach out and touching the screen.<br/><br/>Much of the credit in establishing the characters are the voices used. Craig T. Nelson brings a beautiful masculinity to Bob Parr who would probably resemble bodybuilder Jeramy Freeman. Holly Hunter's voice makes Helen spunky, resourceful, feminist but devoted at the same time. Samuel L. Jackson brings his own star power into Lucius Best and the scenes involving his wife at a tense moment is side-splitting and cheerfully stereotypical. And what Bird himself does with his own rendition of Edith Head is nothing short of camp heaven.<br/><br/>In short, excellent family entertainment with a smart spin on what becomes of superheros once their fifteen minutes of fame are over."

","'The Incredibles (2004)' is a masterclass in character, always putting its central family in front of its superb superhero action. That action is often somewhat counter-intuitively but cleverly conveyed using the tropes and language of the spy genre, giving the movie a decidedly 60s flavour in the process. The piece is a much more mature affair than you might expect, being a family film in every sense of the word - a movie suitable for kids as opposed to one made for them. It is nuanced, affecting and will actually pay off more for the older members of its audience. It plays like a live-action picture with the world's most convincing special effects, since they're rendered exactly like the rest of the flick, and some of the most convincing characters, too. What makes the film so fantastic is that it's genuinely entertaining all the way through. It's properly funny, intriguing, suspenseful, emotionally impactful and exciting. What's so impressive is that it easily rises to the top of its genre, standing amongst the best of its peers (and even, in itself, commenting on them), despite being released when that very same genre was still in its infancy. It stands tall as apparent 'kid' fare that's far more mature than most 'adult' - or, at least, 'teen' - stuff being produced even today (over ten years after its release). It's effortlessly enjoyable and wonderfully conceived. Really, it's just incredible. 9/10"
"Jay_Exiomo","10","15","24","25 July 2005"," Incredible in every sense of it!
","""The Incredibles"" is by far and away the most mature and engaging Pixar film to date. <br/><br/>This movie is nothing less than a display of sheer brilliance to an utmost prestigious level that proves the genius in director Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant""). From the perfectly created characters to the witty and humorous dialog involved, ""The Incredibles"" is the ideal film for true fans of the animation and/or comic book genre. It doesn't fail to provide viewers of with a fragment of every genre; incredible animation, action, and even a bit of drama. <br/><br/>However, the aspect most evident in ""The Incredibles"" that was frequently credited for the success of its predecessors was the emotional aspect. The thesis on midlife crossroads on personal and professional dilemmas was well presented.<br/><br/>Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) seems an average guy who works in an insurance agency, and lives a ""normal"" mediocre life with his wife Helen and three kids: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. But there's more to it, actually. Bob used to be Mr. Incredible, and Helen was Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two of the world's greatest crime fighters until a series of lawsuits have forced superheroes to adopt civilian identities. But when Bob receives a mysterious call that has him for a top secret assignment, he sees this as an opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again. He accepts the mission but soon discovers that it is a trap of a nemesis from way back, and the whole family eventually has to to join him to fight evil and save the world.<br/><br/>What we have here is something that unfortunately becoming quite a rare thing nowadays: an example of a truly brilliant animation. As I have said, not only does it have some of the most phenomenal computer graphics and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best movies it also has the heart to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments. <br/><br/>The main reason for this is the great characterization. ""The Incredibles"" may contain a little too much of violence that may be better suited for older children than the younger ones. Yet one cannot easily discount the family themes and comic episodes, with characters like superhero-costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird) and Bob's friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) providing ample support. <br/><br/>Another is that the film, as is with previous Pixar films, is effective in the use of computer generated images (CGI) which is a major plus for moviegoers. The details in which the animators for the film present are awe-inspiring and breathtaking. The music also pasted itself impeccably with the atmosphere Bird has created for the film. Very retro.<br/><br/>It is a demonstration of precision and excellence, created by the brilliance and meticulous mannerisms of the director. It goes beyond an animated movie and is without a doubt one of the best animations of all time. It is truly incredible to see a film like this."

","This website has ranked this film to be one of the top 250 films ever made...You want to know something, I totally agree with this verdict!! This high definition surreal film by the master of animation...Walt Disney, evoked a successful culmination of cinematic brilliance on a myriad of artistic production levels!! An accomplishment like this epitomizes the term ""entertaining"" in it's most resounding form!! In evaluating the initial premise of this film, it compounds the dilemma of the proverbial glory days being a thing of the past!! A guy who was a football hero in his school days whereby it was routine to score four touchdowns in a game, and eventually, it fades due to a knee injury or being out of shape or something, this signifies that his best days are over!! When a former head cheerleader who was the starlight of every male's eye, who counted on her good looks, and she loses them, her best days are over as well!! So too is the case of a family of superheroes who leaped through buildings at a single bound in a vigilante crusade to capture nefarious criminals!! Ultimately, their vicarious damage to buildings and citizens meant that the municipality had to insulate itself from any further pecuniary culpability, and relocate them!! This would seemingly suggest that the Incredible's best days are behind them also!! As is the case with so many has beens, the end result winds up being a case of the breadwinner getting relegated to the monotonous plight of an inane job such as an insurance salesman. Such mediocrity reduces the Mr and Mrs to the state of being sedentary and overly mortgaged!! This movie depicts how even a family of manufactured stick people representing the world of fantasy, cannot hide from the afflictions of mid-life crises!!!! The ultimate undoing in these superhero's lives are the non-visceral elements of banality such as; indemnity forms, traffic jams and paranoid nightmares about deteriorating marital trust!! Just as someone wants to be a star football player,or a head cheerleader, all over again, these Incredibles wish to return to their exciting lives as the superheroes who took on capital crime!! Such a plot is very innovative, the writing in this dressed up doggerel of entertainment was remarkable!! This movie has a succinctly homogeneous blend of voices which induce an appropriately heinous cacophony of emotions which effectively illustrate exuberance and despair!! The sound effects were outstanding in this movie!! The cinematography in ""The Incredibles"" was superb!! Middle class hang-ups have been injected into teenage movies and television ever since ""The Simpsons"". This trademark of domestic rancor is for purposes of appealing to a broader audience range!! I found this film to be an ingenious use of satire, while mastering a digitalized analog of intelligent caricatures!! ""The Incredibles"" is not just a kid's film, or an overgrown adolescent's film, it is for everybody!! The family was called the Incredibles, the movie is called FANTASTIC!!"
"MovieAddict2016","9","14","23","26 April 2005"," Pixar's most ""epic"" animated film since ""Toy Story.""
","Although ""The Incredibles"" is not the best film Pixar has released (via Disney) since 1995's ""Toy Story,"" I felt it is the most epic. When I went to go see ""Toy Story"" in 1995, the epic scale of the picture -- the non-stop frantic pace, the action sequences, etc. -- were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as, believe it or not, a blockbuster such as ""Terminator 2"": a crowd-pleasing, overwhelming picture.<br/><br/>""Monsters, Inc."" wasn't quite as epic. It was a great movie, just as good as ""Toy Story,"" but it didn't have the same style per se. ""Finding Nemo"" was very good as well but still didn't capture the same epic scale as ""Toy Story."" (I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just different.) ""The Incredibles"" seemed to. I saw it on DVD and from beginning to end the action is non-stop, the laughs aplenty, and the exotic locations and action-hero references continuous. For this reason, somehow, it reminded me very much of ""Toy Story."" It seemed like older Pixar, rather than some of their newer stuff (all of which is great as well). Pixar has yet to make a bad movie. Even their worst -- ""A Bug's Life"" -- was better than most animated films.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" also returns to the spoof roots of ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Toy Story"" (something ""Finding Nemo"" did but not as often) -- it parodies cultural references. (Something hard to do in an underwater sea adventure.) Although this is a family film, it is NOT a ""children's film."" That is evident from the beginning when the fake news reel in ""The Incredibles"" features articles about a suicidal man suing superheroes because he ""didn't want to be saved."" This is clearly a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the shameless legal standards of the day. (Such as the woman who sued McDonald's because her coffee was too hot. A true story!) Another film might not be clever enough to integrate iconic cultural references into itself but ""The Incredibles"" does.<br/><br/>Similarly, using superheroes, Pixar examines the at-home relationship of a family and spoofs our own rituals. (Such as eating at the dinner table -- the mom tries to stop the squabbling kids just like we do, only because she has superpowers, it's a bit... different.) All in all ""The Incredibles"" really is a great animated film. I enjoyed it more than ""Finding Nemo"" (which I didn't expect to as I loved ""Nemo"") and just as much as ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" Pixar has solidified a new style of family film-making -- the cultural parody animated film -- and the evidence of this can be seen in such take-offs of the formula as ""Shrek"" and ""Shark Tale"" (which featured many cultural references as well).<br/><br/>All in all ""The Incredibles"" is incredibly fun. And funny."
"dunmore_ego","8","5","7","24 June 2007"," Puts the ""in"" credible.
","In every review of *The Incredibles*, it has become a refrain: ""This movie could have worked as well in real life."" Big Bob Parr (voice of Craig T. Nelson) is a cone-shaped mountain of a guy, an ex-superhero doing time as a layperson in a world gone small  from his office cubicle to his aspirations. Married to superheroine, Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter), like every husband, he sneaks out at night occasionally to hang with the boys  in Bob's case, to fight crime as Mr. Incredible with his former teammate, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).<br/><br/>Bob's two kids have inherited superpowers as well: son, Dash, super speed and daughter, Violet, telepathy and invisibility (think Phoenix from the X-Men). (A discussion on how the genetic combination of super-strength and elasticity in the parents would yield super-speed and invisibility in the offspring would get us nowhere.) This 3D-animation marvel is separated from its peers by its thematic thunder - sure, it gives us the usual ""familial values,"" but digs deeper by making the characters smart enough to ponder their roles as super beings in a mediocre world. The parents know that provincialism denotes they must keep their powers/identities hidden and their children sheltered, but the kids don't understand why, raising Socratic questions about herd mentality and the conundrum of being ""created equal"" yet more gifted. Mom tells Dash, ""Everyone's special"" (which is its own special form of condescension) and Dash, instead of taking it like a Disney knockout punch  as most kids in these ""family"" movies are inculcated to accept  retorts (quite logically), ""Which is another way of saying that nobody is."" <br/><br/>And when the action comes, it delivers in ways that even some live-action superhero movies do not. And by this I mean, the whole group uses their powers efficiently and intelligently, working together to combat their threats, rather than getting taken down by some inane plot point which they could have easily escaped simply by being themselves.<br/><br/>And of course, there is the mandatory Group Hero Pose, perfected so gaily by N'Sync during their two-month heyday. (Apologies to my more sensitive readers for using the ""N-word."") Jason Lee voices the villain, Syndrome, whom the family team must combat to Save The Day.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Brad Bird (who does triple duty as Edna Mode, a fashion designer for the hero-conscious), the humor is wit, rather than slapstick, the heroism is moral rather than muscle-bound and the whole outlook is adult rather than kiddie - *The Incredibles* is as real a movie as a cartoon gets."

","Nemo just slightly edges this out for me, but this movie is great just the same. It is filled with the kind of things that makes a life long superhero nerd smile and laugh. This is the story of a family of superheros that have adapted to civilian life. The reason for this? As the world became more litigious, people that were hurt collaterally by superheros started to sue for their injuries. This plot device is genius because it is so very believable. After years in retirement Bob Parr, AKA Mr. Incredible gets recruited for a mission by a mysterious person. Of course the person that recruits Bob has nefarious intentions, and unleashes a seemingly indestructible machine on the world. It is us the the Parrs, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet and Dash, along with the family friend Frozone to save the day. I love that they cast Sam Jackson in the role as Frozone, because his super power is making ice, and Sam Jackson is the coolest MF out there. This is a great movie, not just from an animation stand point, but in the whole realm of superhero films as well."
"mstomaso","7","9","16","17 April 2005"," Serious original fun! A family film in every sense of the word
","The Incredibles is a simple and slightly formulaic comic book-style animated Disney/Pixar feature with a great big heart. I just experienced this film for the second time, and though I didn't really catch anything new, or achieve a different perspective, I was certainly as entertained as I was in the theater the first time.<br/><br/>The Incredibles are the family of Mr. Incredible and Elasti-girl, living in a nightmare future where superheroes have been sued and regulated to the point that they are either forced underground or into protection programs complete with assumed identities and mediocre jobs. Mr. Incredible himself is invincibly physically strong, but emotionally drained by the uselessness of his new life as an insurance claim examiner, and his depression is so complete that he feels as if he is detaching from all that he loves. The children are ""Dash"" - a miniature Flash clone, ""Violet"" - who has all of the basics of Sue Richards, The Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl, and infant Jack Jack - about whom little can be said. Eventually, the entire family gets swept up into a crisis of vast proportion as a forgotten piece of Mr. Incredible's past comes back to threaten the very world which has rejected them all.<br/><br/>The film really does derive a lot of its archetypal character points from Marvel's classic Fantastic Four, but adds brilliant humor, a very positive message, and some voice work which really is nothing less than Incredible. I was especially impressed by Sarah Vowell's Violet. The voice talent in general, however, is exceptionally good, and the supporting cast doesn't slip a centimeter. Brad Bird's Edna is also a memorable stand-out. <br/><br/>Visually, the film is as good as any of the recent animated features most movie fans have enjoyed, though perhaps slightly less inventive and a bit less pretentious. I guess I would have to say that it's also my favorite, with Finding Nemo running a close second. <br/><br/>This would be a great film to see with your kids. It's clean, fun, and yet serious enough to engage even the most angst-ridden teenager. It also contains some very positive messages about the value and meaning of heroism, family, and 'sticking together' through the worst and the best of times."
"james_norman1981","10","6","10","16 May 2006"," The best of Pixar's films and that is truly Incredible
","When Pixar announced that they'd recruited Brad Bird to direct their new film it was treated with surprise. Sure Bird had been a major part of the Simpsons, he'd been instrumental in creating one of the best recent cartoon features (the Iron Giant) and sure he was a breath of fresh air to the Pixar formula. But why try and fix something that is not only not broken but is positively bursting at the seams with creative energy, commercial viability and critical acclaim? The naysayers, and there were a fair few of them, urged caution and sat back to see if Pixar would make their first misstep after a series of blindingly brilliant films that had knocked their competitor from a perch that had been regarded as impregnable.<br/><br/>Disney's misfortune had been our, the viewing public's, great reward. From their childish cartoons we'd suddenly learnt to appreciate and even prefer other possibilities, most specifically computer generated films. Toy Story had come out of nowhere to deliver a killer blow to Disney's tired remakes and uninspired sequels. Ignoring realism in favour of a fun, flexible world where reality existed but didn't automatically infringe on the entertainment, the geniuses at Pixar created a film that didn't try and reinvent the wheel but gave it such an overhaul that the finished product really did look completely new.<br/><br/>By realising that people don't like computer generated images, particularly of human beings, which always look and move too perfectly for us to ever accept them, Pixar instead showed us a world of cute toys and giant, fairly irrelevant humans. With the voices incredibly well cast and the images sharp enough to impress without trying to blitz us with colour, Toy Story demonstrated just how excellent CG could be, provided it was married to a good story aimed at kids and adults alike. From there Pixar went from strength to strength, both at the box office and in the reviews. So, again, we must ask: why did they seek the change? We may never know exactly what happened. My understanding is that Brad Bird approached Pixar with the story and they offered him the directing stint by way of reflecting how impressed they were. This rings slightly false in that you wouldn't entrust millions of dollars to a screen writer to make a live action film and the money and directorial duties are by no means reduced for 3D animation. Therefore I think that Bird was given the gig for other reasons, most specifically that the Pixar team were worried that their tried and tested formula was becoming too obvious - mismatched buddies must retrieve something/someone precious from a perilous situation. Regardless, employ him they did and The Incredibles was the result.<br/><br/>The Incredibles represents Pixar's best, most adult film and was both a critical and commercial hit with adults and infants alike. It contained all the action and special effects one could wish for, but kept them based around a solid, emotional core of plot, characterisation and witty story telling. Like most, if not all, Pixar films, The Incredibles was designed by adults for adults who were looking to entertain children, rather than by adults looking to exploit children (Disney should take note here and, given that they've recently acquired Pixar, it looks like they've done exactly that). This meant that the film was just as interesting to parents (and uncles) as it was to children, doubling the audience size and making the later, night showings at cinemas just as popular as the daytime ones. In foreign countries, France for example, many of the adults actually ignored the dubbed, local language versions in favour of the original English, for fear of missing some of the brilliant, adult orientated jokes (Bomb Voyage can't possibly have been as amusing in French as he was in English for example).<br/><br/>All this comes from Bird's screenplay and it is from there that The Incredibles bursts forth, ahead of the pack. Bird fused numerous, diverse elements to tell the story of a dysfunctional family of superheroes. Mr. Incredible, Bob Parr, is a former superhero forced into retirement, along with all other super heroes, through legal action , an idea I have long considered given how litigious modern society has become. Bob and his wife Helen, the former heroine Elastigirl, disappear to start a family in suburbia.<br/><br/>After 15 years and three kids Bob is fast approaching a midlife crisis. Other than helping the occasional client dodge the pitfalls in the insurance company he works at the only fun he has is illegal hero work found by listening in on the police radio network with his friend Frozone, another former superhero voiced superbly by Samuel L Jackson. Bob is heading for emotional meltdown when, through an unfortunate series of events, he finds himself approached with an offer for true heroism...<br/><br/>The first half of the film, Bob's emotional emancipation followed by his attempted breakout and its consequences, gives way to the action filled second, which I won't spoil by delving into, save to say that it incorporates more than Bob. There is brilliance a plenty, the jet fight was one of the most tense scenes I've ever experienced, while at no point do you end up seeing action purely for its own sake. Each action has a far more important reaction, not least in terms of emotional growth. Numerous issues are analysed and a very positive message of family, confidence without arrogance and just being there for other people are subtly advocated.<br/><br/>All in all I can't recommend this movie enough, particularly as it may well be the last great Pixar film. With Disney's takeover of the company we now have the bringing together of bland, tasteless, star heavy, plot lite films such as Shrek 2, Shark Tale and the like with the genius of Pixar. We can only hope that the heart and minds of the latter win out."
"filmluvr-1","10","6","10","12 February 2005"," The most fun I've had at the movies all year
","I cannot say enough about the cleverness of the writing and the animation of this film. Even the animated acting was better than many live action films. The story, about what happens to a group of superheros when the public turns against them and they are forced to go underground and be normal, and then a tricked back into action, is so well thought out that hardly a moment or a shot passes in which there is not some small brilliant detail that catches you off guard and amuses. Even the music is funny. When Mr. Incredible is creeping around the island fortress of the evil Sundrome the music is strikingly suggestive of the kind of tense themes John Barry would write for James Bond's infiltration of the island fortress in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and many others. The Incredibles is particularly striking, I think, for those of us who grew up reading comic books regularly because it gives answers to fun questions like, where does a superhero go when he needs a new costume? I cannot recommend it enough for both kids and adults."
"tedg","Null","11","22","7 November 2004"," Pixar is Invincible
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>All movies are about other movies. Most simply quote them, and most of these are bad. Some are very clever quoters, like Tarantino. But still mere quoters. A few weeks ago, I saw 'Van Helsing' which impressed the daylights out of me. It was all about transmutation at many levels including transmuting itself through several other movie identities.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I've been impressed by Pixar for other reasons. They've always been the leaders in folding and introspective dimensionality. Their logo even shows it: an illuminator jumps on the 'i', replaces it, looks around and then looks directly at you.<br/><br/>In this film, their introspective experiments extend to quoting other films. But instead of the simple shopkeeping of Tarantino, we have appearances of other films but instead of being quoted they are re-imagined. Each transmutation is better than the original: This is better Bond than Bond, better Spy Kids than Spy Kids, better family drama than any recent experience. Better through-the-trees chase than Star Wars. Much, much better than 'Spiderman' and its ilk because it really understands pacing and manages ever-more unseen camera swoops.<br/><br/>And it does everything it does with familiar images. For instance, the scene where Bob smacks his boss through several walls and he ends up wrapped in bandages and in traction is a collection of classic images from old cartoons, starting with the big guy grabbing the little guy. Except you don't notice that the big guy is the good guy. Never happens in the classics.<br/><br/>There are two interesting folds here: the one that folds many movies genres as we mentioned and the one that conflates the folds of reality. Here's how this works: Usually there are two layers of a folded movie: the movie and some more abstract story within the movie. Spoofs depend on you knowing the layers, even if a layer isn't shown. So 'Austin Powers' has the intermediate level of Bond, even though it doesn't have an explicit segment that exists in the world of Bond. <br/><br/>Ted's law says the folding distance must be equal, so the abstraction between the real world and that of Bond is exactly the same as that between Powers and Bond, extra cartoonishness if you wish.<br/><br/>This Pixar project has two levels squashed into the same world. One level is the very realistically abstracted story between Bob and Helen. This isn't very cartoonish at all compared the regular world of cartoons. Then you have the superhero world which Bob and later Helen dive into; this is the most extremely abstract world of cartoons. Three levels, us, Bob and Helen as people (and they seem more real in this mode than most 'real' characters) and Bob and Helen and kids as superheros.<br/><br/>The novelty of the fold is that these are squashed together as if there is no distance. That (plus some very human-like camera angles and the 'interview' footage at the beginning) squashes the world of the viewer into what we see. Its the kind of brilliant novelty that can only be done by close students of the art.<br/><br/>A side comment that follows: the standard Disney cartoon has to have an obvious moral. Parents enthusiastically use this as a sad excuse for parenting. This film puts the moral in the spoof level. That means, folks, that it is equating it to the mediocre fictions Bob berates at the beginning. To distract the dopes in the audience, they do damage control by splicing an 'ordinary' moralistic dippy thing at the beginning.<br/><br/>The real moral is that most movie houses have 'insurance:' they test their films into mediocrity. Pixar does no testing. They figure it out and trust their geniuses. Along the way, they take two heavy hits in the story at insurance companies who literally put superstars out of business, and incidentally steal from the worthy. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","The Incredibles is further proof Pixar focuses more on story and characters rather than in-jokes and celebrity voices, as in Dreamworks'features (not that there's anything wrong with that, just look at Shrek 1 AND 2). Okay, there are quite a lot of pop-culture references in this film, because of the story, but that doesn't stop The Incredibles from being an... incredible movie.<br/><br/>For the first time in a Pixar film, the main characters are human: Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) used to be a great superhero, Mr.Incredible, until such activities became illegal (fans of Alan Moore may find that concept familiar). Now he has to deal with a boring job and his family: wife Helen (Holly Hunter), aka Elastigirl, and three kids, Dash (who's called Flash in the Italian version, guess why), Violet(who's got the same powers as Marvel's Invisible Woman) and baby Jack-Jack, who so far seems to be ""normal"". He's desperate to return to the old glorious days, not realizing his family is the ""greatest adventure ever"". And their help will be needed when a new threat shows up...<br/><br/>The film's best element is the script, which teaches a valuable lesson (family matters more than anything) while providing some jaw-dropping action scenes (no wonder the movie got a PG rating) and various references to the genre (almost every existing superhero is poked at, as well as James Bond and Indiana Jones). The other awesome thing is of course the characters: the titular family is basically the ""super"" version of the Simpsons (Bob getting home from work is pure Homer), and two supporting characters deserve a special mention. One is Frozone, Mr.Incredible's buddy, the only one in the movie who's voiced by a real star (Samuel L. Jackson, who's a gas as usual). The most important one, though, is Edna Mode, who makes the supers' outfits. Wonderful and hilarious, she's one of the best animated characters in years (ironically enough, she's voiced by a man, the movie's writer/director, Brad Bird).<br/><br/>For those who really love movies, The Incredibles is a must-see in the animated feature category.

","For his directorial debut in the Pixar Studios, Brad Bird had an idea of genius.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""The Incredibles"" is two things: a superhero movie genre with all the predictable archetypes and it's a commentary on the restraining uniformity of American suburban life. That ""super hero/ ordinary family"" contrast is the core of the film and the inspiration for its greatest moments. This achievement is even more remarkable given how familiar we are with these archetypes, yet they work in such a symbiosis that the set-ups are always predictable but not the outcomes, and the starting gimmick reveals itself a never-ending source of fun and entertainment.<br/><br/>The identity of superheroes and their struggle to fit in the real life is an overused theme but because we're watching a family movie, the formula is totally reversed, ""The Incredibles"" is about a 'normal family' trying to keep their super-heroic background secret, the focus is on the normal identity, not the superheroes. The first scenes are misleading: Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has an appointment yet finds the time to save a cat, stop a bank robber, and bag thief with the providential help of Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), he meets one of his friends, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), he prevents a man from suicide, he intercepts a French villain with the suave name of Bomb Voyage, and one of his fans, a wannabe sidekick named IncrediBoy (Jason Lee) to blew it with his intervention. What a night, but he finds the time to join the church and marry the woman of his life, Elastigirl  the tone is set, the whole super-heroic stunts were just the prelude to a beautiful family story.<br/><br/>But these stunts weren't without consequences, two of them will be particularly dramatic. The suicidal man sues Incredible for having ruined his death rather than saved his life, starting a streak of successful lawsuits where heroes are condemned to pay indemnities for undesired interventions, hence becoming a liability to the Stage government. Finally, it's decided each of them to be relocated in a sort of witness protection-like program, with the order not to ever interfere, and live in anonymity. Superheroes all have weaknesses, Kryptonites, but no one can beat the bureaucracy. The enemy is normality. And this is a constant theme as the father Incredible, now Bob Parr, can't resuscitate the old past glory and is forced to work in a cubicle for a petty boss, Helen is a devoted housewife teaching her son not to run too fast, and fit in the crowd by not being special, not the super-heroic way. This contributes to one of the best quotes : ""everyone's special"" ""which means no one is"". I love how they twist the old cliché of the little boy who can't fit, but this time in the other way.<br/><br/>The second consequence was that the rejected sidekick will finally fill his heart with enough anger and resentment to become a supra-villain, in a mix of Lex Luthor and Spectre, in fact, many elements from ""The Incredibles"" borrows from James Bond and the 60's secret service superheroes classics, and the vintage feeling is a delight for the eyes. Even the setting looks like a futuristic view of USA as it was envisioned in the 60's, on this level, Brad Bird and team did a terrific job. Sensual secretaries, tropical landscape, launched missiles, a scene-stealing little designer, voiced by Brad Bird, and who plays the Q role, the super-heroic element is responsible for the greatest thrills while the family is the heart. This combination is the secret of ""The Incredibles"". We know the little boy Dash, will have to run faster than ever for an extreme great chase, we know Violet, the shy teenager will sure be capable to use her power to create magnetic field and impregnable bubbles, but how refreshing to share their first frustration. The kid can't run, and she's so shy she makes herself invisible.<br/><br/>It's great to see Mr Incredible reluctant to use his force although sometime he can help it, while he breaks the car window by closing the door too strongly or lifting it out of anger, or doing something we're all dreamed of like squashing the boss in the walls, he has to wait before fully using his powers. And Helen is reluctant to wear her new outfit and when she does, she can't help but notices her curves in the mirror. The script characterization keeps us with the sensation that we're watching real people, and the super powers become almost accessory, they do contribute to a variety of actions but it's all Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet  and yes, the baby Jack-Jack whose powers are unknown yet, but we can figure that they're letting it for the last act. It's a Family film in the real meaning of the word, it's for the family and about a family.<br/><br/>Most of the plot relies on very common clichés, but the film is much aware for them, and never hesitates to show it, denouncing the infamous monologue cliché or the way capes can become a lethal target, not to mention Samuel L. Jackson's performance, so authentic, calling it self-parody would be insult."

","This refreshing cartoon is so much fun! And it's honest fun, built on character and story without relying, for a change, on pooh-pooh humor or juvenile idiocy. This film has a family of all-too human characters, which, although each member has special super- human characteristics, is also burdened with all-too-human personal challenges-- whether it be a boring job, the struggle for adolescent identity, or the need to be special in some way--this family is quite wonderful. <br/><br/>The Pixar animation is dazzling, from the recreation of wild, tossing seas to the attack of whirring saucers in a tropical jungle, pixar magic takes you there, but only in context of a thrilling story--and the characters are tellingly memorable, especially a costume designer likely based on Hollywood's Edith Head combined with Coco Chanel--who would have thought it in a kiddy pic? How refreshing to have a film that doesn't go for the cheap trick, the easy laugh, the lowest common denominator, but instead aims for genuine heart. This is a family film in the best possible sense of the word and will withstand the test of time."

","The Incredibles was one of Pixar's best films. I didn't find it as good as Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up, but it wasn't as bad as Brave, or as pedestrian as Finding Nemo. It is a very long (for US standards) animated feature at 110 minutes and has much more complexity and character development than the usual animated fare made in the US: this is a family film that adults will like nearly as much as the children (though not 100% as much). <br/><br/>It is full of action but nobody appear to die in the film besides the villain: in one scene Mr. Incredible throws a massive metal thing over some guards and they are only disabled.

","Okay, by now, it's unanimous that Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" is a great family film. So why add another review? It's not because I think I'll say anything that a plethora of other reviewers hasn't already said, but because I feel the ~need~ to say that this is a great family film.<br/><br/>Too many movies barely pass for family films these days. They oftentimes contain elements and themes to which we do not wish to have our children exposed. They even, more often than not, contain messages or morals with which we do not agree and find awkward or inappropriate to explain to our children. They even promote lifestyle choices, hereditary and/or cultural differences, or unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions and still pass for family films.<br/><br/>This is not one of those movies. The Incredibles is wholesome, witty, and clever, while appealing to all ages. You can't say that about many movies, especially today.<br/><br/>All in all? This is a great movie, anytime you want a movie you don't mind your grandparents or young children watching.

"bkrauser-81-311064","9","4","6","25 February 2014"," Hulkingly Awesome Superhero Movie
","Shortest review ever: Incredible.<br/><br/>You need more? Fine. Pixar continues an unheard streak of high-quality storytelling and captivating creativity with 2004's answer to the question, ""is there happiness in the world?"" The Incredibles takes place in a world where super-strength, super-speed, super-cool superpowers exist and heroes are adored by the masses they protect. Yet because of impending lawsuits and municipal damages, the government has stepped in to insure our heroes' secret identities are now their only identities. Bob Parr aka Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) is struggling with his new ""normal"" life married to fellow superhero Elastigirl aka Helen (Holly Hunter). His job sucks, the kids have superpowers of their own they're itching to explore and he desperately misses the thrill of crime fighting. In comes a mysterious benefactor who just might be his ticket to a better life.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is Pixar's first real attempt at a completely human world populated by four limbed humanoids as opposed to toys or fishes or bugs. Instead of opting for close-to-human features, which most people find creepy, the characters are exaggerated and cartoony. But don't let that fool you into thinking the details of this marvelous film aren't spectacular. The settings range from Tropical Island to bustling metropolis and exhibit a unique feel and personality. The animators must have taken years out of their lives to complete a film of this caliber.<br/><br/>Yet even if the film wasn't as technically brilliant as it is, it'd still have a great story populated by great characters. Each main character is a new spin on the typical nuclear family with Bob being the lovable but unrealized provider who needs help with his priorities. Helen is the overworked mother, wife and voice of reason yet unlike the valium-taking housewives of the 1950's she can kick all kinds of butt. In tow are three precocious, bickering children: Dash (Spencer Fox) who possesses super-speed, Violet (Sarah Vowell) who has the power of invisibility much like many young teenagers feel they do and Jack-Jack a toddler seemingly lacking superpowers. Also in the mix is the nefarious villain Syndrome (Jason Lee) who reeks of abandonment issues and riotous Edith Head parody Edna Mode (Director Brad Bird) who nearly steals the movie.<br/><br/>I'm honestly surprised that a story like this hasn't been done before. There might be some serials back in the day that expounded on similar themes but I cannot recall any. Sure there are elements of superheroes turned unsanctioned vigilantes in Batman-lore and The Watchmen and The Fantastic Four does have familial ties. But mixing these two themes and adding in a cottage industry in superhero costumes; that's not just new to film but to superherodom.<br/><br/>If on the off-chance you were trapped underneath something heavy for the last ten years and haven't seen The Incredibles, I recommend that you go and see what you've been missing. It's a brilliant original story, artfully crafted to perfection by the dream-makers of Pixar and voiced by smartly casted actors. Did I also mention it's a non-stop thrill ride unlike any other? Well believe me when I tell you that it truly is."
"brett-koerten","10","4","6","8 August 2010"," As cliché as it sounds, this movie is Incredible.
","It is often said that there are 2 things in this world that are guaranteed: death and taxes. I would like to argue that there is a third: Pixar movies will be an instant classic. Ever since the first Toy Story was released in 1995, I have eagerly awaited the release of each new movie. When The Incredibles was released in 2004, I could not get to the theater soon enough, and needless to say, I was not disappointed. In a time when generic superhero movies are released every few months, Pixar created a superhero movie with an engaging story that focuses more on the characters than watching the heroes save the world from total destruction. <br/><br/>The story focuses primarily on Mr. Incredible and his struggle to find meaning in life after a series of lawsuits has caused superheroes to go into hiding. The once loved superhero spends his day working a monotonous desk job and his evenings listening to a radio scanner with his friend Frozone in hopes of reliving the glory days. The story connected with me because I believe we all have the desire to live for something greater than ourselves and to find purpose in life, yet we find ourselves sitting behind a desk and never reaching our full potential. The ""superhero"" story revolves around Mr. Incredible attempting to save the world from his one-time #1 fan, now turned villain, Syndrome. This challenge brings the Incredible family together and helps them realize the importance of working as a team and realizing that their abilities should not be hidden, but used to make a difference in the world.<br/><br/>Another area where Pixar shines is in their character development. From the insecure adolescent with the ability to disappear to the super busy mom who can stretch herself to accomplish whatever task is needed, the characters powers were brilliantly chosen to fit what power one would expect someone in that stage of life would need. Even the villain was someone that I could relate to. I'm sure most people have had someone they looked up to let them down, and although most of us do not become that person's arch-nemesis, I could feel sympathy for the guy. If anything, Syndrome's back story shows how much of an impact we can have on people who may look up to us. <br/><br/>All of this plus the stunning computer animation, intelligent humor, and wholesome fun helps continue the company's streak of top-notch movies. It challenges the viewer to find their purpose/meaning in life while also encouraging them to accept and use whatever gifts he or she may have. Six years after its release, this movie still remains at the top of my list of favorite Pixar movies and in the top 5 of my all-time favorite movies."

","Superheroes have to go into hiding ala the witness protection program after civilians start to take advantage by suing the gifted ones in crazed lawsuits.

The patriarch of the titled family though becomes the target of a deviant individual who was once his biggest fan. Thus it is up to his family to save him so the group can save the world once more. ""The Incredibles"" is strong with its animation, but honestly the story is hit-and-miss. Hanna and Barbara-styled ideas from the 1960s and 1970s mix with that dark comic book look that was so prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s to form a long (and I do mean long) cartoon that suffers an identity crisis with its tone and pace. The characters have their moments, but most are not as interesting as they look. Director Brad Bird has crafted a film that definitely has more upside than down because of its glossy look and hot visuals. However, I still think that a little more time could have been spent on the script and on the movie's potential uniqueness. Unfortunately, ""The Incredibles"" really pales to most recent computer generated productions. 4 stars out of 5."

"drifteru","8","9","18","5 November 2004"," An overpraised but credible pastiche
","Most Pixar films get good reviews from the critics, but they seem to be falling all over themselves for THE INCREDIBLES. I'm not sure why.<br/><br/>First off, the film strikes me as a pastiche of the Saturday morning cartoons I grew up watching, like THE FANTASTIC FOUR and JONNY QUEST, with a little James Bond thrown in. As such, it seems designed to appeal most to 10- to 14-year-old boys, a group that may be reluctant to go to an animated movie; witness the anemic box office of TITAN A.E. or TREASURE PLANET for proof.<br/><br/>By and large, the story is played straight. There are a few laughs scattered here and there, but the tone is nothing like the mixture of humor and pathos Pixar established for the medium with TOY STORY and Dreamworks exaggerated ad nauseam in SHREK 2.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's what the critics find appealing. THE INCREDIBLES is certainly not like any other animated film I've seen; at times, it's easy to forget that it *is* animated. Some of that is due to the ever-growing artistry of the Pixar team, which often makes you feel like you're watching a comic book/video game come to life.<br/><br/>But as solid as the movie is -- and except for a slow start, I was not bored -- for me, it's missing that little bit of magic to take it to the next level, where millions have found Shrek and Nemo."
"majikstl","Null","11","24","24 November 2004"," The Unremarkables...
","Though well made, sometimes very funny and imaginative, in the end THE INCREDIBLES could just as well be called The Unremarkables. While certainly a nice job is done by all, THE INCREDIBLES has the poor fortune to follow Pixar's other masterpieces to the screen and can't rise out of the shadows of the TOY STORY films, MONSTERS, INC. and FINDING NEMO. THE INCREDIBLES sets it sites higher than those films, as far as its outlandish story goes, but while its save-the-world adventure seems more grand in comparison to the seemingly mundane antics of the other films' miniature characters, the story comes off as being really rather ordinary. <br/><br/>THE INCREDIBLES has really nothing new to offer, just an odd juxtaposition of old ideas and clichés from the two genres it grafts together. In tying together the world of the typical family sitcom with the premise of a routine superhero adventure, the film seeks originality, but the most remarkable thing about the film is that it shows that superhero tales have become just as mundane as your typical family sitcom. <br/><br/>I think the magic of Pixar's previous efforts comes from more than just the wonderful artwork. Those films took us to other worlds or forced us to look at our world from a different perspective. THE INCREDIBLES goes from everyday suburbia to the inner sanctum of a mad genius out to control the world and the sad reality is that we have already been to the latter as often, if not more so, than the former. Saving the world is just not what it used to be; on the heels of James Bond, Spider-Man, Superman and an endless list of others, what The Incredibles do is old hat. And let's face it, in the toon world what these characters do is not that big of a deal either; from Bugs Bunny and Wiley Coyote to Goofy and Roger Rabbit, being indestructible and defying the laws of physics are pretty common tricks.<br/><br/>Everything THE INCREDIBLES offers -- strength, speed, flexibility, invisibility -- has a been-there-done-that quality. All the classic cartoon characters were, to one extent or another, already superhuman.<br/><br/>As such, superheroism in the toon world is a given; it is when the gifts that defy physics and common sense are endowed on real actors that the genre still has a sense of awe. When Christopher Reeve flies, when Tobey Maguire swings, when James Bond whips out Q's gadgets or Indiana Jones cracks his whip, the images still carry a kick -- men doing what cartoon characters take for granted. We can live vicariously through Superman or James Bond, but how often do we fantasize being Donald Duck or even Underdog?<br/><br/>To me, the Incredibles' derring-do pales in comparison to the toys in TOY STORY figuring out how to drive a car or the great aquarium escape in FINDING NEMO. Just as much imagination may have been expended in helping The Incredibles save New York City, but how many times have we seen New York saved in recent years? On the other hand, the trip through the closet to Monstropilis was a wonderful new experience. <br/><br/>This is not to say that THE INCREDIBLES is a bad or unrewarding. Indeed, it was worth it just to hear Holly Hunter as Elastigirl -- with that voice she was born to do cartoon voiceovers."
"TensersFloatingDisk","3","23","59","2 June 2005"," Good movie...TERRIBLE messages
","Movies don't just entertain -- they MEAN. They have messages. They instruct, influence, and evoke.<br/><br/>So what is the meaning of _The_Incredibles_? Simple: You Don't Count.<br/><br/>I am, perhaps, unusual in that I scrutinize every movie, TV show, newspaper story and advertisement for its deeper message -- but I think that practice is a lot more common when we consider media aimed at children, as this movie, with its toy tie-ins and McDonalds-driven marketing, most certainly is. So when friends suggested that Pixar had hit another one out of the park with _The_Incredibles_, I naturally screened it for my kid, thinking this would be a beauty.<br/><br/>Imagine my shock and dismay to find that, underneath the comic-book overtones, this is not a movie for kids at all. Not only is the violence fast, furious, and rampant, it's deadly...as the characters themselves point out, Saturday Morning Cartoons offer kids an unrealistic belief that deadly violence is somehow fun. Well OK, I can get behind that message, but it's going to be tricky explaining to my six-year-old that when he sees a plane full of bad-guys blow up as it rips through a tree, that this isn't just metaphorical -- that guy is DEAD.<br/><br/>But I got more and more disturbed when I saw that the majority of the violence in this movie wasn't being perpetrated by the bad guys at all -- it's mostly coming from our ""heroes,"" The Incredible family themselves. Mr. I. uproots trees, tosses bombs, knocks down buildings, and punches mere mortal villains with fists which we've seen lift train cars. And then, in a fit of pique, in an early establishing scene, Mr. Incredible punches his boss. Who is *NOT* a villain. He's an unarmed civilian, which Mr. Incredible outweighs by about 200 pounds. He punches this guy through several walls, and later views of this poor guy in the hospital make it clear that he's broken a lot of bones.<br/><br/>This is our HERO???? And then there's the main message of the film: you don't count. You see you, me, all us non-super-heroes, we aren't ""special,"" like the Incredibles. And no, the idea that everyone has some special quality, that everyone has unique skills or traits, that's disdained by our hero as a ""celebration of mediocrity"" -- his normal job, like the one you and I have, you see that's not good enough for the special people. No, the special people should be given the opportunity to requisition government aircraft, to own supercars they haven't paid for, to throw civilians through walls without any consequence if they act annoying. In fact, the guy who suggests that everyone *could* be special or super, if given the chance, is the VILLAIN of the movie! So there goes about 2,000 years worth of morality, right down the drain. According to this movie, might makes right, and anyone who thinks otherwise deserves to be stomped into the pavement. Jesus wept."

That's not to say that this is a bad movie by any means, but there is nothing outstanding about it either. Of course, this could be said about a lot of films but is particular pertinent here when one considers the huge hype surrounding it when it first came out.<br/><br/>It is quite an enjoyable tale about superheroes being forced to hide their identities, bring up families and fitting in until one day Mr Incredible gets the chance to relive the glory days...<br/><br/>There are some very funny characters (Edna and Huph in particular) and most of the cast do their job well although Holly Hunter's lisp does get a little distracting after a while.

","People have been making fun of superhero clichés for more than ten years, since before The Tick, Tiny Toons and the like, and this itself has been a cliché: to observe, ""Bad guys have giant secret lairs! And they ""monologue"" before they kill you! LOL."" It's an easier formula than actually inventing a new superhero saga.<br/><br/>Now this worn-out schtick has unfortunately become the basis for a Pixar movie. Not nearly as well-written as ""Toy Story,"" this thing feels like it was written on autopilot, with only the most obvious plot developments proceeding from the ""what if a suburban family were superheroes?"" premise with a clanking predictability (Writer: ""OMG, here's the part where they fight over a remote control! And they fight over traffic directions! And...what else do married couples do?"") that made me wonder whether Brad Bird was a screenwriter's pseudonym for Omnibot 7000.<br/><br/>While the movie pretends like it's about breaking out of suburban conformity, it comes across like a celebration of it. I would rather have watched a movie about Samuel Jackson's character, Frozone, who provides some spark amid the numbing sitcom vibe. <br/><br/>The pic further loses points for taking cheap shots at the French, public interest law, and human life. 'Cuz halfway through, the movie seems to get superheroes badly confused with James Bond, and this annoying family proceeds to spend quite a while killing off identical-looking bad guys, rather remorselessly: someone is blown to bits, and in the next shot everyone is hugging. The family that kills together...<br/><br/>Real superheroes bring people to justice, rather than slaughtering them. Not that this is a violent movie in its slaying of faceless drones. No, what you get feels like you're stuck at the house of the dullest people you know, while they play PS2 in their living room. I liked it better when it was called ""Metal Gear.""<br/><br/>And, yeah, would a memorable joke be too much to ask?"

","THE INCREDIBLES (2004) **** (VOICES of: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, Sarah Vowell, Spencer Fox, Elizabeth Pena, Brad Bird, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger) (Dir: Brad Bird) Pixar does it again! Wonderfully funny and fast-paced animated valentine to comic book heroes with a unique spin: the titular family of action heroes are part of a federal witness relocation program - after society has deemed them too 'special' resulting in far-too-many legal woes  that eventually find themselves back fighting the good fight when Mr. Incredible (Nelson in square-jawed jocularity) faces a new enemy in the form of Syndrome (Lee, having a snarky field day), a former fan of the superhero who has now made it his life's mission to off his one-time would-be mentor, while attempting to raise a family with Elastigirl (the ever feisty and able Hunter) with varied results. <br/><br/>Excellently cast  especially NPR personality Vowell as the Incredible' eldest, painfully shy daughter (love the curtain of hair-one-eye look!) Violet and Fox as the middle, precocious tow-headed son (aptly named) Dash who both are becoming aware of their 'specialness' as adolescence beckons (metaphors aplenty!) Jackson lends able support as fellow hero Frozone, a (literally) cool dude bud of the family as well as the ever irrepressible Shawn as the pip-squeaked 'boss' of Mr. Incredible's alias Bob Parr, an insurance claims adjustor; and Pena as a femme fatale named Mirage who bares more than a striking resemblance to Gwyneth Paltrow morphed with a pipe cleaner. But it is director Bird who steals the show voicing the fashionista/costume designer Edna E. Mode  think Linda Hunt meets Edith Head  in a hilarious no-holds-barred slap of surreality to the reluctantly returning superheroes into the fray. Bird is also no slouch in keeping the breakneck pace and overall retro '50s/'60s look of the film (think those Rankin Bass holiday animated specials) while expertly sifting pop culture in-the-knowisms to the genre at hand. What is most surprising is the warmhearted emotion that is on display with the gut-busting comedy juggling act of breathless action. One of the year's best films."

This is a good concept for a movie to work from as it hasn't been tackled particularly successfully in the past but unfortunately, this doesn't do the job any better and we are left wondering how such a mundane and 'going by the numbers' movie has made so much money.

And I also hated Shrek with a passion, but when I rented this DVD, I honestly, sincerely tried to like the movie, approaching it with an unbiased mind. Really, I did. What a disappointment. If I watched the movie already expecting to hate it, my feelings wouldn't be so bitter.<br/><br/>The entire movie is pretty much an insult - a preposterous ""family"" story involving superheroes (a culture that I *despise*, but hey, I thought this would be awesome, cruel parody on it) and lame, idiotic morals. I'm actually puzzled at what *was* the message here, but in the end, the less I think about it, the better. None of the characters did anything to me. Nothing at all was even remotely funny. But what really got me was the attempt at doing something ""adult"", ""serious"" and ""meaningful"". To me, it was just overreaching. They were trying so hard to make a *statement* with that movie, they failed to make it entertaining and rewarding. Besides, why was the movie advertised for kids, anyway? This movie had *nothing* at all to do with kids. To me, it isn't very honest to do ""serious"", ""adult"" animation and advertise it as a kids movie just to earn easy money. Not honest at all.<br/><br/>The attitude of the movie bugged me. It seemed to be building up towards something important, something truly earth-shattering. And as it approached the end, it just became more and more ridiculous and insulting - the scene showing soldiers making a ""drinking game"" with the live footage on TV, culminating with Mr. Incredible ""heroically"" beating them to a pulp (away from the camera, of course! Gotta be P.C.!), was the moment when I was convinced I should stop watching. But I didn't, and it just got worse. The movie climaxed with the baby, Jack-Jack, showing his superpowers as if nobody saw that coming (come on, did the writers think I was THAT dumb?), and humiliating the villain with all sorts of glories. And like that wasn't enough, the writers KILL the villain, just to make us go ""wow, that's SO bold and unexpected for a family movie!"" The ending arrives, and happens exactly the way I predicted it to go. Well, not true... I didn't think the movie would sink SO LOW to the point of making another moralistic climax with Dash purposefully finishing the race on second place.<br/><br/>I am convinced. The more gushing, brainless raves a movie gets, the worse it is. That is the only logical explanation I can come up with for garbage like this to be passed off as some revolutionary masterpiece. Not even the animation was noteworthy - it was so polished, so squeaky-clean, so show-offy and state-of-the-art that it was just plain boring to look at. Instead of trying to entertain us, Pixar just tried to show off. And since people are so easily impressed by such arrogance, I guess they can get away with it. But in a few years, that stuff will be horribly dated - kind of like The Matrix. You know such love for technology has a price. Please, if you want to watch a movie, go watch a movie made for human beings. Leave ""The Incredibles"" for the robots and the androids when they take over the human race - it will be surefire MST3K material."

","Am I missing something here? When this movie came out last year everyone went on about it like it cured cancer. Well I just saw it on DVD. What is remotely new about this movie? Nothing. It's nice visually, but so what? I thought it was going to be a biting, snide and outrageous parody. Instead we get the same old family dynamics and boring ""be yourself"" speeches.<br/><br/>A few minor jokes about expanding waistlines do not carry a movie. And frankly, too much action leaves me numb and animated action even more so. The whole idea of the stay-at-home (not to mention incredibly NAGGING) mother was a bit tired. And I thought the black character was really insulting. Was it necessary for him to be a jive-talking stereotype? This movie is for people who actually thought Finding Nemo was good too."

","This movie could have been so much more. Unless you're a fan of the technical aspects of animation this movie is a real letdown for all but the preteens. If you take your 8 year old to see this movie I'm sure they will enjoy it and want to see it a million more times, just look at the box office for Yûgiô. Unlike the feeling you get from the trailers and promos, that is the audience that will be attracted to this movie. I left the theater with my brain feeling numb, you know, that feeling you can get when you've spent a whole Saturday morning in front of the TV watching cartoons. The feel of the animation is better than Saturday morning cartoons but the plot is the same. The characters don't develop and the inconsistencies in the plot are horrible. It is very obvious that the creators have hopes for a long running series for these characters. I couldn't shake the thought that I was watching a pilot for a bad ""Simpsons"" instead of a feature length movie.<br/><br/>For parents of young children this movie will be great as your children will be entertained. This is doomed though to be one of those movies you will buy for your children when it comes out on DVD and then have to watch with them thousands of times. It lacks the ""smart"" type of humor that can transcend between both child and adult so prepare to be bored. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a good movie to entertain your small children but don't expect much on an adult level. 2 of 10 for the nice animation work."
"howdesign","Null","4","7","7 November 2004"," Much Action, But Missing Something
","Big Pixar fan here. Also a big CGI fan. I took my three kids today to the movie and left a little dazed by its pace and length.<br/><br/>I had superhuman expectations for this movie and it came up just a bit short. The action was great. The CGI was fantastic. But after all that, it just seemed to be missing something. To me, the ""style"" of the movie wasn't terribly notable either. Unlike Nemo and even Toy Story or Bug's Life, there were few ""wow"" moments where the eye candy of the CGI spoiled the viewer. Perhaps it's because we've already been spoiled from past Pixar and Shrek level pictures. This picture takes the action to a whole new level but that aspect tended to blur too many times for my tastes. <br/><br/>Viewers who loved the thoughtful moments of The Iron Giant may be a bit disappointed here. Some of my favorite moments of The Incredibles were the small, clever instances rather than the manic action. I laughed out loud at some of these instances and wanted more. The Samuel L. Jackson character seemed underdeveloped. Even the main characters seemed thin to me. Yeah, we learned about Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's early career fame, but nothing prior.<br/><br/>I think this movie will stand out in the Pixar collection for the action, but it's getting easier for these CGI movies to numb the senses. There's enough here to satisfy many types of viewers, but the pace will make a second viewing necessary to get everything. Having seen The Polar Express premier the same weekend, I may have been jaded. TPE is heads and shoulders above TI in my opinion, but the former's story was already a classic. The quality of its CGI was jaw dropping too, where as The Incredibles just seemed very good.<br/><br/>I think we expect each new computer animated movie to set a higher standard than the previous, but they'll have to level out at some point. I think we may be near that point (i.e. Shark Tale). It's now possible with CGI to do ""anything"". But the story will continue to be most important. I noticed during several points of The Incredibles that I should be more impressed with what they were able to do on screen, but I felt it didn't matter. The story wasn't keeping my interest a well as I would have liked.<br/><br/>Pixar has set a high standard and this movie will make them financially happy, but I don't think it's Oscar-worthy. They're mortal and may not please all of us all of the time. But it's hard to not expect instant classics from them, which may be our fault more than theirs."

","I saw the previews, read the articles, checked IMDb and thought this was going to be a fantastic film along the lines of the 'Finding Nemo' and 'Toy Story'. From the extra preview to the cartoon to the feature I was more and more disappointed. The voice talent was good with Craig T Nelson surprisingly good as the voice of the Bob Parr and I enjoyed Holly Hunter as Helen Parr but the story was rehashed bits already done well by others and the plot was flat. The movie turned into ""Spy Kids"" halfway through. The chase scene through the jungle was directly out of ""Return of the Jedi"". The dysfunctional family angle was boring and Samuel L. Jackson's character was too small and stereotypical. I would have left early but I kept hoping that it was going to finally start getting good and sad to say it didn't.

","With the on-set of numerous law suits, which are costing the Government millions, super-heroes are forced to go into hiding under the witness protection program. Forced to lead mundane, ordinary lives and go under societies radar; one of these heroes turned civilians is Bob Par (aka Mr. Incredible aka voice of Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Helen (aka Elastigirl aka voice of Holly Hunter). But life is difficult for the Par family; especially with their three confused children. Especially for Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and little brother Dash (Spencer Fox) who have grown up believing their super-human powers are a flaw, not an asset. On-top of family crises, Bob isn't happy. He misses the 'old days' and tries to cling to his past by keeping in touch with his old friend Frozone (aka Lucius Best aka voice of Samuel L. Jackson) and listening to police radios for the 'low down'. So when Bob is approached by Mirage (Elizabeth Peña) who offers him a chance to step back into the limelight, he jumps. But the tests Bob is put through; like defeating a ball robot; are really apart of Mirage's evil boss Syndrome's (jason lee) attempt to wipe-out superheroes until he is the only one left. Now it is a matter of Helen and her children working together to save their Incredible father.... and the world.<br/><br/>While ""The Incredibles"" had praise heaped upon it; I simply cant see what all the fuss was about. There are no gags in this film whatsoever. Pixar's usual trademark wry, adult humor are not at all present in this film and it is sorely lacking because of it. And despite the glossy, bold colorings; it is essentially a dark film. There are moments of conflict which are entirely too serious for a children's movie; and a little uncomfortable. And while I am not one of those people who rambles on about violence in the movies and TV affecting today's youth; there is a lot of violence in this animation, and it is simply too excessive not to comment on. A lot of guns; which, despite being computer-graphics, are still very real in appearance and frequently used. Lots of explosions, crashes, punches etc... I know this is a film about super-heroes and villains; but I just couldn't get past how unsettling it all was. And trust me when I say it is odd for me to comment on such a thing; I am usually one of those people complaining about how up-tight all those PG13 lovers are.<br/><br/>The Incredibles lacks the charm and essential wit normally characterized by a Pixar film. In comparison to its predecessors, ""The Incredibles"" is incredibly lacking. It is unfunny, uninteresting and all of the violence is somewhat unnecassary. What a disappointment. But hey; if you want to jump onto the band wagon, go right ahead. When has quality ever really gotten in the way of that sheep-mentality anyway?"

I have even conducted a straw-poll amongst my colleagues in the IT System Support Dept and have yet to find anyone who has actually watched/suffered this movie right to the end. The animation may be good but the story is immensely dull and ponderous. I wonder just what is supposed to be the target audience for this movie? My eight-year old daughter found that much of the dialogue was too grown-up for her. Whilst my wife and I found much of it to be down at ""cartoon level"" and rather too simplistic for an Adult Audience.

","possible spoilers<br/><br/>The Incredibles, the latest film from Pixar, is yet the latest disappointment for me. Don't get me wrong. This is by no means a bad film... sadly, it's just that the film isn't that good, or at least as good as I would have hoped. The film takes place in a world where super-heroes, or ""supers"" as they're called, have been prohibited. One of them, Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, is eventually called back into action by a mysterious person, who turns out to be... Buddy, a guy who lost it after Mr. Incredible refused to let him be his teen sidekick. Since then, Buddy, now calling himself Syndrome, has secretly been killing all of the supers off one by one, until there's only a handful left: Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone. When things eventually get too tough for Mr. Incredible to handle, it's up to his wife Helen(aka Elastigirl) and their kids, Dash and Violet to land a hand. Overall, the storyline is pretty weak. It's a bit predictable, and nothing that much comes as a surprise, although the characters are for the most part likable. My major complaint with The Incredibles, however, would be that midway through it completely changes into a brain-dead action film, and if I wanted something like that, I would have watched a Bond movie. There isn't enough of the trademark ""Pixar"" wit that has been in films like Toy Story and Monsters Inc, something that I really enjoy. If I wanted an all-out action flick, I would have watched something like Overall, I probably could have waited until this came out on video and DVD."

Well, the Internet sequences WERE NOT EVEN INCLUDED IN THE MOVIE. So those who laughed over the making the belt fitting scene will be sorely disappointed not to see it.<br/><br/>This movie is NOT a comedy. It is black on a number of fronts and is not good for a younger audience. Try an incredibly violent Spy Kids.<br/><br/>The violence is on many fronts. There is a missile downing of an aeroplane with children on board. There are several violent deaths e.g. enemies flying into cliffs. This is culturally wrong because super heroes do not kill people. Secondly, billing this movie as an animation implies a level of non-violence.<br/><br/>There is a marital dispute that runs sourly throughout the entire movie. This is never even resolved by the end of the movie. I went to be entertained, not reminded of the difficulties of balancing my marriage.<br/><br/>Holly Hunter was a bad choice for the mother.<br/><br/>There was appalling grammar throughout the movie, further advancing the entertainment industries intention to ruin the English language.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective there were a number of advances in wet scenes, water in general and lighting. However, Pixar concentrated a lot on human faces and the lip synching was noticeably bad and was a distraction throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I am not sure where Pixar is going now, but this is not a good direction. We went to a afternoon performance with a younger audience and the only laughter was at the end.<br/><br/>Boring, violent, and very disappointing."

"GSmith9072","7","3","5","18 June 2007"," A bewildering combination of brilliance and despondent themes
","I want to congratulate director Brad Bird on one of the most original animated opening sequences I've seen. From the very start of the film, the viewer is all ready to submerge into a film that takes animation and ""children's entertainment"" to a whole new level, and this level isn't just pretentious gibber concocted to look revolutionary. This is the real thing. And it's almost a superb film. But I must take strong, even drastic conflict with the underlying themes that the film presents. What makes the ""The Incredibles"" both excellent and reprehensible is Bird's writing that unfortunately overlooks and neglects aspects in it's presentation. At least I hope so. The film leaps back and forth from a respectable animated film into something dark and ugly, and, amongst such, paints a gloss over it and claims accessibility to children. It is such a fact that I pray is never repeated. <br/><br/>Bird's writing flounders in the very fact that it is trying to promote a message, and not a silly one. While doing so in the context of a superhero film, the film meanders back and forth from being real and fantastical. Essentially, the film can't decide what it wants to be. Does it want to pay homage to classic comics where elements of our reality are taken for granted or does it want to portray a strange new world where supers are taken out of context and applied a different role in the society? That is, the film begs to be taken as some kind or allegory, at the time maintaining, even emphasizing it's seriousness. The film contains fantastic voice work from the whole cast involved, and toward the middle of the film there are some impressively convincing moments of drama and suspense. What is further done with this is utterly disappointing. The film sporadically morphs back into a comic book where the lives of everyone except our heroes are meaningless, as is the physical and emotional pain of these characters. Some situations that involve very serious acts perpetuated by the protagonists are never resolved and are thusly deemed as acceptable. This is evident from the very start of the film when our hero, who's personality is much more like the appearances of the characters in ""Monster's Inc"", derides the talent of the soon-to be powerful villain as a youngster and never cares to say anything about it until years later, when the tables are turned. The film's message is to point out that ""no, we aren't all special"", and I can live with that to a certain degree because it's true for the most part. But one wonders if these certain facts are necessary for smaller children to digest? Perhaps this film isn't for them at all, and that's fine. What do I as an older person think? I think these themes scream some pretty reprehensible notions, and it killed any entertaining factor that ""The Incredibles"" had, as well as making me dislike the characters. Aside from our hero's treatment of Buddy and his hardly fairly matched boss in the beginning, when you view what occurred in terms of the film's overall theme it fails to mesh into anything we'd think as admirable if you're the average caring person. Buddy's child-like enthusiasm for his talent is not a bad thing, but it is treated as such. One talent is favored over the other, and I'm not sure why. Justifably, Buddy seeks out to be like his ex-hero and is killed for it. Wait, I'm completely aware of Buddy, who's later turned into Syndrome, is a serial killer. But what can we say about the depiction of a struggling person desperate to be labeled what is considered ""special"" as a vicious murderer? Something just isn't right here. It isn't helped by the very fact that virtually every non-super is either looney or negative in nature. <br/><br/>There are further questionable sequences in the film, including the aforementioned violence occurring toward the end, that even while in self-defense, it is not believable when compared to the same intensity of other scenes involving the protagonists in mortal danger. I certainly do demand that films, despite the lowered standards for family entertainment, be further observed beyond their entertainment value or admittedly very good direction. Still, the film is also to be commended for it's artistic landscape, a somewhat 1950's universe laden with modernist design. A true rarity animation for adults is, and this so disappointingly has to offend in an unusual and problematic way."

But the time was passing, and things were changing: many people were unhappy with the heroes, seeing their efforts to help as a threat instead of a good thing. Soon the government asked the heroes to retire their 'uniforms'and act like regular citizens.

","This is a very enjoyable movie, with a lot of smart and interesting twists to the superhero genre. however it feels like two separate movies. The first half is more serious and is like a cross between a superhero spoof and the idea of a superhero taken as reality. The problem comes when the movie switches from being something that questioned the genre and made it more real to something that no longer takes its characters seriously. By the end this is just a ride movie, not an action movie with consistent character development and a point that people could walk away with. now, i'm not talking about a sound-byte ""Message"" that was missing, because something like that actually was there, it was just betrayed by the ending. The family of the incredibles became people with extraordinary powers rather than truly special or extraordinary people. *Spoiler* The lack of responsibility towards the villain that Mr. ""incredible"" showed disproves that he is anything other than a man with superhuman strength. He is not a hero. His ego had a part in creating the villain. syndrome had free will and choice to do what he did and it couldn't be called Mr incredible's fault, but Mr. incredible does kill him in a very cavalier manner with no attempt to capture or rehabilitate him, as a hero, incredible is supposed to be better in character than regular people. The film also treated the killing of syndrome as a joke, with that cape thing. on the one hand something like that can be considered funny in a cartoonish comic book setting but not in a world that is supposed to be taken seriously as the world of the incredibles had been set up to be. This movie had great potential and is still excellent in many respects, but it is not the great film that many critics and audiences seem to think it is."

Then an opportunity arises to resume super-heroing and, before you know it, Bob and his entire family are in jeopardy.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is an excellent film, with plenty of action, adventure, humour, and superheroics, and a surprising amount of James Bond-iness (including musical references). At its heart is the family relationships between the Parrs, and the threats to this are shown to be just as important as the larger and more physical threats from the villain.<br/><br/>The animation is superb, the character design is brilliant, and the set design - particularly the island locations - is just stunning. The film is a visual treat. But the characters themselves are beautifully realised, too. The voice work is fantastic (if I had to single out anyone it would be Jason Lee, delivering a character which is funny and seriously scary at the same time) and the animation acting is always heartfelt and true.<br/><br/>If I had one criticism - and I do - it is that the film feels a little flat during the period while depressed Bob is working at the office.

","On the face of it this may look like it is very much a film for children that will have little appeal to adults unless they are watching it with their children; this however would be a mistake as it has a good story that adults can enjoy too. Some aspects are clearly aimed at the adult viewer such as obvious references to James Bond, these are done in a way that people who don't see the reference won't get the impression that they are missing something.<br/><br/>The film opens fifteen years ago in a world where superheroes routinely fight crime and protect the population... until the population is fed up with paying to repair all the damage they do while fighting crime. Banned from using their powers they are forced to hie their super powers and live regular lives. Back in the present Mr Incredible is working in an insurance office by day and sneaking off with his old friend Frozone to fight crime by night... while his wife Helen, formally Elastigirl believes he is just bowling. After one such outing he is contacted by the mysterious Mirage who offers him a chance to use his powers again in service of the government. He thinks he can hide this from his wife but she spots that his costume has been repaired and contacts the designer Edna 'E' Mode who tells her that not only did she repair it but also made him another. Helen goes to see her and while there learns that her husband has been captured; she must go to his rescue, accompanied by their two children who stowed away on her plane... luckily they have powers that will help rescue their father from Syndrome, his former number one fan who has gone somewhat insane and makes up for his own lack of powers with an array of gadgets.<br/><br/>Pixar did a great job making this film, making the characters feel believable even though they are animated superheroes. The story was fairly gripping and there was a sense of danger... we were shown that Syndrome had already killed several other ""Supers"". Some parents might not be too keen on the fact that some people die, including a few in an amusing scene about the dangers of wearing a cape, none of these deaths are likely to scare children though. I would certainly recommend this film to anybody wanting to see a well made film with a good story and nothing to offend."
"joecoolbrad","10","2","3","6 June 2009"," An excellent action-comedy film.
","Strong point: Excellent Action, surprisingly deep characters, hilarious comedy<br/><br/>Weak Point: How in the name of all that is purple did this get a PG rating?<br/><br/>This should be an action-comedy superhero film, not a family film. The producers should have gone the whole way and made this an action film. As it is, the film is stellar. When I finished watching it, I immediately felt invigorated and exhilarated. For the first half of the movie I could not stop laughing. For the second half, I was constantly on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Its hard to decide which is more appealing, the characters, the comedy, or the action. Each of these is beautifully done, and excellently presented. The special effects and action are as thrilling as a trip with Peter Jackson. The characters emotionally deep and complex. For Director Brad Bird, this is familiar territory, and something he did very well in the Iron Giant. It defiantly carries over into this masterpiece. the film is also peppered with some of the best comedy you will ever see in a film. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: What I've meant to say with all this yakking is: Watch this movie."

","Wonderful movie. For a moment, I forgot that I am watching a comic. Emotions looked real. Characters just fitted very well. Story is really good and animation is world class. No noise, no deviations and narration was straight to the point. Everyone in the superhero's family is given a unique power and they are given a pie of their share fighting with the baddies. All characters are balanced really well which most of the superhero movies miss. suspense about the villain really stands out. I enjoyed watching this movie. I am curious about the second part of this movie. I haven't found anything to complain. This movie deserves a 10/10."
"greenforest56","10","2","3","3 September 2007"," Alas, the only word that comes to mind is ""incredible""
","Wow! The cinematography, the camera angles, the action shots, the direction!!!!! This movie is ""incredible"". On top of that - its got a great story line and plot! It's even got good character development! And this is a kid's movie involving super heroes! Usually a setup for cookie cutter cardboard cut outs! I think Walt Disney would be proud of this movie. The digital technology in this not only rivaled the animation of his classics - but outdid it in some ways! Action, adventure? Try James Bond in 'Thunderball"" and Indiana Jones meets Superman! Kids will love this and so will grown ups, the true mark of an outstanding animated feature.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a little more violent than Disney's classics. Unfortunetely, that age of innocence is gone forever. By today's standards, where car jackings don't make the news because they're so routine, this movie isn't bad. I would say 9 years old. On the other hand, I used to watch a kid's cartoon called ""Space Ghost"" whose sole attraction was that he blew up half the universe every Saturday morning.......and I was 7......<br/><br/>So, on that score I guess parents will have to make their own call. That aside, there are no weak points in this movie: voice casting, script, cinematography, action, plot, set direction, everything is great. A really fun movie to watch. And, about as entertaining and wholesome a family movie as these things get, today."
"karthik-globalsoul","8","2","3","27 June 2007"," Slick Flick  The Incredibles
","(Karthik Narayan) When I saw this movie rated quite high on the movie websites, I wondered why an animated picture could be given high preference as an all-time great movie. That inquisitiveness made me watch this movie more than anything else. But after watching it, I staunchly recommend it to everyone who likes classic comedy, super hero clashes and a down to earth storyline that anyone can associate themselves with.<br/><br/>Action super hero movies have come in aplenty, mostly taken over from comics. This movie isn't the proverbial average Super-hero (oh boy, what an oxymoron). A superhero family who try to live a common man's life and suffer the consequences and the pang of not being able to save the world in time. Instead they are at home reading the newspapers, listening to the radio which alerts the world against danger which is bound to happen anyway.<br/><br/>The family of Mr.Incredible is secluded away from the rest of the action simply because the Government wanted them to stay away from daily life; The Government poking its nose into the common man's world, so what's new about that, you might ask. Mr.Incredible isn't able to judge what is right  to save the city against the dangers or to save his family against the dangers of the city (read people). The moral of the story is trouble is always by the people and for the people. For without people, there is no trouble.<br/><br/>In their quest to save themselves against the world, the Superheroes succumb to the temptation to save the world against the real lurking dangers that were carelessly ignored. This causes them to throw all caution to the wind and take on the dangers that were more impeding and important. Along the way, the family unites as a team and the children learn a valuable lesson in confidence and self defense mechanisms to take on the world.<br/><br/>The villainous fan is outrageous, the practicality of a superhero living a human life is well said and the Super powers are quite staggering  especially that of the children.<br/><br/>The theme is superb; the comic way in which the story is woven is marvelous and overall, incredible indeed! This movie is honey spread on a plate waiting to be tasted. Don't forget to take the toasted bread with you as you move on to relish it."
"Rob_Taylor","6","8","21","24 November 2004"," The Incredibly Mediocre Movie..
","Don't get me wrong...it has its moments. But they are few and far between in this film.<br/><br/>The decision to make the story more ""real"" by having the superheroes portrayed as an ordinary family with ordinary family problems went a long way to disappoint me, even though I had expected this from reviews. To me ""ordinary"" and ""super"" are two words that should never get mixed together. I appreciate the movie's thought that, if everyone had superpowers, then everyone would be ordinary, but come on. I want to be entertained, not run through an updated episode of The Flintstones.<br/><br/>Another nail in the coffin for this one was the hype. Once again, the movie moguls hype up a film, raising our expectations to silly levels. How can we be anything but disappointed with the reality?<br/><br/>If you compare this movie to the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo it doesn't even come close to being in the same league.<br/><br/>Unlike those movies, where a bit of affectionate scene plagiarism was appreciated for what it was, The Incredibles just annoyed the Hell out of me with its ""Return of the Jedi"" jungle chase scene. A quick flit through the jungle with the hero being chased by the bad guys - just long enough for you to realize it for what it was - would have been fine. But no. They had to drag the scene out for minute after minute, adding in all the scenes from the RoTJ chase, such as the enemy drawing alongside, the swinging from the vines etc. until you were sick of it and praying it would end.<br/><br/>There are some good ideas, but on the whole the film doesn't get my thumbs up of approval. Once again, partly the hype to blame, but also mostly because it's not that good."

In addition to the attractive story, whether it is the style of painting, the sound effect, and then the tight grasp of the rhythm of the plot are great, and there are many laughter points, which are both nervous and heart-wrenching, both happy and moved."
"Ryan_Barbakins","10","1","1","15 February 2020"," Fantastically Witty Family Superhero Flm!
","The Incredibles presents a family with superpowers that must deal with living in a world where using super powers is illegal. Pixar yet again presents a fun, clever, and original idea to the big the screen for all ages to enjoy. And the execution of this concept is absolutly stellar! Brad Bird's pixar films truly are not made for children, they are made to satisfy adults while still making it something that kids can enjoy.
All four of the characters go through a self-changing arc that turns them into better people by the end of the film. Mr. Incredible learns that his family is more important than his desires, Elastigirl learns that her husband cares more about his family than she is willing to admit, Violet learns that opening up and embracing yourself is better than hiding in the shadows, and dash learns that slowing down every once in a while isn't the end of the world. All of this helps strengthen not only the characters, but also their relationships to one another.
Syndrome is one of the greatest cinematic villains in history. His character and plan is so logical and clever that is has been replicated multiple times in other superhero films (including twice in the MCU).
The film never seems to skip a beat. When our heros are not fighting crime, they are fighting at the dinner table with each other. Every scene has a purpose whether it is for the advancement of the plot or developing the family.
This film is just about perfect, because every element compliments the other in a naturally cohesive and entertaining way."

","4/4<br/><br/>The Incredibles feels as if it goes out of it's way to go against every superhero movie stereotype in the books. It's a completely original world with great characters, dialogue, and animated action. It stands out against so many other family films because it is one of the few that actually appeals to the whole family. It won't leave little kids bored half-way through, but it's smart enough to keep the teens and adults satisfied.<br/><br/>The movie centers around the Parr family. The common love or dismissal of superheroes is replaced with a society that hates their guts. After an attempted suicide was foiled by Mr. Incredible, superheroes were outlawed. Then it cuts to him as a family man. His kids and wife (former super ""Elasta-Girl) have superpowers, and after 15 years of leading a ""normal life"", he has a compulsive need to sneak out at night to preform heroics.<br/><br/>Instead of studying only one superhero, it gives adequate screen time and attention to each member of the Parr family. Each member of the family has their own powers and balances each other out in the action. The chemistry between the characters alternates between trying to preform heroics, and well... typical family squabbling. The way The Incredibles depicts the ultimate family super-team side as well as the typical American family side is very clever.<br/><br/>Pixar made a movie that will shake the foundations of its rival studios. Their keaner eye for quality and tried-and-true conflict style has carried them for more than 20 years. They have had their downs, and they have had their greats, but The Incredibles is one for the ages."

"zkonedog","5","1","1","4 March 2017"," A Bit Uneven And Lacking The Usual Pixar Strong Characters
","The legacy of the Disney/Pixar film collection will always (at least to me) be its ability to completely engross/entertain children and adults alike in a single sitting. While ""The Incredibles"" will suck in the kiddies again as usually, this time the adults are left out a bit.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), a former superhero who is now adjusting to family life with wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), also a former hero. Instead of saving the world and fighting bad guys, they are now raising their three children Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and Jack-Jack the baby. When a new baddie comes into the picture, however, the ""old crew"" (plus a few new ""kids"") is needed once again.<br/><br/>In terms of action and adventure, the ""Incredibles"" is as good as any previous Disney effort. It is full of color and spectacle and will have the kids hooked within minutes. In this aspect, it is a very successful endeavor.<br/><br/>The ""trouble"" with this film, though, is that the characters just aren't as well-developed as other fare. For example, when you watch movies like ""Finding Nemo"" or even ""Tangled"", you really feel as if you are invested in the characters and their exploits. In ""The Incredibles"", though, the characters are just present and not quite as well-developed.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only caveat to the above paragraph is that if you have a family, the themes for ""The Incredibles"" might hit a little close to home. Though I myself come from a large family, I do not have a family of my own, and thus have not had to go through the types of trials and humorous situations that this movie portrays.<br/><br/>Thus, my experience with ""The Incredibles"" was an uneven one in the end. I could appreciate some of the jokes and sight gags, but I never was really able to ""buy in"" to the characters to the extent of other past Disney works."

","It's hard to believe that it's been a decade since I saw this one...

Being a lifelong comic book fan (whenever money permitted), I recognized The Fantastic Four the moment I saw them (although, to be fair, Mr. Fantastic was actually preceded in comics by Jack Cole's Plastic Man and The Human Torch before he became Human was an android capable of setting himself alight). The opening scenes establish that THE INCREDIBLES Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl were just two among MANY Supers who roamed the land before a lawsuit brought them all down (a lawsuit, we learn, that was the result of fanboy ""Incrediboy"" interfering in Mr. Incredible's attempt to stop the dastardly Bomb Voyage from blowing up a building)- and all of this en route to Mr. Incredible's wedding to Elastigirl... The disenfranchised Supers shoe-horn themselves into ""normal"" society, but each and every one of them is chomping at the bit to get back into costume. Meanwhile, the evil Syndrome is making plans to destroy Mr. Incredible. Will he succeed? Next issue: The Shocking Answer!!!"

","The Pixar Studios, which cannot seem to take a wrong step, steps right again with ""The Incredibles,"" a superhero spoof that alternates breakneck action with satire of suburban sitcom life. Here's another example of Pixar's mastery of popular animation.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible, the hero of ""The Incredibles,"" is a superhero in the traditional 1950s mold, dashing about town fighting crime and saving the lives of endangered civilians. Alas, the populace is not unanimously grateful, and he's faced with so many lawsuits for unlawful rescue and inadvertent side-effects that he's forced to retire. Under the government's Superhero Relocation Program, Mr. Incredible moves to the suburbs, joined by his wife Elastigirl and their children Violet, Dashiell and little Jack Jack.<br/><br/>One day, however, he gets a message from a woman named Mirage. She has a lot of superhero duties to do, and he agrees to do it without letting his family know. But things go array when it turns out Mirage wasn't the one behind the superhero duties; but her employer, a villain named Syndrome, who a childhood obsession with Mr. Incredible, but now wants to destroy him due to what Mr. Incredible did to him in the past. Syndrome also wants to destroy all superheroes, then make himself a hero through any means necessary.<br/><br/>On the surface, ""The Incredibles"" is a goof on superhero comics. Underneath, it's a critique of modern American uniformity. Mr. Incredible is forced to retire, not because of age or obsolescence, but because of trial lawyers seeking damages for his unsolicited good deeds; he's in the same position as the Boy Scout who helps the little old lady across the street when she doesn't want to go. What his society needs is not super-deeds but tort reform. ""They keep finding new ways,"" he sighs, ""to celebrate mediocrity.""<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen a Bond movie will make the connection between Syndrome's island hideout and the headquarters of various Bond villains. ""The Incredibles"" also has a character inspired by Q, Bond's gadget-master. This is Edna Mode, known as E and voiced by Brad Bird, who also wrote and directed. She's a horn-rimmed little genius who delivers a hilarious lecture on the reasons why Mr. Incredible does not want a cape on his new uniform; capes can be as treacherous.<br/><br/>The Incredibles,"" too, has special qualities, especially in the subtle ways it observes its gifted characters trying to dumb down and join the crowd. Kids in the audience will likely miss that level, but will like the exuberance of characters like Dash. Grown-ups are likely to be surprised by how smart the movie is, and how sneakily perceptive.<br/><br/>The highlight, and strongest point of the movie, is in the last third where we see The Incredibles team up to defeat Syndrome and his evil plan. Not only are the powers used to the maximum potential, but the climax is a lot of fun. It's action packed, well done, and very entertaining. It's a unique superhero movie because it focuses on the family rather than just one superhero. And the family is unique; the kids are energized, the parents are well written, and what they're going through is relatable (even in the world they live in). Not only do I consider this one of my favorite animated films ever, but also one of my favorite superhero movies ever. It's a must-watch."
"jmitrani750","9","1","1","3 February 2014"," The Incredibles from a deeper perspective
","The most profound and prevalent theme the movie, ""The Incredibles,"" has to offer is its paradoxical correlation between superiority and conformity. Being superior entails a relationship between two or more individuals. In this movie, the main characters were considered super heroes due to intrinsic physical abilities that enabled them to do what the average man couldn't. Throughout the first scene of the movie, the viewer is reminded how society deemed these individuals. Super heroes in ""The Incredibles"" were initially lauded because they devoted their powers and lives to noble causes and the maintenance of justice. However, in an era of American history that championed normalcy, being superior was not desirable. Conformity embraces those that seek to fit in and shuns those that exhibit any differences. While being ""super"" implies an advantage, the movie captures poignantly portrays having super human abilities as a disadvantage. Hence, the viewer is forced to come to the following paradoxical conclusion. While having super powers was once advantageous, in a society that emphasizes conventionality, being different in any sort of way is deemed unacceptable. On a figurative level, I guess one could ponder the statement the film tries to make as the protagonist struggles to live his mundane life. While he is not destitute or poverty stricken, Bob Parr is trapped within the confines of 21st century suburbia. Ironically, the world's strongest man is powerless against the forces and burdens or society, and his coerced into taking a terrible job as opposed to living out his ambitions. While no one can relate to the super human strength that our main character exhibits, many can empathize with his loss of ardor and vigor in the face of the banalities of life. Bob Parr was once Mr. Incredible, conveying this through his super powers and his steadfast dedication towards justice. Society has forced this man to hide his powers and subdue his natural inclinations to help those in need. Many adults entering their respective fields often experience this type of loss as they ascend up their respective ranks. Lawyers seeking to represent the oppressed or prosecute the wicked often become disenchanted with the sleaziness of state and federal bureaucracies. Doctors hoping to treat patients who lack financial means often run into trouble a myriad of factors, such as insurance problems, inadequacies of public hospitals, and the disparity of wealth between private practice and public health officials. Businessmen hoping to reallocate wealth in this country and solve our nation's crushing inequality tend to succumb their personal whims and horde more wealth for themselves. If you still don't believe this movie demonstrates the theme of the loss of nobility in the face of conformity, and how this manifests itself in the workplace, consider Bob's regular job. Bob is an insurance salesman, a profession dedicated to helping those affected by adversity. However, his insurance company, like the society around it, has abandoned its morals. Rather than help those affected by tragedy, Bob is instructed to simply let his clients wallow in their misery. When he attempts to finance claims beneath his boss's nose, he is censured and nearly fired. The connection I want to reiterate boils down to relationship between being super and being normal. Whereas one could accomplish the former through superhuman abilities or standing up for what's right, it seems though people lose this throughout their adult lives. Being normal is easier than being super. If society continues to advocate for conformity and repress any ability that would enable one to transcend the burdens of life, then we will lose all of our superheroes, both fictional and non fictional."
"C22Man","9","1","1","31 October 2013"," Truly outstanding superhero homage from Pixar
","The Incredibles is another classic computer-animated film from Pixar. Riding high from past successes Pixar decided to do a film different to the norm by featuring all human characters for the first time and giving Brad Bird free reign over the whole project, and it pays off no end with one of their strongest efforts. <br/><br/>The story starts off with superheroes Mr Incredible and Elastigirl keeping Metroville safe from crime and getting married. This all stops when people begin suing the 'Supers' as they are forced to quit and go into a relocation programme. Fifteen years pass and they try to live a normal life with their children, but Mr Incredible misses the glory days. He gets his chance via a mysterious call to a secret mission. However he quickly discovers his past is back to haunt him and a plot to kill off all Supers. The plot is excellent as it holds up in so many ways as an actioner and drama with comedic elements. The similarities to other Superhero media, especially Watchmen, are done perfectly too. <br/><br/>The cast and characters are brilliant. Mr Incredible is everything a lead needs, he's charismatic and 'super' but he's humane and caring, it makes a very three dimensional character backed wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson's strong voice. Elastigirl is also great being a dominant and getting in on the action, the unique voice of Holly Hunter works a charm. Dash and Violet are also a lot of fun. They don't become annoying like many children do, they have good personalities and their powers are well worked in. Jason Lee was great as Syndrome, who's a superb villain being so unlikable and evil. Samuel L. Jackson is a lot of fun as the cool Frozone and Brad Bird is hilarious as obsessed Superhero costume designer Edna Mode. <br/><br/>The Incredibles is almost perfect is every way you could imagine. The action is superb from the many battles on the island to the explosive climax. The pacing is excellently managed, it takes time to develop the characters and lets events pan out with care. The vast amount of homages to Superheroes is wonderful. The way the film builds an array of Supers and has fun with them is a joy to behold. The nods to The Fantastic Four and Watchmen were very impressive. The music from Michael Giacchino is just marvellous moving from heroic to Bond like, the main theme and 'Kronos Unveiled' are just magnificent. The animation is brilliant, all the Supers look unique and are all memorably designed, and everything looks fantastic wherever it takes place. It's also refreshing that The Incredibles is much more older children/adult oriented than anything Pixar has done before or since. It doesn't shy away from the violence and how much the entire family has their lives put on the line. Plus the film must be commended for being much more serious and intense, there are still some great jokes, but its great how it uses the subject matter in a thoughtful way. <br/><br/>Overall The Incredibles is both really funny and really well made, it's certainly one of Pixar's best due to how good everything really is."

","This is my bankable companion for action, The Incredibles is an action packed and comedy filled computer animation superhero film, which juggles between the superhero life and the suburban life. The movie transcend beyond the natural computer animation that Pixar was used to, it contained an all human cast, that took the winds out of the Pixar animators, due to the intensity of work that had to be done to create these characters. The Incredibles is one movie that you can adapt to with ease, finding fun on every turn.<br/><br/>After his disappointing movie The Iron Giant (1999) which has been said was due to marketing gone wrong, Brad Bird was down in the blues and he then focused more attention on developing a movie idea he had been working on for some time, it pitched the idea to Pixar's John Lasseter who liked it and brought Bird on board the Pixar team to make the movie. The idea was about a superhero family, with the father going through midlife crises. Bird's refusal to settle for less caused the movie to go through numerous delays, as the animators had to work out the kinks in creating human skin, human clothing, and hair animation in water, air, fire and smoke, to make the characters look real.<br/><br/>The movie does pose some dark parts, with death all well assured and the non hesitant of any of the characters to pull the trigger on the opposing sides, even the children of Mr. Incredible and ElastiGirl were no different, they were not taken unawares or felt any remorse when the opposition died in explosions, while the opposition was trying to kill them, neither were they moved or objected to their parents use of deadly force which resulted into the death of the opposing characters. That is something about the movie that I feel kids should not be exposed to too much.<br/><br/>The incredibles was a theatrical success, winning Two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Sound Editing. It cleared the box office getting home over 630 million compared to its 92 million production cost. It also spawned out comics and numerous merchandises. At least till date 3 video games have been released based on the film characters and adventures.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is fun all the way the kind of fun you get when watching a good action flick mixed with a wonderful sitcom. It is one of a kind and a sequel to this movie is one that I have been waiting for since its release, I just hope I don't have to wait too long.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

It involves all that is necessary for an entertaining film.The characters at some point of time felt so lively to me that i forgot it was an animation movie. There are films like these(including the toy story series) which are close to my hearts. This is one of my favorite movies. <br/><br/>""A must watch for everyone regardless of anything"""
"thepsychocritic","7","1","1","31 August 2011"," A Superhero movie with real Superheroes.
","I am on a superhero high. I've had so much of them that I have finally learnt to shoot laser from my eyes; really. Most of it has been bad. I felt that the superhero days were over. A certain desolateness was creeping into my hapless existence. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I stole my hot, blonde neighbour's Porsche, drove at jet speed to my nearest retail store, ran down two priests, a banshee and a flatulent Eskimo on my way and bought a DVD of The Incredibles. That digital versatile disk didn't work, so I sued the shopkeeper and did the stealing, running over and buying thing again. I plugged it in and blissfully slipped into an animated world of action, comedy and some real superheroes.<br/><br/>The reel rolls with an expected action sequence. Mr. Incredible (voice by Craig T. Nelson) catches thieves, prevents a man from committing suicide, saves a cat and is about to defeat Bon Voyage when an intrusion by his 'biggest fan' results in large scale loss of public property and the escaping of the criminal. Suddenly, the public is angry at these virtuous vigilantes and they are forced underground.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later Robert Parr is facing a midlife crisis. He has married Helena Parr, formerly Elastigirl (voice by Holly Hunter), has helped increase the world population by three and works in an insurance firm under an obnoxious boss, who soon fires him. On the same day he gets a message from a mysterious woman who provides him with another shot at long lost glory. It is a clandestine operation and hidden from the scrutinizing eye of his family, Mr. Incredible returns to business.<br/><br/>In all fairness, animated movies have a definite advantage over non- animated ones. The former don't have to worry about testy actors, bad weather and other such misfortunes that plague the unfortunate latter. If The Incredibles was not an animated movie, it wouldn't have been as good a movie as it otherwise was. However, it IS an animated movie and that puts things in a whole new perspective. <br/><br/>As many detractors would say, the concept isn't highly original per se and it is difficult to contradict them. However, undeniably, The Incredibles was a fresh watch. It was a surprise in 2004, releasing before Nolan's Batman, Ironman and other recent hits.<br/><br/>The four protagonists are extremely well characterized and do not end up becoming tropes. They are affable, endearing and with a baby named Jack- Jack, make a good little superhero family. The side –cast too (Frozone, Edna, Mirage) too manage to carve their own identity, each of them being memorable. The antagonist, Syndrome, leaves more to be desired. He should have been more evil, more clever, more mysterious and more everything else Supervillians need to be.<br/><br/>The film loses out slightly because of being predictable. At every point in the movie you can foretell how the events are going to unfold next. As a result of which nothing surprises you. Everything happens exactly how you had expected it to. What could have been an amazing entertainer becomes a clichéd entertainer. It lacks the ingenuity that other PIXAR films bring with them. It is a pity because an otherwise brilliant movie slips into mediocrity due to this error.<br/><br/>The Incredibles scores well on other fronts. It does well to wring emotions out of you. Your kids, who are also the target audience, are going to love it. The kid in me did. They will be enthralled by the effects, action and superpowers, and in all likelihood won't begrudge the movie for the above mentioned reasons.<br/><br/>And to top it all, like all PIXAR releases, this one too is subtly heart-warming. How does one complain against that?"
"random_avenger","7","1","1","22 August 2010"," The Incredibles
","In a world where superheroes and villains are common, life is good for two heroes named Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl who like their jobs of saving people and finally marry each other. Due to an unfortunate lawsuit against Mr. Incredible, the use of all superpowers is banned and the heroes are forced to lead ordinary, normal lives. The dull suburb life is hard especially for Mr. Incredible (civilian name Bob Parr) and his lively son Dash, while his shy daughter Violet would prefer to be a normal girl despite her skills. When Bob is offered a top secret chance to resume his heroic antics, he agrees enthusiastically, much to the chagrin of his wife Helen. Things are not what they look like though and soon the whole world is in grave danger, prompting Helen to get back to business too.<br/><br/>Pixar Studios' strengths are in good use in the movie: the conventions of James Bond-style action movies are lampooned amusingly, particularly the colourful character designs of the superhero subgenre – actually the whole plot premise sounds similar to the Watchmen graphic novel that was made into a movie in 2009. There are also some enjoyable mature jokes, such as the legal battle over saving someone's life against their will and the urban anxiety caused by an uneventful office career. The training montage and the cape mishap collection are funny too, but mostly the comedy is very action oriented. This is also where the film's biggest problems lie, as the last act of the story is almost nothing but an endless action sequence. Perhaps kids are entertained by hordes of supervillain henchmen being beaten by the family or a giant robot destroying a city, but I was getting a bit bored by the hectic, noisy mayhem that leaves little time to examine the characters' personalities. I understand the movie is not supposed to be a deep character study, but I really feel the pacing gets stuck on full speed for too long at the end.<br/><br/>I saw a dubbed version of the film, so I cannot comment on the original voice actors' performances, but if they are as enthusiastic as the Finnish actors, the constant yelling also adds to the numb feeling caused by the excessive action (which is also surprisingly violent for a family film, even if cartoonish). At the end of the day, I don't think The Incredibles reaches the quality of the best Pixar productions that I've seen (Toy Story 1 and 2, WALLE), but it is a decent piece of entertainment in any case. I enjoyed the first half more than the second, but I'm sure many people disagree with me, so give it a go if you have enjoyed Pixar's works so far. Any superhero fan should also get a kick out of it."

","What a family! And I'm not only talking about the Pixar family, but about the Incredibles family. An adventure for everyone. Pixar has another great movie up their sleeves. If they continue like that, the Top 100 List here on IMDb will solely exist/consist with their movies in there! <br/><br/>Seriously though: The Incredibles takes the Superhero movie genre and takes it's own spin on it. I wouldn't say it spoofs the Superhero world, it just a funny movie, that happens to play in a world with Superheroes. Of course the voice talent on hand here does the story justice, as with the other Pixar movies. A fun-filled adventure that you shouldn't miss."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","1","16 June 2009"," Excellent Pixar film, not the best one, but still very good!
","I wasn't expecting The Incredibles to be as good as it was, it was inventive, funny and original, all the things that I look for in an animated film. I don't think it is Pixar's best, that's Toy Story, but it's certainly not the weakest, that's Cars though that was a worthy film as well. The animation is spot on, and just adds to the inventive feel of the film, and is helped enormously by an innovative plot that is the source of the film's originality. The story is very fast-paced, if perhaps a little slow to begin with, and the script is filled with humour to satisfy even the fussiest child. The characters are very well-done, thanks to the excellent voice cast, standouts are Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, and My Name is Earl's Jason Lee is a big surprise as the villain Syndrome. Brad Bird's Edna was a hoot too. The film however, does have two flaws, it is overlong and sometimes drags consequently, and it is a little too violent at times, the last half-hour especially. Overall, an excellent family film, not perfect, but anybody who's seen some of the Disney direct to video sequels, save one or two exceptions will agree that the Incredibles does a much better job at entertaining than they did. 8/10 Bethany Cox."

","A truly enjoyable movie for anyone who ever enjoyed comic books.<br/><br/>I think this is without a doubt the best animated film to take on the task of taking the comic book hero genre into a movie. Numerous touches, small and large, bring back the atmosphere we always imagined as kids.<br/><br/>Additionally, this is a great movie for all ages to enjoy together. The scary scenes are tolerable for young kids and don't last overly long. There is plenty of comedy for adults, and enough 'cool factor' for everyone.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful to behold.<br/><br/>I just watched it again on the Disney channel tonight, and enjoyed it every bit as much as when I first watched it when it came out."

","What have I got to say about this? It's FANTASTIC! It is a wonderful movie! I absolutely love the animation in this film. I never expected super-heroes to be in an animated film. Movements are pretty realistic, story has funny moments and voices are well chosen. Characters are well designed and portrayed. At first just by looking at a poster I did not think it would be a great movie. The picture of the super-hero family made me think that the movie would be more enjoyed by younger children, but you cannot judge movies and books by their cover. Anyway, this is not a film many little kids may enjoy, but older kids and adults might really like it. Story is very imaginative and it is in a way something new to animation.<br/><br/>Do not bother to listen to any people who hate it because you will not."

","I saw this movie in theaters, and recently, after seeing Ratatouille in theaters, watched the entire movie on the DVD again from start to finish. When the DVD was first on sale, I bought it simply because I knew I'd eventually want to see it again, but other than the special and bonus features (including Just Jack Attack), did not view the movie since its 2004 theatrical release.<br/><br/>Seeing the movie again, and comparing it to the number of excellent movies that came before and after it, I once again feel it was simply one of the very best films - plot wise, composition and technical production value wise, and as far as the voice talent and, of course, the script. And I don't mean this as one of the very best children's film or the very best animation films. I mean, simply put, it easily is among my all time top ten amongst films in terms of overall quality, which includes for me production values, direction, art direction, acting and, primarily, script.<br/><br/>It is also a film you can easily see over and over again and catch new and interesting details and quality marks not as easily discerned in previous viewings."
"JagsFanJay","10","1","1","15 August 2007"," Greatest Animated Movie Ever
","This is without a doubt the best animated movie I have ever seen and has the distinction of being the only animated film in my top 25 movies of all time. The reason I like this movie because unlike other animated films of this current generation, it isn't preachy, there is no symbolism like in ""Finding Nemo"" where Nemo's underdeveloped fin makes the entire film about overcoming his handicap and proving to his father that he is just like everyone else. Kids and adults alike watch these types of movies as an escape. They want to have a good time without being bombarded with ""life lessons"". The Incredibles is exactly that, a good time. It's not a movie directed strictly at kids either. Adults can enjoy this just as much as any child. The animation is great, the story is amazing and the action is non stop. If you only see one animated movie in your lifetime, this is the one. I hope they make a sequel."

Now he has come back for revenge, all because he couldn't be Mr. Incredible's sidekick, also to be the new superhero and be super famous. He sends an evil robot monster into town and then tries to save everyone by using a remote he created to control the monster that he created.

The city, state, country, and maybe even world is all in their hands. Other superheroes like their family friends who are superheroes comes in and help. They all succeed and save the day. Dash, if I am correct that is the name of the fast superhero boy, can finally be in the track team but can't go too fast or he will seem too unnormal, so he goes second place. Will there be a part two of The Incredibles? Who knows? Let's find out.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed this movie for many reasons, it's funny, it's packed tight full of action, and it's so clever. I have remembered seeing a trailer of this movie years before it came out. I thought that for the first time I have seen a trailer of a movie that has failed to meet it's specifications to be accepted into the movie theater. I was wrong, four years later I see it was in the theaters.. but I did not see it until it was released on DVD. Then I enjoyed a movie that I have for such a long time waited to see. Actually, I wasn't sure if it was going to be a good movie or not.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for children, teens, and even adults. This movie was that good and I recommend it!"

","Having started watching Disney films before I was a year old, I can honestly say that I've seen nearly every film Disney has ever released. The original animated Disney films, like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" will always have a special place in my heart, and can at this point not be surpassed by many of the new Disney/Pixar animated films. In fact, ""The Incredibles"" is the only one of these ""3-D"" animation films that has achieved classic status in my mind. It's absolutely incredible.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" manages to do everything the other Disney/Pixar films have tried to do at once. It manages to pay homage to the golden age of superheroes, while at the same time poking fun at certain aspects of it and almost grounding the whole superhero concept in reality. It poses the question of what would truly happen if there were superheroes in society, and does so in an interesting and compelling ways. The story is also enormously compelling. It's a superhero plot that avoids every cliché that it wants to and includes the rest in purposeful and funny ways. Still, what sets the film aside other animated films is its characters, which are all enormously clever and creative.<br/><br/>The ""Incredible"" family is a hilarious and fun superhero family, because they're just like us (except for the powers, which they actually come to loathe). We see a dysfunctional superhero family, which is certainly a first. We also get to see their family friend, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), who was very ""cool,"" if you know what I mean. The villain in the mix is Syndrome, an ambitious child-turned-superhero hater and terrorist. Disney does not handle the film with the normal child quality. Death is not avoided, but rather confronted when Mr. Incredible makes his inevitable strike on the ruthless villain. Syndrome is also perfectly rendered, from his fiery hair down to his maniacal voice. He's extraordinarily intimidating and though funny at times, often shows his purely evil self.<br/><br/>The film is funny at times, while serious at others. It has great characters, a unique plot, fantastic animation, a great score, and a hilarious script. I'd recommend it to children above the age of 6 or 7 and even more so to teens and adults who were around during the golden age of superheroes. It's a perfect film."

I really like the style of this movie; it's not just another animation flick like the boring ""funny"" ones we see coming out almost every month now; it's a real movie, only animated. But who cares, right. They have done a damn good job. Great script, great graphics, great voicing, - I love the fact that they haven't made all characters look like Brangolina. You find yourself feeling complete and satisfied ate the end, which never happens with superhero movies.<br/><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/>I just hope, they won't screw it up and decide on a sequel.

","Okay, Pixar and animation has a lot more going for it. Besides only needing human voices to make animated movies and television series, the top and first class animated figures are done by computers now than hand-done but it takes a village to make a great animated film. The Incredibles is about a superhero couple who retire to have a normal life as they can. Of course, Craig T. Nelson is wonderful and recognizable as the voice of the father and superhero who can't give up his former profession. His wife is the voice of norm here who wants a normal life for their family. I could see why this film and others have attracted audiences whether young and old, parents, grandparents, and children. Most audiences can relate to the situation and enjoy the Disney film and appreciate how technology has come along way."

Well, I was quite disappointed. Yeah, there were a few chuckles here and there, but nothing to make me laugh out loud. Maybe this wasn't a comedy. It's a superhero film, of course. So, I was quite surprise with the fantastic action sequences, filled with explosions here and there and some smart action!<br/><br/>The animation is so fantastic (not to mention it's similar to Fantastic Four)! This film much darker than most Pixar films, and a lot more violent. There were even some tense scenes for me, but it was great because it's geared towards kids and adults who could enjoy the movie together instead of having a complaint to take your kids to see this!<br/><br/>For a superhero movie, it's a really fantastic one. It's one of the best ever made! The characters are lovable and the story is great! I love Brad Bird's homage to many films and all of that jazz! This is just a great film for the family. The score is also great.<br/><br/>Although not hilarious as I thought it would be, this is a great addition to the Pixar films.

The funny thing is that the adults don't seems to mind. Even the shorts, like Jack-Jack Attack and Bounchin' were great.

His wife, Ellen Parr, is also an ex-superhero, and they have three kids who also have superpowers. Like any family, they have their problems.

","What's so admirable about Pixar Animation Studios is how they pay attention to the most important factor, story and the art of storytelling. The Incredibles continues the studios' long line of films that excel not only in animation, but in quality as well. Filling the screen with highly detailed and stylized images, the story introduces us to a family of superheroes. After they are forced to go undercover and live a normal suburban life, they must join and work together in order to defeat the maniacal Syndrome. The movie has a great plot that not only explores many common family issues but has lots of action and adventure that will please the young and old alike. The characters are a blast to watch because they are so well-drawn and full of life. Aside from our family of superheroes, there's fashion diva Edna Mode, ""oh-so-cool"" Frozone, and obnoxious boss Gilbert Huph (perfectly voiced by Wallace Shawn). Even the smallest of characters stand out (such as Bomb Voyage). Pixar made a great investment in hiring Brad Bird. He's a very talented man who has created a popcorn masterpiece."

","The Incredibles (2004) <br/><br/>Review: When I heard that this was from Brad Bird, I was skeptical. Pixar has done some good. I was tempted. Here we go: <br/><br/>The Incredibles is truly something else. We already see the great Pixar animation alone that is even better that Toy Story. This movie features a family with the mother and father two former superheroes living in suburbia. Father Incredible misses the days of the past and longs for them again. That's only part of the story.<br/><br/>The Incredibles has it all. We have excellent voice acting. From Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Jason Lee. They are great here. We also have some truly fast and intense action that I did not expect at all. It will leave you wanting more. Not too violent and not light on it either. Good for the kids and adults alike. You will not be bored.<br/><br/>This movie is also quite intelligent. With unique enemy robots to a rather sinister villain, we have a good thing going here. The ONLY thing preventing this getting a 10 is the setup of the story sending our heroes into retirement. I cannot identify with that at all. Sure, it's original, but far to hard to believe. That's the only drawback here.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Humor, action, and intelligence. What is there to complain about? Almost the best. Brad Bird is a genius."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","1","23 November 2006"," Its popularity is well justified
","This is an animation film about lost heroes resuming their service again to stop evil plots being implemented.<br/><br/>I think the runaway success of this film is that the film's lead heroes are very everyday. The family is portrayed to be heroes who have had their glorious days but got disgraced because of a series of negative incidents. They then choose to have a family life and stay away from the limelight. They are reluctant to use their supernatural powers, and only uses them when the situation gets out of hand. This key point is radically different to most superhero movies, where the heroes have always been glorious heroes and will forever be glorious heroes. In this movie, the heroes fall and then rise back up again, creating a positive message for kids.<br/><br/>Apart from this fundamental difference from other superhero movies, it also has a great story. It also has cute and attractive animation. This film really deserves the attention and praise, and cannot simply be attributed to be popular because it is an animation."

","okay, we all know how amazing this is, most breathtaking cgi you've ever seen, etc, etc. Yup, it's dazzling, a must-see. But that isn't what does it for me, not the stunning cinematography (if that's what you call it when it's computerised?). No, this film has what Bruce Lee calls ""emotional content"", and it packs a real punch, too.<br/><br/>I laughed, I cried, both out loud, nearly shat myself, loads of times. But still, that's not what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the details. Not those sumptuously detailed backdrops, but the emotional details. As well as one big, rollicking story, there are four or five ""wee"" stories, each of the main characters growing individually (at one point Violet says says something like ""well, I think dad's made a lot of progress today, but really we should be going now""). I say ""five"", because really, it's a story about one family, albeit a very ""special"" one.<br/><br/>There's that scene where Violet (who is gloriously flowering into womanhood throughout the whole film) puts on her mask for the very first time, and the camera pulls back as she shifts her position ever so slightly, stands upright and proudly *becomes* a super-hero. It's truly magnificent. She started the film looking like that girl from Ju-On, all hair and one big eye.<br/><br/>Another, when Dash (who reminds me of Bart Simpson, except funnier, faster, and cuter) has just run his legs off to save the day, and Helen (Mum) tells him how proud she is, he can barely move for exhaustion, but that smile! It says it all. The mother is the pivotal character in the whole film, and keeps it all together, saves the day more than anyone else, too. The scene with the guided missiles, I screamed! Then bawled like a baby! Wow!<br/><br/>And when Mr. Incredible tells Mrs. Incredible he's ""not strong enough"", and we realise he means ""strong enough to go on without you"", I literally burst into tears. Incredible stuff! The whole script is so tight, and delivered with such exceptional timing, you realise quickly that you've bought a ticket for one big dizzy emotional roller-coaster that's not gonna stop until the credits roll.<br/><br/>By the time I get to the neck-breaking chase scenes at the end, I'm a complete wreck! So maybe I'm an emotional kinda guy, but I can't remember the last time a movie made me cry like this. What I'm saying is, these guys can ACT! What am I saying? It's a CARTOON! Incredible! <br/><br/>I'd just finished watching that documentary trilogy ""The Corporation"" a few days before seeing this film, and I reckon this helped me to better understand the corporate satire in the middle. I loved the camera work in that section, all right-angular, particularly the part where Bob sits down and disarranges Mr. Huph's pencils, and again where he's using his hands to demonstrate how a ""team"" works. lovely stuff!<br/><br/>Every time the camera moves, there's something new to enjoy, I particularly enjoyed Bob's ""corporate PC"" with the zillion+ wires coming out of the back. Remember who own Pixar?<br/><br/>Yes, I could go on and on, the clever symbolism, the fine intellectual texturing, the deep and piercing satire (and I've said nothing about Edna 'E' Mode who just rocks, and steal all her scenes!) but I'm thinking, in the time I could take to really tell you how amazing this film is, I could watch it again! And man! am I looking forward to doing THAT!<br/><br/>-fm"

","The Pixar team continues its winning streak with this sharp, snappy, surprisingly adult animated adventure film about a family of former superheroes who cannot fit into ""normal"" society no matter how hard they try. I'm actually surprised that kids stayed with this film long enough to enjoy the fast-paced non-stop action of its second half; the film's early scenes are a quite funny commentary on bland, middle-class suburban America and the insidiousness of mediocrity that it encourages, obviously aimed more at its adult audience than it is at the kiddy crowd.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that Pixar animation always looks slightly creepy when applied to human characters. The actors and animators do as much as they can to infuse the characters with warmth and to make them engaging, but they can't completely get around the fact that there's a plastic, lifeless quality inherent in digital animation that doesn't exist in its hand-drawn counterpart. But that's not a huge detriment here and doesn't prevent this film from being a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","The Incredibles is just one of the most incredible movie if you don't mind the stupid redundancy.<br/><br/>I had good hopes for it, and after Finding Nemo, it was very hard for The Incredibles to follow a film that would ignite such expectations. But, this really was beyond me.<br/><br/>The film is brilliant, it's a remarkable achievement, and I'm not talking about the animation or the technology, I'm talking about the extreme maturity and intelligence with which the film is narrated, as Nemo, Incredibles has above average character development, it surpasses many regular films, and within the genre, it surpasses Spider Man. Now, I'm probably going to get based, but Spider Man is no where near the brilliance of The Incredibles, it is an extremely entertaining film, with lot's of depth, in both story and character, the film is perfect, it fulfills all of it's aspirations and surpasses them.<br/><br/>Now, some have bashed the movie on the basis that the film takes heavy cues off Fantastic Four and Spy Kids, the answer, yes the film does have strong foundations from those two, but, neither of them on their better moments amount to what Incredibles has achieved, and besides, the whole point of the movie is that works within that genre, what GREAT genre movies do is they take a overdone and weary genre, give it a fresh, innovative and clever spin and turn it into a new level(similar to what Scorsese did with GoodFellas, don't get me wrong, I'm not comparing GoodFellas with Incredibles, I'm comparing the look towards the individual genres each films takes.) The Incredibles as all Pixar films cover all demographics, Incredibles has something for everyone, and those who don't find it funny, and find it too slow, well, Pixar never set out to do Airplane funny, and making fun of other stuff like Shrek is way too easy, Incredibles has it's share of laughs. And it's not too slow, it only takes it's time to build the characters, so that when the film takes a fast pace, it's not juts for the kicks, important things are at stake, characters are important. It's stupid to bash a film because it takes it'ts time to build it's characters, which seems a forgotten art in Hollywood this days(particularly action/adventure). The film not only is concerned on being exiting, explosive and entertaining, but that it has a logical and interesting story, with clearly defined characters.<br/><br/>To sum up, the film to my opinion raises the bar in not just animated cinema, but cinema all together.<br/><br/>On an extra note, the film has a superb use of music, reminiscent to James Bond soundtracks, very catchy, and used with incredible skill."

","The Incredibles is undoubtedly Pixar's most ""grown-up"" movie to date. It is also perhaps their most ""intellectual"" movie. By which I don't mean that previous Pixar movies were somehow stupid, but rather that The Incredibles, despite being more action oriented, is more a movie for the brain and less a movie for the heart - particularly compared to Monsters Inc, and Nemo.<br/><br/>Opening with a quick sequence of interview cuts with the three main super heroes Elastigirl, Frozone, and of course Mr Incredible himself The Incredibles thankfully avoids any kind of origin story for these people. No nuclear powered spiders or murdered parents here. These people just are super heroes. This is the time of super heroes at the height of their power and popularity. Mr Incredible, otherwise known as Bob, saves kittens, foils robbers, and generally does good deeds - all at the same time, and all whilst on the way to his own wedding. Only an obsessed fan boy (literally) becomes a fly in the ointment. Mr Incredible is at his prime, and he works alone.<br/><br/>Then everything in super herodom falls apart. People start suing the super heroes, the government picks up the tab, and the heroes are forced into an early retirement through a relocation scheme. Cut to some fifteen years later - no longer Mr Incredible, but now simply Bob, who works in insurance.<br/><br/>The movie takes its more serious turn here as it delves into the life of an unhappy Bob in full mid-life crisis mode. Bob longs for the old life. Out of shape and in a dead end job he pines for action, for the adrenalin rush, for the glory days. Married now to Elastigirl - Helen - and with three kids, Bob seems set for a life of mediocrity and all around normality. Whilst his friend Frozone has settled into the quiet life without longing, Bob listens to police radio waiting for his chance to do some good.<br/><br/>The super-children themselves are not deeply drawn. Violet is the shy young girl who lacks confidence and just wants to be normal, whilst Dash is the bored little boy who aches to show off all that he is capable of and resents being held back. Jak jak, the baby, takes a back seat - obviously. After all, how much character development can one do with a baby? Yet Jak jak gets his own scene stealing moments and emerges as something of a character in his own right.<br/><br/>Bob's big break comes with the appearance of Mirage, a mysterious and beautiful young woman who offers him the chance of a return to the good old times. Bob seizes the opportunity with all he has, like a starving man grasping at a twinkie, and for a while all is well in Bob's world. Again he is the happy, powerful, virile Mr Incredible.<br/><br/>Until he is captured by the movie's villain, Syndrome, on a Bond-esquire island full of gadgetry and henchmen.<br/><br/>Helen, and the kids, set off to rescue their father. Along the way, of course, the usual stuff happens, the family overcome their respective character flaws and the world is saved.<br/><br/>This is not to dismiss the movie at this point, but merely to avoid any further plot details. Even though The Incredibles works best before the island rescue it still works extremely well through the family heroics and the action packed climax. The imagery is wonderful, the action pieces well designed and thoroughly entertaining, and even the sly satire and occasional homage are subtle and clever.<br/><br/>For something inevitably tagged ""a kid's movie"" there are dark times - such as the discovery of a hero's skeleton in the caves, - and there are adult quips - such as the drinking games of the henchmen. One scene in particular comes across on two unsettling levels. Bob's discovery of Syndrome's computer, and hence the villain's past actions, comes across as both horrifying and yet strangely Pokemon-like disconnected at the same time.<br/><br/>Yet I'm left with the feeling there should be something just a little more. Perhaps it's the well-trodden path the children go through, or perhaps it's the feeling that although The Incredibles does everything technically extremely well it actually breaks little new ground in terms of story or character. The children especially ooze cliché, and the outcome of every single character's arc is never in doubt for a moment.<br/><br/>Mostly, though not completely, The Incredibles is somewhat lacking of an emotional core. There are occasional break thoughts here, particularly Bob's interaction with Helen, yet the movie does not fully engage. This is not so much a criticism, after all this is a super hero cartoon not Lost in Translation, but where Pixar's films are invariably emotionally engaging to have one this slight is mildly disappointing.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredibles offers an extremely entertaining time for children and adults alike, with enough smart moments and social commentary for those who want to see them. What it fails to offer is the emotional experience that Pixar movies are renowned for. 8/10"

"TheHumbleCritic","4","9","25","27 February 2005"," Flashy, but pretty ho-hum
","When one walks into a Pixar film, one can usually expect the sort of quirky animated cleverness that the studio has become known for in such imaginative fare like ""Toy Story 2,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Finding Nemo."" In those films, Pixar re-imagines and reconfigures the established. Sharks undergoing therapy for cannibalism, or an ant committing suicide by walking into a drop of water, are creative re-workings of what we see and dismiss everyday. It takes creative minds to come up with such amusing alternatives to what would normally not elicit a second glance from all of us, and most importantly, it is possible and most plausible only in the world of animation where talking fishes and bugs do not seem totally ridiculous.<br/><br/>Such imagination is absent with their newest feature, ""The Incredibles."" This movie's creative insight is that, well, superheroes really CAN have mundane lives. The film is visually gorgeous but thematically empty, a merely average film that has been raised to celestial levels for what many have labeled its animated ""realism,"" I'm guessing what most critics apocryphally mean when they notice shimmering wet hair or fluid body movements. Well, mimicking humans is not trailblazing Pixar's territory, but belongs first to the Squaresoft Pictures flop, ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within."" The second one is a terrible film as most over-inflated, sci-fi anime can be, but ""The Incredibles"" has escaped such criticism largely due to critics falling in love with its pastel color scheme and its fidelity to cartoonish humans with real features (like said hair) amidst an environ of real water, fire, trees, etc. If making everything appear so ""real"" was the goal, why not just shoot a live-action film with CGI superimposed and save us all the time, money, and lavish plaudits? <br/><br/>The fact is were it not for the CGI, this film's reportedly high-minded drama would not garner any year-end awards. As some other reviewers have pointed out, it's as cliché-ridden as can be, even falling upon the sitcom-like contrived plots such as a series of coincidences making a wife believe her husband is cheating on her, or the nerdy girl not fitting in with the cool crop at school, only to fit in and receive invitations from the future prom king at the end (the creators could have taken a lesson from this year's anti-conformity ""Napoleon Dynamite""). Most Pixar plots have been fairly simple with good messages, but what livens up nearly every story they have told are new takes on the humdrum. Turtles turned into stoner surfers in ""Finding Nemo,"" for example, while ""A Bug's Life"" is teeming with new versions of a collection of insects. The Incredible family's superpowers are supposed to substitute for this lack of creative imagination, but the abilities are not inventive themselves. Super strength, flexibility, speed, invisibility are all brilliantly conceived, but as wonders lack variety to the eye, and since the Incredibles' world is modeled on the human world, there is also no escape into the beautiful rendering of the ocean or of a blown-up microcosm like in other Pixar features. As hard as it may seem to imagine, this movie more than any other Pixar film could have been filmed in live-action, a cardinal no-no suggestion for any animated flick.<br/><br/>The decision to make the film a drama devoid of humor is also not a wise one; scenes that would normally be infused by amusing side-characters are filled with sidekicks there only to advance the plot. Edna as a creation, for instance, is mildly amusing but is a simple caricature of Bond movies and fashion designers, supplying useful gadgets but lacking the imagination of a true creation (and not parody) of a Mr. Potato Head or Heimlich caterpillar. Jokes are not as edgy and wry as a result, and while its insistence on a conservative moral might be fresh in today's left-Hollywood climate (i.e. Manchurian Candidate, Spartan), its beaten to the ground ad-nauseum by every character who gets a turn at dictating it to the audience.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" is not a terrible movie. Though uninspired, it's still technically marvelous animation. The story is initially amusing in points. The kitchen-sink drama is actually brutally honest, depicting family life (albeit superhero family life) at its most stultifying and completely routine, something very far from a traditionalist conservative message. There are even some good action scenes, especially when the speedy son discovers the true extent of his own superpowers. But maybe it's all that CGI, or a lack of original story, that made me consider ""The Incredibles"" more of a video game by its end rather than a feature film. The final boss battle could be straight from a platformer or role-playing game with one party of five unleashing attacks on one mechanical robot replete with attack points and weaknesses. By the final accounts, ""The Incredibles"" is really a very average movie, but has the potential to be an excellent video game. Take it from someone who plays them."
"pivic","2","11","33","12 December 2004"," Backlash, boring, prejudiced
","Stunning graphics! New ways to portray animated figures in cinema! Yep, Pixar have done it again. It's really amazing to see.<br/><br/>But. We have to see the very boring parts of the film, of which there are many.<br/><br/>Apart from this film containing part of the biggest backlash drabness since reading snippets from reality in Susan Faludi's ""Backlash"", I must say this: everything in this film has been done before.<br/><br/>The story and everything in it is plain ""Our Man Flint"" and James Bond. Everything that's shown in the film has been shown before, in non-animated films. And I find that a bit boring, don't you agree? ""We are Pixar! We have the ability to make any kind of film now, that we can do anything with computers, which means we don't have to spend a lot of money for props, expensive actors and film in impossible locations!"" So why, kind Madams/Sirs, are we brought re-hashed spy-stories? Pixar has the ability to give the audience the most fascinating computer generated graphics ever, so why not do that AND an interesting story with great characters? I think I know why. Money walks. What? Here: the crowd is obviously loving something they've seen big parts of before, just framed in another way, even more graphic than ever. It's true, I'm sorry. It's easier to mash something like this together than make a new ""The Godfather"", ""Fight Club"" or ""Seven Samurai"".<br/><br/>With ""backlash"" I mean the following, which is the worst about this film: female characters aren't allowed to be active individuals in this film. Read that sentence again, then move on. The males are the ones who make the decisions, apart from a couple of instances when the women do, instead of being passive, second rate characters. And this simply isn't acceptable. Why? Because I like films that are realistic, not thoroughly anti-feministic and prejudiced. And I will tell you why I feel this film represents just that.<br/><br/>When the darkly dressed, fringe-covering-most-of-her-face, shy and introverted daughter of the family is ""turned to the better"", this means she meets a boy who's so far shown her no interest at all, merely by suddenly wearing her hair in a pink tiara and dressing in ""girly clothes"", i.e. pink colours and a skirt. She's also passive, as is her mother: while the males in the family are the ones making the decisions, the strong, fast and moving ones, the women are merely stretchy, able to become invisible, able to protect themselves - not to attack. The little boy in the family can hit people, and kill them. Yeay! His big sister just turns...more girly. She hits a few bad guys, sure, but doesn't kill them. Her assailants fall unconscious as she turns invisible and hits them, while the little boy hits the living daylights out of a bad guy, finding out he actually likes to hit them, before his victim flies into a stone wall, dying in an explosion.<br/><br/>The men even lie and the women don't, but that's OK, because it's all good family fun. Of course.<br/><br/>I am not making the above up. See the film (without paying for it, preferably) and spew yourselves.<br/><br/>This is very much reminding me of the myth about lions. People think the male is the King Of The Jungle, when, in fact, the lionesses are the predators, catching the prey and making sure the families progress in every way. The males don't even hunt, as they cannot: the mane prevents them from running much. Still, the myth about them prevails. They're displayed as the Kings Of The Jungle while the female tends the cubs.<br/><br/>Sadly, this shows in a lot of ways in this film. The mom works at home. The man DOES work in a very boring environment, but, without spoiling a bit of the film, doesn't exactly do anything about the family situation except lie to his wife. For two months. And this is the ""woman of my life"", as he later calls her? This film reeks of disorder. I'm sorry, but of course women and men aren't exactly made out of merely two molds. It's just that this film, no matter how immensely important computer graphics-wise it may be, tries to put through that gibberish. Sad. It could have been immense. Will The Movie Machine churn out more of this garbage? Think critically."

The main characters are cookie-cutter, with the overused family of two parents, a girl, a boy, and a baby.

Jason Lee's voice work was excellent, as well. However, the story never really took off. I wanted more time spent on the children, giving me more details about their problems so that when they came into their own later in the movie, it would mean more. I didn't get it. Worst of all there was very little humor. In the past, Pixar has been known to have a good dose of wit in their movies. This one had almost none. Had I gone in knowing this was 99% drama, I probably would have been much less disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is still a pretty solid film.

"chakarlu","5","5","12","8 November 2004"," Mediocrity at its best
","Giving characters a plastic-like appearance might have worked for Pixar's previous Toy Story, but doesn't work in the context of superheroes trying to cope with real life. Mr. Incredible (aka Bob Parr) and family all look like action figures and don't mesh with the film's attempt to portray the hassles of real life. <br/><br/>In media and press releases, Pixar writers and animators have expressed a desire to tell unique stories rather than repeat some of the same themes. But apparently, that goal was never given a high priority since old James Bond and Powerpuff Girl elements are not only included for clever parody, but serve as pillars of the plot.<br/><br/>The Incredibles never draws audiences into the everyday life aspect, which any viewer can experience without the aid of a screen, nor does it draw the moviegoer into the comic book/superhero realm, which is more of a smash em' up, beat em' down stream of headache inducing action. Giving Pixar filmmakers credit that is due, it should be noted that the film, being filled with likable characters and voices actors, isn't a bad film, it simply promises more than it can deliver. The Incredibles manages to be a mediocre movie, while telling kids and adults to reach their full potential."
"bob the moo","Null","4","9","21 December 2004"," Great film but forgets who its audience is
","Fifteen years ago the world was a different place; superheroes moved among and were constantly acting to keep us safe from danger and crime. However when Mr Incredible saves a man from coming suicide, he is sued for doing so, sparking a series of lawsuits against other superheroes. With the Government picking up the bill and public opinion turning against them, the superheroes retire into normal life incognito. Now, Mr Incredible lives with this wife and kids as Bob Parr, working in an insurance office and spending evenings with his friend Lucius (formally Fro-Zone) pining for the old days of daring-do. So when a mysterious offer of work as a superhero comes up, Bob jumps at the chance; but is everything as it seems on the mysterious island? Having left it as long as possible before going to the cinema to see this film in order to avoid the place being full of children, and I timed it reasonably well with the cinema only having about 40 other people in there and only about 15 children. The film opens well with some good action scenes and setting the historical frame for the story we are to be told  the wonderfully convincing soul-destruction of an ""ordinary"" life. It paints this very well and uses it to get into a bigger story about Bob's loss of manhood and achievement that could have easily been about a middle-age realisation of the loss of youth as much as about as the glory days in regards superpowers. It is pretty adult and dark throughout and for me this is its main failing, in that it seems to forget that all the marketing for this thing has been fired at kids and most screenings will have very young children in it.<br/><br/>Other Pixar films have got the balance spot on, but here we have a film that could easily have been PG for content but also has surprisingly little to keep children engaged. Most of them in my screening were shifting around or just sitting bored, with only a few laughs to be heard throughout the whole film. The content and material is much more suited to older children and adults but they are never going to do that with a film that can get the kiddie dollar and the pester power so why it wasn't made more suited for them is beyond me. However this is only a weakness if you have kids in the cinema with you, without them there is a lot of funny stuff, clever stuff and well written characters to get into; I did really enjoy the story and even found the action parts to be very exciting and very well done.<br/><br/>Visually the film is great and Pixar have greatly improved their human characters  of course they are not photo-realistic but that is not the point. The backdrops seem set in a 1950/60's America of superheroes, although it is rather timeless. It references heavily to things like Bond, Fantastic Four and spy thrillers but it never turns into the sort of reference heavy joking that can (and I believe will) date so many animated features that live and die on the quality of their spoofs and in-jokes. The end credits are incredibly cool and I did wonder why they had saved such great artwork until then instead of the opening credits, unless it was to keep potential spoilers out of the front of the film. The characters are great fun and are very well written. Mr Incredible is a very human man who we feel for easily and the investment put into him covers the lesser job put in with his family. The film lacks the collection of good support characters that are often put in things like Toy Story etc but does have a great minor role in the hilarious Edna. Nelson does very well with the lead role; Hunter is impressive and even the children are pretty good even if Fox overdoes the ""all-American goodness"" aspect of Dash. Jackson has a much smaller role than expected but is still very funny but I must admit that I found Jason Lee and his character to be annoying and unengaging  although I suppose it doesn't matter so much.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very enjoyable film but it is not one that is aimed at children other than to make money out of them. The marketing may tell you it is but really the story, 95% of the laughs, the action and the design of the film all say that it is for older children and adults to really get the good out of  young kids will only like some bits and the noise, although I could see many being scared by it more than loving it. Well written, funny, exciting and consistently interesting for all sorts of reasons and yet another great film from Pixar."

","After Pixar's previous efforts The Incredibles may suffer by comparison. Yes the animation is wonderful and detailed but the storylne and script leave a lot to be desired.

The storyline concerns itself with individuals being proud of their talents and that everyone should try to become the best at what they excel in. This is wrapped together with what is at best a hackneyed spy or action movie storyline that is not going to win any prizes for originality.<br/><br/>This is not a bad film but by Pixar's standards is definitely not a great one."

","Right about now I'm thinking that there must be something wrong with *me.* After all, the world is saying that this is an 8.6 movie, and people are giving it 10s. And I thought it SUCKED.<br/><br/>The pacing is horrible. The first hour is positively boring, unfunny, and the action scenes are so fast that you can hardly tell what's going on. There were a few great moments, but not enough to make me really care about any of the characters. I was actually going to *walk out* because it was simply dull. But then every once in a while, something interesting would happen and I'd want to keep giving it a chance. <br/><br/>OK, so in the last 20 minutes or so, the story actually picks up. And by that I mean you can *follow* what's happening, because the pacing is better and not all crazy and frenetic. For a while the characters slow down and reflect on what's happening to them, and they seem to be real people. There's also some good (creative) action toward the end, and the villain's plot is the only truly well-crafted part of the story.<br/><br/>It's annoying that the humor attempts are mostly just cheap things that they throw in on the side (kid on big wheel) that have nothing to do with the story, or repetitive sight gags like Mr. Incredible accidentally breaking some household object because he doesn't know his own strength. Meanwhile, there are HUGE tracts of dialogue that are absent of cleverness, or just too fast, mumbled, or obscured by FX sounds.<br/><br/>I did not care for the design of this movie generally - often the characters' eyes were dark and flat. They did not have that shine in them, the living sparkle that would draw me in. While I sat there I thought about other animated films where the eyes seemed positively beaming with emotions, and here everyone seemed like a wind-up toy. Maybe I am just too ""old-school"" animation, but it seems like there is so much focus now on light and shading and detail of the surrounding scenes that the distinction and liveliness of the characters has been lost. <br/><br/>I loved The Lion King and the Toy Story movies as much as anyone else. I saw Shrek 2 three times. I also disliked Home on the Range, Treasure Planet and Atlantis for the same reasons the critics did.<br/><br/>But for some reason this movie just did NOT deliver for me. Bland script, uneven action, minimally sympathetic characters... Not to mention some rather annoying, obligatory add-in scenes like the goth daughter who is suddenly more popular at school and the cute guy asks her out, and Samuel Jackson's character who is totally undeveloped. <br/><br/>I also found it really weird that the villain did not have *ONE, single* humorous or clever line. <br/><br/>So apparently I'm in some 1% that disliked this movie. But be warned, people:<br/><br/>I was once like you. <br/><br/>One day you're going along enjoying all these movies, and then suddenly they all suck but no one agrees with you."

","This is without a doubt the worst movie Pixar has ever released. Normally a Pixar movie leaves you with a feeling of hope, warmth, SOMETHING other than frustration and disgust. Unfortunately, The 'Incredibles' didn't give us that luxury. Why? Let me explain.<br/><br/>First of all, the whole family dynamic is just annoying to me. You have a family of super heroes with two REALLY annoying children. And since they have super powers they can use those to be even MORE annoying. When I was a kid, I never said to myself 'man, I want to see kids in my movies' because even then I knew that kids were annoying in movies and shows a lot of the time. I have never seen the addition of kids to an idea EVER making it better (ala friends, ghostbusters, ninja turtles, how i met your mother) and all it did was put some children in precarious situations where you know they won't die because of a combination of it being Pixar and them being children. Also, did I mention they were annoying?<br/><br/>I was not a fan of what they did with the villain as well. So you're telling me that the family of superheroes that were born with their superpowers are the good guys, while the person who was born with none and had to work hard and invent things to become super is the bad guy. Nice job movie. Hard work is for chumps. Just be born special. That always irritated me. (also we have Mr. Incredible to thank for his creation in the first place)<br/><br/>Another stupid thing in this film is the watchmen like ban on superheroes. I never got how anybody enforces that. So you're basically saying that since the superheroes are forced to stop using their powers that all of a sudden the super villains are going to be like 'oh, well, i guess we have to stop now too.' no. of course they're not. They're going to go 'wow there's no more super heroes! Let's take over EVERYTHING' But of course this movie is too stupid to thank of that.<br/><br/>And of course, instead of having to rehabilitate the villain at the end with Mr Incredible having to take responsibility for his recuperation, nope, let's just kill him because that's easier and ties everything together in a nice little package.<br/><br/>With the exception of SLJ's character and the villain, nearly everyone annoyed me, especially with the 'noble' don't hurt my family mentality that we're supposed to feel sorry for him because we feel he's a 'good father' despite the fact that he couldn't control his anger nearly killing his boss and went off being a superhero behind his wife's back and nearly got them all killed. What a prince.<br/><br/>I will probably get minuses for this review but I don't care. If you like this movie, fine. But I cannot understand the love of this film and it frustrates every time someone says it is good. It's not. I wouldn't even put it on the low side of mediocre. All that being said, it's a 3 out of 10."

","THE INCREDIBLES is an incredibly popular Pixar computer animated action cartoon that made millions at the box office because it's an entertaining and funny romp about a family of super-incredible heroes.<br/><br/>Audiences can relate because the heads of the family (Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl--voiced by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter) really want to settle down and have normal lives in suburbia without having to resort to their superpowers to save the world.<br/><br/>But boredom creeps into their lives and the message of the film seems to be, if you have a gift use it. After years of suppressing his gift, Mr. Incredible gets lured into active service again and then the film really gets going.<br/><br/>Once the film shifts into action mode, there's an incredible amount of things to watch as the scenes go speeding by relentlessly in search of a new adventure at every turn. And when Mr. Incredible's family joins the search for his whereabouts when he's captured by his nemesis, the film lurches forward with even greater speed.<br/><br/>Apparently, audiences reacted very enthusiastically to this sort of crime caper action cartoon, animated in great style by Pixar. If you enjoy watching comic book heroes do their thing, you won't be disappointed in ""The Incredibles.""<br/><br/>Of course, it goes against the theory that the Disney studios kept in mind when making the first feature-length cartoon, afraid that too bright colors and too much fast action would give moviegoers a headache for a feature-length cartoon. ""The Incredibles"" defies that theory at every turn."

Sure it was a funny family film (which is uncommon and quite a feat), but should that put it over classic films such as the ones I just mentioned? I really don't think so. It is a good film, but not a great film, and does not deserve to be ranked among great films.<br/><br/>A good film, but overrated."
"Buddy-51","8","3","6","2 May 2005"," gorgeous animated tale
","The animated hit ""The Incredibles"" is a parody of superhero and James Bond movies sprinkled with cynical helpings of ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best."" This seems an odd sort of hybrid until one realizes that The Incredibles are really a crime-busting family made up of a dad named Bob (actually Mr. Incredible), a mom named Helen (aka Elastigirl), a daughter named Violet, and a son named Dash, each of whom comes equipped with his or her own superhero specialty.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, we see the family in full fighting regalia, battling criminals, rescuing the innocent, and earning accolades from the city's grateful citizenry. However, even a superhero isn't immune from the excesses of an overly-litigious society, and soon more and more of these superhero crime fighters begin to fall victim to law suits and out-of-court settlements. As a result, not only the Incredibles, but all the known superheroes are forced to withdraw from society, being sent to faraway corners to live out their lives in a sort of witness-protection-program-type anonymity. Safely ensconced in their suburban sanctuary, Helen wants the family to adopt a ""normal"" lifestyle, hidden away from the prying eyes of a judgmental society, but Bob is a superhero to the core and he cannot endure the stifling existence imposed on him by suburban domesticity. Thus, he spends most of his time sneaking around behind his wife's back, saving the world on his off-hours. When Paul finds himself in a spot from which even the great Mr. Incredible is not able to extricate himself, it's Helen and the kiddies to the rescue and the adventure really begins.<br/><br/>Although the humor in ""The Incredibles"" isn't as free-ranging and eclectic as it is in, say, the ""Toy Story"" or ""Shrek"" movies, the film still manages to generate a goodly number of laughs, primarily through the clever domestication of its superhero figures. Amidst all their battles with evil forces, the family still finds time for marital squabbles and sibling rivalry. But, rest assured, the time-honored themes of family unity and being true to oneself get plenty of play as well.<br/><br/>There's first rate voice-over work from Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Wallace Shawn et. al. But there's none better than Brad Bird (who also wrote and directed the film) as Edna 'E' Mode, a hilarious takeoff on elitist fashion designers who makes an indelible mark in the few scenes she's in. The film does suffer a bit from over length and the problem most action-oriented films have of loading on the special effects in the action scenes to the point where the characters and storyline tend to get lost in the shuffle. But that deficiency is more than made up for in the beautifully streamlined, high-tech look of the film which seems both state-of-the-art modern and a little bit retro at one and the same time.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" is a little less ingenious than the ""Shrek"" movies, but it has a beauty and charm all its own."
"Sinnerman","8","3","6","5 January 2005"," Oh Darling, nothing is beneathe me!
","I love it! The most entertaining movie I have seen all year.<br/><br/>With equal parts action, drama, humour and pathos, this is the best Pixar product since Toy Story 2 (I have to admit I didn't like Finding Nemo or Monster Inc). What a rare gem of a movie this is! Frankly, I have not been this viscerally thrilled by an ""action"" movie since the first time I saw Jurassic Park in the theatres 11 years ago. 2 hours flew by right before my eyes. But the real surprise is that I found myself responding to its quiet ""meandering"" moments too. What a feat of digital animation! Let me regurgitate my take now once more...with feelings; I can feel my pulse beat faster whenever the boy sprints around in the movie. I can feel my throat choking with cheers whenever the Chaplinesque stunts assault the screen. I can feel my mouth touching my ears whenever I see action-editing/ ""choreography"" done this successfully. I can feel my gut busting whenever Brad Bird say ""Darling"". I can feel my strings tugged whenever I soak in the astoundingly nuanced voice performances. I can feel for the movie because it celebrates neither mediocrity or superiority. It celebrates diversity, teamwork and the exponential power of synergy. This film's values are good and deep. Me like.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I can feel my heart soar when the year's best lines in cinema were uttered near film's end, ""I am always beneathe you, but nothing is beneathe me!!"" Say cheese! Pixar and the man behind Iron Giant - now thats a winning combination! Brilliant! Go watch it if you are one of the few who have yet to do so."

"Victor Field","9","3","6","30 December 2004"," ""Oh, come on! You gotta admit this is cool!""
","How worth it is ""The Incredibles""? Let's consider the evidence: <br/><br/>1. Writer-director Brad Bird has ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Simpsons"" on his CV, making him ideal to oversee an animated movie that's very funny and very thoughtful, while also delivering messages without ramming them down your throat or otherwise talking down to the audience.<br/><br/>2. This disproves the theory that animated movies of two hours' duration are exclusively a Japanese thing (the secret: all killer, no filler).<br/><br/>3. ""The Incredibles"" wears its influences well - the notion of superheroes having to hide their powers from a world that doesn't really appreciate them is very ""X-Men,"" but it never plays as a ripoff. ""The Return of Captain Invincible"" (also about a superhero coming out of retirement) also precedes this, but it doesn't handle its premise as well.<br/><br/>4. The movie has a very 1960s look, but it's not interested in going the Austin Powers route and sending the whole thing up - the movie's got humour, but it plays its core situation and the character relationships very straight.<br/><br/>5. As wonderful as ""Finding Nemo"" was, its title character was a bit nondescript; here all the main characters are fleshed-out humans, from Mr. Incredible to super-speedy son Dash, and even the villain.<br/><br/>6. The movie has action to spare, but it's the little twists thrown in that make it work (it's heartbreaking when Violet tries to activate her forcefield at a crucial time and can't).<br/><br/>7. ""Alias"" composer Michael Giacchino's excellent score deserves an Oscar nomination at the very least. (Walt Disney Feature Animation and DreamWorks please note the lack of songs.)<br/><br/>8. The voice work.<br/><br/>9. Elastigirl - the real leader of the family, and the most attractive animated crime fighter this side of Kim Possible.<br/><br/>10. ""When everyone's super, no one will be,"" the arch villain pronounces. And ""The Incredibles"" proves that we need the ""Shark Tale""s and ""Home On The Range""s of this world - just as the movie itself shows that we need special people to stand out from the mass but also need people who AREN'T superheroes, we need the dross to truly appreciate the gems.<br/><br/>This movie stands proud with the other Pixar movies, and also alongside recent non-animated superhero movies. It truly lives up to its name."
"domadilla","8","3","6","15 December 2004"," Quite simply the best super-hero movie yet!
","After a second a viewing, I am still in awe of the spectacle that is 'The Incredibles'. The animation is awesome (as can be expected of Pixar these days) and sets the benchmark for animation involving human characters. But graphics aside, it is the witty script and lively voice acting that make this film a joy to watch. Not to mention fabulous the way the 'supers' (lingo in the film for one with super powers) abilities are employed. Never before has a super-hero movie been able to show how the 'supers' can use their powers in arange of ways and in coordination with other 'supers'. It makes the actions so much more engaging and meaningful - the X-men producers and script writers should be taking notes.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone, simply, anyone. There is something in it for everyone. Kids will laugh at the slap-stick comedy, whilst adults will chuckle along at the meticulously formulated innuendos. The action is slick and the plot fast-paced. Grab the popcorn and enjoy the ride!<br/><br/>8/10"
"Psymon__","Null","3","6","10 December 2004"," Fun movie, but not that original
","I saw this movie a few days ago, and it was great. I went to the theater expecting an average movie, and I was far from disappointed.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible is one of the best superheroes in the world. His best friend is Frozone, and he's getting married to Elastigirl. However, when Mr. Incredible saves someone who doesn't want to be saved, he gets sued. And after that, pretty much every other superhero. As a result, all superheroes are forced to stop being superheroes. 15 years later, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl have 3 children (Violet, Dash & Jack Jack) and Mr. Incredible works at an insurance company. Frozone and Mr. Incredible still fight crime secretly in their civilian outfits, and one time Mr. Incredible is hired to return as Mr. Incredible.<br/><br/>The Animation was great, although the characters look a little cartoony IMO compared to other Pixar animations like Finding Nemo. Not a big deal though. I specially liked the animation of Elastigirl, when she moves across the rooftops in the beginning and when she hitches a ride on the monorail cart halfway.<br/><br/>One thing that was bothering me though, but it's not a big deal if you're not a superhero nut like me: There isn't a single original Superhero in the movie. I can understand that it's kinda the point to make a parody of existing superheroes, but the movie itself is great, they could have made their superheroes a little more original:<br/><br/>-The Incredibles: The Fantastic Four. A family fighting crime, and even most of their powers and personalities are the same. -Mr. Incredible: His name is obviously based on Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four. His powers and personality are based on the Thing (also FF) though. -Elastigirl: Mr. Fantastics Powers are stretching, like Elastigirls, even though she uses her powers more like Plasticman -Violet Parr: Invisiblity and Invisible forcefields are The invisible Woman's (Fantastic Four) specialty. -The Dash: His name and powers obviously come from the Flash, his personality is from the Human Torch (FF) -Jack Jack: Franklin Richards, Mr. Fantastic & The invisible Woman's son. No powers yet, but pretty powerful when he does get them. His powers are similar to the Human Torch's and The Demon. -Frozone: Iceman from the X-Men obviously, even the way he moves around (Ice skating on giant ice-roads he creates). -Syndrome: Dr. Doom, Mr. Fantastics former best friend and now the Fantastic Four's main enemy. Syndrome is Mr. Incredible's former fan and now main enemy. Doom and Syndrome both have no powers but a load of gadgets (made by themselves), and they both have a huge land (although there are actually living people in Doom's land). -The Underminer: he only has a small part at the end, but an ugly supervillain that lives underground is really similar to Mole Man, a Fantastic Four villain. -Gazerbeam: You only see his corpse, but a superhero that shoots beams out of his eyes is obviously a rip on Cyclops of the X-Men.<br/><br/>Nothing original about the movie, except maybe the story (even though it was really familiar), but like I said if you're not a superhero nut like me probably won't even notice. But I'm gonna be pretty upset if everyone's gonna say that the Fantastic Four ripped of The Ultimates when the FF movie is gonna be released next year."

","I don't know what to say or what to think... But still writing a comment, funny huh? I must say, I was glued to my chair the whole movie, and didn't want to miss a thing. But maybe I expected to much after movies like Finding Nemo. Where's the humor gone?<br/><br/>This movie is extremely difficult to understand for kids, let alone those who get a lousy translation when in countries like Indonesia. poor Indonesians who don't speak English....<br/><br/>The dialoge at times made you feel like being in the middle of some French Psychological Drama. Yet at times, I had fun, and I ended going home with a feeling of being satisfied for most of the time, but still some empty feeling in my stomach. Maybe I should have brought more snacks into the theater.<br/><br/>Pixar is trying hard, and at least they did a very good job picturing human beings in 3-D. Still, Dreamworks is WAY behind in their animation. But it is time for Pixar to think hard in what direction they should go, or they are going to loose public."
"dnlgg","8","5","13","2 December 2004"," Smart, Funny, but inconsistent tone and morality
","This is a very enjoyable movie, with a lot of smart and interesting twists to the superhero genre. however it feels like two separate movies. The first half is more serious and is like a cross between a superhero spoof and the idea of a superhero taken as reality. The problem comes when the movie switches from being something that questioned the genre and made it more real to something that no longer takes its characters seriously. By the end this is just a ride movie, not an action movie with consistent character development and a point that people could walk away with. now, i'm not talking about a sound-byte ""Message"" that was missing, because something like that actually was there, it was just betrayed by the ending. The family of the incredibles became people with extraordinary powers rather than truly special or extraordinary people. *Spoiler* The lack of responsibility towards the villain that Mr. ""incredible"" showed disproves that he is anything other than a man with superhuman strength. He is not a hero. His ego had a part in creating the villain. syndrome had free will and choice to do what he did and it couldn't be called Mr incredible's fault, but Mr. incredible does kill him in a very cavalier manner with no attempt to capture or rehabilitate him, as a hero, incredible is supposed to be better in character than regular people. The film also treated the killing of syndrome as a joke, with that cape thing. on the one hand something like that can be considered funny in a cartoonish comic book setting but not in a world that is supposed to be taken seriously as the world of the incredibles had been set up to be. This movie had great potential and is still excellent in many respects, but it is not the great film that many critics and audiences seem to think it is."

","All of you do realize these movies are made for little children whose imaginations fill in all the missing ingredients, like humor, drama, adventure. This one didn't have to much of anything, but tried everything, in case you didn't notice, thats a terrible mistake, like cold mountain, its tries to hard and does too little. I seem to recall a similar film this year that received terrible reviews for having too much action and not enough character, Van Helsing was incredibly much more enjoyable, it had action, humor, enough of a story to make it worth watching, and was entertaining, this one lacked all of that and is probably the longest cartoon ever. Although it is somewhat worthy of a look, its definitely overrated by everyone, even if you didn't like it, you probably still like it too much. For a few small laughs and some fancy computer action ill give it a 2 out of a 10, ign called it the best movie of the year, thats just goes to show they know about as much as Ebert, and i know that all you true movie fans out there hate him, open your minds next time you watch a film, remember there's more to a film then eye candy, which is all this is."

In the beginning of the movie, Dash feels like he never gets to use his powers and Violet is too shy to ask some guy out. Let me guess: By the end of the movie, Dash gets to use his powers to the fullest and Violet schedules a date with some guy we don't know or care about.<br/><br/>Mrs. Incredible... man, what an annoying bitch. How much more of a stereotypical soccer mom could she get? Seeing her on screen made me glad she wasn't my mom.<br/><br/>I guess if you've never been to a superhero movie before, this one will give you something new and what you haven't yet seen.

The voice cast consists, unlike many other animated movies out of actors that are not 'hot' at the moment. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are not exactly popular actors, that will draw lots of people to the theaters when you put their names on a poster. That's not why they were cast, they were just simply cast because they have great voices. I've always liked Holly Hunter's voice and accent and it was great to finally hear her in an animated movie. The rest of the cast mainly consists out of people that made their debut with this movie (Except for Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee of course.). Kudos to that, I'm sure they could had attached some big 'hot' names to this project but they went for quality and the best instead of for the most popular.<br/><br/>OK the story ain't exactly anything special but the main characters and fun feeling of the movie compensates for this.

","In my opinion this movie represents no progress in the history of modern animation movies in which computer technique replaced drawing technique. This story could be made and told with real actors instead of animated characters. In fact we don't see here any anthropomorphic animals, fairies or witches just only normal people living in a city of the present times though some of them endowed with supernatural powers whose origin is never revealed. No poetry or lyricism either just only adventure and violent fighting with the usual common special effects computers can produce even in movies performed by real players. But even these effects are not especially creative or more original than those we have seen in a lot of other recent animation movies. Do the people who made this movie think that animated characters can portray human emotions or feelings than human actors whatever the former's facial expressions and bodily movements may look human? When they are well done we like them just because they seem human and not because they are better expressed then by real actors and actresses. Of course the only advantage is that animated characters can be 100% shaped by his creator in a way that no movie director can make with human players who always have their own personalities. But this is precisely what we like to see: a human player putting in the acting something of his or her own personality and not acting like a created robot. Well for those who like this kind of movie they won't be disappointed after all since the movie has got enough action and enough thrilling scenes to make it fairly enjoyable."

It's like watching a slightly better Saturday morning cartoon movie with a way higher budget. There just didn't seem to be any good emotional depth to this movie. The whole movie is about a family with super powers dealing with family issues while fighting the bad guys. Yeah, most super hero movies is about the hero fighting agains the bad guys, but in this the whole thing felt generic. I remember first watching this in theaters and not getting much out of it. I was actually more bored than entertained. The 3D animation was pretty good when it came out, it's developed by Pixar after all. But besides the good animation when this movie came out, that just seems like it's all that is going for this movie. It's not a bad movie, it's actually worth a watch in my opinion.

When I go to see a kid's movie, especially a Pixar one at that, I come in foremost expecting a fair amount of comedy, but with excellent character development and whole hearted emotion. No to mention a good score is a must. This film just tried too hard to be an actual action flick. It seemed to forget that it is, after all, a family movie. Not for the fact that it was too gruesome or something, come on, its Disney but where were the laughs? For the longest time in this drawn out film I was bored with it all. If I want to see a superhero I will actually go see one, not this! Also, I was rather surprised sometimes at the not-so-subtle sensuality at times.<br/><br/>The plot, something Pixar usually stands out for amongst the wannabes, falls incredibly short. Syndrome killed off hundreds of heroes, to perfect his little doomsday droid so he could build himself a utopia of superheroes like himself. Eh, decent at best, but the main problem was the cast, aside Mr. incredible. Everyone else aside him, and I guess Syndrome, were left completely undeveloped. Unlike in ""Toy Story"", ""Bug's Life"" and ""Finding Nemo"", where you left the theater with a sense of awe, wonder and feel-goodness, I just left this one with ""blah"".<br/><br/>In the words of ""Finding Nemo"": ""What a pity."""

","Animated movies are tricky to make. You have to write a great story that is compatible with animation. Then you need good animation. Lastly, you need the right kind of voice actors for your characters. As of late, the CG-animated movies have been flying into theaters and have been doing really well. This movie far above all the Shrek's, Ice Ages', and all of the other contenders. This movie is incredible.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is Disney/Pixar's latest achievement in CG-animation. The story follows a family of real super heroes. Mr. Incredible or Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Elastigirl or Helen (Holly Hunter) have three children. There is Dash, Violet, and baby Jack-Jack. Jack-Jack is the only one without a super power at the moment. The others have some interesting talents to compensate. There is Mr. Incredible's astounding strength, Elastigirl's ability to stretch to mind boggling lengths, Dash's lightning quick speed, and Violet's cloaking ability and the power to create force fields. The problem with their powers is that they cannot use them due to a ban of all super powers back before the family was together. All super heroes were forced into retirement and kept secret with relocation and the government making sure they stay hidden. But all of this is about to change.<br/><br/>When a menace in the jungle rises up, Mr. Incredible is contacted by a secret agency to remove the problem after being spotted on saving people with his buddy Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson). Mr. Incredible's feels that this is just the jump-start for superheroes to make a comeback. What he doesn't know is that his past is about to catch up with him.<br/><br/>This isn't just an ordinary CG-animated film. This film was nominated for four Oscars, winning two for Best Animated Film and Best Achievement in Sound Editing. It was also nominated for Best Achievement in Sound and even Best Original Screenplay which is quite an honor. Obviously, this means that not only was the animation great and technical aspects good, but the story was good enough to contend with live-action movies like Eternal Sunshine or the Spotless Mind (won Oscar for Best Original Screenplay), The Aviator, Hotel Rwanda, and Vera Drake. This movie was a contender with the ""big boys"". This is a huge step for animated movies of all kinds.<br/><br/>Along with the story and the awards, there is a great cast of vocal actors. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible making him sound macho, tough, and also concerned about his family. Hunter is flawless as his wife who's worried that her family is slipping farther apart. Jackson is funny as Frozone and Jason Lee gives his voice to Syndrome and makes him quite convincing.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a must-see movie and should be in everybody's collection. This movie is above phenomenal and vent way beyond my expectations. Who expected this to top Finding Nemo? The Incredibles is an instant classic. Super hero movies will be around for a long time, but none will be like this."

","Disney's imagination and Pizar's awesome animation techniques combine once again to produce another slice of fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is faithful to the superhero genre, albeit with a tongue in cheek humour that operates on several levels beneath the simplistic yet effective storyline. With plenty of laugh out loud moments and some more subtle humorous undertones, the incredibles has enough to entertain most of us.<br/><br/>Although the Incredibles lacks the charm and sentiment of Finding Nemo, it makes up for it with action and excitement, and it's a different movie experience. This is the action movie of the animation genre.<br/><br/>8/10 recommended to anyone who enjoys Disney/Pixar productions, it's not the best, but it's up there."

","This is more of the good stuff we have come to expect from Pixar. It has memorable characters, funny dialog, and lots of action. In the movie, superheroes have all been forced to retire due to liability issues. Their super-battles did so much damage that society has decided to battle evil the old-fashioned way. Mr. Incredible and Elsatigirl try to make a go at ""normal"" family life and forget their super-ness. However, Mr. I cannot let go of the old days, and his longing is manipulated by an evil genius to perfect killer robots. Soon, the whole family must emerge from normal life and use their super powers to bring down the bad guy. Thrilling action sequences and witty dialog ensue.<br/><br/>If you want to find something wrong with this film, the only obvious flaw is that it is formulaic in plot and the characters are recycled from some comic book or another (in fact, the three quarters of the family is very similar to Marvel's ""Fantastic Four"": a strong man, a stretchable person, a girl who can turn invisible and create force fields).<br/><br/>An added bonus to this film are the philosophical nuggets it throws out. There is an obvious message that one should be true to one's self, instead of trying to conform to society. More subtle is the constant barbs against normal people the superheroes make. They bridle against the mediocrity that they are expected to imitate. The bad guy was not born with super powers, but made himself super through his hard work and inventive genius. The bad guy goes so far as to threaten to provide the world with inventions that will give all people super powers. Mr. Incredible opines that if all people are super powerful, than nobody is super.<br/><br/>What does it mean? Do the Incredibles represent old inhertied wealth, despising the crassness of the nouveaux riches bad guy? Is it better to simply be born with advantages, or to create one's own opportunities?"

","I am not the biggest computer generated movie fan there is, but I have to hand it to Pixar, they made one of the best movies of 2004 with this hit ""The Incredibles"". In fact, of all the movies I saw last year the only one I rank ahead of it is another super hero movie ""Spider-man 2"". Of course, I enjoy super hero flicks so they had that going for them. This movie centers around a super hero forced to live an ordinary life after certain problems arise during a rescue of a person falling from a building and a train accident. The super hero (Mr. Incredible) isn't adjusting to life as an ordinary guy to well. He keeps helping those in need even at the risk of losing money for his company. I found this trait most endearing, because it showed he was not in the biz merely for the glory, but that he truly wants to help people. So much so that he goes out one night a week with his old super hero buddy ""Frozone"" and they stop some crimes. However, when Mr. Incredible gets an invitation to go to an island and do his super hero thing he leaps at the opportunity. Eventually, this leads to his capture and the rest of the family must come to the rescue. Every aspect of this film was great, I loved that this film was actually rather long as it is one of the rare animated movies that really has a chance to develop a good story. You aren't going to be to surprised by many things, but here you just do not need to be surprised. The voices are all great headlined terrifically by Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter. Good laughs, good action, and an all around good movie are awaiting you in this little treasure. I especially liked Dash's sprint through the forest. If I had any complaints it might be that I wish Samuel L Jackson's character Frozone was in it a bit more."

","An unqualified ""we liked it"" for the movie, ""The Incredibles."" It opens with pseudo-newsreel interview footage with the three main characters to show, as the writer/director tells it, the human side of these characters before we see them in wild action. This is a comic book movie, in a time when there are very many superheros, and it focuses on one of them, Mr. Incredible, also known as Bob Parr in his street identity. The animation is superb, the script is superb, the voice-acting is uniformly superb. Especially Craig T. Nelson as Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as Helen Parr/Elastigirl, Samuel L. Jackson as Lucius Best/Frozone, and the one I think was the very best, Jason Lee as Buddy Pine/Syndrome. Saw it on DVD, second disk has many extras.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. In opening sequences we see Mr. Incredible in action, saving a cat, then stopping robbers with the uprooted tree, saving a man from suicide, and keeping a commuter ""el"" train from falling through a hole made by a bomb, all on his way to his wedding. But newspaper headlines tell us citizens begin to sue the various superheros, costing the government much money, so they are put in the superhero relocation program, where they are expected to become regular citizens. <br/><br/>The opening of the movie has Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl getting married, and we cut to 15 years later, Bob Parr is working as an insurance salesman, but once a week he and Lucius Best go ""bowling"" but in reality are in a car monitoring police radio, just itching to get back into saving people. The grown up Buddy Pine has become Syndrome, out to destroy all the old superheros so he, himself, could become the superhero everyone worships. So on a remote island Mr. Incredible ends up, fighting for his life, when his wife and two children (boy is very fast, girl can become invisible and also generate force fields), where they all team to defeat Syndrome's plan."

However, the storyline allowed great characters to develop, the animation was top notch, and the lines were very, very funny.

","The only thing that prevents THE INCREDIBLES from being the movie of the decade is the fact that Pixar or Brad Bird will inevitably top it within the next five years. This movie is a triumph on all fronts; it's so absorbing you hardly notice the flawless animation, which is nonetheless stunning. Almost a century of cartoons have led up to a moment of this kind of sophistication. The movie works, however, because it overwhelms its medium. It may be the CITIZEN KANE of toons. I waited for this movie over a long period of time and expected it to be absolutely grand. I still feel that I underestimated it.<br/><br/>Bird is more than likely the finest director working in animation today, and he's got some stiff competition. On his first feature, THE IRON GIANT, he fused a larger-than-life fantasy story and all the streamlined beauty that came with it into a human drama that could invite both wonder and tears.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Pixar has become not only the finest animation studio to exist since the peaks of Disney and Warners but almost a modern Selznick International -- a mark of quality recognized like few other production companies, to the point that the Pixar label now probably means as much as (if not more than) the Disney logo on all their product. The Pixar touch is wide-ranging; they've done perfect comedy in TOY STORY and MONSTERS INC. and offered a brilliant adventure film with A BUG'S LIFE. They are best exemplified by Andrew Stanton's FINDING NEMO, a celebrated feature that brought wide-eyed wonder back to the multiplexes.<br/><br/>Combine Bird with Pixar and you knew you had a must-see picture. The shocker is just how far Bird carried the studio, and vice versa. Dreamworks, Fox, and Disney's in-house animators are right to live in fear. Not only is this movie the most monstrously entertaining thing to come along in ages, not only does it treat its audience with respect while still commanding awe, it takes a million risks and gets away with it because of its intelligence, conviction, and good humor. The cold emptiness in Bob's eyes when he holds Mirage by her neck after he's been crushed by what he thinks is an inconceivable loss... we've never seen this in a cartoon (at least, an American cartoon) before, and we've never really seen it done with such subtlety and excitement anywhere.<br/><br/>As in THE IRON GIANT, Bird tells a big story -- superheroes making a comeback -- then throws us into the human element, with some highly adult scenes and a comic wisdom that never, EVER stoops to the ""faux-hip"" humor common in other animated features. It's a movie with an underlying seriousness about its own craft. The comedy is knowing and warm, the drama intense and involving, the action as riveting as you'll ever see in any live action film. All of its ingredients have been enlivened with a sense of beauty and charm that spit in the eye of the prospect that cartoons don't matter. All that matters is brilliant storytelling and movie-making, and THE INCREDIBLES is the real thing. Pixar and Bird have another classic on their hands -- easily their best to date -- that one-ups nearly every other animated feature made so far. Long live them both."

","Disney Pixar animations have delivered once again. To be honest I often wonder how these animated movies can live up to the hype created during their years of production. Toy Story did it, Shrek did it and, oh yeah, Shrek 2 did it as well. The Incredibles was different to these films. This movie is yet another superhero film, yet in animation style, and hence not only had to compete with previous computer animation films but also the Supermans and Batmans that came before it.<br/><br/>The story begins in a fictional city where superheroes are just that, heroes. Soon the town is unhappy with the heroes efforts, lawsuits are being filed against them, and so superheroes are forced to assume their secret identities. Mr. Incredible along with his wife Elastigirl are forced to live normal lives and bring up 3 children, Violet, Dash and JJ. Mr. Incredible, frustrated with his insurance job seeks to find a challenge, a way to utilize his super strength, and so the trouble begins I must say that I was impressed with the films adult wit and humor, once again in line with that of films such as Shrek, and this heightened my interest during some of the film's duller moments.<br/><br/>In my opinion the movie went for half an hour longer than necessary, dwelling on the ""boring"" lives of the superheroes and frankly leaving the action until the end of the picture, by which time half of the audience had fallen asleep.<br/><br/>Despite this one drawback (yet not a small one) the film was funny, graphically awesome and all-round entertaining, a fantastic family film that all can enjoy.<br/><br/>Rating 7.5"

","You can't expect anything less than top quality from Pixar, and with The Incredibles, they certainly deliver.<br/><br/>The main issue I had was the simplistic style. If you've seen Finding Nemo, you'll know that it's full of subtle jokes and references to popular culture, something that is almost entirely absent in The Incredibles. It's those subtle jokes that keep adults interested in a movie like this. Of course there are tons of references to comics and their superheroes, but these are inaccessible to the general viewer.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is also lacking in verbal humor compared to Nemo. It's disappointing to watch The Incredibles and wonder where the jokes are, once you've seen what Pixar's capable of.<br/><br/>Following a general trend in Pixar movies, the graphics are a step up from Finding Nemo, which showcased the Pixar team's skills at simulating water and its interaction with light. The Incredibles showcases their particle effects; i.e. explosions, dust, etc. There certainly are rather a lot of explosions. The Incredibles is eye candy all the way through, but primarily to someone who knows how to judge computer graphics (as I do). The graphics aren't stunningly beautiful like in Nemo, but they are very technologically advanced.<br/><br/>The action sequences are outstanding, in particular the sequence on the island with all the family members. Their superpowers complement each other very well, to combine into a very satisfying and enjoyable sequence.<br/><br/>All in all a good movie, worth seeing. Can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike (but be warned there are a LOT of explosions), just don't expect the high sophistication and sheer graphical beauty of Finding Nemo."

It is a perfect complement to the wave of superhero movies we have coming out in the last few years, validating the goodness of the virtuous heroes and also poking fun at them (the whole bit about the costumes and what could go wrong with them was absolutely hilarious). It is one of the best of the year and clearly the best animated movie of the year."

What little there were wasn't objectionable. The kids weren't annoying. Thank heaven the baby's role was kept to a minimum. The soundtrack is totally original. Some cues are reminiscent of a Bond film, but sounds nothing like a Batman or Superman film. The music is all over the place. Buy the soundtrack and listen to Track 9: Kronos Unveiled.

","First of all, no spoilers in this review. Well, one... watch for the kid on the tricycle. This was AWESOME, the best animation I have ever seen, except for Toy Story (which will always be my favorite Pixar film, unless something really amazing comes out). I LOVE the James Bond-style music, the sly asides to films and cartoons like Dr. No, Star Wars and The Simpsons, and everything else about this film. I have read other reviews here that chide the film for ""copying"" scenes from Return of the Jedi (for instance); what those reviewers somehow missed is that a large part of this film's reason for existence is HOMAGE. This IS all the childhood cartoons I watched on Saturday morning, and James Bond, and the comics, Star Wars, Johnny Quest, et cetera. It must reference those to succeed, and this it does very well. Great art takes what has gone before and presents it again, on a higher, sublime, synergistic level. That is what The Incredibles accomplishes. I think I reviewed this once already, in fact, and I've seen it twice now too! That shows my appreciation of this film as I rarely pay to see a film two times. It is a little long and not for 6-year-olds (there's some fairly serious violence). Still, five stars out of five!"

That was not because the characters didn't look 'entirely' human, but more because it was clear that they possessed human qualities; even though most of them were indeed super heros, who were delighted by life and did not abuse it. ""I'm alive!"" (Dash, after one of his near death experiences!) I felt that way too after watching it. I laughed so much. Edna 'Mode' ('Fashion' en francais)was the directors voice... loved it.

I believe that even if this movie was made to entertain, it also was made thinking of all kind of persons, not only children but adults as well, maybe some parts of the movie will not appeal to the little ones but at the end, it will be a great entertainment for children and adults as well. Each of the characters is well developed and most of them are smart in their own way and very fun to watch.

","It mirrors real life events. No, really. I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>I scanned the user comments to see if anyone else noticed this, but stopped after the first two pages of comments (Boy! This created a response.)<br/><br/>I should introduce myself as an avid comic book reader. And comic historian. So I paid attention to the timeline.<br/><br/>As I recall, the opening sequence occurs in the last years of the 1940s. At this point, superheroes are incredibly popular, at an all-time high, swinging from rooftops, saving the day... and then they get sued. Public opinion turns against them. A book, ""Seduction of the Innocent"", is published. The supers are limited in what they are allowed to do. (And yes, in every word after ""1940s"" I'm referring to our world.) They were considered too sexual, or violent, or frightening for children. Those who survived the purge became more ""silly"" (Not saying the stories weren't good, just that they weren't serious.) Only five super-hero characters enjoy continuous publication: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Green Arrow (these last two due to ""Piggy-backing"" on the other heroes' titles) While every other superhero character disappears into the background... until 1960, when the ""Silver Age"" of superhero comics began. One of these breakthrough series was the Fantastic Four, featuring two characters from the Golden Age (Human Torch and the Thing), and consisting of a real ""family"" of superheroes. (Mr. Fantastic married Invisible Girl, Human Torch was her brother. The Thing was Mr. F's longtime best friend and basically brother-figure.) <br/><br/>As far as I can see, it was out of these basic concepts that ""The Incredibles"" was born. A family of Supers emerging at the dawn of the 1960's. ""What would it be like if this had happened to real Superheroes? What if the world, in effect, told the Super-people to ""Go away?"" Well, this film fills in that period, devoid of believable heroes, and how they returned. <br/><br/>And it tells a dang good mid-life crisis story in the midst of all this.<br/><br/>And takes potshots at James Bond, to boot. (Also a 60's staple.)<br/><br/>As for the commenter who mentioned that there weren't ""in-jokes"", (and liked that fact, so I'm not intentionally trying to burst your bubble, but...) well, there's a lot of them. It's just that they're fairly behind-the-scenes for the most part, but one of the most direct references was the appearance of (a version of) the MOLE MAN! at the end. (For those not familiar with Mole Man, he was the very first villain that the FF faced, in Fantastic Four #1.) Yep. Okay, I'm done now.<br/><br/>All in all, an amazing movie, with a completely different view if you know your comics history.<br/><br/>10/10."

","I praise Pixar for bringing animation films to a totally new level. It never ceases to amaze me how they roll out products that continue to amaze a wealth of generations and backgrounds, while somehow bringing them all back on the same page for a wonderful night out that is sure not to disappoint.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a film that is surprisingly multi-faceted, striking chords in ways that I didn't even expect. The plot is simple: Mr. Incredible, a superhero who is all about glamour and power back in the days when superheroes were normal in everyday society (there's an interesting thought for you...) is forced to retire when he gets sued because he injures a man trying to commit suicide by grabbing him by the neck when saving him. Sounds like such a modern day dilemma.<br/><br/>As a result, not only is he forced to retire, but the government officially shut down the superhero business permanently. As a result, to save the numerous superheroes who basically lost their jobs, they're granted amnesty and forced to relocate and mesh in everyday life. After this 'tragedy,' we join Mr. Incredible who is now married to his superhero wife Elastigirl, and now has to live life with three kids, a dead-end job, and a mid-life crisis seemingly so depressing that makes me feel sorry for him as a young adult!<br/><br/>But, that's all I will share with you. With it's recognizeable Pixar trademark action sequences, as well as its relation to humanity and the values we hold dear such as family and normality (this is the first Pixar film to portray humans), the Incredibles surprisingly delights for kids and adults. The kids may miss some of the deeper themes embedded in this film, but the adults should pick them up real easily, with the kids enjoying more of the action sequences especially out of the kids in the Incredible family.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a great night out, give the Incredibles a try!"

","I have mentioned in some of my other Pixar reviews about memories which I have of watching them constantly as a child, but The Incredibles might be the most nostalgic film of all time for me. I was eight when it came out, and it's one of the first films I clearly remember seeing in the cinema. I also really loved the PlayStation 2 game for The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Whilst The Incredibles doesn't quite hit me on the same level as some of Pixar's other films, like Finding Nemo or Toy Story 3, and it lacks the emotional punch which those films carried, it contains such a fun narrative and it's always a complete blast to watch.<br/><br/>Pixar always manage to create three-dimensional and fleshed-out characters, and that's no different in The Incredibles. It contains relatable themes which will hit adults much harder than it will for the children, but they wrap them in such a delightful adventure that it's fun for the whole family to watch.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this is an animated film, Syndrome is one of the best villains we have ever seen in a superhero film. The writing and direction are impeccable, and I have no idea why they waited fourteen years to release a sequel.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredibles isn't my favourite Pixar film, but it's always extremely fun to sit down and watch, and it contains such a fun take on the superhero genre which is so popular in today's environment.<br/><br/>SCORE: 92%"

","The Incredibles creates an exciting world where superheroes have been oppressed and tells the story of a family of superheroes trying to maintain a cover in suburban life.

And following in the footsteps of Finding Nemo, it also has humour on a similar level.<br/><br/>Also, for it being a kids' movie, I actually didn't see the plot twist coming.

","A grand superhero animation<br/><br/>This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is an animated superhero movie that premiered in 2004. The movie is directed by Brad Bird, produced by John Walker, written by Brad Bird, and stars Craig T. Nelson, and Holly Hunter. The movie is about a superhero family that must hide their identities after public opinion turns against the superheroes.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a great movie that showcases how well character and story can be blended in an animation. There are many things that this movie does well and it blends incredibly well. The movie blends its story, action, and character development all in one great package. The movie mainly follows Bob Parr aliasing as Mr. Incredible played by Craig T. Nelson. This character is the central focus from the audience. He is a great character for the audience to follow and we see how he wants to make superheroes more popular again.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie are incredible. They make for an awesome experience if the audience is only watching the movie for the visuals alone. The family's superpowers are in great display here and it is well directed and produced. The production quality is top-notch in this movie and it is true of Pixar movies in general.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly enjoyable. The only downsides to the movie is that for fans of superheroes, there is not much new in this story. The movie features the cliches of the superhero genre. The movie almost plays it straight with how superheroes have to deal with society. The movie does not offer any deconstruction and offers a simple story to the movie. This is fine for any audience that does not want anything difficult to follow.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'The Incredibles'.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

"educallejero","9","0","0","14 July 2019"," You can't just stop being mature at some point in the movie...
","So. The presentation of the characters and the themes presented about normal human problems (midlife crisis for the ""Family Dad"" losing his youth and/or masculinity with a meaningless job; the ""mother"" that gave up everything personal to raise the children; socially awkward teenage
uncomfortable with what she is; little kid learning the responsibility and dangers of his powers/virtues) is awesome.
Maybe even a bit too long? I loved it.<br/><br/>After that, it gets into the story, the Syndrome (villain) character and the other overall theme: exceptionality. This movie reaffirms that some people are just better than others (which, yeah true I guess?), and every effort to try to make life and rules similar for everybody, is bad (socialism/communism is bad).
As a leftist, I do not agree with the movie, but what they want to communicate, they do and perfectly.<br/><br/>My problem is with the characters towards the end. When the 3rd act starts, all the nuanced characterization and matured reaction of every human, is thrown out of the window.
Characters do stuff and the movie never even comes close to make them ponder with what they did. That wouldn't be such a big problem if earlier in the movie, characters reflect on their decisions or think before they act.<br/><br/>One example: Mr. Incredible has the chance to do something to try to get the job done, but it is immoral. He doesn't do it, showing that he is, in fact, a hero that deserves the special treatment he asks (and the movie asks) for. Later in the movie, he just does that immoral act, and while totally justifiable, the movie acts like it was nothing, making the earlier scene totally irrelevant, because then, our hero is good because we say it's good, not because of his entire characterization. Anyways. Great movie, but there are some really small things here and there like this."

","Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired ""Shark Tale"", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with ""The Incredibles"". And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.<br/><br/>First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.<br/><br/>Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.<br/><br/>Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.<br/><br/>Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended"

","It's great movie with great action, dialogue and animation. This perfected hair and skin rendering. The story's about a superhero named Mr. Incredible and his struggles of living in a world where superhero's are no illegal. Wanting to relive the glory days and make enough money to provide for his family he agrees to work for an enigmatic company that may have a hidden agenda.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, his family have to cope with him gone. Elastigirl has to balance work and raising her 3 kids Dash, Violet and the baby Jack-Jack. Soon it becomes apparent that it may take a family of superhero's to save the day. What I like about this movie's the animation and the sense of humor.<br/><br/>The characters look like 2D cartoons rendered in 3D. They have well defined personalities. Bob's a bumbling, frustrated yet well meaning father, Helen's an uptight yet loving mother, Dash's a busy, energetic boy and Violet's a shy, moody introvert. The humor pokes fun at superhero's and suburban life as a whole. It also has some pretty interesting messages like the villains you see on tv are nothing like the ones in real life.<br/><br/>Another is be careful who you treat because they may be your enemy before you know it. In this case a once overzealous fan becomes the main antagonist named Syndrome(Jason Lee). He's an interesting villain. With that being said this's a great movie. One of Pixar's best. I highly recommend you check this one out."

","The early 2000s were the days where superhero movies were just coming into there own and disney pixar were deciding a superhero movie would be a great idea and in a time where some of the superhero movies were cringy and ok at best this is one that gets underlooked as a superhero movie and even now it still holds up as a aninmated action/spy thriller/superhero movie but it's also a detailed look at a American family who happen to have super powers and it can change the entire family dynamic.
the cast is Craig T. Nelson Bob Parr / Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter Helen Parr / Elastigirl, Samuel L. Jackson Lucius Best / Frozone, Jason Lee Buddy Pine / Syndrome, Dominique Louis Bomb Voyage, Spencer Fox Dashiell 'Dash' Parr, Sarah Vowell Violet Parr and Brad Bird Edna 'E' Mode. Growing up watching this movie these voices of these actors sticks with me and the preformaces one is because i watched this movie way to much as a kid and the other reason is beacause well the performances are just incredible no pun intended so the entire cast just can't be replaced because i strongly connect growing up with hearing there voices as a chracter that i enjoy watching on screen.
The Incredibles is well just amazing the way that it becomes a commentary on the family dynamic with a loving but sometimes strained marrage the social awkward teenager trying to fit in the younger boy who is just filled to the brim with energy and obviously a baby doing baby things and they do a great job with adding things like super powers and it can change the dynamic and make it 50% worse than it already is. Also Sydrome is such a great villian all of his actions become so justifible when you realise what he went through and then you understand that he was just a troubled boy who wanted to be a superheo when he was told he retaliated like a child because deep down he was still a child because that was taken from him.

Outlawed and retired from his prime as a superhero, Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is frustrated with his dull job and, though he loves them, his family, despite their powers, aren't providing him with the outlet he's looking for. He's provided with another opportunity for greatness when offered the chance to takedown an experimental robot that's loose on a tropical island.<br/><br/>
I never particularly loved ""The Incredibles"", I'm not sure why so I was hoping this repeat viewing might clear it up. Visually it's not aged particularly well. The faces of the characters are lacking definition and plasticy and though the ice, fire and explosion effects are decent, water and wetness is not as well done. Vocal performances are good throughout and the future/sixties vibe works pretty well.<br/><br/>
Storyline wise its ok, but it does take quite a while to get started. There aren't that many genuine laughs though but the action picks up once the whole family make it to the island.<br/><br/>
I do, in retrospect, prefer it to its sequel but in terms of both the superhero genre and the standards of animation now, its light years behind something like ""Into The Spider-verse"". Of course, without ""The Incredibles"" and its massive success, we probably don't get these subsequent films."

","When Mr. Incredible, aka Bob Parr (Nelson), catches a jumper who doesn't want to be saved, he opens the door to a wave of legal compensations that puts all superheroes out of business and into a relocation programme. Years later, Bob and Helen - formerly Elastigirl - are trying raise a 'normal' family when they receive a mysterious call for help.
Writer-director Brad Bird has been shopping his cartoon riff on comic books around Hollywood for nigh on ten years. During that decade, a digital revolution has sucked the lead from the pencils of traditional animators. Bird, who earned his stripes as a key member of The Simpsons' creative team and gave The Iron Giant a defiantly lo-fi sheen in 1999, may once have intended to hand-draw his superhero family, but it's no surprise that, once the 3D-CG era dawned, the director was himself drawn to Pixar Studios.<br/><br/>If it ain't broke, so they say, don't fix it, and - with five home runs from five at bat Ã¹-the only thing Pixar has broken so far is the bank. And yet, Finding Nemo proved to be the company's biggest box office whale so far, it was also apparent that the Pixar formula was now perhaps picked clean. Like A Bug's Life and Monsters, Inc. before it, Nemo's design was drafted straight from John Lasseter's Toy Story blueprint - mismatched buddies, colourful supporting cast, road movie, yada, yada, yada. Bird, however, is the first outsider to be welcomed into the Pixar family, and he has parlayed the creative freedom afforded him to deliver something altogether different: part domestic sitcom with human characters and adult concerns, part costume caper with breathless action sequences and production design ripped from Bond boffin Ken Adam's most fevered dreams.<br/><br/>Most superhero movies employ a number of costume changes, but The Incredibles features just one of note. Following a bit of historical business to explain the crimefighter relocation programme, the first half keeps the suits - and the powers - firmly in the closet, as our humbled hero fights corporate tyranny as an insurance clerk by day and mines cheap thrills by listening to the police scanner at night. Only when Bob is lured out of retirement and into danger do he and the family call upon a celebrated fashion designer - voiced by Brad Bird himself in full ""dahling"" mode, and an unmistakable highlight - to provide the obligatory threads.<br/><br/>The little black masks subsequently remain on, but for adults it is the earlier interplay between Bob and Helen that'll likely linger longest. Unlike, say, Shrek, Bird never scatter-guns gags at the screen or short-changes character for a joke. He has a smattering of bulletproof set-pieces to lean upon - look out for the bit with capes - but mostly the gags are organic, generated by the story rather than offered in place of one. In fact, the oddly melancholy first half is closer in tone to superior suburban indie comedies like Office Space or The Good Girl than anything Pixar has so far produced.<br/><br/>The younger demographic will doubtless be relieved when the evil mastermind is unmasked and the Incredible kids finally get in on the action, but the relentless - and overcooked - final reel inevitably leaves less room for character grace notes. And while the action is expertly tooled, those critics of CGI who feel cartoony FX can diminish the sense of jeopardy in live-action movies are hardly likely to be sweating bullets over the fates of drawings. Indeed, it's perhaps a shame it's taken Bird's movie a decade to reach the screen, as the recent glut of live-action superhero feats has inevitably stolen some of the thunder from his cartoon marvels.<br/><br/>Still, even if The Incredibles is just an arranged marriage between superhero romp and classic sitcom, this hybrid has enough highlights for everybody to guarantee Pixar another critical and commercial hit. Looks like 2004 has given birth to a new superhero franchise after all."

","5 November 2004. This is one of the best animated feature films of all-time breaking through to the family, comedy, action-thriller movie genre that can compete with live-action movies. The animation, the intelligent script, plot, and humor are all blended into a super format that made the Iron Giant so popular and an instant animated classic. The Incredibles will be one of those movies that will set a new benchmark in animation and perhaps in family movies for years to come. Certainly this movie argues for the elimination of the new Academy Award animation category and allow animated feature films to compete along with the other movie genres on a level playing field. A certainty for a Golden Globe nomination, this movie was awesome, if a bit long and slow in a few places (editing could have tightened it up), but overall, a marvelous effort, exciting, compelling, and funny with a great dose of human values and family values all wrapped up in a retro-contemporary cartoon package just right from the current day. Nine out of Ten Stars."

","The Incredibles is directed by Brad Bird and features the voices of Craig T Nelson(The Proposal),Holly Hunter and Jason Lee(Alvin And The Chipmunks) and tells the story about a supposedly ordinary family The Parrs who are hiding a secret. They are really superheros who take down bad guys and save the world. Helen Parr(voiced by Holly Hunter) is Elasticgirl, her husband Bob Parr(Nelson) is the leader Mr Incredible,his daughter Violet can turn herself invisible,while his son can run very fast and his baby son can shapeshifts,and do cool things.<br/><br/>
The Incredible are put to the test when a villian named Syndrome(Lee) who we also see in the beginning as the young boy who wants to join Mr Incredible but is rejected by him as he told Buddy(Syndrome) that he works alone. Since then Syndrome seeks revenge. Will the incredibles along with frozone(Samuel L Jackson ) save the day?<br/><br/>With a running time of almost 2 hours(yes you could say it's the longest animated film ever made since Fantasia),this film is packed with great animation,gorgeous visuals and a great cast.<br/><br/>

","I sort of watched them out of order. I wasn't really privy to the existence of The Incredibles until my fiance wanted to rent the sequel...and then I went back and watched the first one.<br/><br/>I have to say that I liked 2 more, but only because it looked like a period pop art piece and the first one you really didn't get that feel. It was clearly set in the early 60s, but you didn't get that whole esthetic as much as you did in the sequel and that was the biggest draw I had to it.<br/><br/>That being said, it was't bad.<br/><br/>Sociopolitically I liked the line about when everyone has super powers no one does. It registered loudly to someone that works in history. So the plot, on that basis, was compelling.<br/><br/>And I am sure that if I had seen them in order I'd like it just as much.<br/><br/>The sequel, the main draw that sucked me in was the look of the film. Here it was the quasi-family struggles which, again, seemed to be highlighted a little better in the second film. Still, it was there enough, the work-life balance to draw you in, and the absurdity that the work was being a hero was entertaining.<br/><br/>As was the reason they had to go underground which, again, was done a little better than when the MCU tried it...but still not elaborated on enough to make it as interesting as it could have once been.<br/><br/>In any case, it's still an entertaining cartoon. And you can see where the creators took what worked in the first one and elaborated on the concepts until they popped."

"tomgillespie2002","9","0","0","2 November 2018"," The perfect balance of comedy, drama and action
","Earlier this year, when Disney finally completed their takeover of 21st Century Fox, Marvel fans rejoiced at the idea of the X-Men and the Fantastic Four finally being brought into the fold and into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After the silly, family-friendly Fantastic Four we got back in 2005 and its only-slightly-better sequel in 2006, Josh Trank's much-anticipated 2015 reboot failed spectacularly, causing Fox to shelve the tainted franchise indefinitely. Since Kevin Feige and the MCU can seemingly do no wrong, we will finally be getting an interpretation worthy of Marvel's first family. What most fans didn't realise however, is that we already had a great Fantastic Four movie, only it wasn't made by Marvel and didn't feature the likes of Mr. Fantastic and the Human Torch. No, I'm not referring to Roger Corman's 1994 disaster, but the one made by Pixar Studios called The Incredibles, which is still to this day one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.<br/><br/>The world has been blessed with the arrival of superheroes: super-powered beings who dress up in masks and tights, battling crime in their spare time to the adoration of a grateful public. But with the rise of superheroes comes the rise of supervillains, all with equally outlandish costumes, nicknames and powers. Public opinion suddenly shifts when famous hero Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) saves a man from suicide, and the lawsuits start to hit the caped crusaders. In response, the government starts the Superhero Relocation Program, designed to hide the supers in society and keep their crime-fighting antics at bay. Years later, Mr. Incredible is living a dull suburban existence with his wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and their three children Violent (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and baby Jack-Jack. His work at an insurance company brings him no joy, so he helps the vulnerable to find loopholes in the company's policies to ensure they pay out, and spends some nights with old buddy Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) listening to a police radio. But life seems to have meaning once again when he is contacted by a mysterious woman named Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), who offers the overweight lug a top-secret mission on a secret island base.<br/><br/>Pixar is famous not only for the quality of their movies, but for how their products can be loved by anybody in any age group. Children will enjoy the bright colours and spectacular action, adults will appreciate the sly wit, and just about everybody will fall for the heart. Yet despite its somewhat glossy appearance, The Incredibles is Pixar at its most mature. While the film does gift its characters super-strength, super-speed and invisibility, The Incredibles is really about dysfunction and the trappings of family life and a 9 to 5 job. Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl have reached crisis point, with the latter left to dealt with children only just discovering their powers while the former is off daydreaming about the glory days. It's what drives the drama, and is ultimately what makes you hold your breath when they are in danger or want to punch the air when they suit up to face their foe. Such an honest depiction of marital life doesn't make for depressing viewing however, with writer/director Brad Bird mixing in some fine slapstick humour and the mic-dropping costume designer Edna Mode (voiced by Bird himself). 14 years after its release, it still remains one of Pixar's finest, and Bird finds the perfect balance of comedy, drama and action as he did with his other animated classic, The Iron Giant."

","The Incredibles is nothing short of incredible. Even though it's animated, it's one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, and it's one of my favorite movies of all time, AND it's my favorite animated movie of all time! Jeez, this movie is a record-breaker when it comes to being among the best of its kind. And the movie CERTAINLY reflects that.<br/><br/>What's the story? In this lauded Pixar animated film, married superheroes Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are forced to assume mundane lives as Bob and Helen Parr after all super-powered activities have been banned by the government. While Mr. Incredible loves his wife and kids, he longs to return to a life of adventure, and he gets a chance when summoned to an island to battle an out-of-control robot. Soon, Mr. Incredible is in trouble, and it's up to his family to save him.<br/><br/>No good superhero movie is without its action, and this movie definitely doesn't disappoint. The action scenes in this movie are phenomenal, especially the final battle where the Parr family have to destroy Syndrome's mega Omnidroid. Also, the animation, while looking a bit dated by today's standards, looked amazing for its time, and today it still looks very solid. Also, the performances are great. Craig T. Nelson does a great job at playing Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr, and you can tell Mr. Incredible's feelings with his voice, something all movies should do but unfortunately don't always succeed. This film, however, definitely succeeds in that category. Holly Hunter is also very good at playing Elastigirl/Helen Parr, even if she sounds like she's wearing braces. The characters are likable and very identifiable to a lot of families with major issues, and it is very realistic to those. Also, I like how the film focuses more on the family and not the action. It's a great twist on the superhero genre I think a lot of superhero films should use, especially ones like Ant-Man and Spider-Man, which do focus on the main hero's family, but not like this.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Incredibles is an incredible movie under the genius mind of Brad Bird, who also made The Iron Giant, Ratatouille, Mission: Impossible- Ghost Protocol, Tomorrowland (which wasn't that great) and the sequel, Incredibles 2. Brad Bird did a great job at directing, and the movie itself holds a strong story, a great script, very nice animation, memorable characters, an awesome score, and some epic action. If you like superheroes, you'll love The Incredibles. It's a film for everyone."

It wasn't quite as good as I'd told myself, but it was very enjoyable and is perfect for the family. Good story line, good humour, well made film."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","3 October 2018"," Enjoyable mix of superhero and spy tropes
","With this film Brad Bird brings something interesting into the superhero craze. He takes the normal superhero norm (secret identities, superpowers, supervillain etc.), and combines it with the spy aesthetic of the early James Bond films. And why not? The stories, the covert operations, the code names and all that feel very much at home in both genres and they mix together almost seamlessly.<br/><br/>Bird's approach is also interesting in that he focuses rather heavily on family dynamics. And just how similar and familiar they feel despite the whole family having superpowers. Quite honestly it makes them more human than any X-Men film has ever managed. Not because their struggles are so similar, so humane in nature. But because they are human, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Not that the film doesn't work in any other way. Far from it. It's a beautifully - really beautifully, in fact - animated adventure film with great characters, great villains, great locations and all that jazz. I especially love the use of colour in the film. Every single frame makes me love the 60s aesthetic even more.<br/><br/>If I had to nitpick, I perhaps could say that the villain is perhaps a bit too goofy. He manages to be menacing when he needs to, which is not something every goofy villain can say, but there still a couple of scenes where his performance doesn't quite flow. At least for me.<br/><br/>Still, one of the better Pixar films to date and certainly one of the more unique superhero films our there. Certainly worth a watch."

","Two formerly highly idolized superheroes, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, are now forced to stay undercover along with their three children and live a life as normal as can be to not raise suspicion towards them. However, the task is not that easy for Mr. Incredible and the wish to regain his previous fame is high. Hiding it from his family, he starts to accept new missions from an unknown source. 
The Incredibles was one of the very first movies I went to see in the cinema and that I remember well. Though I was only six years old, I still enjoyed it very much. But the most striking aspect for me is that rewatching it fourteen years later still sparks in me the same joy and interest I had the first time, and I think that is one of the movie's main strength. Indeed, it has ""aged"" very well and remains up to date, funny and endearing regardless of time passing. The plot is simple and resembles that of a Marvel comic, but it differentiates itself through its characters and its animation. Indeed, first, the characters are very relatable (parents can relate to the ""mid-life"" crisis of Mr. Incredible, children can relate to Violet's insecurities or Dash's hyperactivity) and endearing, and they all have very clear personalities which makes the viewer want to care for them. Second, the animation for a 2004 is amazing and it is easy to actually forget that it is an animated movie thanks to the smoothness of the images.
Overall, The Incredibles is therefore a very enjoyable animated movie, be it for children, teens, or adults, and you will definitely smile a lot when it ends. I am very excited to see how the second one will turn out."

","The Incredibles truly is an amazing superhero action flick with the heart only Pixar manages to do. Another great effort by Brad Bird! <br/><br/>The characters are so lovely. The mid-life crisis stricken Bob Parr and his family who try to blend into regular suburban lives after some unfortunate events get forced into action after Bob is offered an opportunity to be super again. Craig T. Nelson nails the sound of a tired middelaged father who lives through that midlife crisis while also showcasing intense emotions when someone crosses his limits. Holly Hunter makes Helen Parr/Elastigirl a perfect example of a stern mom trying to keep everything under control. Sarah Vowell does make Violet a nervous teenage girl which fits perfectly and when she bounces off the youthful Dash they become really entertaining. <br/><br/>But my favorites were Edna Mode and Buddy Pine/Syndrome. Did you honestly know as a kid that Brad Bird himself did the voice of Edna? I didn't, but now I know and it is so cool! Edna is so funny in her Cruella De Vil-ish attitude and her exaggerated outburst of excitement and other emotions! I was laughing so hard so many times! <br/><br/>Syndrome must without a doubt be one of the animated villains with the highest deathcount. Oh god, I just realised how many superheroes he took down to achieve his gold. Such a tragic story of a neglected boy. Jason Lee really nailed his geeky personality, but also made him incredibly manacing when he was doing terrible things. <br/><br/>The family aspect of the movie was also handled in a mature way by having both conflicts shown and resolved through the movie's running time. More than once the writers also managed to poke some great fun at existing family tropes which I first noticed when watching the movie recently. <br/><br/>Overall, a great superhero action flick, but made incredible with great themes of family."

","As we approach Pixar's 25th anniversary, many people like to list their favourite Pixar film. Some list Up, Ratatouille, Toy Story, Inside Out, Wall-E, and as of recent even Coco. The Incredibles, is not always as well-noticed as these films and in my view actually underrated of its brilliance and undertones of social tensions and familial dynamics.<br/><br/> The film opens with Superheroes like Mr. Incredible being adored by the public stopping crime, fending off evil and generally enjoying life. But then as time passes, mistakes begin to happen as these superheroes powers' lead to injuries, damages and other stresses on the populace. Much like 1950's America, fear is stoked and people begin to demand these superheroes be stopped, they are different, dangerous, out of control and are doing more harm than good. Mr. Incredible who at the end of this montage has married another super Elastigirl are forced to become ordinary, take menial jobs, bury their powers and live in suburbia.<br/><br/> Some years pass, and we now see both heroes living as ordinary people, 
Mr.Incredible(Bob Parr) stuck working in an office block as an insurance advisor, and Elastigirl(Helen Parr) as a housewife. They are now parents to two kids Violet and Dash, along with a baby Jack-Jack. There are so many great lines in the film , one incredible choice by writer/director Brad Bird after another that as a kid when I first saw this film in 2004, didn't pick up on and now see with clarity.As the film goes forward, we begin to take notice of the family dynamic and how each one is bitter, torn and suffocating over the restraints the world has placed on them.<br/><br/>Their son Dash whose superpower is extreme speed can not try out for sports because his mom fears he will expose his powers, and endanger them. He is upset and takes his frustrations out at school getting in trouble and acting out. Violet is socially awkward, stuck not knowing how to socialise out of fear of exposing her power and can not express her emotions. Meanwhile their father Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson is stuck in a mid-life crisis angry at the boredom of his life, hiding their powers, no longer helping achieve the fame and notoriety he once had.<br/><br/>He sneaks out of the home with his friend another superhero Frozone voiced by Samuel L. Jackson to save people, fight crime, etc... This puts him at sharp odds with his wife voiced by Holly Hunter who is tired of her husband's recklessness, inability to move on from the past, and endangering their family's well-being.<br/><br/> This film is funny especially EDNA MODE, its serious, tragic at times and also the rare blend of action and reality that will bring kids and adults together. Im happy that Brad Bird who also did the Iron Giant a film that was overlooked due to studio mismanagement, finally got recognition for his brilliance here and also with Ratatouille. Every character is relatable and you feel their frustrations, pain and fear of the situations their in. As in the Iron Giant, Bird is able to create serious situations with his characters that pull at you, like the plane sequence and the terror as Helen tries to save her children from harm, or when Bob breaks down thinking his family has been killed and nearly snaps in a dark scene but one that makes sense if you were in his shoes.<br/><br/> These are moments you don't usually in a kids' film, and the action and familial dynamic really captures what most families super or not go through at some point or another. Even Syndrome a villain who is ruthless is three-dimensional because he recognizes his flaws, and is driven by the fact that he was told he could not be what he wanted due to being different. Even the minor characters step up like kid on the bike who was funny as well, and of course Bird's work voicing the great Edna Mode. This film while not emotionally as powerful as Up or Inside Out, is brilliant in its scene of familial bonds, action and power of how differences should bring us together instead of tearing us apart.<br/><br/>PS: CANT WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","The greatest thing about this movie was the charm we all experienced. The interactions and real-world problems and tasks this super-powered family goes through is what made it stand. Basically, just Fantastic Four on a film screen (which is good). They each have something to deal with, while the main character has something greater to focus on. That makes all of them great together when they need to cope about it together, like family. A lot of the lines are super memorable. And the villain is simple enough to enjoy the conflict."

","""The Incredibles"" good animated film, great screenplay, charismatic characters and interesting villains, perhaps one of the movie's most consistently superhero movies. Set in the 60's, we see the stories of rise and fall of a group of superheroes, saving the world to their daily lives. With incredibly beautiful computer animation for the standards of the time, the incredible was the longest computer-generated animation until its release, plus a good rhythm, and a magnificent soundtrack that brings us to a mix of Batman and Superman, a soundtrack that screams ""THIS IS A SUPER-HEROI MOVIE"". We have a great construction of characters, characters that are broken several times, that reflect, give up and try, involved in family dramas and search for self-knowledge, the film talks about the nature of man to seek a meaning to his life. It's a very good movie, with dialogues, script, characters and technically high level."

","This has got to be my favorite Pixar film yet. I have watched it over and over with and without my kids. I love the element of them leading normal lives, but wanting to get back out there and be who they desire to be. Then the bond between Helen and Robert ""Bob"" is so genuine, even for a cartoon. The story lost it's wat towards the end and tried to (i felt) wrap it up too fast for what had already transpired. I also loved the seemstress, she was a riot and made me wish that I could exude that ""I don't give a cr*p"" attitude. I can't sing the praises of this one enough though... good job Pixar...

","Such a great movie. Really creative. Really entertaining and well done. I love Dash's chase scene. I love the sequence of Helen getting stuck in all the doors. It's brilliant comedy and taking advantage of the sticky situations someone who can stretch can find herself in. I'm kind of astonished at the dark/adult content this movie deals with. Suicide? dead family? Playing getting sucked into a jet engine for laughs? Not to mention one of the most grisly Disney deaths I can think of (Others to me would be Bugs Life and Tarzan). That scene of the jet getting blown up always gets me emotionally. It's super tense and you understand both Helen and Violet's viewpoint of asking Violet to put a force-field around the plane. You're pulling for Violet and yet feel the frustration and fear of Helen. It's edited so well. Ug! I'm gushing. It's also refreshing to see a full family in a family movie. Disney has a lot of broken/single-parents and I get it. It saves money to not have siblings or two parents. it's less complicated. it makes kids like that feel better. But it's so nice to see a movie about family and about what they can accomplish together and show what a family can be. It's really encouraging. One of Pixar's best. Oh, and Edna is wonderful. duh"
"elicopperman","9","0","0","30 March 2018"," One of My Favorite Superhero Movies
","After nearly fifteen years, this movie is still one of Pixar's most outstanding works (in my opinion at least). With numerous superhero films coming out in the 21st century, The Incredibles has stood as one of the most unique superhero movies in history, mainly for how it focuses on a family of superheroes (a real family btw, not a figurative one like Fantastic Four). I personally can't even count the amount of times I've watched this movie I love it so much, but let's see why.<br/><br/>Set in a world where superheroes have been outlawed, former supers Mr. Incredible (Bob Parr) and Elastigirl (Helen Parr) have kept their powers and lives hidden away in suburbia for roughly fifteen years while raising their children, Violet, Dash and Jack Jack who also have super powers. One day, Mr. Incredible gets a call to an island to fight a giant robot, only to discover that it was all a trap planned by Syndrome (formerly Mr. Incredible's biggest fan Buddy Pine) in order to kill Mr. Incredible and all the supers with his killer robot and intelligence. With the help of his family, Mr. Incredible must now stop Syndrome from fulfilling his plans of world domination. <br/><br/>Right off the bat, arguably the best aspect of the entire movie is the relationship between Bob and Helen, as we really see just how living away from public consciousness for so many years has put a toll on them. While Helen tries to adapt, Bob simply can't and wishes he could showcase his true potential once again. As someone who wishes to showcase his true talent to the world one day, I can relate to feeling neglected by society's conformist outlook that celebrates mediocrity. Not to mention, the opening scenes which transition from Bob and Helen playfully flirting to them getting married really does highlight their affectionate bond for one another, which makes their future relation all the more devastating and mature when all hell breaks lose. Given that each member of the Parr family has realistic flaws, like Dash also wanting to let his potential of running kick in, to Violet mostly being a social outcast before having to face the world, there are as many grievances in the family as there is tenderness, which really does make the Parr family one incredible family.<br/><br/>However, another notable accomplishment in the film's own right is the villain Syndrome. Originally an obsessive fan of Mr. Incredible who turned to the dark side once he discovered just how little your idols might actually care for their true believers, Syndrome just might be one of the most ruthless and down right sadistic villains in animation. Ignoring the fact that he wiped out nearly all the superheroes to pretend to be one so people could worship him, the fact that he loathes Mr. Incredible enough to not only want him dead, but that he shows no remorse for what he has done is truly heart wrenching. He does have the occasional fanboy moment (that famous ""Got Busy"" line still cracks me up), but his callous motivation shows just how much he could care less for anyone, even his own assistant Mirage. Considering we live in an age where die hard fans will go ballistic if their idols do something even slightly off-putting, Syndrome is a brilliant representation of just how blind people can be in their sickening schemes.<br/><br/>This was Pixar's first film to feature an entire human cast, and the way the animators at Pixar pulled them off is truly remarkable. Along with smooth and accurate movements, the characters look like they were designed for traditional animation rather than 3D (makes sense since the director Brad Bird is a CalArts Graduate). Not to mention, the effects animation like water, fire, ice, electricity and explosions, the backgrounds such as the modern looking houses and buildings and the volcanic island Nominisan, and the robot itself known as the Omnidroid are truly stunning to look at, as even the slightest details are worth praising. <br/><br/>The actions scenes are also well choreographed, and it's fun to see how creative the animators got in pulling off ways for the Incredibles to use their powers when needed. CG animation back then was still not quite up to snuff as it is today, making the visuals all the more astonishing while also proving just how many tiresome work hours were spent on crafting and rendering the film. Also, the music score by Michael Giacchino is a delightful and snappy mix of intense 60s style action music and suspenseful dramatic scores, depending on the scene, and it's no wonder Giacchino is still a highly respected film composer today.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the movie does have a few issues, but none that truly detract from the overall quality. For one, the first half of the film spends a little too much time on Mr. Incredible, and then the second half focuses on his family as much as him. While not jarring, it does feel like the film should have spent at least some more time on Dash and Violet to make them a little more memorable. Also, Syndrome's assistant Mirage is responsible for luring Mr. Incredible to the island so he can get killed (let alone the other superheroes), and while she does have a change of heart later on, we never see her again, making her arch feel unfinished (BTW, don't use the comics as an excuse for her appearing later on because that's an adaptation, not the original source). I just think she got off a little too easy, and even though she does help out the main heroes, she still leaves some questions about her past and her presence after the film unresolved. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, The Incredibles still holds up as a well written, fantastically animated, and action-packed superhero movie that puts a unique twist on the genre with a family trying to get back in the swing and a menacing albeit hysterical villain. With a sequel coming in the next two months, it only shows just how passionate Brad Bird was about this film, and it will forever be remembered for years as one of my favorite superhero films of all time."

"TheMovieDiorama","10","0","0","9 March 2018"," The Incredibles is the pinnacle of superhero animation.
","Not to mention this is my favourite Pixar animation, this is also my favourite superhero film. A genre that is ridiculously exhausted now, The Incredibles took superheroes and made them relatable, human...and damn likeable. They are just like us, with families and a desire to do good in the world. Sure they have powers that neither me, you or the pet cat have, but it was refreshing to watch the day-to-day lives of a super heroic family. The family we follow is the Parr family, in particular the focus is on Mr Incredible. Washed up, old and trying to earn a living, he desires to be the famed superhero that he once was. Where to begin with this? Outstanding animation, perfect voice casting, memorable characters, inventive plot and one of the most quotable scripts of all time. There is no way anyone can hate on this film, no way. Every character is superb, from the charming Parr family to the villainous Syndrome (who by the way, is your biggest fan...). But the champion is the one, the only...Edna Mode. Every scene with her, is comedic genius. Where her spinoff film? I would pay top dollar to see that! The script is phenomenally quotable and plagued with famous scenes. ""Where's my super suit!?"", ""No capes!!"", ""Go home buddy, I work alone."" and a personal favourite ""Coincidence? I think NOT!"". Consistently funny, witty and charming, you don't get scripts like these in every family film. The plot was engrossing with no pointless scenes, the pacing was rapid and builds up to the final battle sequence. The superpowers were creative, heck even the baby has some damn awesome superpowers. A baby!? When was the last time you saw that in a film? Oh and Samuel L Jackson was perfect voice casting for Frozone, without a doubt. In my opinion, drum roll please, Pixar haven't exceeded with an animation since The Incredibles. This being one of my favourite films of all time, this is a super duper ridiculously easy perfect rating. Where's my sequel? I need it now."

","The story has a nice hook right when it opens as Mr. Incredible appears to be in smug competition with Elastigirl, and then it's revealed they're really married. I thought that was a cool way to introduce the principal characters. I got a big kick out of Edna Mode, even though she wasn't in the picture all that much. Writer and director Brad Bird got into the act himself by voicing Edna, and he did a splendid job. It wasn't till I started writing this that I picked up on the reference to one of TV's first talk show hosts, Jack Paar. That would have been the littlest member of The Incredibles Family, Jack-Jack Parr. Spelled different but it's still a cool in joke. I'm more of a super-hero movie fan than I am of animated flicks, but it was a pretty good idea to combine the two genres here for a fun and entertaining movie. And in the tradition of modern day super-hero flicks, there's even a set up for a sequel with a villain called The Underminer. Pretty cool."

","I have an affinity for superhero movies--comic book related and non- comic book related. So, a movie with a few super-humans, even as an animation, is right up my alley. But The Incredibles went a slightly different direction. They explored a very novel concept with superheros. What if they were a liability? What if they were forced into retirement? What would a super-family be like living as normal human beings?<br/><br/>Those are the questions The Incredibles answered and it was great. Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) marry and have a family. Mr. Incredible struggles with being a non-super working stiff. Elastigirl is struggling to maintain the family's low profile. Both of their struggles come to a head when they are forced back into action.<br/><br/>I liked the premise as well as the execution of it.

The film premiered on October 27, 2004, at the BFI London Film Festival and had its general release in the United States on November 5, 2004. The film performed well at the box office, grossing $633 million worldwide during its original theatrical run. The Incredibles was met with high critical acclaim, garnering high marks from professional critics, and provoking commentary on its themes. The film received the 2004 Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, along with two Academy Awards. It became the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.<br/><br/>A sequel, The Incredibles 2, is scheduled for release on June 15, 2018.<br/><br/>Public opinion turns against humans with superpowers – called ""Supers"" – due to peripheral damage caused by their crime-fighting activities.

","Was The Incredibles ""totally wicked""? After watching this incredulous movie, the time has come for a film review. The Incredibles is an action/superhero film, where a family of ex-superhero rejects embark on a mission to rescue their city. Personally I see this film as ""okay"". The reason is that it was rated a PG and included scenes of kissing over a long period of time, making oneself ask if that was really necessary. Any Disney movie should abstain from having one too many love scenes that are over the top. If they wanted to show romance between characters, they could have presented in a more child-friendly way, such as a hug or peck on the cheek. The Incredibles is one of those superhero films that break conventions. An example is the Mr Incredible's biggest fan now is his worst enemy. Not many movies have this particular type of convention, not that I can think of. Another convention is when the superheroes of the planet get sued because of their actions to save the world. The public thought that superheroes weren't needed anymore, so they hid. Can you think of another film like this? I think not. They are many morals in this story, such as trust, loyalty, hope and most of all, friendship. The Incredibles really capture these, by ways of comedy and tragedy. One example is when they have a major domestic argument and they actually talk about trusting each other etc. etc. So in conclusion, whether I liked the film or not is the question. I mean they had some sad moments, funny moments and moments I where I felt this film wasn't actually animated and moments where I thought ""Thank God it's only animated!""! Surprisingly this movie won 2 Oscars, 59 wins and nominations! So that is the reason why I will give this film a... 87.55%"

I'm surprised that they still haven't made a sequel to this. It has great potential."
"jephtha","8","0","0","8 July 2016"," Relatively edgy and violent, but also smart and observant, this is an excellent family feature
","As Roger Ebert once pointed out, ""On the surface, 'The Incredibles' is a goof on superhero comics. Underneath, it's a critique of modern American uniformity"". That it is, a double-objective accomplished by emphasizing the incompatibility between the fantasy antics of the superhero world, and our own. The result is a marked attempt to broaden the Pixar audience, and a stand-out action flick. <br/><br/>Given the central group, it should come as no surprise that family dynamics are the best asset. Of course, to one degree or another, all the Pixar films are about families; the ""Toy Story"" trilogy made this a progressively emphasized component. What sets ""The Incredibles"" apart is how observant it is about the subject. Some of the best scenes in the movie simply show the interplay amongst the family members, and throughout we witness marital dissonance, sibling rivalry, parental concern, etc. It's all portrayed convincingly and makes the characters come alive in a down to Earth way rarely achieved in the Pixar movies. More importantly, we care about these guys, because they clearly care about each other, even if they sometimes have a difficult time showing it. Nothing quite like thwarting a villainous plot for bonding time. <br/><br/>Concerning the individual characters, Bob and Helen are the standouts. The former is actually a pretty complex creation for this genre, and the screenplay quite cleverly adapts the whole mid-life crisis element to his circumstances. He has a desire to help people, and tries to do so with what life has allowed him. The problem is that he doesn't feel valued for his efforts. More importantly, he doesn't value his line of work, which he believes wastes his capabilities (that last point serves as an interesting running theme also evident in the kids and Edna), and such a lack of motivation follows him home. A call for parents to draw a more stark line between work and home, perhaps? Helen, I believe, is the stronger character, and one of my personal favorites from the Pixar canon. She's the more level-headed of the two and throughout the movie has to keep everyone else in check. It's a great demonstration of the importance of her role in her family and greatly endears us to her. Not to mention, she's got a real knack for quick thinking. <br/><br/>The other characters serve their purposes adequately. Syndrome is an amusing spoof of megalomaniacal bad guys (e.g. Lex Luthor), while Edna (a delightful nod to Q from the James Bond series), with her seemingly endless resources, dismissive attitude about her height and exacting attitude, may be my favorite supporting character in these movies. Violet and Dash aren't defined much beyond basic attributes, but their presence reinforces certain themes (notice how much more confident they seem after using their abilities in fulfilling ways) and their subplots are resolved well. I particularly liked how Dash's school race at the end was more an exercise in self-control than ""being the best by a tiny bit"". At that point, his relatives' opinions were the only ones that mattered. How nice. <br/><br/>On the visual level, this one is not quite as fanciful as, say, ""Toy Story 2"" or ""Finding Nemo"". There's a good variety of locations and the costumes really pop on screen, largely due to the combination of black with bright red, but overall this movie has a relatively subdued look. Even so, it gets major points for the actions of its key players. Every major member of the Parr family has a pretty standard superpower, but these are all utilized in a wide variety of dynamic and interesting ways. I still remember feeling surprised at Elastigirl's first display of speed and agility, a good indicator of the energy with which these powers are portrayed. Beyond that, it's also worth noting how the characters use their powers for expression (notice Violet hiding from her crush and Helen increasing in height as she yells) or for ordinary, everyday actions. It makes certain scenes that much more interesting to watch. Beyond that, I love the sense of scale. Bob staring up at an absurdly large computer screen almost gives the impression of being in an IMAX theater, while the Omnidroids both look and feel big, thanks to both the quality of animation and camera angles. <br/><br/>All this being said, ""The Incredibles"" is not perfect. For one, it does take longer to kick off than others in its own line. The first act, while necessary to set-up the main story, doesn't really cut loose in a way one would expect. This is supposed to be the golden age of superheroes; shouldn't there be more seen in action? Once we get to the family dinner scene, things start to get good. What's more, I would have preferred more interaction within the Parr family, which is sparse for a considerable chunk of the running length. The way that Bob comes to appreciate Helen and the kids could have had more thought put into it, but at least, as shown in the prelude to the climax, it's a development treated with weight when it could have easily been perfunctory. But my biggest reservation is how Syndrome is dispatched. I, for one, would have found it more satisfying for the Parrs to coordinate their powers to defeat this guy in a direct fight, rather than just having him undone by an (admittedly funny) wardrobe malfunction. <br/><br/>But, these defects are ultimately of little consequence. ""The Incredibles"" is a fine and intelligent animated feature, and one of the few from the pertinent animation studio that is fruitful for a continuation."

Brad Bird deserves a standing ovation for his creativity, hard work, and passion that was put into this production. It is a rare gift that Pixar possesses when a film is created for audiences of all ages. You will not regret viewing this movie. The title of the film could not say it better, this film is quite incredible."

","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>It has gone more than 10 years since this classic animated movie took the stage. all the time i thought that ""Oh...well... just another one... maybe some day...."" Despite of the almost 12 years passing by since this won Oscars, I can honestly say that it was one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. Been produced in 2004.... WOW! A lot better compared to multiple movies being made today.... and that says a lot.<br/><br/>So... a family being incredible with all super skills... can that be something? YES, IT CAN! Take a little the Saint...take a little Avengers.... take a great deal of James Bond... take a great deal of Superman and the Marvel hero group. Shake it around in a crazy mans brilliant head... and there you have it... Brad Bird. ;)<br/><br/>Overall a great experience. On the downside it stands clear that both the story telling and the humour telling is a little out of date. Some things can be told before they happen. Some comic incidents and humour skills is little to obvious, to be funny in a WAY OUT LOUD- thing in 2016. And.... maybe that is only a little charming nostalgic trip into our history?<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Academy Award winner. Questions, anyone....? - The actors : Hahaha..... Craig T. Nelson meets up with Samuel L. Jackson. Amusing and authentic and more than well acting. Great job, everyone! - The story : Good old fashioned ""come to save the day"" and some twists into that. Very good! - Entertainment : Maybe little too stuck in its age of 2004 for its own good. And.... great entertainment. - Age : Maybe from 7...or even 11, as the movie is more an adult made animated than vice versa.<br/><br/>7,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.)<br/><br/>(Short elucidation for the rating: 8 Excellent and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)"

","The Incredibles (2004): Dir: Brad Bird / Voices: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, Wallace Shawn: Computer generated fun fest about massive strength and normality. The Incredibles are a family of superheroes under the witness protection program trying to start a new life in the suburbs. Problem is that Mr. Incredible misses the action and saving lives. When he loses his job he is suddenly presented with the opportunity to help people again. What he doesn't realize is that a trap is set by an old enemy to expose them and reveal their power source. Great setup burdened with formula storytelling and a third act that is overrun with too many climaxes. Director Brad Bird delivers the same brand of humour that worked for him in The Iron Giant. Craig T. Nelson voices Mr. Incredible who doesn't know his own strength. Holly Hunter voices Elasta-girl who can stretch beyond normal measures. Samuel L. Jackson voices a sidekick who has ice powers. Jason Lee voices the villain who desired to be a superhero himself until constant rejection rendered him a villain. Wallace Shawn voices the small but overbearing supervisor that meets consequences when he pushes his authority too far. Beautifully animated comedy about talent and serving but it also makes a case for normality and how we as a society hold various talents to contribute to the good of others. Score: 8 / 10"

"sharky_55","9","0","0","17 July 2015"," We're superheroes. What could happen?
","What could happen indeed? The Incredibles opens with an action packed introduction of the title superheroes at the peak of their powers - even in the romance department they are sorted. It's a vividly engaging sequence which hints at the sort of relationship Mr Incredible and Elastigirl have beneath those masks, with some playful, almost seductive dialogue. The husky voice acting of Holly Hunter is excellent in this context but also throughout the film in moments of marriage and motherhood. <br/><br/>But skip 15 years and a couple hundred lawsuits and suddenly the age of superheroes is over. It's a distinct tonal shift; the warmth and bravado of the past is replaced with a desaturated and mute palette, highlighting the suburban nuclear life the Parrs now live. Mr Incredible is now out of shape and stuck behind a desk, scamming and weaselling citizens out of their money rather than saving them from burning buildings. It's a Watchmen-like premise; what if superheroes were suddenly uninvited and no longer favoured in the public? And the way Brad Bird introduces us to this new age is so effective and subtle. The revelation of Dash's powers are presented via a seemingly normal occurrence of a misbehaving child forced to go to the principal's office. It's never overtly said but it characterises the over-energetic and impulsive Dash immediately. Bird even manages to incorporate humour and a sense of the absurd in what is a typical parenting issue (Don't Bernie me!). Same with Violet, her powers are also thematically connected to her personality, melting away in thin air at the sight of her crush due to that teenage nervousness. <br/><br/>The way their powers are embedded within the narrative of their civilian relocated lives is done very well. It strengthens the characterisation of the family and creates the opposing viewpoints of Helen and Bob at that point in their lives. Bob gets angry after being fired and in a fit of rage lifts up his entire car while a normal person might just yell. He also carves up Dash's steak so hard he breaks the whole plate. It's all done realistically so that when the dinner table conversation turns sour and they break out their powers, you get a sense of where this family's at. There's humour in Jack Jack's cheering and the sudden freeze and swiftness in which they go back to normal (ala what they should be pretending to be). Beyond that we get more instances of their powers twisting their day to day lives; zoom outs to Bob working out with entire trains, casually lifting up the couch during vacuum cleaning, playing football but with inflated passing yards (later again utilised in the climax). It all progresses evenly; Helen wants the kids to hide their powers, but later praises them for their quick adaptability, and finally they compromise in the end when Dash comes 2nd in the race. <br/><br/>Brad Bird of all people voices the eccentric fashion designer Edna Mode for both ordinary supermodels and heroes. It's a wonderfully bizarre performance brimming full of peculiar mannerisms and memorable dialogue. In particular the no capes sequence which pokes fun at the typical fashion trend of heroes to have that excessive feature. Little titbits like this point to how Bird can turn self awareness of the genre's tropes into funny situations, since by itself it doesn't exactly mean anything except a nod to the audience. A similar memorable line is when Buddy reveals himself to Mr Incredible after all those long years and launches into a typical recount. Bob is seemingly about to strike on the momentarily distracted Syndrome when suddenly he catches him mid flight with his laser and laughs heartily: ""You caught me monologuing, you sly dog!"" Delightful. As well as this you also have to commend the conversation between Frozone (Samuel L Jackson) and his wife as he struggles to find his super-suit. The juxtaposition of the wife's indifference to the invasion and her indignation at missing their dinner with the action scenes playing outside the window is hilarious. ""I am your wife! I'm the greatest good you are ever gonna get!""<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino's first collaboration with Pixar is a stylish success. The score could almost be lifted off the 60s era of spy flicks, as evident by the matching set designs of the initial scenes in the introduction of the film. The predominantly brass composition adds a jazzy tone and provides rhythm and energy to the action scenes. The main theme in particular is very reminiscent of James Bond. Indeed Pixar initially wanted John Barry to compose a similar score to that of the 1969 Bond flick, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The big band jazz sound makes for a thrilling and stylish addition to the overall film. <br/><br/>The Incredibles is everything modern superhero films are not. It doesn't overwhelm you with frenzied end of world odds or chaotic action sequences, and its humour is well placed and not jarringly inserted as a witty one liner or quip. Most of all the characters are written with refreshing earnesty and sincerity. Although they may possess some incredible abilities, the Parrs are not so different from any other dysfunctional family."

Mr. Incredible is strong, because he is trying to support his family. Mrs. Incredible is elastic, because she is a mom who is stretched thin trying to hold the family together. Violet is a shy girl, who wants to be invisible to her peers, and Dash is a hyperactive young boy, taken to the extreme. Of course Jack Jack is an unpredictable baby (hence his myriad of powers).

","A family of undercover superheroes, while trying to live the quiet suburban life, are forced into action to save the world.<br/><br/>This is a fun film that allowed Pixar the opportunity to think up a variety of new heroes and villains. Of course, the number of powers different people can have is rather limited and is probably exhausted, but coming up with new names is fun and they have done that well.<br/><br/>The casting is a little strange. Jason Lee was a great choice, but Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson were an odd pair to pick. Not saying they are a bad casting choice, just an odd one.

Not only by the way it is told, no, but by the also excellent script. A script that combines in a perfect way (something rarely seen in a children's movie) fantasy, action and reality. It's a good story in a nutshell. A good story, in which elements of realism and fantasy are combined in a way that lends credibility and strength to the characters, which, as I said, it is unusual for a film of this genre. But without losing that touch of fantasy and action pretty well made that characterizes and gives life to the genre. But for me, the ending is a little weak compared to the all high expectations that generated the excellent plot."
"lenvallairdjr","9","0","0","18 November 2014"," An incredible movie deserves incredible acclaim.
","This movie to me is more than just Incredible; It's stays up with its title and bursts through it like the amazing speed of Dash. This movie came out in 2004 and was Pixar's first step into the realm of PG and they succeeded with ease. <br/><br/>First up is the storyline; The movie starts off with a bang and the life of Mr.Incredible. We are then introduced to a town where crime is almost on every corner and superheroes rule the city. The way how the story flow is excellent; It's amazing with action-packed sequences and battles with a few humorous moments yet sprinkled with some innuendos for the older audience. 9.5/10. <br/><br/>Next up is the environment; It's just the city and places you would see in a 90's superhero show like Superman or Batman but in this movie, it's detailed and stands out in the best way possible. From the islands to the houses to Edna's building, it's just excellent. 9.5/10. <br/><br/>Lastly is the characters: The superheroes in this movie are excellent enough to have their own spin off shows and Brad Bird(director of the movie) took almost every superpower we know and want and made them work on every character; From invisibility and force fields(Violet), to super speed (Dash), to super strength(Mr.Incredible). There are 2 characters I must point out: First is Edna Mode. For a small person like her, she can sure express her personality and for the job she has, which is fashion design for superheroes, she needs that. The personality she shows is a great combination of sassy, passion and cleverness. Did I mention that she shows off a feeling that tells you she's one step ahead? You can't help but like her. Secondly is Incrediboy. Who knew that a boy who was a huge fan of Mr. Incredible could turn into an smart and maniacal villain named Syndrome? His goal is to get revenge on superheroes by eliminating them with his diabolical, maniacal creations like the Ommitroid so he can be the only hero in the world. This is why he's one of the best villains ever! Bottom line: These are superheroes that you wish were real and the rest of the characters stand out as well, especially Frozone; He's a really ""cool"" guy. (Get it?) For characters, 9.75/10. <br/><br/>In the end, The Incredibles gets a 9.6/10. This movie here is super fantastic! Forget ""The Avengers"", this is the true superhero movie in my opinion. No wonder why this movie won 2 Oscars! I would recommend this movie to any superhero or Disney fan and anyone who's a kid at heart; An incredible movie deserves incredible animation acclaim."
"ofpsmith","9","0","0","15 November 2014"," ""No capes!""
","The Incredibles is a good well though out film. Being this is the first Pixar movie with human beings as the main characters they did really well on the animation. This is the story. In the early 1960s (probably) in a city in the United States we see Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Craig T Nelson) as a superhero who is treated as a regular celebrity. Bob's superpower is that he has super strong abilities. There are a bunch of other super heroes including Helen Parr (Holly Hunter) his fiancée who can morph into anything, and Lucius Best (Samuel L Jackson) who can freeze anything. Everything is going fine until Bob is sued and eventually all super heroes are forced into a normal life. Fast forward to 15 years later where we see Bob living his normal life with Helen and their kids Dash (Spencer Fox) and Violet (Sarah Vowell). Bob is a bored insurance claims investor and constantly angers his boss. He looks for excitement and is recruited by a former fan of Bob's named Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) who is secretly planning to eliminate him. The rest I won't explain. The story is really good and the animation is really good. This is the first Pixar feature film with humans as the main characters. When you look at their old short films like Tin Toy you see that Pixar never really had much success with animating humans. But when they made this, the animation was great and they got it spot on. It's a really good movie and I definitely recommend it."

","This film came out when I was 7 and I loved it! 10 years later, I am now 17 and I love this film just as much, maybe even more. It is, in my opinion, one of Pixar's best films and yet one of the most underrated ones. Whenever someone says 'Pixar' most people will think of the Toy Story trilogy. As much as I love the Toy Story films, I think The Incredibles is better, to be honest. The plot revolves around Bob Parr who is better known as the famous superhero 'Mr. Incredible'. Things are going great for Bob, saving the citizens of Metroville and he's just about to marry Helen (better known as the superhero 'Elastigirl'), but, unfortunately, after letting a criminal go loose and accidentally leaving many people injured, Bob and Helen are forced to leave their superhero lives behind and live as normal citizens. Around 15 years later, they are happily married and have three kids (Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack). Bob also works in an office but doesn't enjoy it and dreams of being a superhero again. Luckily, he gets his chance when a mysterious message sends him a to a secret island where he battles a giant evil robot. But, as he tries to hide his secret superhero life in order to protect his family, Bob faces one of the biggest challenges ever. I loved everything about this film, not only was there lots of action and suspense, there was plenty of humour too! There are also many signs of character development. I think that this is one of the best superhero films ever, I mean, who wouldn't want to be in a family full of superheros? If you love Pixar films and are a huge fan of superheros then I'm sure you'll love this film as much as I do! Really is, just simply, incredible."

","Ever since 1995, Pixar had started making classics for as long as anyone can remember. Then, people haven't forgotten their first take on the superhero genre known as ""The Incredibles"", a story about a family living in a quiet suburban life who are being forced into action to save the world from an evil force. As a child, I loved it and after 10 years, it's still incredible. Back then I never realized how mature and action packed this film is it's one of Pixar's best since Toy Story and Finding Nemo. There's absolutely no flaws with this film.<br/><br/>The story is really incredible and while it does have some violent moments, it does deliver the message about family being more important than reliving the glory days perfectly. It also has some of the best comedy ever written it's on par with the comedy from Toy Story. The characters, like the writing, are also good helped by some solid voice work especially the villain Syndrome, a person who got rejected by Mr. Incredible and wanted revenge, and his motivations for why he wanted to be like him is well written, which makes him one of the best Pixar villains. The music score from Michael Giacchino is fantastic and fitted the style and tone perfectly; the action is also fantastic with an intense feel to them, but the best part of the film goes to the animation with it's realistic skin textures on the humans and their hair.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredibles still holds up as the most incredible (pun-attended) animated superhero movie and one of Pixar's best films yet. To those who haven't seen it yet, check it out! With a sequel in the works, I can't wait to see it! Thumbs up! :)"

"andy-933-696608","Null","0","0","22 December 2013"," A company is like an enormous clock.
","There a lot of super heroes out there have an assortment of talents. The Flash can run thousands of miles within a matter of seconds. Superman can fly and lift buildings with merely his hands. Spiderman can shoot webs from his arms, and climb walls as though he were an arachnid. Power free, not powerless heroes such as Batman use merely their intellect and resources to seek justice and carve their presence in the cruel and inhumane world they walk endlessly. Now when discussing these well-known heroes, the question of what makes a person special is delivered with a perplexing aura. It would be redundant to define these heroes merely by the gifts they were born with, be it super strength or the intellect to create justice through the world. There is more to a person than simply their talents. Following the success of his 1999 directorial debut, The Iron Giant, film maker Brad Bird presents yet another emotionally charged and politically themed animated feature worthy of the examination of American society.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a brilliant and artistically creative animated comedy which examines a world were super heroes are no longer allowed to be super. Mr. Incredible/ Bob Parr (Nelson) and his wife, Elastigirl, Helen (Hunter) were both forced into retirement in a world that began to believe that the super hero's secret identity was the only identity that which they could dawn. Now living the quiet, settled down, and hypocritically comfortable suburban life, with their children Dashiell (Fox) (short for Dash) and Violet (Vowell), they must make due with a world that merely moves by the prospect of capital and bureaucratic abuse. Now in saying that I know a lot of right-wingers probably hate Brad Bird's political leanings as his films constantly tackle American society regarding economics and even military conflict. Take for example the subject of the cold war in The Iron Giant which focused on the tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union as paranoia defined our society heavily at the time that sputnik was launched. It can be said that The Incredibles borders more on an anti-capitalist agenda as the introduction of Mr. Incredible's employer gives an insight into the biased hypocrisies of white-collar America in the 1950's and even to this day. Wallace Shawn is known for playing strange and overly frantic characters in an attempt to deliver a bundle of laughs in whichever film production he makes a cameo, live or animated.<br/><br/>Now as Gilbert Huph, Wallace comes off as both greedy and fully aware of the deception his insurance company demonstrates when providing services to people in need, and when questioned by Mr. incredible on these ethical matters, he simply resorts to an elitist standard of corporate antagonism. Aside from the anti-capitalist views Brad Bird expresses within his characters, are even more prevalent within the nihilistic characteristics of the film's antagonist Syndrome (Lee). Now as the evil villain, Syndrome represents the apathetic psychopath who's quest for power knows no bounds within the common ethics he breaches within this film. Women, children, nor even the life of his lover matter as he cynically disregards life to the standard a power play between him and his nemesis Mr. Incredible.<br/><br/>It is very fascinating to see that an animated film like The Incredibles entertains such a philosophical discussion within such a broad topic as dynamically themed super heroes. It's even more interesting to see that within this simple story a lot of complexity can emerge from these animated characters. But then again that's why DreamWorks always comes second to Pixar, with the Shrek films being the exception. Near the end of the film is the big battle scene of any superhero film, most of the time with a big city being leveled and the heroes gathering to battle their monstrous adversary. Mr. Incredible rushes to face off against the Omnidroid, a robot designed by Syndrone, and as he is about to fight, his wife Helen objects as to why he is going alone. She presses him on whether it is about his pride, or his desire for glory, thus giving Helen's feminist depiction a three dimensional aspect to her character. The scene is emotionally engaging, no doubt it coming from the unique performances from Holly hunter and Craig T. Nelson, but it also speaks a lot about the unity of human beings. There are those who prefer to take on the hardships for others, believing they are not strong enough to bare their loved one's suffering. And there are those who feel that strength comes from the unity people can give to one another as a source of strength.<br/><br/>For an animated comedy it still seems new to see the prevalence of the theses themes of moral conflict, and emotional support being portrayed within a film that targets mostly child audiences. But then again, these themes were shown in Brad Bird's previous feature film, The Iron Giant, as it not only portrayed an era of political chaos, but it further elaborated on the nature of violence, and its implementation into American society. What can really make these films affective is the relevance they hold with their audiences, consisting of children between the ages of 5 to 10 and older. In today's modern world, most people see that the invasion of Iraq was immoral and unjustified, and that's primarily through the use of mainstream media. Now it would be absurd to say that television makes a majority of children imitate it, however it is also relevant to point out that it can have an effect in implementing certain beliefs into their mental construct. With a film as well-crafted and visually engaging as The Incredibles it doesn't seems as though it is a far cry from having the socially affective means of the director's intentions."

","This is not your average Pixar movie. This is the kind of film Pixar originally intended to make. For those of you do not know one of the reasons Pixar was created was to make more ""Edgy"" films that Disney would not approve of. If you do not believe me watch one of the many documentaries about the origins of Pixar or look at the origin animation tests for Toy Story. The problem that lead Pixar to not go down the ""Edgy"" rout was that they felt they could not strike a balance between being Edgy and kid-friendly. With this film they found that balance. At its core this film share a lot of themes with Alan Moore's Watchmen and both feature a society that rejects superheros. This is notable because of it sets it apart from the other Pixar films as it is one of the only ones with strictly adult themes unlike say Finding Nemo which is has mostly universal themes. <br/><br/>While I enjoy most of Pixar's films I have always felt that their claims of not being as Saccharin as Disney are very overstated. That is until I saw this film. I was immediately taken aback by how Cynical this movie was and just how un-Disney it was. There is no way that a film like this could ever come out of Disney studios. In addition to being a radical change of pace for Pixar this film also mark a new sophistication in Pixar's writing and animation.For the first the characters in their films felt like real people and ciphers to do physical comedy and state the films themes. This likely is the only Pixar film that would work as Live-Action film for adults. While it does not have the heart of Toy Story or the wonder of Finding Nemo it more than makes up for it with it amazing animation, excellent writing, and and great voice acting."

And while the script is superbly written plus wonderfully balances its moments of action, drama, comedy, adventure & spectacle, it's the computer animation here that breaks all barriers of its time to realise Bird's vision on the film canvas in a full-fledged manner, which also makes it Pixar's most challenging work until that point.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, The Incredibles leaves its mark in all departments. The 3D rendering of every frame is polished to an extensive level of detail. Cinematography makes energetic use of camera, firm exhibition of colour palette plus also benefits from accurate lighting. Editing is at its absolute best during the action sequences, most of which are jaw- dropping to look at, but there are also a few moments where the pacing is a bit on a slower side.<br/><br/>Add to that, characters inhabiting the picture are brilliantly envisioned, sketched & rendered plus the relentless refinement in screenplay nicely takes care of the character development part. Pixar again puts up a rich voice cast, all of whom ably fill in their respective roles. The themes of mid-life crisis, job dissatisfaction, marriage troubles etc are elegantly handled as well. And Michael Giacchino chips in with a fantastic score that beautifully intertwines with the events of this action-adventure.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Incredibles is Pixar's most action-packed film to date that sets a new benchmark for computer animation by stretching it beyond its limitations. Full of creative energy, highly gripping plot, intriguing characters, spellbinding action, groundbreaking animation, vibrant photography, tight editing & sensational score, all pushed to extreme under Brad Bird's kinetic direction, this instant classic triumphs as one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying films to come out of Pixar's cannon. Living up to its name & working on all levels, The Incredibles is blockbuster filmmaking at its most incredible."

"Stompgal_87","8","0","0","9 August 2013"," Incredible by name, incredible by nature although not Pixar's best
","I saw this film at the cinema twice when I was 17; once with my mum where we missed the beginning and only saw it from the part where Dash is in the principal's office with Helen/Elastigirl for putting a pin on the teacher's chair; and the second time when I saw it with some fellow college students and support staff as a reward for keeping on top of my work. It is on par with 'Cars' and 'Ratatouille' but it is not quite as enjoyable as the likes of 'Up' and the 'Toy Story' trilogy (my personal favourite Pixar films, especially TS3).<br/><br/>The positive points of this film are the action scenes, cool special effects and the futuristic monorail-type pods and Syndrome's long-legged robotic contraptions that looked awesome. I also liked the fact that it avoided certain superhero clichés such as Edna Mode not adding capes to the Parr/Incredible family's suits due to them causing problems with past supeheroes in spite of Elastigirl being similar to Mr Fantastic and Violet being similar to The Invisible Woman/Girl but Syndrome's demise was creative since his cape got caught in a jet engine, thus adding a new spin on a superhero cliché and a villain death. Another part that kept me entertained was the running gag of the little boy on his tricycle waiting for Mr Incredible/Bob to do something amazing, which eventually led to him shouting, ""That was totally wicked!"" upon witnessing an explosion. The fact that there were two sides to the Parr/Incredible family was appealing because they were a typical dysfunctional family in some scenes and a cooperative superhero family in others. One part of the film that confused me was Dash's place in his race towards the end of the film because on the first few times I watched this film I thought he came first but when I listened to the audio description (which I enjoyed listening to because I was doing a radio drama course at the time), he had actually come second. I found the film a tad overlong as well, but I thought Frozone was a rather amusing side character and Jack-Jack is a cute member of the family. Although he didn't do much to begin with, I liked him bursting into flames and becoming metallic when trying to defeat Syndrome.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't Pixar's best but it is still watchable for its breathtaking action scenes, futuristic elements and its use of superhero clichés in new ways. 8/10."

","This has to be the best film Pixar has ever done. I found it really charming and entertaining to watch.I loved the mix between action, family and comedy. The film had an interesting plot and it was clever how the film flowed. I thought the film began well, but in got way better as it progressed. The characters were awesome, mainly Dash and Frozone. One specific point in the film, when the family needed each other most, that scene unlocked the characters full potential. I enjoyed Jack-Jack fighting Syndrome at the very end, I found that hilarious. What I disliked was that the film took 30 minutes to begin, 60 minutes in the middle, 10 minutes of the end and 10 minutes of credits. There was very little time for the final fight and it was rushed. The Incredibles was a spectacle to watch and one of the best animations ever!"

","I have to be honest, I started out as a hardcore ""cartoon only"" Disney fan. Then came two of the greatest animated movies of all time, Toy Story and A Bugs Life. I loved these two movies so much that I knew, I was wrong. 3D cartoons had indeed created a pretty huge fan base, with Pixar spearheading this revolution. Incredibles is another brilliant movie by them. I love everything about it. I love how the characters are all unique in their own way, how the action sequences can be comical at the same time and most of all, I love that I can watch this with my family over and over again, and never get bored of it. That's how good it is. I may be overselling it, but mind you, it is a children's movie, and as such is created in such a way that it is easily understood by a child. This means that as adults, the storyline may seem a little underwhelming. Which is true to a certain extent. Regardless, it is without a shadow of a doubt, ENTERTAINING! And in the end, isn't that all that matters?"

","A fun, wild, exciting, and perpetually moving superhero roller coaster ride of a film. Combining Pixar's polish with their amazing animation team, The Incredibles is a focused and entertaining animated thrill ride. Tons of great ideas, snappy writing and laugh out loud comedy. The original score is stellar featuring energetic jazz and exciting battle music. The wonderful art direction shines as well; The Incredibles has to be one of the more creative efforts by the team. It almost falls apart to shreds with its lightning fast pacing, but ties up nicely and leaves us begging for more. The Incredibles is a film that will sit on my shelf for a long time. It's family friendly and exciting for all ages, and is an easy film to put on whenever and wherever."
"Sherrill777","10","0","0","16 April 2013"," Excellent Superhero Movie!
","This Pixar film was created before Superhero movies became uber-popular, and it ranks up as one of the top movies of that genre, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie centers around a family with super-powers, but it isn't the powers themselves which are the focus - it's the people and their relationships. The super-powers are plentiful and used in a creative and diverse fashion, but they are never feel like they are being used as a display of unrealistic Hollywood 'showy-ness' (like many special effects laden movies do). The characters use their powers in a very natural way.<br/><br/>Beyond the superpowers, the story-line was engaging for both adults and children, never feeling slow or dragging, but neither did it neglect the character development in favor of pure action or comedy.<br/><br/>This movie was rated PG, rather than just G, although, in my opinion, there's nothing that's scarier or more adult than might be found in, say, Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' or several other classic children's films. Unless a child is extremely sensitive, I would expect most to find this movie perfectly wonderful. I Highly Recommend this to everyone! 10/10"

The dialogs and the scenes will capture the attention of everyone since you can have fun with the slap stick stuff and the action, or see the problems the couple has as well as each individuals. Many parents will recognize recurring household frictions and dynamics.<br/><br/>The scenario is rich in adventure, super heroes, and some villains.

The pacing of this film was brilliant and everything flowed in very nicely by the end of the film. I loved how the film didn't just become the average superhero movie with some terrorists taking over a place but gave you quite an unpredictable villain. His story was actually quite sad, when Bob says that he doesn't need the help of Incrediboy, his biggest fan.

","Story ""Supers""—humans gifted with superpowers—were once seen as heroes, but collateral damage from their various good deeds led the government to create a ""Supers Relocation Program"", forcing the Supers to fit in among the civilians and not use their superpowers. Bob and Helen Parr, who are Supers, have married and now have three children, Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack, in the suburbs of Metroville. Violet and Dash have innate superpowers, but the toddler Jack-Jack has yet to show any. Bob, stuck in a white-collar job at an insurance agency, reminisces of his former days as Mr. Incredible, and sneaks out on Wednesday nights with his Super friend, Lucius Best (a.k.a. Frozone), to fight street crime. Characters:  Craig T. Nelson as Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible, the patriarch of the Parr family, possessing super-strength.  Holly Hunter as Helen Parr/Elastigirl, Bob's wife, able to stretch her body like rubber.  Spencer Fox as Dashiell Robert ""Dash"" Parr/The Dash, the Parrs' 4th-grader son, gifted with super-speed.  Sarah Vowell as Violet Parr, the Parrs' middle-schooler daughter, who possesses the ability to turn invisible and create a force shield around herself or other people.  Eli Fucile and Maeve Andrews as Jack-Jack Parr, Bob and Helen's infant son, who initially shows no powers but near the end of the film reveals himself to have an enormous range of abilities including shape-shifting, teleporting, laser vision, self-immolation, flight, etc.  Jason Lee as Buddy Pine/Syndrome, who has no super powers of his own but uses advanced technology to give himself equivalent abilities.  Samuel L. Jackson as Lucius Best/Frozone, Bob's close friend, who has the ability to form ice from himself and from the humidity in the air.  Elizabeth Peña as Mirage, Syndrome's agent who lures Supers to the island.  Brad Bird as Edna Mode, fashion designer for the Supers.  Bud Luckey as Rick Dicker, the government agent overseeing the Relocation Program.  Wallace Shawn as Gilbert Huph, Bob's boss at his white-collar job.  John Ratzenberger as The Underminer, a new villain who appears at the end of the film.  Dominique Louis as Bomb Voyage, a villain from the past who uses Buddy's interference in Mr. Incredible's heroism to escape.  Bret Parker as Kari McKeen, the babysitter.

","I don't have too much to say about this film. It's got lots of good family stuff in it, along with a lot of good action. It hearkens back to classic James Bond films, but also adds the ""super"" hero element in it.<br/><br/>Superheros are the guys and gals with lots of incredible abilities, who go about righting wrongs and thwarting wrong-doers to uphold the law. Super-villains are the arch fiends of these people, and scheme to dominate the world and rob it blind of money.<br/><br/>So, if you've amassed enough wealth to own your own secret island fortress, and pay lots of people to work for you, including armed guards and even a hottie who's your secretary, then why on Earth would you go about killing off the opposition?<br/><br/>To me that's where the film fails. The main plot piece is a kid who wants to live out some revenge fantasy and show the world that he's the only true (and new) superhero, as opposed to just going on living the good life that he's created for himself. It's an emotional vendetta, and it just seems really crazy to me. That is there's this guy who had his hero jilt him, but he's gone on to become a multi millionaire (billionaire?), and he's trying to fulfill his anger wishes?<br/><br/>Huh.<br/><br/>Well, it is a kids' film, so you can't fault it too much, but the plot wasn't very plausible. Still, it's fun entertainment, and you gotta love it for that.<br/><br/>Give it a try."

","While not quite up with the greatest of the Pixar films (Up, Wall-e, Nemo, etc.) This is still smart, inventive and tremendous fun, with some humanity thrown in to boot. <br/><br/>For my money, more entertaining than any of the James Bond or superhero films of recent vintage which it spoofs (and with more exciting action besides!). <br/><br/>In an alternate universe, Superheroes are told to stop being, well, super, because of the risk of law suits and other problems. But some just can't get the urge to fight crime out of their blood. Like Mr. Incredible. He loves being a family man (a family who also all have super powers) but a 9-5 job in an ugly, greedy corporate world is more than he can take. So he quietly slips back into the super-hero biz, and eventually drags the whole family in as well. <br/><br/>All done with terrific animation, clever wordplay, great voice acting, and a nice comment or two about the traps of trying to be 'normal'. It gets all the balances right; humor to action to character to story."

Then Syndromes great line about ""and when everyone's super, no one is."" but adapted to the situation. When someone gets bored, they usually get up and say in Dash's voice, ""OK, I'm gonna look around"" and quality it by adding, ""I'm NOT gonna leave the cave."" or when you come home and find the kitchen a mess you can ease the tension by quoting Bob, ""I just cleaned up this mess, can't it stay clean for ... 5 minutes?"""

","The Incredibles is a terrific movie with a great storyline, animation, characters and voice actors. It is definitely one of Pixars finest and I personally think the best work to come out of the mind of Brad Bird. Syndrome, voiced by Jason Lee, is one of my all time favourite villains, he would be right up there in a list of along with Darth Vader and Mr Burns. There's been a lot of talk for different Pixar sequels, like a Toy Story 4, but I think if any sequel plans come after Monsters University, it should be a sequel to The Incredibles, we need more from this amazing family, there is more stories to be told there.<br/><br/>Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) has to give up his job as superhero Mr Incredible and settle down in the suburbs with his wife Helen (Holly Hunter). However, it is difficult for them to live like a normal family with their three kids when they all have superpowers. Bob isn't enjoying his normal life, so when he is given an opportunity to be Mr Incredible again, he immediately takes it, but must keep it secret from his family."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","0","0","10 May 2012"," Pixar's best family action movie
","Before this film was released, one could say the Pixar was too soft of a movie company. After making successful films like Toy Story (1995), A Bug's Life (1998), etc...one could think Pixar wasn't going to produce a film that had a little more action in it. Well for those who thought that, they were wrong! This is possibly one of the most exciting family hero films ever created.<br/><br/>The story of The Incredibles actually originates from just one super hero's surname; Mr. Incredible, played by Craig T. Nelson. Along with Mr. Incredible is Elastigirl, voiced by Holly Hunter, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) and various other super heroes. And as for the other super heroes (and villains), all of them are voiced to up most accuracy. There is not one character that sounds out of place, which is a nice thing.<br/><br/>The action is what will really bring the audience to a stand still. To watch Mr. Incredible and all his companions fight all the villains is really intense. It's even more intense to watch the super heroes as their alter egos because they have to restrain the supernatural powers. Most of the time, this is when some comedic moments are intertwined with the story to create some laughs with audience. The music was composed by Michael Giacchino and I really like his sense of style. It feels like the viewer is watching a Spy film! Plus it's great for any brass lovers because in this soundtrack, one can definitely hear all the trumpets and trombones.<br/><br/>Speaking of comedy however, there are plenty of comical parts to this film and it varies too, it's not just one gag the whole time. Each superhero has their moments and so do groups of characters as well. Viewers will get a real kick out of two specific moments. The first is The Incredibles' boss Etna. She has a serious attitude yet she can never be taken seriously. Another moment is when The Incredibles are driving through the city. They argue just like a normal family would and it's even funnier because almost anyone if not everyone can relate to that!<br/><br/>It's a rare that Pixar makes a film that's this violent and yet family oriented, but it's definitely a joy to watch. A great voice cast, peppy music and energetic action make The Incredibles a nice add-on to the genre of super heroes."

Everything they do is just magic in a sense where you'll never be disappointed. The Incredibles, in fact, redefines animation as if it's actually real. Sometimes while I watched the movie I thought a real movie was before my eyes, and that's the magic of it. The animation is well done! Perfect I may say. The details they include are beyond amazing and it will literally steal a breath from you. The voice acting is astonishing and again it's like a real movie. Huge kudos for all of the actors! Now to the movie... The movie unfolds like a '60s James Bond flick and very jazzy music plays in the background. The film feels very retro and is very unique. Nothing can compare to Pixar animation and the Incredibles is definitely one of their biggest accomplishments. The adult themes are still lurking in the background; this film exploring family. The film is highly influenced by many pop-culture things but comes off in a new style and is surely one of my favorite animations of all time.

","This is an older Disney Pixar film that I recently watched again with my three year-old. I've been revisiting an abundance of children's films and decided to start reviewing them on our blog. This seemed like as good of a place as any to get started.<br/><br/>We are first introduced to Mr. Incredible, Frozone and Elastigirl in the prime of their crime fighting days. We see them stopping muggers, saving cats from trees, stopping bank robbers and performing feats of heroism in a montage. However, trouble soon develops in the guise of lawsuits by citizens against Mr. Incredible and other superheroes for personal injury and property damage. The government tires of paying for these lawsuits and forces all the superheroes into retirement. <br/><br/>We then see our heroes struggling to act normal in suburbia. Mr. Incredible is forced to be a drone at an insurance agency while his wife Elastigirl is a stay at home mom with three children. We witness her struggle to convince them to keep their budding super powers in check. Other than the fact that they have super powers the struggles and frustrations will be easy for every family to relate to. Eventually an overweight and out of shape Mr. incredible is offered a new assignment by a mysterious benefactor and the plot really takes off.<br/><br/>Many of the sub characters in the film were as memorable as the main characters. I especially enjoyed the super hero costume designer Edna 'E' Mode voiced by Brad Bird. That role just really tickled my funny bone. A few other things that stood out as particularly enjoyable to my three year-old were giant monster robots, volcanoes, giant tikis and robot birds. <br/><br/>The Pixar animation in this film is top notch as usual. I really like the heavily stylized retro style to a lot of the décor. The characters are fun and easy to relate to even with my lack of super powers (as far as you know). Most importantly both I and my three year old could enjoy the film together. There are not many worse things than having to sit through terrible children's movies. <br/><br/>I found similarities in the film to the Fantastic Four Comics and to the Alan Moore the Watchmen graphic novel. If you like great animation, an enjoyable funny plot and believable family dynamics, I think you will enjoy this film."

Yet despite all of this, my favorite superhero movie still has to be the Incredibles, the animated film by Pixar.<br/><br/>I think the reason I like this movie so much is because it's very original. It kind of feels like a parody of a superhero movie, while also being a superhero movie. I have never seen a superhero movie in which the superheros were forced to stop fighting, maybe it was done before, I just never saw it. The animation is steller, this is the first Pixar movie in which humans are the main characters, and man they look a lot better than the humans in Toy Story.

","After years of creating talking toys, talking bugs, talking monsters, and talking fish, Disney-PIXAR finally makes a movie where all the characters are humans, and they are all superheroes.

I thought the movie was pretty interesting, and Pixar finally made a movie with action, peril, and romance. There's no other Pixar movie like this. I enjoyed most of the characters in this movie that were portrayed by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and even the film's own director portraying the best role as fashion designer Edna Mode, which made me laugh a lot, and I really enjoyed watching the character. So the movie was a well-written portrait of family and action, and I thought this was a unique change in the making of Pixar flicks. ""The Incredibles"" is not one of the best Pixar movies, but this is still a fun and entertaining motion picture that even if the action is too PG-13 similar, kids can still have fun watching.

","I think The Incredibles is a great movie. First, it does a great job at outlining what virtually every family is like, so the characters really connect to the viewers and you're sure to find a real life version of each superhero in someone you know. I can think of at least one of the characters that would fit a member in my family. For example, Mr. Incredible reminds me of my dad and Violet reminds me of my sister in some ways. Another reason that makes The Incredibles one of the best movies ever made is the story. <br/><br/>Like the characters, the way the story was written also relates to a large group of people. The movie seamlessly appeals to people of all ages. I say seamlessly because you may never notice their attempt at doing this while watching this movie, unlike the majority of movies where it becomes distracting and obvious they're trying too hard. It is ingeniously written in a way that keeps adults, children, and adolescents entertained. The majority of the jokes are complex – appealing to adults – but at the same time they have a simpler façade that small children will find funny as well. The movie is densely packed with action that will surely keep pre-teens and adolescents entertained. These characteristics of The Incredibles make it one of the best movies out there."

","Meet Bob Parr. Back in his heyday, he was a famous superhero named Mr. Incredible. Sadly, due to a series a worldwide lawsuits, he and his wife, the famous Elastigirl, have been forced into hiding for the last 15 years as normal civilians. While Elastigirl-or Helen, as she's known as in real-life-has moved on to raising a family, Bob is still stuck in the past and constantly feels a need to help others (even when it doesn't turn out well.)<br/><br/>Bob's big break comes to him when he's offered employment from a mysterious woman named Mirage, who claims that he can still be great if he wants to. Having recently been fired from his day job, and desperately wishing to do something significant with his life, Bob instantly agrees and heads off to his destination without telling his wife. Things seems great at first...until he bumps into an unfortunate part of his past that he so carelessly overlooked. It turns out that Buddy, a fan of his that he turned away from being his sidekick 15 years prior, is out to rid the world of superheroes in an attempt to become a one-man act named Syndrome. Helen eventually catches on to what her husband has been up to, but by then it's too late: Bob has gotten himself into a dilemma that has put him, his marriage and- ultimately-his family in jeopardy.<br/><br/>To date, I've seen this movie 3 times: once when it first came out on DVD in 2004, once when I purchased the movie in January and once just a few weeks later when I was bored. Each time, I was able to experience just how great this movie really is. Brad Bird may have gotten his start with the often-overlooked classic known as The Iron Giant, but it's with The Incredibles that he's truly able to shine. Part social-commentary, part dramatic-fiction and part action movie, The Incredibles is just another example of how animation is easily capable of replicating the quality of live-action films, perhaps even surpassing them. The movie has mature humour, impressive animation, excellent voice acting (such as Craig Nelson, Holly Hunter, Jason Lee and Samuel L. Jackson) and the usual touch that can only be found in a Pixar movie. Pixar has made 11 movies so far, but this is easily one of their most serious and ambitious works to date.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie worth seeing. It seems as though, for every good action film we get these days, there are five bad ones to take its place. To that end, it's a good thing that The Incredibles is one of the greats. Not only is it a fun movie, but it's also a smart one that demonstrates just how talented a director Brad Bird really is. It's not my favourite venture from the studio (that'd be Toy Story 3,) but it's still a mighty-fine one. Hats off to you, Pixar: you never fail to amaze with your splendour.<br/><br/>Final Score: 10/10."

","A great hero action family movie that lives to expectations. Great animation, great plot, (black) sense of humor, family trifles, and great characters.<br/><br/>The script has themes and projections of other superheroes movies, like Spiderman, Batman, or Spy Kids, among others, but all the elements are well mixed up, creating an organic original story that stands to the genre. This is a bunch of superhero stereotypes or deja-vues superbly reinvented. That's a merit of the director and of the script. On the other hand, the dubbing is really good too and very engaging.<br/><br/>I also loved the tones and retro look with golden colors, and a retro- ish clothing and hairdos, and the general atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>Despite being an animation movie, you soon will forget that and immerse yourself in the story."

","Pixar did it again! The Incredibles taken primarily as a stretching out on the superhero genre, is first rate entertainment. It also is a very witty commentary on family life. And it is fun fun fun! It seems superfluous to say how good the technical side of Pixar films are, because they all are great! They plan out every detail and edit the scenes together practically flawlessly. Incredibles is no exception. And they keep abreast of inside jokes and pop culture references without sacrificing the story and characters. All technical and story elements are at the disposal of the characters and not the other way around. That is the way to make touching movie experiences!<br/><br/>I grew up loving the superhero/James Bond genre, so this film has plenty of fun with that. ""Monolog-ing"" for example. But the Incredibles goes deeper by centering the film around the Parr family's relationships - especially between Bob and Ellen. This anchors the film in the audience's heart. <br/><br/>The Incredibles is very violent (especially near the end) and so would be too intense for little kids. But it is a great film from Pixar, the king of computer animation."

","The animation is excellent, the story is great, but the best thing of all is that it is really funny in many scenes. Not just family or kid funny, but funny for everyone, often specifically for the grown-ups. Of all the American animated films I've seen, which might be almost all of them, this is my favorite (I like some of Miyazaki's films even better, but he is bringing magic and wonderment in a surreal world instead of pure entertainment). You'll want to see this one even if you have no kids to watch it with. There's a lot of funny stuff, but Brad Bird's Edna character is the best. My daughter liked it well enough at 2 1/2 years of age that she asked to see it several times -- she gets some of the sight gags but she'll like it even better when she gets older. The robot is a little scary, but the rest of the movie is so much fun that kids instinctively know that nothing bad can happen."

","Most modern day superhero movies are kind of poor, bland scripts can ruin the overall joy of the superhero genre.<br/><br/>The thing Pixar has done with this film is not make an adaption of a massive comic book series, but create an original concept which revolutionises the superhero genre. As an audience we are treated to the 'Glory Days' of superheohood and the presentation is just stunning. Realistic visuals with a massive scape of the city, with fun heroes (Mr Incredible) and villains (Bomb Voyage). All this occurring with a beautiful jazz-orchestral soundtrack which is used in various parts of the film. This is used as an effective method of introducing the characters (including Frozone and Elastagirl).<br/><br/>After an unfortunate series of events the one amazing superheros are oppressed by the masses and are forced to behave like normal human beings, superpowers are considered to be disabilities rather than a gift. It becomes apparent that this is more than just a superhero movie as it covers a variety of themes such as an 'opressive government' in the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>We are then introduced to the rest of the main characters, 'Violet Power' a frustrated teenager who is shy but still wants to be recognised (ironic as she has the power of invisibility and force fields). Also her younger brother 'Dashel Power' who has the ability of super speed but can not express his enjoyment of running in sports days at risk of revealing his power. We can already see a 'Dysfunctional Family' sub-plot within the film which is presented in a rather amusing dining room argument scene.<br/><br/>'Bob Powel' (Previously Mr Incredible' is tired of his boring office worker job and attempts secret assignments under his families noses. This reveals a classic super villain known as 'Syndrome' who was incredibly well character developed by the Pixar team.<br/><br/>In conclusion both the Script, Visuals and Music is incredible and beats almost any other superhero movie in this current time. It is also a fresh direction for pixar as it focuses on a more serious plot. It is not as funny as some of the previous work of pixar but it is at the same production value of the other films."

","Following bad press and expensive lawsuits, superheroes are forced to give up crime-fighting and live anonymously. Bob Parr, aka Mr Incredible, settles down with his wife Helen, aka Elastigirl, and resigns himself to his new life as a humble insurance clerk. But secretly he yearns to resume his alter ego and save the world from evil once more <br/><br/>Another great movie from the Pixar animation studio, this is a very interesting mix of comic book capers and escapist spy movies, a sort of weird hybrid of James Bond and The Fantastic Four. The talented Bird (who also made The Iron Giant and Ratatouille) turns in a writer-director tour-de-force, with both a sensational, thrilling, funny, satirical story and a visually gobsmacking adventure. We know Mr Incredible is going to answer the call to save the world, but both the identity of his nemesis and the fact that he brings his family with him for the ride are strokes of genius. Even better is the visual treatment of Syndrome's eye-popping villain's lair, a gleaming subterranean fortress built into the side of a waterfall, complete with a high-speed monorail and a secret control room hidden behind a wall of lava. Michael Giacchino's giddy overblown orchestral music recalls the great adventure scores of John Barry or Jerry Goldsmith, and is a perfect accompaniment to the crazy frenetic action as Syndrome's minions pursue Dash across the surface of a crystal-blue lake. The entire voice cast are terrific, with Nelson striking just the right tone of dramatic pathos, Jackson supercool as the stylish Frozone, Lee adding a second great villain to his canon (the other being Azrael in Dogma) and Peña a sultry showstopper as the glamorous, green-eyed but ultimately good-hearted Mirage. Even Bird himself gets in on the act with an androgynous voice-over as the crazed midget fashion designer Edna Mode (who looks like the legendary Hollywood costumier Edith Head). As always, Pixar understand that great characters and great stories are what make great movies, and then overlay that with fabulous artistry, technology and style. Here is a film which entertains anyone, no matter what their age or background. All you need is an imagination."

","This is a movie that can be only described as INCREDIBLE!! Everything comes together in this movie. The family of superheroes reflects an actual family...the father is a strongman, protecting his family; the mom is elastic, being stretched in every direction to keep her family and children in check; the daughter is a shy person who shrinks and/or disappears; the son is a speed demon with energy to spare; etc., etc. They all come together to help save the world from the bad guys...just like a family should! The voice talent (Craig Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, on and on) was incredible (it's the only adjective I can think of!)...everybody matched their character. I'll forgive an early slow stretch (only a few minutes) because the rest overwhelmed it. This movie gets a 10 only because I can't give it a higher score!!"
"jimjo1216","Null","0","0","25 November 2009"," A thrilling action film that packs an emotional wallop
","THE INCREDIBLES is two hours of solid entertainment. It's got a little bit of everything, and should appeal to just about anyone. It's a kind of animated tribute to superheroes, while also being a movie about families. It's fun, it keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, it will make you laugh, it will make you tear up, and it's full of true-to-life moments.<br/><br/>The movie will satisfy anyone's needs for superhero action, featuring costumed crusaders using their extraordinary powers to save the day. But the film tries not to fall into the traps of superhero clichés. It even makes light of when villains ""monologue"", giving the heroes time to foil their plans. The movie keeps you on your toes. Just when you think something has happened, the tables are turned.<br/><br/>But THE INCREDIBLES really knows how to stir up a viewer's emotions, too. You feel for the characters. The superhero children are put in very real, life-threatening danger. You hold your breath. The father thinks he's lost his family. A wife worries about her marriage. A nefarious and murderous plot is revealed. The kids triumphantly discover their own capabilities, and not a moment too soon.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really hold back. It gets you concerned that something awful might happen, holding the tension. Brad Bird, who directed the film, did not come up through Pixar. He was an animation director in the industry who joined up with Pixar because he admired how they did things. (His earlier work includes THE IRON GIANT.) I think that might be why THE INCREDIBLES feels a bit darker than other Pixar films. It's rated PG. Most Pixar films, great as they are, seem overly kid-friendly and G-rated. THE INCREDIBLES is safe for kids, but it has an edge to it and it is still appealing to adult viewers.<br/><br/>And another thing the movie does so well, besides superhero action, is family matters. There are little moments that could have been taken from real life, from any of our real families. That makes the characters relatable. For instance, the bickering siblings at the dinner table. Or the mom who calls the dad to dinner while he's busy ""watching TV"". The shy teenage daughter who harbors a crush for a boy at school. The parents arguing over which exit to use on the expressway. To me, the family stuff is one of the film's strengths. It's the source for much of the emotional impact. Throughout the film, the characters are tested again and again, and we as viewers are genuinely concerned for them. Grown-up viewers (particularly parents, I'd wager) might connect more with the emotional family storyline, while the kids will enjoy the action. Different levels...<br/><br/>THE INCREDIBLES is kind of like a James Bond film. There are heavily guarded bases, secret hideouts, missile launches, exotic locales, and a great deal of sneaking around. The score by Michael Giacchino (which is excellent, by the way) seems to evoke some 007, too.<br/><br/>The movie is like a Bond film with a dash of ""Watchmen"" (superheroes being outlawed), a hint of the Fantastic Four (some of the powers, plus the superteam concept), and a family-oriented skew.<br/><br/>I really can't get over how great THE INCREDIBLES is, having just watched it for the first time in quite a while. It's fun and action-packed, and I love it for that. But it also really works up your emotions, getting you invested in the characters on the screen. It is enjoyable for the whole family, with something for kids as well as older, wiser adults. It's well-rounded. The opening prologue sets up the fictional world and gives a historical background to the movie. The music is great. The stylized end credits are visually awesome. It's an animated Pixar feature, but it's as exciting as any action/adventure film. It may not be as cutesy as other Pixar movies you may enjoy, but THE INCREDIBLES is an excellent film all-around. It's a blast."

","The Incredibles is not just an impeccably crafted entertainment package, it is self-mocking and ironic, qualities that rarely inhabit the American soul. It is a scintillatingly gifted production, but as so often, being American, it wants to supply more than just enough, so it's a wee bit long, and a wee bit convoluted. But these are only quibbles: it's hard to imagine anything more compelling for the juvenile mind --- except experiencing it in three dimensions. The sound is super: in our home we have cinema surround-sound and some of the effects were highly dynamic, zapping your ears as well as your eyes. Highly recommended for wild distraction and some moments of hilarity. Definitely watch it beside your children."

The likes of FLASH GORDON, BUCK ROGERS,THE PHANTOM,MANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN, JUNGLE JIM, SECRET AGENT X9, PRINCE VALIANT, TIM TYYLER'S LUCK, DICK TRACY and SMILIN' JACK came from the pages of Daily and Sunday Newspapers.

Because of the truly universal recognition of all these super hero types, the genera is known to about everyone. There is little need for any elaborate origin story. Instead, the production team chose to pick out a couple of common every day problems and foibles of mankind; putting an analytical microscope on the situation and just how a Super Hero family would handle.<br/><br/>THE MOST CARE was used in the visuals (in both the Background ""Scenery""; as well as the Character Design. Physical types of the characters and their voices were matched up with the Super Hero's name in order to make the finished product one, cohesive and believable unit; all within the premise of a Super Hero World.<br/><br/>THE CASTING OF VOICE Actors was done to a near perfection. With the playbill headed up by Craig T. Nelson (Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible), Holly Hunter (Helen Hunter/Elastigirl) and, in an excellent sort of Comic Relief role, Samuel L.

The cast is rounded out by: Jason Lee, Dominique Louis, Teddy Newton, Jean Sincere, Eli Fucile, Maeve Andrews, Wallace and Spencer Fox; along with an extensive group of supporting players. We had special Guest Star, John Ratzenberger, as 'the Underminer', at the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>MUCH TO OUR amusement, the twin bugaboos of Mother Nature and Father Time are gaged along with the Cartoon Worls's version of just what would happen to Super Heroes with the pre-eminence of out of control civil suits; known as the lack of torte reform in our 3 dimensional Planet Earth.<br/><br/>THE WHOLE FAMILY of Super Powered folks gets into the act and weathers the overall crises with grace and pride in a job well-done. The Producers even do what is right at the end of the adventure; in setting up the premises for a sequel.<br/><br/>C'MON YOU GUYS at Disney and Pixar-let's have the next installment already!

","My Take: It's a fun and funny animated comic-book entertainment with enough eye candy to give you a toothache.<br/><br/>The days of FLASH GORDON is back with Pixar's THE INCREDIBLES, a fast-paced and highly entertaining take on the comic-book superhero fad. While big studios are making larger projects as SPIDER-MAN and a new entry in the BATMAN franchise, Pixar as made a worthy contender to any of these hits. It's packed with adventure, all-out action, intrigue and comedy, melded together with the best in computer animation has to offer. It's wild fun for kids and parents alike.<br/><br/>After years of service, superheros Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) and Elastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter) are kept under supervision under the Superhero Relocation Program. Forced to live mundane lives as a working father, Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, longs for action, and gets his chance when a mysterious message gets in his hands, only to discover that what he really needs right now is a little family cooperation when an evil new villain named Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), who was formerly a superhero fanatic, now a crazed baddie who wants to get his share of the superhero limelight.<br/><br/>The rest is a ride. The animation is crisp and active, with sequences that rival anything audiences have seen on any SPIDERMAN's or SUPERMAN's out there. The voice cast is familiar but never distracting (Samuel L. Jackson's voice performance as the super-cool hero Frozone is a favorite), lending their voices to some funny and colorful characters. Director Brad Bird may have had a kid's movie in mind while making this, but he packs in enough humor and adult appeal to make it perfect entertainment for the whole bunch. It ain't the best Pixar film however, but that doesn't matter. It's entertainment nonetheless.<br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 out of 5."

","15 years after he stopped being a superhero, Bob Parr finds his job and life boring and when he is called to investigate a robot, his superhero life remerges.<br/><br/>The people behind Pixar are never to be underestimated. Whether they are exploring human's regard of life (Wall-E) or examining the sadness of children outgrowing their toys (Toy Story) the imagination is always juxtaposed against an important real life meaning, which is also now a huge dedication to Walt Disney and this particular picture brad Bird for a fast and relative action adventure.<br/><br/>Though The Incredibles' inside message may not be as obvious or as significant as those mentioned, it is relative when looking at the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>Starting off with Mr Incredible stopping a crime whilst in a rush to get to an important destination we are thrust into a cool and collected approach to the life of a superhero. The car is cooler than the Bat-mobile and the strength of the character is better than the Hulk's, not to forget the humour is better than both franchises put together.<br/><br/>Then the important messages come across. An unfortunate turn of events sees superheroes forced into hiding and are no longer able to fight crime and save lives. The rising levels of crime and the poor approach by the force shows a political nasty side of the law, choosing their pride over people's well being.<br/><br/>What is perhaps most touching about this picture is the look on heroes. Seeing a personal hero in the flesh and being turned away without regard for feeling is a crushing moment and the relevance is significant as it can change a person into the worst possible being.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a fast flowing adventure, looking at the importance of saving lives and also the importance of family. Though the family side of this film feels cheesy and over dramatic at turns, there is no denying its significance, especially considering the target audience is family.

","The movie was totally incredible, awesome and cool. The best character was dash with his powers. Frozone was also superb and incredible.

I like Syndrome's gadgets and his powers. When dash runs in the water, he moves like a motor boat. Jack-Jack is also superb with his powers. Frozone is too awesome with his Ice glide and Freeze Ray. The Omnidroids are the best robots. They are powers are very aggressive. The battle between Mr. Incredible and Omnidroid 8 is totally awesome. When Elastigirl, Violet and Dash are flying in a jet, that scene is totally thrilling and awesome. When, Elastigirl passes the security guards, that scene is totally incredible. When the Parr family is united they had a fight between the guards, that scene is totally cool. When, Dash and Violet are running away from a guard by forming the Incredi-Ball, that time two velocipods come to attack and this Incredi-Ball hit the velocipods and destroy them, that scene is totally awesome.

","I know it sounds lame but the Incredibles is a masterpiece of movie-making. OK so the Spidermans, Batman, Iron Man etc. are thrilling and epic and so on, but The Incredibles looks at the superhero genre from a different angle, superheroes are outlawed and forced to live normal lives. This is where the whole Incredible family comes in. They are 'accidently on purpose' called in to stop a crisis on an island somewhere that spread to, uhhh, a city somewhere. I forget where. The film is fantastic, 'acting' great, the plot to eliminate all 'supers' works well and every character is great. Watch out for Edna, a great character they should have developed more. Overall, a resounding 10 out of 10 Incredible!"

","Anyone ready for another kid-based, non-violent movie by Pixar? Well, sorry-we have a teen-based, violent movie by Pixar. Oh well-it's still a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>I didn't see this in theaters(unfortunately, my little brother, who was 6 at the time, didn't want to see it, so we didn't go), but when it came out On Demand(yeah, I have Comcast), I saw it and was immediately HOOKED! The plot was well put out, and imaginative-you can never guess what will happen. Even if it's close, the unexpected will happen.<br/><br/>(SPOILER WARNING-Do not go on if you have not seen the movie)<br/><br/>So what's the downside? Two letters-P and G. I have nothing against PG movies-it's just the fact of a Pixar PG movie that kinda worries me. It is violent, as you'll see in the parental guide. One thing that surprised me was the use of blood in the movie, when the giant robot sliced Mr. Incredible's arm(but that's not a major complaint-there was some blood in Finding Nemo, a G rated Pixar movie).<br/><br/>But other than that, it's a great film to watch with your family. I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 4-there are some explosions and scary, shall we say, ""pop-ups"", plus the already mentioned ""scene""-but everyone else will love this movie. Too bad the later superhero movies turn out to be not as great. I seriously can't think of a better way to kill an afternoon."

","At first I was really upset with the makers of this story, as the Characters have powers from both Marvel and DC Comics. But, when I finally saw the movie on cable, I had to admit, I actually liked it, a lot! Let me lay out their powers: Mr. Incredible: 1. Super strength (ala DC Comics Superman, Uncle Sam) Ms. Incredible: 1. Stretching ability (ala Marvel's Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, DC's Elongated Man) Violet: 1. Ability to generate force fields and go invisible (ala Marvel's Sue Richards of the Fantastic Four and Jane Grey of the X-Men) Dash: 1. Super Speed (ala DC's Kid Flash) Jack-Jack: 1. Morphing Ability (his name escapes me, but I remember the Character ""The Element Man"" - I believe DC comics). After I got over my ""prejudice,"" I found the movie very well done...they spent a buck (or two) making this feature. Edna's security system just cracks me up! Finally, Congress should be mandated to watch Mr. Syndrome's character and learn from his dialogue. Particularly the line - ""When everyone's Super - no one will be..."" You see we have had Nuclear Weapons advantage over the rest of the world for over fifty years. That is coming rapidly to an end, as now everyone wants in, whether we approve or not. So, to repeat: ""When everyone's Super - No one will be"" I hope somebody heard what they are trying to say - I did! Five stars!!"

","There are elements of the animation in this film that are quite staggering. The hair and fabric especially look so lifelike that you begin to wonder where it's all going to end. I caught a bit of a Formula 1 race the other day; the camera was located in the driver's cab so that we could see what he saw and my first thought was how much it looked like a video game. Thankfully, the likes of Pixar aren't content to simply amaze its audience with its computer images but also devotes time and care to the storyline of superheroes trying to fit into an ordinary world.<br/><br/>The film, although immersed in bright and saturated colours, has a dark undertone that will fly over the heads of the kids at which it is primarily aimed to hit the their adult companions square between the eyes. We're all super-heroes in our own eyes  or we'd all like to be  and our powers are constrained only by the mundane chains of job and mortgage with which we bind ourselves. Couple that with a yearning for the glory days and you have either a recipe for depression or a launch pad for wild fantasy. The film acknowledges the fact that we're all different, but doesn't patronise its audience by pretending we're all special. It's OK to try to be something more than we are, just stay within society's rules and values as you try.<br/><br/>The film provides a few belly-laughs too. Worth catching."

","Had it been done as a live-action picture, I don't think ""The Incredibles"" would have been nearly as successful (in a worst-case scenario, it probably would have wound up a dumb parody, a la this year's ""Superhero Movie""); the interplay between live action and CG remains a tricky balance that few filmmakers can convincingly pull off. Thankfully, writer/director Brad Bird has taken his years of creativity (as a longtime contributor to ""The Simpsons"") and poured every drop into one of the best computer-animated films I've ever seen--while the title may sound pompous and hyperbolic, ""The Incredibles"" delivers high-quality thrills and laughs on an epic scale. Part of the fun lies in Bird's own lampooning of superhero clichés while developing a narrative that draws a very valid conclusion about the dangers of fanboy-love. The Incredibles themselves are a family defined by their super-powers: Bob Paar (aka Mr. Incredible, a Superman surrogate, voiced by Craig T. Nelson), his wife, Helen (aka Elastigirl; Holly Hunter), daughter Violet (able to turn herself invisible and put up force-fields), and sons Dash (named thus for his ability to run super-fast) and Jack-Jack (whose hidden talent is saved for the very end); when obsessive fan Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) takes his own superhero-fascination to extreme lengths, it is up to the quirky family (called out of exile after being blacklisted) to put a stop to his plans. The voice-actors fully inhabit their animated counterparts, nailing the human imperfections and weaknesses that eventually equate ""saving the fam"" as an act just as important as Saving the World. While I had considerably less love for Bird's ""Ratatouille,"" ""The Incredibles"" is still a beacon of promise for an extensive animation career to come."
"SevenStitches","9","0","0","30 June 2008"," Smart film, animation or otherwise
","This is possibly the most intelligently made animated film I've ever seen, along with been one of the most down to earth entertaining ones to boot.<br/><br/>Viewing the life of superheroes in a previously unexplored fashion, ""The Incredibles"" functions as not just a self aware parody on regular superhero clichés but also as a genuinely thought provoking study on how the constraints of mediocrity in society can sometimes oppress those who wish to excel and reach higher heights deserving of their potential. That and the jealousy that can emerge from those that look on these individuals with envious eyes. On top of all that you have a wonderful comedy dealing with the obstacles of middle aged superheroes past their prime and handling normal family life. All of this is exceptionally covered without any dilution, with all the right questions explored and all the right funny bones tickled with witty dialogue, fantastic vocal performances, wonderfully developed characters and an engaging story line. It truly is a film for all ages.<br/><br/>I haven't even mentioned the unbelievable animation, Pixar's best at the time (and still a marvel three films later) that allowed them to render impressively varied vistas, beautifully expressive characters and spectacular action sequences that rival the best of the live action superhero genre.<br/><br/>Director Brad Bird would go on to direct Pixar's ""Ratatouille"" (2007) with a far more subdued hand but nevertheless retaining a lot of the wit that he showcased as a writer here. However by a very small thread I'd tip this to be his best work out of the three films he's directed (his first was the excellent ""The Iron Giant"" (1999)) and it's also probably Pixar's greatest achievement too. Now lets see if Andrew Stanton's ""WALL-E"" can top it."

","Mister Incredible is a superhero at the top of his game, along with the likes of Frozone, Elastigirl and various others they keep people safe from various super villains. However, when Mister Incredible saves someone who does not want to be saved, it opens the floodgates for more superheroes to be sued by an ungrateful America that views them with envy, causing the government to ban superheroes and for their secret identities to become their only identities.<br/><br/>In this, Brad Bird's inspired take on the superhero genre, we see what happens when Superheroes have to settle down and become ordinary people, the dialogue is excellent and the situations superb. The arrival of the supervillain Syndrome (I am your number one fan) with his secret base on a volcanic island being an element that is clearly borrowed heavily from the Bond films and the music reflects that. The performances are all great, with Jason Lee excelling as Syndrome, whose idea to dispose of all the supers and then make himself out to be a new superhero but for all the cleverness of it, one of the sad things about the film is that the best animated human at this stage of computer animation was still Boo from ""Monsters Inc"" and some of the mixing of different size elements does not quite work as well as it should, with squash and stretch techniques also taking something away from pulling you in fully.<br/><br/>The other thing about the film that lets it down is the editing, with clearly some scenes that could be tightened up for the sake of a quicker film that would have made for a better film. The ending also seems to keep on going and going and going when it could have been that much slicker.<br/><br/>Overall a pretty good film. Not the best film Pixar have made, but a pretty god step on the road to further glory."

The Incredibles deals with family issues and quarreling in a way that gets through to both adults and children it is wonderful. Being a student of animation myself I found this film to be an incredible achievement with its ability to use human like forms and animate them so well. Brad Bird who not only directed this, but provided the incredibly hilarious voice for Edna Mode created a wonderful family of supers that we can love and feel for their rather different problems.

","The Incredibles describes a period in the life of two ex-super-heroes and their young family. When Mr. Incredible loses his ""normal life"" job, he discovers a suspicious job offer that requires his super abilities. This brings him out of retirement without him explaining it to his family. Eventually, the job develops into a large scale scheme. This is mostly done to set up a rivalry between Mr. Incredible and Syndrome, a troubled villain whose anger was spawned from Mr. Incredible's rejection of him as a sidekick.<br/><br/>Syndrome is a stereotypical villain: a selfish and remorseless man that somehow has access to a lot of technology and employees to carry out damage onto society. He is flat and unlikable. The good guys (primarily the Incredibles family) are also very stereotyped, and do not really show any deep emotion. I guess it is supposed to reflect what we expect super-heroes to be like, but it leaves a little void when trying to understand them. Even so, the characters are used creatively in the action sequences, especially the ones that combine all the abilities together. The animation was top notch quality and flowed smoothly. The music was exactly what you expect super-hero music to be. It went good with the action sequences, but not much else, and got dry by the end.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a great kids/family movie, but does not have enough essence to make an impact on older viewers. There were some good parody moments and unique action sequences, as well as plenty of comedy (I loved it when Syndrome remarked ""You caught me monologuing"").

But when it came out, something got me wanting to go see it, so we did.<br/><br/>This movie sort of re-introduced me to the awesome world of animation. The story itself keeps the same morals every Pixar films teach children, but amps them up and shows them to us in a whole new way. This movie is probably more for children 7 and up. Not because it's inappropriate for small children, but because the small children would be bored for the first half of the film. One thing I've found is that small children are not entertained by a good story but by loud sounds and flashing colors. And in the beginning--apart from a quick prologue--this movie doesn't have any ""action."" Some of the struggles that Bob goes through would probably not be understood by a child under the age of seven. However, the later half of the movie is fast-paced and action packed. The story is interesting for older audience members and the noises are now louder and a lot of explosions and stuff flash across the screen, making it interesting for babies. :) I think the only bad thing about this movie is it's pacing toward the beginning. It's extremely slow and, even to an older audience member, it starts to get a little boring.<br/><br/>So if you want to see a fresh, original, action-packed, and technically brilliant film, then see this film.<br/><br/>-Chris"

","Very good movie!!!I like It very much.Before I watch It I don't believe that's a good movie but when I watch It I change my opinion.It has very good effects and very fantasy.In these years were made very movies like this and some of them aren't so good.It's funny in the most moments and has hidden message.I read It like ""The weak can be powerful and the powerful can be weak."" I'm not sure...maybe I see It just because I have a very big fantasy.I hope Brad Bird make another episode of ""The Incredibles"".I vote with 8 because the movie is little overburdened and has to many superfluous emotions.I think that's stupid for a movie like this but I'm glad that I watch It.I hope You enjoy It like me.It's very fun."

","The Parrs aren't what you'd call a normal family. Dad Bob has super strength and mom Helen can stretch her body like a rubber band. Daughter Violet can will herself into invisibility, son Dash has super speed, and lil' Jack Jack... well, if you haven't seen it, I wouldn't dream of spoiling it. Together they are The Incredibles, a spandex-clad superhero squad determined to save the world from the forces of evil while still making it home at a decent hour.<br/><br/>THE INCREDIBLES is one of the most fun and entertaining animated features in years. Visually, it's a breathtaking treat for the eyes. The computer animation team managed to depict even the finest details without hindering the Saturday morning cartoon feel that gives the film so much of its charm. It's simply amazing to watch. The sound is equally superb, with high marks going to a casting team that found a perfect audio mate for each character.<br/><br/>Of course that wouldn't matter much without a good script and original, creative dialog. In that regard, THE INCREDIBLES scores again. The writing here is particularly sharp. Unlike a lot of family movies, where kids laugh at the kid stuff and parents laugh at the stuff junior is too young to get, the jokes here are broad and funny whether you're 8 or 88. And unlike so many animated efforts before it, THE INCREDIBLES is never weighed down by the serious, life-lesson moments, nor is it heavy-handed with its morality.<br/><br/>THE INCREDIBLES was a well-deserved box office smash. Much like MONSTERS INC. and SHREK, grown-ups will be surprised at how much they enjoy it, and the kiddies... well, you can expect this one to be a constant presence in the DVD player."

","I must say, when I heard Pixar was doing an original Super hero film, I had my doubts. But after I saw ""The Incredibles"", I was begging for a sequel. The movie starts out simply enough, Mr. Incredible fighting crime, and when he tries to stop someone from committing suicide, he gets sued for injuring said person which forces all super-powered people to go into hiding. Years later, Mr. Incredible has ""settled down"" and had a family... all of whom have superpowers too. One day, an old friend calls on him and creates him a new costume and is then sent on a mission. When his family finds out, they go after him, creating a team much like Marvel's Fantastic 4. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Pixar films and the Fantastic 4, you will love this movie!"

"DavidSim240183","9","0","0","29 May 2006"," Pixar does it again!
","Pixar are undoubtedly the kings of computer animation. They have a truly magical touch, and have created some really memorable characters from Buzz Lightyear to Finding Nemo's Dory. But with The Incredibles they have broken new ground again, and crafted a superhero story in the everyday world but with a touch of fantasy.<br/><br/>Geared towards adults this time (although kids will still get a kick out of it), what separates The Incredibles from Pixar's previous work is the fact that it's about people this time. Not toys. Not monsters. Not fish. But it still has that important dose of fantasy that makes The Incredibles recognisably Pixar.<br/><br/>Mr Incredible, aka Bob Parr (voiced by Craig T Nelson) is one of the world's most revered superheroes. With his super strength, he has saved everyone from train crash victims to a cat up a tree. And he still finds time to get married to the super stretchy Elastigirl (voiced brilliantly by Holly Hunter). After a restless ten minutes filled with mock interviews and minor heroics, the film then picks up steam with a grainy B&W newsreel.<br/><br/>Mr I is sued by someone who tried faking suicide just to cash in. That is until Mr I stepped in and saved the day. Soon other people start filing lawsuits against him, and this eventually spreads to other superheroes too. Finally, the government imposes a restraining order on all superheroes who are forced to go into hiding, using their secret identities full-time, but keeping their superpowers under wraps.<br/><br/>15 years later, Bob is miserable as an insurance sales adjuster. He has let himself go, lusts for the glory days and gets no satisfaction from his job. Elastigirl has adjusted to suburban living better than Bob and raises their three kids. Violet, a shy, withdrawn girl who can turn invisible and create forcefields. Dash who can run at superhuman speed. And Jack-Jack, who's still a baby and hasn't manifested his powers yet.<br/><br/>When Bob is fired from his job after he can take no more, he is contacted by the beautiful Mirage (voiced by Elizabeth Pena). She knows his secret, and offers him a job, destroying a dangerous robot. His confidence abounds, he gets into shape, and acquires a new suit from designer Edna Mode (voiced hilariously by director Brad Bird).<br/><br/>But Mr I's employer is setting him up for a trap. Mirage really works for Syndrome. He was once a number one fan of Mr I. But when Bob refused to let him work with him, he lashed out on his own, and became a super-villain. He intends to unleash a legion of robots to conquer the world. When Elastigirl discovers Bob is being held at Syndrome's fortified island hideaway, she swings into action with the kids to stop Syndrome.<br/><br/>What distinguishes The Incredibles from other recent animated fare is its sly intelligence. It has some brilliant ideas such as different people living in the epitome of suburban conformity. Not to mention people having to conceal their powers, even if they didn't want them to begin with. There is so much potential here, one wishes The Incredibles was a TV Series. I'd never get tired of their exploits.<br/><br/>Brad Bird the director, also known for the excellent and underrated The Iron Giant has indulged his love for retro 50s futuristic decor. Syndrome's island hideaway is like something out of a James Bond film. With pod monorails, wind tunnels and crashing waterfalls, the set-pieces are extraordinary. It doesn't quite elicit the awe and stunning beauty of Finding Nemo, but The Incredibles is still one of the most amazing looking films around.<br/><br/>And the cast is great too. Mr I is a poignant character. Someone who was on top of the world and lost it all. Dash and Violet make a believable brother and sister. And in Violet's case, her power of invisibility is an excellent metaphor for loneliness. Syndrome is an oddly amusing villain. You get the impression he was the last person to be picked for the football teams in school, and now he's paying back the world in spades.<br/><br/>But the scene stealers are Holly Hunter and Brad Bird. Hunter lends her memorable voice and makes Elastigirl admirably feisty. She gets a lot of great scenes both in and out of the costume. Elastigirl deserves her own franchise. And Brad Bird is marvellous as the costume designer Edna Mode. With opinions on everything, and fashion sense to boot, she is one of Pixar's most memorable creations.<br/><br/>But The Incredibles has a few flaws. Some of the action scenes get a bit hectic, and fellow retired superhero Frozone is an unnecessary character. The Incredibles are a much more interesting family unit. Since he's afforded such small screen time, you wonder what was the point of having him in the film. Also I would have liked to have seen more of Mirage. In true James Bond fashion, she falls for Mr I and helps him escape. Then she just disappears.<br/><br/>But in all other regards, The Incredibles is a clever and engaging adventure filled with great ideas. Also it never talks down to kids, and if these characters die, they're really dead. The Incredibles represents a new era for Pixar, and is just as impressive as anything else they've done. And the music's great too.<br/><br/>Here's to the future of Pixar."

","Movies just don't get any better than this! Brilliant concept (litigious Americans sue super heroes into retirement!), wry social commentary, unforgettable characters (ex.

What I especially liked was how funny it was, without resorting to cheap self-referential references as so many new animated movies do (ex. Shark Tale, which was egregious.) <br/><br/>In case you are not familiar, the plot is basically that super heroes have been driven into ""witness protection"" style programs because they got sued so many times. Mr. Incredible and his family are now trying to live a normal suburban life, when he gets a mysterious contact... Should he remain incognito, or resume his super identity once again? <br/><br/>When this movie is released on a new HD format (ex HD DVD or BluRay) then I will buy it and a compatible player!"

","First off, Toy Story was good. A Bug's Life was better. Monster's Inc. surpassed them both. However, The Incredibles out did them all and by far is the best of all the Pixar/Disney cartoons. The key idea I got from this movie is that having a family is the best adventure to have even if you are a superhero. The characters are of fine quality and each has their own power that makes them each unique in their own way. First we have Mr. Incredible, the father figure trying to recapture his superhero days in a society where superheroes can't use their powers. Also realizes that you don't need much to be a superhero. Next we have Elastic Girl, Incredible's wife that tries to keep the family together and rescue her husband from danger. Then we have the kids, one who is super fast and the other who can become invisible and make force-fields. Finally, Fro-Zone, a family friend to the Incredible family and sidekick to Mr. Incredible, who has the ability to freeze anything he touches.<br/><br/>The movie is action packed from start to finish with Incredible and Fro-Zone saving people behind their family's backs to the Incredible family united taking on the sinister Syndrome and his evil machines. The theme about this movie has to be that you can't change who you are and that family and friends will always there. Be sure to catch this movie on DVD and watch the hilarious outtakes and extras. Again, this is the best Pixar/Disney cartoon out there."

","Lovely, When a group of superheroes are forced into early retirement, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) settles into a normal life as Bob Paar, insurance claims adjustor. His wife Helen (Holly Hunter), formerly known as Elastigirl, adapts to life away from the crime-fighting arena much better than Bob as she focuses on raising their three children (2 with noticeable ""special powers"" they have to learn to control in public). Bob still itches for action and sneaks out with his old pal Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) for a regular guys' night out of rescuing and crime-prevention.<br/><br/>When Bob is offered the chance to once again don his Mr. Incredible suit, he jumps at the chance - not knowing that he is being sucked into an evil plan by an old fan (Jason Lee).

Bob was known as Mr. Incredible in his years as a superhero and Helen was Elastigirl. their two children, Violet and Dash, also have superpowers: Violet can become invisible at will and Dash can run faster than any normal child. They are in hiding because supers have been accused of hurting people more than helping them. Bob,however, pines for the glory days and would give anything to relive them. When he gets an invitation for a new job after being fired from his old one, Insuracare (His insuracare boss is voiced by Wallace Shawn), by a mysterious woman named Mirage, he feels as if his glory life has been regained, but soon, he learns it's all a ruse to trap him. The villain: Syndrome (Jason Lee of My Name is Earl). It isn't too long before Helen and the kids find out and they (after Violet hires a babysitter for jack Jack, featured in the animated Short, Jack Jack Attack, a hilarious feature on the DVD)rush to his aid. Can they save him before Syndrome releases the ultimate weapon of Destruction-The Omnidroid?! <br/><br/>Fave Character: Violet Parr, because she is the one I can most relate to: A teenager who struggles to find herself, especially if you have superpowers.

Life was super right until he was sued by a suicide diver who didn't want to get saved. While other superheros are getting sued here and there. This lead to a conclusion where people don't want anymore superheros when crime seemed to decreased more than average. The super heroes now have to face the rest of their lives as their alter egos. With the government protecting their private lives.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible aka Bob Parr his alter ego is now settling down with a normal life with his wife Helen aka Elastagirl with a family to raise. They have a son, an infant son and a teenage daughter. They developed unique powers of their own but they were told not to use them at all or their secret will be reviewed.<br/><br/>Bob Parr misses his hero days.

","The Incredibles was a good old fashioned family computer generated graphics movie. The target audience for the film is easily identifiable, but that still does not take the humor and enjoyment away from us older folks.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible does a great job with never letting go of his desire to be a big buff manly man and so becomes the hero of the movie, but how his entire family becomes involved with him in the process is pretty creative. I will have to say that the very end of the movie was a bit dumb, however.<br/><br/>Pixar is totally, obviously, no doubt at all, hoping that this movie will offer a sequel in the near future with an emphasis placed on the developing powers of the youngest child of the family. However entertaining this might be, and there definitely is some potential for it, they did not have to make it so blatantly obvious in the movie.<br/><br/>It is a bit different judging a movie when the merits of the actors are basically dependent on the abilities of the graphics designers to convey feeling and fluid motion.

"bdl7431","7","0","0","12 March 2006"," Good - but not great!
","The Incredibles is a good film - but I don't think it is as good that it should make the top 250 of IMDb.<br/><br/>The film has some premises and plots that are original enough - superheros are forced underground because their actions, which inevitably lead to massive property destruction and other interferences, have resulted in enough lawsuits that they were banded. Added to this is an over-anxious fan, who takes his hero worship to the point that he wants to destroy the superheros, and very nearly succeeds, all the while becoming a superhero through the use of devices he invented himself. And finally, two of the superheros had gotten married and had super kids. This presents a large, and frankly entertaining, subplot to the film as we superimpose situation comedy family life over the nominally perfect world that superheros are usually portrayed as having.<br/><br/>The problem I have with the film, as noted by another reviewer, is that these elements are overshadowed by the larger action sequences, which are violent and tend to be based on other films. Dash's sequence while he is running through the jungle, for example, seems to be virtually identical to the Princess Leia/Luke Skywalker/Imperial troopers floating motorcycle sequence in ""Return of the Jedi"". The robot that Syndrome uses seems to be taken from the classic Jonny Quest episode ""The Robot Spy"". While I have no problem with borrowing from other films/sources, I prefer it to be done for satire reasons - this was not the case here.<br/><br/>I will admit - the animation keeps getting better and better - the facial expressions are the best I have seen yet in a Pixar film.<br/><br/>So, a good film certainly - but not an excellent film. And the violence would discourage me from showing to a very young audience."

The film begins simple enough: a young Bob Parr, or Mr. Incredible, who marries a superhero friend, Elastigirl. They later have three kids, Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack, who is still a baby. Dash is my favorite character. His power is speed, and I could really use speed since I'm the slowest guy in my class. Violet and Dash at first detest each other, but then they later save each other's lives several times each. Jack-Jack is too young to talk, and his powers aren't revealed until near the end. But he is sooooooooooooooo cute. Helen is a good mother, but she can be impatient at times. Bob is a little obese, but that's okay, because even he's not perfect. Frozone has the coolest power. He can throw ice from his fingertips. He would be an Olympic Gold Medalist, because he did a great job with that snowboard. Mr. Huph is a very short employer, but he sure has a big mouth. Voice by Wally Shawn. (Rex in Toy Story 1 and 2) Mirage is a nice-looking woman, but she can be brain-washed if you do it right.

","You've got to admit it. The Incredibles is pretty incredible. It's about family of supers who seem to have somehow become super powerful by copying heroes from comics.

","Imagine Pixar making one of their classic animated films but gearing it to an age group a few years older than their usual one-movie-fits-all demographic. With ""The Incredibles,"" via a slightly advanced though not unpredictable plot-line and mature characterizations, writer/director Brad Bird has delivered such a film. This very engaging, fast-paced film is not for all ages, but for the 10-yr-old and above crowd it is entertaining, probably even intriguing.<br/><br/>The story goes something like this. <br/><br/>Bob & Helen Parr are ex-super heroes who, via a string of improbable law suits brought against all super heroes from insufferable plaintiffs, have been relegated to the Feds witness-protection program. Destined to live out their lives in obscurity, they reside in Anywheresville, USA, Bob toiling as an insurance claims handler, Helen doing her bit as housewife. Together they are raising their offspring: Violet, a raven-haired, wall-flower, teenager; Dashiell, aka ""Dash,"" a precocious 9-yr-old; and their infant son, Jack Jack.<br/><br/>Naturally, their destiny changes when a mysterious, high-paying client establishes communication with Bob, aka ""Mr. Incredible,"" encouraging him to supplant his meager income with some lucrative super-hero work vanquishing potential threats to humanity. Bob, who moonlights with his ex-super hero buddy, aka ""Frozone,"" listening to police and fire department dispatches on his CB radio before racing off to do sub rosa pro bono super-hero work, is all ears. <br/><br/>Eventually Bob's secret super-hero as Mr. Incredible pits him against a rival whose powers are vast. Though these powers are all the result of inventions, they are far superior to Mr. Incredible's God-given gift of incredibleness, which, for all intents and purposes provides the super-hero with little more than super-human strength that enables him to sustain major butt-whippings until he can figure out how to out-wit or trick his opponent du jour. Seeking to exact punishment for a childhood insult, Mr. Incredible's rival captures.<br/><br/>That action draws Helen Parr, aka ""Elastigirl,"" (her powers stem from super-human flexibility) back into the super-hero game. It also permits the Parr's gifted children, conniving ""Dash"" and horse-eyed Violet, to use the talents that they have had to suppress all their lives. <br/><br/>Dash's gift is super-human foot and hand speed. He would easily win every track race at school, if his parents would only permit him to do so. <br/><br/>Violet's more complex gifts are grafted from her circumspect, shy and inquisitive personality. Like any teenager who considers herself to be a nerd or geek or unattractive, Violet's every action is wrought from serious introspection. In some instances her motis operandi would be to simply disappear, in other instances, owing to her profound want to protect those she loves, she would want nothing but to shelter them from harm. Appropriately her gifts from the gods are the ability to disappear or the capability to throw an impregnable force-field around herself and family whenever the situation calls for it.<br/><br/>Together ""The Incredibles"" go to battle against Mr. Incredible's rival, who, of course, is also out to take over the world. I need not tell you who wins that battle.<br/><br/>The film's concentration on the development of each member of the Parr family elevates it from your simple Pixar-esquire, free-wheeling, family film to an unique animated film about an intricate, modest family of would-be super-heroes hoping to live a normal life out of the spotlight. Intertwined with Pixar's usual off-the-charts animation this development helps ""The Incredibles"" evolve into a film worthy of its title: incredible."

Everything about the plot is easily predictable, mainly because the ""hints"" they throw at you are so big they're not really hints.

The Incredibles sees Pixar step it up a gear with even more complex shapes and textures (which left me in awe of computer aided design) and the story is just great fun. Holly Hunter is so convincing as the worrying mum and the baby is actually quite adorable! I was left in stitches at times in this movie. It has all the humour of Finding Nemo and A Bugs Life yet it still leaves you hovering on the edge of your seat with anticipation. I especially found the character Edna hilarious- all the characters fit their stereotypes so well and yet they add to them too. But beware Disney fans. This partnership with Pixar looks to be making classic Disney animation a thing of the past and I for one miss those days- Beauty and the Beast was just as much fun for me.

Then the Disney offerings that had no life, cardboard backdrops, color that did not live, characters that made no sense. The only reason I saw ""Beauty and the Beast"" was because someone else paid for it and I still felt it was too expensive for me. There was no background to enrich the wonderful story, same with Mulan. In short, Steve Jobs, who grew up on excellence instills it in his people, and like Walt, will not let them stagnate.

","What and idea! What happens when a superhero gets obsolete and becomes domesticated. This is the theme of this Disney/Pixar animated movie and the premise is nothing short of brilliant. Although, there are thousands of people working on this kind of movie, the major credit only goes to one person, the director Brad Bird. Bird was a consultant and sometimes director of the Simpsons but you can't really compare the two.<br/><br/>The voice cast is a little unusual this time. Although Holly Hunter is very famous here in Denmark, Craig T. Nelson is practically unknown to many, at least if you haven't seen the dreadful films like Troop Beverly Hills or Action Jackson. Usually, Disney get the big stars to do voice-overs but I think it was a refreshing change to have a voice that was not immediately recognizable. The children are also great and the voice of the little old lady reminds you a little of Linda Hunt (the weird little dwarf who got an Oscar for playing a man).<br/><br/>But as many Disney films the story could not exist without top-notch animation and this movie delivers in spades. It is the most visual dazzling spectacle to this date and where Dreamworks animation is not at all bad either, there is something spectacular about Disney as it always has been. Maybe it's because Disney and especially Pixar uses screamingly bright colours whereas Dreamworks' are more muted. All this goes at an agonizingly fast pace, the fastest yet and the puns and innuendos come fast and furious. This was by all means a well deserved Oscar-winner and I don't think it will be the last. I have seen the trailer for ""Chicken Little"" and it looks much more simple but with Disney you can never tell."

","The Incredibles is a fantasy, a study in what makes a true hero, a superbly done animation, and a real story. How did they achieve all of these things, and in an era of greed and blockbuster-oriented movies-by-committee? Disney/Pixar gave writer/director Brad Bird the freedom to fully exploit his considerable talents, and we have this resulting masterpiece.<br/><br/>When I first heard of this movie, I assumed it was a children's film and put it on my back burner list of movies to eventually see. When I finally got a hold of the DVD I was amazed to discover that it is in fact a sophisticated, humorous, and affectionate poke at superhero movies and comic books. In fact, you can take the movie as a giant comic book on one level, but on another level there is some significant social commentary.<br/><br/>What makes a true hero? Is it his or her talents and abilities (in this case, the ability to knock down buildings or stretch like a rubber band or run super-fast)? Or is it something more subtle, something in the spirit, the courage to face up to one's foibles and weaknesses and overcome them and in doing so, make the world a better place. Is it better to celebrate mediocrity, the concept that everyone is ""special"", or should we not celebrate the exceptional ones among us, uplift them and admire them for their special contributions to the world? If you are a thoughtful person, this movie will leave you asking these questions. It will also leave you laughing--the dialogue is hilarious, the characters realistic and believable. The romance-obsessed teenager, the mischievous little boy, the housewife who is suppressing her true heroic nature, and the husband withering away in a cube farm--these are people you meet every day, and you might be one of them. I can relate to the cube farm, myself.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie, and I eagerly await Mr. Bird's next effort."

","In a time when superheroes are the big thing, an animated film like this was sure to gain popularity, and it did. The film is full of action, with many superbly crafted explosive sequences, but yet the film is tame enough to be entertaining viewing for the whole family. However, that is all that the film basically is: amusing action sequences combined with some excellent animation. The characters are never more than run-of-the-mill stereotypes, with the screenplay never rising really above the ordinary, except for a full good jokes. Still, it is all quite watchable, and some of the non-action sequences, such as the driving on roads and newspaper footage, had me very impressed. It is a visual marvel - and the Oscar winning sound effects are good too. But is it anything more? Well, I guess that is up to the individual to decide."
"GothicZM","Null","0","0","3 June 2005"," A Teen's Opinion
","Pixar Animation Studios comes back again to bring something different than anything seen in any other Pixar film. Lots of action sequences, explosions, and a lot of people that end up dead. A few funny moments here and there, but nothing really big. This is a very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>After receiving many lawsuits because of their acts, the superheroes are forced to settle down, and live their lives like normal people. Bob Parr, who said in an interview at the beginning of the film that he would like to settle down and raise, realizes that that really isn't what he wants to do. A message is given to him, telling him that he has a chance to be a superhero again. Of course, this turns out to get him into a lot of trouble. So his family must rescue him.<br/><br/>With each Pixar film, the audience can see the CG work continue to get better and more realistic. I believe this is the first Pixar film that actually has no weird monsters or animals. Something new from Pixar. The CG was amazing, as with Finding Nemo and Monsters Incorporated.<br/><br/>There was a lot more action in this film than expected. A lot of the scenes involve people getting killed or injured in some way. Scenes where Dash Parr is running through the trees on the island. Men in these flying disks were chasing him, and they would crash and blow up. They ended dead. That was surprising, because Pixar has never really killed anyone before. There were more people getting killed when Edna goes through the list of people that had cape problems. She talks about a superhero that got sucked into the vortex, and a superhero that got torn apart in a jet. Just so many people ended up losing their lives. That was surprising.<br/><br/>Looking back at other Pixar films, I thought this was going to be a laugh out loud movie, but it was not. Like I said, it was a big action/adventure... James Bond kind of movie. Just listen to the music in the trailer. There were a few laughs. Mostly when Elastigirl did something weird. Another laugh was the little kid shouting, ""That was totally wicked..."" at the end. Also when was shouting at Dash in the race and the guy sitting next to him is wondering what the hell they're doing.<br/><br/>This is one of the year's best films. There was a lot of good action and some humor. Good acting and voice acting. There was one thing. I'm not sure if it's a mistake or something, but in the dinner scene, first we see Violets left eye, but later, when she's complaining about being normal, we see her right eye, like a mirror image of her. Can anyone confirm this for me? other than that, one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>Entertainment = 9.5/10 <br/><br/>Favorite Scene = Scene where Bob's boss calls him in to talk about how Bob works. He lines up these up these pencils and points them forward. When Bob sits in the chair, a pencil slides to the left and the boss puts it back. He goes on talking about how things work together like a clock. By the end of the scene, the boss ends up injured."

Contrary to what some people have said, I don't think that a sequel would necessarily be a good idea. It is just possible that by the time a sequel is made, Pixar and Disney will have parted company for ever, and that Disney will make one of its vastly inferior sequels, such as the 101 Dalmations one a couple of years back, as they are apparently threatening to do with Toy Story.

","Pixar rewrote the rule book for animation in 1995 with Toy Story and, less than a decade later, it has done it again. Toy Story, with its combination of wit and star-quality voice acting, was as entertaining for adults as it was for children. It made previous kings of the genre, like Aladdin, look dated.<br/><br/>The Incredibles has made another critical advance: animation can be cinematic as well as cartoonish.<br/><br/>Some films, such as Shark Tale or Madagascar, fall back on celebrity or madcap action as a substitute for plot or characterisation. Adult humour is inserted, but it is discrete from the children's jokes and adds no wit or depth.<br/><br/>Not so with The Incredibles, which has the self-confidence to combine an anti-politically correct message - that not everyone is special - with a structure that intersperses action with comedy and drama. The idea that ex-superheroes reminisce about their glory days while hanging out in a car listening to police radio chatter is as wonderful as the notion that there is one fashion designer responsible for all superhero outfits, and who hates capes because they are a safety hazard. ""I never look back, darling,"" she admonishes Mr Incredible. ""It distracts from the now.""<br/><br/>And when the action scenes do come, they are better than anything you've seen before. The first time I saw this film I had to stand up at the back of the cinema because some creep had taken my seat. I was so captivated that I simply forgot the discomfort of standing for an hour and 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Brad Bird is a visionary. An amazing director, writer, and even a scene stealer as the voice for the fashion designer Edna Mode. The Incredibles succeeds not only as an animation, but as a comedy, a drama and an action film. It will be some time before we see its equal."

Nearly ten years later, this film makes Toy Story look like an experiment. This is a film that lends itself well to the workings of a computer animated hit from the lighting to the costumes to the stunts to the superpowers the superheroes use to get the job done.<br/><br/>In this film, Brad Bird crafts a social commentary so subtle that you don't even see it until a second or third viewing. To some degree he did this in the highly underrated Iron Giant, but it's much more successful in the Incredibles considering the Iron Giant takes place in 1957. Bird spares no American institution: The insurance agencies, the traditional educational system and the legal system were the most prevalent.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you haven't seen this yet, what the heck are you waiting for!?!"

","'The Incredibles' is the best animated action-adventure ever made. Combining wry satirical humor, politics, domestic drama, and those blistering action sequences, this movie is Disney/Pixar's best film since the original 'Toy Story'.<br/><br/>The story centers around Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson), a superhero who, in his prime, was a man you could always count on. But 15 years ago, everything changed. After Mr. Incredible intercepted a suicide jumper, the jumper filed a lawsuit against him and the public's view of superheroes gradually began to change. Finally, under immense pressure from lawsuits and other issues, the government launched the 'Superhero Relocation Program': In exchange for having the slate wiped clean, the Supers (as they're called) agreed to never use their powers in heroic acts again and essentially become normal. Flash-forward to now: Mr. Incredible is now Bob Parr, an insurance agent married to former Super Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter), now known as Helen, and three kids: Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), a teenager who can turn invisible and generate force fields; Dash (voice of Spencer Fox), a 10 year-old who does everything super-fast; and Jack-Jack, the baby and the only ""normal"" person in the family. Bob misses the old life, and when a mysterious person calls him back into action, he jumps at the chance. He may get more than he bargained for, though, when it turns out to be a trap set by an enemy with an intriguing grudge, and now Bob's family must save him.<br/><br/>Director Brad Bird (he of the underrated 1999 film 'The Iron Giant') is a newbie to Pixar, but that doesn't stop him from creating a modern animated masterpiece. Pixar's animation is much cooler than that of DreamWorks or other CGI studios, and they're the first people to get action in cartoons right in a long, long time. The story is great, highly original, and it's got one of the best animated villains in history: Syndrome (voice of Jason Lee), a former fan who has now turned to the dark side and wants to destroy his once-upon-a-time idol. Syndrome is *really* evil (he coldly disregards the lives of Bob's family), and not a bumbling fool like so many other cartoon bad guys. All the vocal performances are spot-on, and they include Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone, an old superhero friend of Bob's (he can freeze stuff), and Bird as Edna Mode, a fashion designer for superheroes. 'E', as she is called, is a hilarious character, and I hope to see more of her in the eventual sequel.<br/><br/>'The Incredibles' is classic, and it's a bold new step in direction for Pixar."

","Watched the Incredibles yesterday and enjoyed it very much. It's a light-hearted tale of an aging and washed-up superhero who is given the opportunity to be a hero again. Mr Incredible leaps at the opportunity to use his powers again, although he isn't quite brave enough to tell his wife, Elastigirl, what he's doing. Unfortunately, the situation turns dangerous and threatens the lives of Mr Incredibles' family as well as the general public. It's up to the Incredibles to save the day.<br/><br/>This is a funny movie which is loads of fun to watch. The animation is excellent, the characters are likable, the villain is dastardly and the story never gets boring. The movie is written from a middle-aged point of view. There's a big emphasis on family values and most of the jokes are geared towards middle-aged audiences with even a bit of sly sexual humour thrown in. Despite this, kids will still love it, even if they don't get all the jokes. They'll particularly love watching Mr Incredible and Elastigirl's two superpowered kids, Nash and Violet, while they outthwart Syndrome's evil henchmen.<br/><br/>Overall, a very fun and entertaining movie. A great movie to take kids to because the kids will love it, and so will you. 7/10"
"toddinvestor","7","0","0","30 November 2004"," a good movie, BUT ...
","... not incredible. Perhaps I went in with expectations too high. For sure, Pixar comes through with another brilliant animation display. The neverending variety of scenes, many at high speed, are enjoyable to watch on the big screen. Character development is also good. Each Incredible is given a decent amount of screen time though Mr. Incredible is the featured hero throughout. I enjoyed Dash, the young boy flying around at incredible speeds. So, what is not to like? Well, as good as the movie is, it drags with a 2 hour running time. There is humor here and there but not enough to compensate for the lengthy dialogue sequences. ""The Incredibles"" carries itself like an adult drama too often, and the kidlets in the theatre I was in were getting restless. It is like an animated James Bond, with all the chase scenes to go with it, and talking too. Too much in fact. Though I enjoyed it, I did not leave feeling compelled to see it again. Neither did my 10 year old nephew. That makes ""The Incredibles"" good, but not great. 7/10 Note: wouldn't recommend it for younger children, too intense and scary for the young ones"
"manishlx","10","0","0","21 November 2004"," Incredible detail *spoilers, detailed*
","I saw this movie twice in the same weekend, and I am definitely going to rate it 15 out of 10. Just about everyone who has rated this film positively has said much of what I have to say, so I won't repeat the gushy stuff. <br/><br/>There is a part of my brain that just complains a lot when a cartoon or a live-action superhero movie fails to convey a physical consistency. I loved Superman, but his feats were not as convincing even if the special effects were top-notch for its time. Spider-Man had that real feel to it, but the Incredibles really raises the bar. Pixar doesn't try to go photo-realistic but under the cartoony look there's a tangibility to the world of the Incredibles that goes past most live-action movies.<br/><br/>See if you spotted or can spot (the next time you go) these finer details: - Mr Incredible lifted his car more convincingly than any live-action or animated superhero, ever. The balance, the muscle movement, and the whole scene was way more real than I expected. - Dash discovered nuances of his speed just as a boy of his age would. The surprise that he was fast enough to run on water. Exhilaration resulted in more speed and confidence. Discovered his sparring superiority (dodge, super-speed pummel) Even how he enjoyed talking about it with an equally excited dad. Ran into a swarm of bugs (how come the Flash doesn't?) - A smart bad guy henchman who throws dirt into water to track an invisible Violet. Other henchmen with apparently real-world feelings (running to the one who fell with the precise coconut toss) - Elastigirl having to feel for the bad guy's face in the elevator since she couldn't see him to punch him. Her pleading with the missile deployed to abort the attack. Putting away the KO'd heavy henchmen in the closet was so very real-feeling - Violet not being used to her powers under pressure, since she never superheroes before (but no problem stopping Dash). Rolling a force field like a solid ball to escape! - I really felt Mr Incredible throwing his back out in his first Omnidroid encounter - Someone already mentioned the lack of water vapor in the flaming building, and resulting dehydration that stopped Frozone from freezing things - Edna mode's brushed the icky crushed tissues to the counter top-disposal with rolled up papers, also tossed the damaged costume into the trash. The style was so real in spite of the exaggerated small size - The perspective in the jumps and falls in the island's rain forest - The very real feel of the office doorknob (crushed), the car door frame that Mr I grabs, the steak plate getting cut to the table (but not the whole table as is often clichéd), the sphere- bubble-car that Mr I lands on, the way he punches the dent out in the roof, the real-feeling way the shell lands... - The tree Mr I shook to release the kitten made me jump when he slammed it in the opposite direction to end the car chase, that was more real than I've ever seen.<br/><br/>So the conclusion is that Live-Action superheroes sell because they are more convincing than cartoons, but 3-D animation of this quality and detail really really achieves the effect that both live-action and 2-D animation Superhero storytellers would die for."
"pip-7","10","0","0","22 November 2004"," A darn good show but not nearly as funny or emotional as 'The Iron Giant'
","Since watching Brad Bird's first animated film The Iron Giant, I am immensed with its surprisingly entertaining storyline and brilliant animation depicting the big robot as a child and the boy as his parent (yep, everything's done without irritating sing-along sequences and typical sidekicks). What gives this rare gem a powerful film is an unexpected and sometimes emotional 'twist' somewhere near the end which definitely lets the audience including myself to express our own emotions (hatred and even sympathy) towards the characters involved in this movie. Since then, I always consider this movie a real 'classic' of its own genre.<br/><br/>Now, it's been five years since The Iron Giant and Bird once again takes the world finally with The Incredibles, an action-packed family film about the life of a superhero whose recognition as a crime fighter is marred by the public. And so, he marries a woman with elastic powers (hmm, almost reminds me of the 'Fantastic Four') and starts his own family which unfortunately leads to his pathetic days as an ordinary social worker (which is funny because he isn't used to this normal lifestyle since he himself is 'abnormal'!). Unlike any Pixar films, The Incredibles' is more of a bizarre mix of drama and comedy (and lots of family issues too) which, for some people's POV, is a refreshing change from the typical CGI movie fare. Of course, I have nothing against Pixar's awesome animation technique: the character's posture, emotions and facial expressions, despite their cartoony looks, seem more real than the fake-looking Polar Express's 'real' characters. Also, expect some Bird's favorite trademarks (Mr. Incredible banging the malfunctioning car door, the robot invasion, the retro elements and even the ever lovable Frank and Ollie cameos!) which are delicately picked up from The Iron Giant.<br/><br/>However, despite the good stuff I have mentioned above, every good movies also need some criticism as well (sorry, adored fans of Pixar). The settings in the middle act are heavily (and obviously) borrowed from the X-Men movies by Bryan Singer (e.g. the futuristic ship, the backgrounds in the hidden base, the sky chase with missiles), ruining the movie's overall originality. Perhaps the sadder part of this sort of criticism is that, despite its incredible premises and technical wizardry Bird is trying to achieve, The Incredibles sadly doesn't capture the emotional and humorous tones of his previous outing The Iron Giant. It's quite surprising that I don't feel the same magical experiences that I earned in Iron Giant. Perhaps reviving the same old magic proves to be harder than expected but anyway, The Incredibles is still an enjoyable movie with great moments with Edna the cloth designer and even the most amazing chase and battle sequences ever created in animation history.<br/><br/>Although The Incredibles lacks originality, watching it for the second (third, fourth and so on, thanks to DVD) time only proves how wonderful this movie is (combined with great and sometimes humorous dialogue and brilliant mise-en-scene that reflects its Golden Era atmosphere). Realizing that I can't think of a better storyline on a particular sequence, I congratulate Brad Bird and his entire team at Pixar for making such a serious animated film, not only with 'flexible' and appealing animation, but also with a big heart."

","Prior to seeing ""The Incredibles"", I had not been to the movies in two years, and I have never seen a movie in the theaters by myself. But, when I decided to see ""The Incredibles"" the night before Thanksgiving 2004, needless to say, I made a great choice.<br/><br/>In fact, ""The Incredibles"" had piqued my interest long before it hit the theaters; I have had a slight interest in superheroes since I was about five or six years old. Surely, I would vaguely be taken in a way by a film about a superhero, but a family of superheroes? Now, THAT sounds like something I shouldn't miss! And I didn't miss out; I went, and was impressed with the results. It consists of almost every genre known to the movies: a lot of action, adventure and drama, a little bit of comedy and horror, a good deal of sci-fi and suspense, a killer music score, and even a little ""dash"" of romance. Great voice work featuring the talents of Craig T. Nelson (TV's ""Coach""), Holly Hunter (""Raising Arizona""), Samuel L. Jackson (""Pulp Fiction"") and Jason Lee (the View Askew films and later of TV's ""My Name is Earl"") among others, as well as the storyline, the direction of animation veteran Brad Bird, and, of course, the slick and stylish computer animation that looks and appears so real, and the quality of it that just says Pixar.<br/><br/>As for what happens in the film itself...well, I can't tell you. You'll have to see it for yourself. And just remember this piece of advice: If it's from Pixar, it's gotta be good. And ""The Incredibles"" is absolutely no exception. If this comment was helpful along with the reviews, and if you see the film for yourself, you will end up saying, ""That's incredible!"""

If you want to save a few bucks, though, wait till it comes out on DVD/Video. Then, you don't have to pay for the gas to drive you to the theater.

","I have a lot more trouble enjoying movies than I used to. I blame video games, which give me an expectation that entertainment will completely absorb me. So when I see a movie that completely immerses me, entertains me and even, in spite of being a comedy, can be moving and just a touch insightful, I have to jump up and shout bravo (at least figuratively: I did not actually jump up in the theatre and say bravo). <br/><br/>A very funny and imaginative film, The Incredibles takes a clever premise and follows it through to the end with precision. The basic action story outline is fairly predictable and by the numbers - I was ahead of it every step of the way - but it's all done with a wonderful sense of humanity and humor that feels organic to the story rather than forced and slapsticky (as can happen with many animated films). The best thing in the movie is the fashion designer, surprisingly voiced by director Byrd. She's just hysterical. <br/><br/>Really a must-see movie.<br/><br/>ADDENDUM: Watched this movie again 14 years later on TV. If I were writing a review now I would give it 8 rather than 9, but I'll leave the original rating. This time I thought it was a cute, fun movie, but only the last third was really full out terrific, a just amazing mix of action and comedy.<br/><br/>Still, highly recommended."
"sarge_5150","10","0","0","27 November 2004"," Very well done departure
","This is a different film from previous Pixar/Disney collaborations. As with previous films, the graphics are outstanding. Much like Finding Nemo the graphics are so well done that you are not consciously aware of their provenance. Even though the cast is exclusively humans, the images are engaging without taking you out of the film. The soundtrack does an excellent job of conveying the tone of the scene. Both the images and sounds pay homage to other genres and films without name-dropping.<br/><br/>Where the previous Pixar/Disney collaborations emphasize the youthful fun over the adult conflict, this film moves the conflict to center stage. This is a film about a man struggling to balance his metier and his obligations and a woman trying to hold her family together. The setting of this conflict amidst superheros ultimately makes this film so enjoyable. But, unlike Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and Toy Story, this film feels like a drama. (In that regard it reminds me of Bird's The Iron Giant.)<br/><br/>In other words, rather than a kid's film that adults can enjoy, this is an adult's film that kids can enjoy."
"ferguson-6","8","0","0","27 November 2004"," Totally Wicked, Pixar
","Greetings again from the darkness. OK, so I felt a little foolish walking into an animated feature without any kids. However, the embarrassment turned into fascination as soon as the short, ""Boundin'"" started. Nice little parable to start the day. ""The Incredibles"" is the latest offering from Pixar (and the director of ""The Iron Giant"") and is bit like ""Toy Story"" on steroids. Everyone from age 5 and up will enjoy this and some will be shocked at the realism, action sequences and drama of the story. Craig T. Nelson (TV's ""Coach"" and the ""Poltergeist"" dad) and Holly Hunter (""Thirteen"" and ""The Piano"") are the lead voices as Mr. Incredible and his wife, ElastiGirl. They are Superheroes forced into hiding and feeble attempts at normalcy with their kids, who were of course also blessed with superhero traits. The action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking and the mix of parental struggles, teen angst, sibling rivalry and hero worship make for a story strong enough to keep one's interest for 2 hours. Pixar continues to flirt with reality in their animation and we get the feeling that at anytime they will trick us with the blurred line between reality and fantasy. Samuel L Jackson and Jason Lee turn in nice voice acting, but little Dash pretty much steals every scene he is in. So, hold your head up high and go see this one. You don't even have to borrow any nieces or nephews!! Also, make sure to stay for the closing credits - they are a delight with the visuals and the score, which blends James Bond, The Avengers, The Pink Panther and Looney Toons all into one sound!"

"madpenguin41","8","0","0","27 November 2004"," Splendid!
","Okay, so let's get the bad news out of the way first. 'The Incredibles' does not touch 'Finding Nemo' in terms of greatness. The sheer beauty and ingenuity of that film is the type that comes along about once every fifty years, so perhaps it's unfair to compare. One of the key differences is that while 'Nemo' is very much a timeless tale with universal themes, 'The Incredibles' is very much of a particular time and place, that being modern America.<br/><br/>Indeed, Pixar has surprisingly managed to create one of the most socially relevant films in a year where nearly every film released attempts to be socially relevant. 'What?' you ask. 'Isn't this a cartoon and aren't cartoons for kids?' Actually, this cartoon isn't so much for kids, at least not very young ones. Excessive violence abounds and the villainy is actually threatening in a life-or-death kind of way. There has certainly never been another animated film with Disney's name on it that was as violent or as dark as this. Besides the content, the ideas and themes of the film really suggest an adult target audience.<br/><br/>So yeah, the kids sort of get left out here, but man, are the older folk in for a treat. At its core, 'The Incredibles' is a well-pointed satire of mainstream American life and the cultural standards that are imposed upon this nation's citizens. Within the first ten minutes, the film is depicting a man in midlife crisis and a family filled with discontent and dysfunction. As I said, this IS satire, so these problems are greatly amplified by the fact that this entire family consists of natural-born superheroes. What makes the film so poignant however, is that it not only depicts the problem, but delves deep into examining why it exists. Bob Parr sits at a cubicle all day and is forced to deny insurance claims to as many people as possible. This is what he spends his time doing, yet he is capable of not only being a truly productive member of society, but of achieving great good in the world. Hits a bit too close to home, doesn't it? In fact, the film shows each of its main characters shoved into a role of mediocrity where their real talents and potential go unused. This is bad for them, and it's bad for society as well. They are unable to give back to the world via the gifts they've been born with and they are unhappy in being forced to simply live standard lives. Indeed, 'The Incredibles' more than any other film in recent memory addresses the problem of a culture that tends to look down upon any individual talent, unless that talent involves the exploitation of someone for economic gain (see Bob's insurance job). <br/><br/>Greatness isn't allowed in this society. In fact, it is so forbidden that superheroes are outlawed altogether, after a rash of lawsuits over collateral damages the most hilarious of which is from a man who sues over a broken leg which is incurred while he is rescued from a suicide attempt. So all superheroes are forced to live the normal, domestic lives that bore all the rest of us to tears. Of course, 'The Incredibles' isn't necessarily a dark film. In fact, once the members of this family are allowed to embrace their talents, the bonds between them rapidly flourish. So is the root of family dysfunction found in the decision to do what society seems to approve of rather than what natural talent dictates? It's an interesting question to ponder, and one which will certainly be pondered by anyone who sees this film.<br/><br/>Outside of theme, the execution of the movie in general, is quite excellent. Pixar has an incredible knack for picking up extraordinarily well-written scripts, and this is certainly no exception. The satire never gets in the way of an exciting story (which is all the more exciting due to the depth of the characters). In fact, I would go so far as to say this is one of the better action films I've seen. The vocal talents are great all of them, so I won't bother mentioning just one or two names. And of course, the animation is absolutely first-rate. Even if someone could somehow hate everything else about this movie, he would have to admire it for the sheer brilliance of its visuals. Seriously, wow!<br/><br/>Of course, 'The Incredibles' is not without its flaws. The latter third of the film consists entirely of the family struggling and battling super-villain Syndrome. It's not that this section is poorly done; it just seems a bit incongruous with the rest of the film, as much of the satire is lost here. Syndrome himself is a problem, due to an overall lack of originality he and his giant volcano hideout feel way too copped from about every James Bond film. While we're at it, the final battle of the Incredibles against Syndrome's giant evil robot seems to go on much longer than necessary, perhaps because we see Mr. Incredible battle the exact same robot an hour earlier. <br/><br/>Of course, these are nit-picks in what is overwhelmingly a very funny, exciting, and even poignant film. Score: 8/10"
"YoukieBob","Null","0","0","27 November 2004"," High recommendations from a teen
","I was rather impressed by this movie! I went into the theater knowing it was going to be good, but was blown away at the very serious story under the cute Disney/Pixar mask, as well as the depth of the story and characters, although it was a very predictable Disney-esque movie.<br/><br/>The characters were very well-developed, and I found myself able to relate to them--I could practically write a book about the characters after only an hour-and-a-half movie. The villains were also very real, but I also noted that Syndrome had a striking resemblance to Freakazoid, a character from a favorite television show of mine (although it is no longer airing in the States). He was really, truly villainous, and I found myself genuinely afraid of this rather disturbed character. I would rather not meet him on the street.<br/><br/>I also must say that computer animation has come a very long way since<br/><br/>Toy Story in 1994. Where Toy Story was a breakthrough movie of its day, The Incredibles has really set the standards for all computer animation up till now. I found the characters in The Incredibles to be even more realistic-looking than even Shrek or Shrek 2, which were both very impressive as well. The humor in the movie was also very funny and well-played. As a teenager watching a lot of Disney movies again, it was not hard to find adult jokes that I know kids wouldn't get--but there was plenty of fun to be had for everyone--There were several instances where everyone in the theater was laughing, including me! The character's voices were also thought out very well. I could really see the characters having the voices they did. Being the voice-over nazi I am (I am a huge anime buff), I was VERY impressed with the job done by all of the voice actors, and none of them were well-known!<br/><br/>I also found a close resemblance to Freakazoid in Syndrome's voice and The Incredibles costumes (Freakazoid had F! on his chest, the Incredibles had an i), but maybe I'm reading into it too deeply. The little neighbor boy, who appeared three times, I found very amusing. I know kids like that down my street.<br/><br/>Highly recommended (by a teen!), and adults will like it as much as kids did, I am sure. <br/><br/>I give this a 9 out of 10, and I would see it again!"

"sdillon-1","Null","0","0","23 November 2004"," Brad Bird is the Steven Spielberg of animation
","Brad Bird directed my all-time-favourite animated feature The Iron Giant; one of the most criminally underrated films ever. So for me expectation was extremely high for this, his second feature. Opting for computer animation over hand drawings and working with Pixar studios for the first time, I wondered if he could repeat the magic. He has. As far as I'm concerned, Brad Bird is now the Steven Spielberg of animation. It may be premature to say this after one viewing, but I think its Pixar's greatest picture to date, better even than Toy Story 2.<br/><br/>The story is far too good to spoil but I will reveal this much. Superheroes have become outlawed through a series of lawsuits. Mr Incredible and his superhero wife Elastigirl had to enter a witness protection programme to hide their secret identities. Mr Incredible now holds down a boring office job in an insurance company and has three children, all of whom have powers but are forbidden to use them. Suffice to say this leads to a hilarious and poignant home life full of domestic difficulties and Mr Incredible begins to long for the good old days of superhero exploits.<br/><br/>The bittersweet early scenes soon give way to a full-on action adventure, and this is the point where I redundantly mention how staggering the animation is, because no amount of description can do it justice. It is beautifully rendered making tremendous use of widescreen space. The witty, sophisticated screenplay has an informed knowledge of comic book lore without once resorting to the cheap, self conscious spoof so common in similar works. Instead, it has the courage to play it fairly straight, which gives the story great emotional resonance. That's not to say it isn't funny. It's frequently hilarious; one inspired gag involving capes is especially amusing and a vocal cameo from Brad Bird himself as a luvvie fashion designer is guaranteed to bring the house down. The most knowing line comes from the villain, who having captured Mr Incredible starts explaining his master plan before realising what he's doing: 'I can't believe you've got me monologuing!'<br/><br/>One of Bird's favourite films is obviously the 1950's version of The War of the Worlds, as both The Iron Giant and The Incredibles feature huge robots which are an obvious homage to said film. It also has the coolest 'baddies base' I've ever seen, even outstripping You Only Live Twice. Speaking of James Bond, Michael Giacchino's John Barryesque music score is outstanding, and very reminiscent of the classic 1960's Bond films. The vocal talents are all excellent; Craig T Nelson as Mr Incredible, Holly Hunter as Elastigirl and especially Samuel L Jackson as friend of the family superhero Frozone. Even the end credits are wonderfully stylish. Above all, this is one film that must be seen on a big screen. Even the most 'stay-at-home-and-wait-for-the-video' among you should make an exception (you know who you are!).<br/><br/>Some critics have carped that the mega-action climax is overkill and that the film is too long. Personally, I thought the finale appropriately loud and exciting and whilst it is longer than normal (120 minutes is unusual for a cartoon feature), it never outstays its welcome. In short, this is the best animated film of the year, the best family film of the year and the most out and out fun film of the year.<br/><br/>Oh, and for those poor unfortunates among you who haven't seen The Iron Giant yet, buy or rent the DVD and watch that too!"

","At last, a big-budget, Hollywood movie that's both technically proficient AND a great story! Spectacular animation, both on the main characters and the amazing backgrounds. And most importantly, the animators didn't leave the storytelling behind. Heartwarming plot, engaging characters, and great voice talent made this movie a wonder from start to finish. The audience, both adults and children, left the theater amazed and smiling- a rare feat these days, and truly something not to be missed. Looking forward to a sequel- hopefully not a quick knockoff or a weekly imported TV series, but something with the same degree of care and heart as this treasure. Don't miss this movie!"

","When I saw The Incredibles, I expected it to be a film like Finding Nemo; that is, a humorous family movie with universal (mostly) appeal. I was surprised to find this a very different movie. It has a very sophisticated plot and was not watered down for younger viewers to try to understand. The fights were actually quite exciting, and were never predictable. I also applaud them because, for the most part, they veered away from Disney clichés that are used so often in family films, older children and adults predict them and get tired of them. The villains were intriguing and had a lot of depth. All the characters were developed incredibly well (no pun intended, but it's hard to keep from using the word ""incredible"" and having to come up with synonyms every time) and I thought the jokes were well-done. However, it contained a significant amount of violence (shooting hand guns, realistic (sometimes) punching and kicking, several explosions, etc.) and may be too scary for younger children. If you have children below the age of seven (I could be over/underestimating, but it's hard to remember back so far) I'd recommend seeing it first before you see it with them."

","Being part of that very elite club that didn't think that much of Finding Nemo, I didn't really know what to expect from The Incredibles, another computer generated film by Disney/Pixar. I had heard amazing things about it, but I had also heard amazing things about Nemo. The standard opening short, ""Boundin'"", made me doubt how good the actual film would be. But now I see that there's an inverse. Nemo's opening short was the hilarious ""Knick Knack,"" and the movie just turned out to be mediocre. Here, ""Boundin'"" was quite atrocious, but The Incredibles was great. How could I tell it was great from the beginning? Well, I knew that Pixar made kids films, and the opening scene had a car chase filled with guns firing at each other. I knew this was going to be a different film, and, by golly, I knew I'd love it from then on in.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) is a superhero, saving his fair city from supervillains. However, when he rescues someone who didn't want to be rescued, it starts a whole line of lawsuits against superheroes, so Mr. Incredible, after his marriage to Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), is forced into retirement. He's now Bob Parr, an insurance agent living with Helen and their three children, Dashiell ""Dash"" (Spencer Fox), Violet (Sarah Vowell), and baby Jack-Jack (Jack-Jack? I mean, seriously, JACK-JACK?). A deranged former fan of Mr. Incredible, Buddy Pine (Jason Lee), decides to destroy every former superhero in the world by becoming Syndrome, and Mr. Incredible has to decide whether or not to keep his quiet suburban life to go back into the now illegal field of superheroing.<br/><br/>Ever since Toy Story came out, the bar for animation has continually been set higher and higher. And since Shrek, the look of the animation hasn't changed at all. That is, until November 5, 2004, when The Incredibles was released. This being Pixar's first film only featuring human characters, and since human characters were Pixar's weakness in all of their other movies, it's corrected here. And since there's not as much cartoonery here (in relation to Nemo, etc.), everything has do, and does, look a lot more realistic. It's this leap of animation that puts Brad Bird's movie up on the charts. Bird, who did the supposedly underrated The Iron Giant and various work on The Simpsons, took on this arduous task of writing and directing this two-hour long scope CG film. I'd hate to see the man who makes a perfect movie with those qualifications, but I have to say Bird did a damn good job.<br/><br/>The greatest asset of The Incredibles is how the story, unlike Nemo, isn't condescending to, or even for, kids. Gunplay, suicide, violence, peril involving young children-this is the type of action movie everyone's been waiting for. The Incredibles can be enjoyed at the same level by any age group. There aren't really many gross gags, like Nemo or other Pixars. In fact, the movie worked great because it's not a comedy. It's an action movie with many funny spots in it. It's like Bird's work on The Simpsons-many of the best episodes are not only funny, but are also fun to watch (which is part of the fault of the newer episodes, but I digress). Since the movie's major focus isn't humor, it can focus on the well-developed characters, the plot, and all of the details. The movie, at two hours long, flew by.<br/><br/>People have said that Craig T. Nelson's voicework is unrecognizable, but to them I have this to say: if you saw him and saw him talk, would you be able to recognize him? I thought not. The animation matched his voice perfectly in all of its deadpan glory, so, I suppose in that regard he did a good job. Hunter is pretty good, but Bird, as Edna Mode, is way overrated. I don't understand these people who say that Edna should have her own sequel, but that's another story. Samuel L. Jackson, as ""Frozone"", is awesome, as he always is (can he be anything else?), but he's only in about two scenes. Everyone knows that he's awesome, so why make his role so small? I couldn't place Lee's voice at first, but it was basically generic voice-over work. That's the weakest part of The Incredibles, is the voice-over work. Everything else is-dare I say-incredible, that it's brought down by such mediocre voices.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for action violence."

","I am not an animation fan, but after I watched 'The Incredibles<br/><br/>specials' on TV, I just had to go to the cinema immediately... and it<br/><br/>was even better than my expectations!! I love this film!! I almost<br/><br/>forgotten that it was an animation when I was watching it and I<br/><br/>was very moved by the bond between the characters. Before<br/><br/>watching this, my favourite animations were 'Toy Stories 1 & 2' and <br/><br/>'Spirited away', but now I will have to put this before the 2 Toy<br/><br/>Stories. I don't really understand why there are viewers who<br/><br/>complaint that this film is boring and slow... I actually found it quite<br/><br/>the opposite. The storyline may not be the most original, but the<br/><br/>dialogue was witty, intelligent and not too cute nor corny; the<br/><br/>animation was quite realistic and colourful but the best thing of all<br/><br/>was its ability to make the viewers sympathize with the characters.<br/><br/>I especially like the part when they were hiding their secret<br/><br/>identities, living in the suburbs and trying to live like any normal<br/><br/>families...and they even had fights and disagreements like other<br/><br/>families, it just makes them seem so 'real' and 'humane'. To me,<br/><br/>this is not just another cute animation for kids, it's an intelligent<br/><br/>and fun animation for adults too. I highly recommend this to film/ movie lovers!"
"gcrokus","Null","0","0","21 November 2004"," The Technology Has EVERYTHING To Do With It
","In an age where well-crafted animated full-length films become available at the rate of two to three per year, we find again, in 'The Incredibles', one ostensibly for the ages. Critically acclaimed by nearly all (96% on the Tomatometer), again we pay tribute to the graphic artists and computer marvels generating inarguably clever entertainment. But is this more than a diversion? In other words, are we rating such animated features as 'The Incredibles' a little higher than they might actually merit?<br/><br/>We are a becoming a little less charmed with the onslaught, if you will, of cartoons. This author would like to be as hip as the next, but grading animated features as highly as live action releases might be a slight to the latter, more traditional, forms of film. Recent documentaries ('Fahrenheit 9/11', 'Super Size Me') and mainstream efforts ('Ray', 'The Motorcycle Diaries') are rated similarly (ballpark estimates); can we in fairness agree that an animated adventure might be in the same class? But let us approximate the value here.<br/><br/>The plot involves superheroes (Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, others) having to go underground, having been found by society to offer more peril to a litigious society than we might have conjured, and this is pretty funny fare. Languishing in retirement, Mr. Incredible and superhero-friend Frozone are bored; Mr. Incredible takes action and returns to the exciting life of villain-thwarting he has missed so desperately for fifteen years. <br/><br/>Eventually his wife (the afore-mentioned Elastigirl) and their children are drawn into Mr. Incredible's new life. And we are left with a bit of a warm feeling for how the family pulls together at the end after several adventures allow them to utilize their special skills. <br/><br/>When questioned in a recent interview (http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0411011) director Brad Bird (he of 'Simpsons' fame) makes an interesting comment:<br/><br/>Q: Is it more difficult or easy to direct an animated feature compared to a live-action one?<br/><br/>'I felt that the most important things to a film, no matter what the medium is - whether it's animation or real, are the same elements. It's still about characters that you care about and a plot that involves you emotionally, that is surprising but seems logical when you go back and think about what happened. I think that that is the stuff that dictates whether a film succeeds or fails. The technology has very little to do with it.'<br/><br/>Since Bird has had virtually no hand in anything but animated TV and film, this is a less compelling statement than it might be otherwise. So, let's put animation where it belongs, as even the Academy of Motion Pictures places it: a separate category.<br/><br/>Rating: Three Stars."

"NoArrow","Null","0","0","20 November 2004"," A ball of pure bravado, indeed, everyone will enjoy this movie
","For almost a decade Pixar has been making good movies; and 'The Incredibles' is the best one yet.<br/><br/>There are a lot of reasons why 'The Incredibles' is better than both Toy Story movies, 'A Bug's Life', 'Monsters Inc.' and 'Finding Nemo', but I think the most important one is that it takes itself seriously. It doesn't contain a single seeable in-joke, no reference that makes us remember it's just a silly movie. It's about the characters, their lives and their world, and it makes us believe one hundred percent in them.<br/><br/>The movie is about superheroes (or 'supers') Mr. Incredible, a dashing Superman type with fierce strength, and Elastigirl, a kind-hearted woman who can stretch her body to unbelievable lengths. They live in a kind of 50s New York where there are car chases and old lady's cats stuck in trees, problems which they solve with diligence and justice. But lately things have been looking down for the supers  property damage, obsessive fansand one night after saving a man from killing himself Mr. Incredible is sued because the man 'didn't want to be saved'.<br/><br/>And so the superhero relocation program is opened, which eliminates the superheroes and places the secret identities hidden around America, to lead normal lives. Mr. Incredible, now called Bob Parr, begins a regular existence with his wife Helen, who is, of course, Elastigirl. Living in the same neighborhood is Lucius, who used to be Frozone, an agile superhero who has the ability to turn the moisture in the air into ice and snow. Bob and Helen have kids, of course, lightning-fast Dash, disappearing Violet and Jack Jackwho is normal.<br/><br/>Then the movie takes a surprising turn: instead of just supplying us with one scene with the bored family and then rushing into the action, it shows us Bob's boredom with his life, Helen's determination to raise her family to be normal, and the kids coping to ordinary school life as secret superheroes. These middle scenes are the movies' funniest, and they are kind of touching, in away. This is Pixar's first movie solely about humans, and, surprisingly enough, the characters are actuallyhuman.<br/><br/>Of course, being an action movie, the film needs action (or else it could've just been a live action film). The plot supplies us with plenty of it. Bob and Lucius spend their 'bowling night' listening to police scanners so they can race around the city, saving people. They are being tracked by an agent from a mysterious company named Mirage, who discovers their alter egos and takes Bob to a remote tropical island. On that island she tells him that a secret government weapon robot has been set loose on the island, and he must find it and capture it. The first battle between the two is spectacular, and it really feels glorious for Bob.<br/><br/>So he goes home and, full of new enthusiasm, he starts working out and taking part in more missions, and even getting a new costume from designer Edna 'E' Mode. Helen is buzzed by his new grasp on his life, but the happiness doesn't last for so longbut I will say no more. The plot has a certain surprise to it, so I'll let you see for yourself. I'll just say it involves the entire family on the island, using their powers in one wondrous scene after another.<br/><br/>The animation is fabulous, probably the best I've seen. The voice actors  Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Jason Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and others  all bring even more life to their characters (and Hunter's voice fits her part perfectly, I'll say). The writing is very funny and creates a very exciting feeling that never leaves, and the whole style of the movie, the 50s, Bond, superhero elements, just add to the bravado.<br/><br/>It's also smart, smarter than your typical kids' movie, as in a scene where Frozone can't use his ice powers in a burning building because all of the moisture is evaporated. And the insights into the characters lives are in a way touching. It never gets too complicated though, we don't have an explanation for everything (including how the characters got their powers) and it doesn't matter. It is a simple, smart movie.<br/><br/>My only small qualm is that it's a bit too longjust a few minutes, nothing big. If a minute was shaved here or there I think the movie may have improved a little, but it hardly matters.<br/><br/>The movie is excellent, when kids a few decades from now look back on the Pixar films, I hope that they'll remember 'The Incredibles'.<br/><br/>8/10."

The characters are SO well written and Syndrome is probably one of the greatest super villains i've seen in a movie, just because he combines comic relief with pure evil and his reasons for seeking revenge is both interesting and original. I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie, because it works for just about anybody. Men, Women, Kids, Grandparents (I think). It works as a comedy, adventure, suspense, and as a cartoon. This just proves how much greater PIXAR is than dreamworks.

The folks working on the Fantastic Four movie should give up now as they've been beaten to the punch. The only downside to this movie (and someone please tell me i'm wrong on this one) is the fact that due to the nature of Pixar and Disney's split, Disney still holds the rights to the Incredibles liscence, meaning Pixar will never make another Incredibles movie.

The Incredibles. There first PG-rated film, it's a vivid, exciting and charming film featuring the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Brad Bird(director and writer), Samuel L.

It has a wicked sense of humor, an eye for action and dazzling scenery. <br/><br/>The problem in some films, in the modern time, is that the characters don't generate much sympathy. You reach the point when you don't care if they live through the final battle and save the world. But the Incredibles generate very interesting personalities and you really cheer for them in the end. Edna was a great addition and generated plenty of laughs.

The lighting, the smoothness of movement, the believable (almost) physics and the incredible imagination that go into these things is astonishing. You can start to forget that it's an animation. It was non-stop, there isn't a moment when there isn't something whether it's part of the main story of just the expressions of the characters and the little visual gags.

Guns, bombs, shooting at kids, babies turning into devils, babies being dropped from the sky, robots trying to kill people, throwing people through walls, choking people, hitting people, and the list could go on.

The fact that it ended.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I really can't think of much else nice to say about ""The Incredibles"". Elements of the storyline felt clichéd and recycled, such as the character syndrome, and the fact that The Incredibles seem suspiciously like a carefully-disguised rip-off of the old cartoon ""The Fantastic Four"". <br/><br/>The plot itself was tired and predictable, much like the clichés. I would've let all that slide if they had at least injected some good humor into the movie, but alas! I didn't get one laugh from the whole thing. But I guess for all the great movies they've done, Pixar were going to have to make a stinker eventually in order to balance things out.

My brother and his wife have no kids and yet they called me to plead with me to see the film after they'd seen it--and that is why this is such an appealing film.

Nevertheless, had it been, say, 20 minutes shorter, it would have been a better film.<br/><br/>Second, this film does not find an effective balance between being funny and being moving.

It has reasonable scripting, a predictable storyline, does not really take computer animation to new limits, and, while funny does not compare with the likes of Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo (let alone a host of other superior animated films commercially unrecognised). This film is one more Pixar film to add to a growing list of adequate, fun, family films which despite being enjoyable really do add little to ""film"" as a whole. I would recommend this film to all who want a bit of an escape and do not feel like watching anything intellectually or emotionally stimulating.<br/><br/>In summary, fun for all the family but should NEVER be considered a true great."
"The_Void","7","2","5","6 April 2005"," Pixar have done it yet again
","After the enormous success of 'Finding Nemo' and the two Toy Story films, we can probably count on a lot more CGI animated films to come from Pixar; but if they're all as good as The Incredibles, that's certainly no bad thing. The Incredibles works principally because it strikes a fine balance between the fun kids movie that it's facade suggests it is, and a movie of substance. That's why Pixar's animations work; there's something for everyone. Younger audiences will enjoy the high paced action and quick one-liners, while older audiences can delight in the themes of loss, family and doing what you're good at; while having a blast at the same time. The Incredibles is based on an absurdly funny idea, which sees superhero couple Mr Incredible and Elastigirl, along with the rest of the superhero world, having to take regular jobs after a series of law-suits are filed against superhero's after a number of their saves went wrong. However, Mr Incredible simply doesn't like his new life; so when an offer of a superhero assignment comes along; he just can't turn it down...<br/><br/>The way that the film portrays the superhero's' family life is really well done and echoes serious American classics such as American Beauty. This, tied in with the quirky characters and their superpowers, makes for some very fun viewing. It's also refreshing to see an animated film tackle this sort of drama as many skip it in favour of more audience-pleasing aspects (not that this film lacks the latter, mind you). The animation is, of course, sublime and is at least as good, if not better, than the animation seen in Finding Nemo. The film also benefits from a talented range of actors providing the characters' voices. Unlike certain other studios, Pixar are more concerned with getting the right voice actor in for the job rather than having another name to add to the poster. Of course, Samuel L. Jackson and Holly Hunter stand out; but the rest of the cast is mostly made up of lesser-known actors, and all bring their characters to life brilliantly. On the whole, The Incredibles is a great piece of entertainment. Brad Bird has created his own cinematic world and it's one that isn't afraid to latch onto the clichés of the superhero tradition and make them it's own. Simply put; this is an incredible film."
"miken-3","7","2","5","24 January 2005"," Good but not great!
","I had heard that this was by far the best Pixar film. Therefore I went with my kids expecting to be enthralled for 2 hours. What I got was a movie that was good but had a lot of periods where I found myself losing concentration.<br/><br/>Yes the movie has its moments. There is a lot of good adult intended humor thrown in. But I am sorry that this movie is not nearly as good as either Shrek film or either Toy Story film.<br/><br/>With a villain who is probably more annoying than Lord Farquard from Shrek , the movie also seems to have ripped off the Fantastic Four to come up with their characters. Let's see the similarities Mr Incredible - Mr. Fantastic (similar name), Plastic Girl - Mr. Fantastic (same power) Invisible Girl (same powers), Mr. Incredible - the Thing (both super strong). And then the boy is the same as Quicksilver and the Samuel L Jackson character is the same as The Iceman.<br/><br/>My kids (11 and 8) preferred the Spongebob movie to this one. I gave that film 10 stars and this one 7 and a half."
"okelydokely2","10","2","5","3 January 2005"," An excellent film in virtually every way
","Sitting in the theater, watching the previews for The Mask 2 and a couple of other regrettable films, it occurred to me once again just how mentally insulting most Hollywood films are. Luckily, movies like The Incredibles come along once in a while to renew one's faith in cinema. This is a really fun, smart film. A once-avid reader of comics myself, I loved the various ways in which this movie paid homage to superhero comics; my wife, who never read or collected comics, also thoroughly relished this movie. The CGI is great, but that's not enough to make a film good, let alone excellent. The story is cohesive, and doesn't feel like it's been written by committee. I didn't see any product placement. The acting is sharp. The interplay among the characters is believable. I can't think of any way in which this film could have been improved in any significant way. Even the end credits were cool - probably the best end credits I've seen (only Ferris Bueller's credits are on par with them, although in a very different way).<br/><br/>Which reminds me - although the end credits are visually interesting, something like 90 percent of the audience decided to leave without watching them. Now, I'll grant that end credits are often pretty boring, but when they're so lovingly rendered, it just doesn't make sense for people to ignore them.<br/><br/>My wife and I rarely buy dvds, but this is one we want to own. Don't miss it."
"hilo12","10","2","5","30 December 2004"," The Incredibles
","Well, what can I say about this movie? When I first heard about it, I thought it would be a major bust- but after seeing it my verdict is........ THE BEST ANIMATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Sorry about the outburst, but in my opinion- it is. The interview of the main 'supers' at the start of the film- I laughed my socks off! Honestly, you must see it.<br/><br/>The characters that I love are- Edna and elastigirl. Edna is the fashion designer and is.......... i can find any other word to describe her apart from hilarious and elastigirl/Helen Parr is just the coolest mum you could ever have (apart from the fact she is a super hero).<br/><br/>The plot isn't thin and the characters are totally lovable- especially Jack-Jack.<br/><br/>I give it 10/10 and would like to end with a quote from the movie: ""that was totally wicked!"" Hilo12"
"haoumaru","10","2","5","29 December 2004"," This movie is like it was made by God Himself!
","Yes, maybe my summary sounds exaggerated, but there's no other way to describe this movie. It should get a 10 in the movie score here at IMDb.<br/><br/>Once in a while a truly perfect movie is produced, and in 2004 it was The Incredibles. Everything, from the characters to the smallest details is mind-blowing. Everything in the movie looks awesome, and the character designs are excellent. The level of CG used in the movie is one of the highest i have seen, everything looks realistic, with a little addition of cartoonish look which enhances the overall appearance of characters and environments. The clothes of the characters look so real, its amazing. Their hair, it really looks like if it was completely real.<br/><br/>The characters' design are perfect, and they are so likable, no one of them is a waste. All of them have their very own personality traits and it adds to the storyline. And speaking of the storyline, it is very good, it's not some goofy kind of story for kids, it's well written, fast paced and just plain amazing. Also, it's great that it's not really a movie just for kids, it treats its audience as intelligent people and the action scenes are very realistic, it's more like a very violent action movie. There's no restrictions in what's depicted, there's bombs, explosions, bullets (not beams or lasers) and even killed people. The animation and facial expressions are incredibly life-like.<br/><br/>The issues in the lives of the characters are also dealt with not in the traditional way, not hiding the more serious or ""adult"" themes from the kids, but depicting them life-like and in a nice non-vulgar or obscene way. The humor is also great, there's no absolutely forced or dumb jokes in the movie and the ones in it are very funny and creative.<br/><br/>The sounds are fantastic and it adds a lot to the overall experience. The music is more like jazz, and fits the situations accordingly. I saw it dubbed so I am not sure how was the voice acting in English, though, I am sure it must have been pretty good for the first time, since American actors and actresses have never really been good at voice acting.<br/><br/>This movie is a true example of how movies should be made. An excellent option, and i hope I can get the DVD when it comes out. The Incredibles is the closest that American movies can get to Anime and Manga, and it will always remain in my list of favorites.<br/><br/>This movie gets a 10 out of 10. No, 100 out of 100! One of the best movies ever!"
"croatiansensation29","10","2","5","29 December 2004"," Quite simply, incredible!
","Once again, Pixar animators outdid themselves with this fine film. It is simply amazing that they can keep coming out with such great films.<br/><br/>This is the story of Mr. Incredible, a superhero, that is forced into hiding after being sued for saving someones life. He becomes a regular joe, working at the office, while his superhero wife, Elastigirl, takes care of his two children who also possess incredible superpowers. Mr. Incredible still dreams about being a superhero, and after losing his office job, he is given the chance to once again shine by an unknown supporter.<br/><br/>The animation is simply stunning in this film, as we have come to expect from Pixar. The story is brilliant! It will keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as make you laugh out loud during some scenes. The film does borrow quite a bit from the comic books that we have grown up with, ""The Fantastic Four"" being the most obvious. Comic book fans will love the comparisons.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film for both kids and adults. Definitely one to buy when it comes onto DVD. Don't miss this one!"
"gregsrants","6","2","5","8 November 2004"," Valiant, but off the Pixar mark
","Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life. Heard of them? Well you don't need to have kids to have a strong recollection of these computer-animated gems. The fact that all four of them are in the Top-100 grossing domestic films of all-time prove that there is both an audience and a lucrative back end for the studio's to keep pumping these out with some regularity. <br/><br/>In fact, while the four earlier mentioned titles represent films from Pixar Studio's and Disney, other animation sects like Dreamworks (which has given us both Shrek films) and Fox Studio (Ice Age) have jumped on the bandwagon. No less than eight computer animated feature films are in the top 100-grossers of all-time. It's a statistic that can't be overlooked. And now with the new Disney/Pixar release of The Incredibles, it won't be long before The Sound of Music (1965) falls down a rung to number 101. <br/><br/>The Incredibles is the sixth film to be produced through the rocky relationship between the Disney and Pixar studio's, and although this film has its moments, it can also be accredited as the weakest to date. <br/><br/>A mixture of The Fantastic Four, Get Smart, James Bond and the X-Men franchise in animated form, writer/director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) brings us the story of a superhero family that goes into the hero-protection program after a series of lawsuits cost the city too much money to enlist or endorse their services. Promising to keep their powers a secret and never again perform super heroic duties, they are given new identities, jobs and a suburban life that is made even more monotonous by the fact that they could be saving lives or flying the skies like the glory days of yesteryear.<br/><br/>It is with their everyday lives that the movie has its sharpest moments. Seeing Mr. Incredible and his hulking size squeezed into an office cubicle and dealing with an interfering boss and needy customers was a subdued delight and much more interesting than when he dons the costume and begins again to fight crime. Watching the children try and contain their powers in the pressures of everyday school life was also an interesting premise that I had hoped the film would have spent more time. <br/><br/>However, it is the action that puts bums in seats and although the story might not be as interesting, there is plenty of fast paced chaos to keep the average moviegoer from napping. After Mr. Incredible gets a taste of the heroic life he once lead its like a shark to blood or me to a buffet table. He just can't get enough. However, all this is done behind the back of his wife and family who only come to the revelation of his alter-life when he is captured by the evil Syndrome (voiced by Mallrats' Jason Lee). In an effort to find their father and ultimately rescue mankind, the family lead by Elasticgirl and including children who posses the powers of speed (Dash) and invisibility and force fields (Violet) set out to a remote island that would have Ian Fleming grinning from ear to ear to take on the bad guys.<br/><br/>The action sequences on the island are quite clever and include razor cutting ships that chase the children through the forest and enough machine gun fire to earn Pixar their first ever PG rating. But for all the menace and action that ensues, the villain might be the major problem with this venture. As the evil Syndrome, the tyrant doesn't really have any character and comes off as boring and as plain as any enemy of James Bond during the Timothy Dalton years. As the focal point to the second half of the movie, this weak development holds the film down like an anchor in a canoe.<br/><br/>But, for all its small issues, this is still a valued effort. Pixar is still a force to be reckoned with and the movie will made bags and bags of money. It's just that put side-by-side against its peers, it just doesn't have the same humor, originality and tempo. Too bad.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"
"badierv","6","2","5","7 November 2004"," Not the greatest film ever made, people
","People, seriously, this film was far from incredible, and at best average, yet it's being rated higher than classics like Pulp Fiction and Dr. Strangelove. While it was very well animated and had many quick hitting jokes, the story was so contrived that it was like watching The Fantastic Four with the powers switched around. The whole ""we have to conceal our powers from the world, and only use them when we have no other option"" was so very X-Men. And the message as I understood it seemed callous. If everyone has powers it's the same as no one having powers. So not everyone is special in their own way? Harsh. Isn't that what we've been trying to teach our kids all this time? Tolerance of people different than ourselves? I'll take Monsters Inc. over this film any day."

","The Incredibles left me in a foul mood. I am a big Disney fan but this particular animated feature disappointed me at every department. I) The plot is very simple, predictable and, thus, completely unexcited. II) No humor. I mean it. I did not laugh, even once (OK it is very personal remark since senses of humor differ, you might have found it to be hysterically funny) III) The characters are primitive, not captivating.. I found nothing interesting about Bob, Helen and their kids. IV) Yes, lots and lots of special effects. But there is nothing behind them. The producers seem to have forgotten it is the characters, the story that can make people love the movie, not pyrotechnics. The fact that this film became one of the season's biggest grosser can be explained by it having been made for and seen by elementary school kids."
"CWessonSpeaks","4","4","15","25 October 2004"," Occasionally clever, sporadically funny and TOTALLY OVER PRODUCED!
","The Incredibles is one of those loud, brash, totally over-produced, lowest common denominator, ""family films' that while not void of clever asides and mild charms, results in a desperately frantic, grating and ultimately tiresome event for those of us who are not 12 years old. While the computer animation is top notch and often remarkable, the premise full of possibilities, and the musical score delightfully manic, the narrative elements are just too predictable. The characters are curiously one dimensional, which seems odd as they all have secret identities which often seem to fill irritating clichés such as the ""sassy"" misunderstood daughter, the ""groovy"" jivin' black sidekick, the ""freaky"" decidedly gay fashionista/designer, and the ""tough love"" Mom to name a few. The narrative's nearly constant action screams along, raising the stakes and inflating its self assured importance with each passing minute.<br/><br/>This multi-million dollar, bombastic side show feels unpleasantly pre-packaged and ready to sell millions of Happy Meals, plush toys and other tie in merchandise. You can't help but wonder how many ""power meetings"" this thing generated for all the synergistic tie-in companies that cling to such shining gloss like leeches. One thing is for sure, it's designed to hit kiddie radar at dead center and this Christmas will be an Incredibles one!<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Incredibles isn't so much a movie experience but rather an endless commercial for Pixar and Disney as the film laboriously tries to top itself with each new sequence that usually ends with in flourish of animated bangs, if not an explosion. You can't help but feel you're being forced to submit to the film's brow-beating fury. Sadly, this will probably be the most popular box office hit of the year because a lot of commercial critics will pour accolades on it as a ""feel good"" movie of epic proportions. <br/><br/>30 years ago parents would have dutifully dropped the kids off at the kiddie matinée and save themselves the headache. Now, in the post Spielberg and Lucas filmscape that made select children's narratives high art and the national obsession with computer generated 'art', many adults will feel obliged to see and love the latest ""wonder"" from the Walt Disney company. Worse if you are not particularly interested in this kind of cinema, numerous people think you are being too hard on such films. <br/><br/>With the Incredibles or more fitting The Incredibles (TM) there's a distinct plasticity in what so many film goers refer to now as a 'fun movie'. Sure, junk food can be a welcome treat but ultimately it can make people sick."

The story was purely OK and the characters felt uncommitted.

","The Incredibles is one of the very few superhero movies that I have seen and enjoyed, as I watch the home release frequently and continue to enjoy it every time. The animation style fits very well with the premise of the film, and it works well with the action scenes (which would normally be too over-the-top for an animated movie). The characters, as I learned from Bobsheaux, are all the same model but given slight adjustments in body, face, or both in order to make unique characters: one of the most ingenious methods of saving budget and production time. The jokes, while somewhat out of place in a movie of its type, are actually competent at setting off chortles. There are some dull moments, sure, and there are some questionable scenes (the plane strike particularly, as Mode's super suits are indestructible, therefore they could have survived the fall normally), but this is a film that you will want to check out. Long before Disney was interested in Marvel, this was all we had and we didn't mind. The best word to describe it is incredible (therefore the title of the movie and of this review)."

This is trait is thanks to the fact that the tones, jokes, and themes of the film never seem to get too campy or childish, and maintain a sense of maturity that most teens and adults can appreciate.

"sandnair87","9","1","2","8 October 2015"," 'The Incredibles' Lives Up to Its Title!
","The Incredibles follows the adventures of reluctantly retired family of superheroes who rediscover the source of their powers – in one another. Bob Farr (Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is one of the world's top superheroes, who makes a living by fighting evil and saving lives on a daily basis. But soon, he is toppled from superhero greatness, his life stolen and his soul crushed. When a man is saved by Mr. Incredible during a suicide attempt, he turns around and sues his masked rescuer for ""Wrongful Un-Death"" - and wins! This opens a floodgate of anti-superhero lawsuits, resulting in the government being forced to place them all in the ""superhero relocation program"".<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Bob and his wife Helen (Elastigirl, voiced by Holly Hunter), a famous former superhero in her own right, have been forced to take on civilian identities, in a non-distinct suburban tract house, with their bundles of joy, precociousness, and teen angst. With the exception of a new baby Jack Jack with no discernible powers, the Incredibles are a family of superhero material. Son Dashiell, possesses lightning speed, while teen daughter Violet has the powers of invisibility and force-field generation.<br/><br/>The irony is that the Farrs go out of their way to appear normal to the outside world, but they don't enjoy it. Reduced to a soul-crushingly dull job as a clock-punching insurance agent, Bob is now fighting boredom and middle age. However, Mr. Incredible still has the superhero monkey on his back and the only way for him to shake it is for him and his buddy Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to sneak out on ""bowling night"" and look for some crime to fight. Itching for greater action, the sidelined superhero gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment. It doesn't take too long, however, to figure out that there's something wrong. When a new super-villain named Syndrome (Jason Lee) emerges, backed by an army of thugs and a series of giant octopedal killer robots, a return to superherodom is inevitable - only this time, it's not just for Mom and Dad, but the kids can play too.<br/><br/>What is most incredible and engaging about The Incredibles is how, well, credible it is. The action sequences are superbly staged, inventive, and exciting, especially the fights with a many-tentacled robot. It's also a very funny movie, hilarious at every level, from school-age snickers to good-natured teen snarkiness to subtle grown-up laughter. The animation is top-notch, as we have come to expect from the wizards at Pixar. The voice cast is uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>Well, I could go on, but let's just say that everything in The Incredibles easily lives up to the title. But the highly impressive ocular feast aside, it's the well-crafted script, with genuine emotions conveyed through the characters that make such a lasting impression. Pixar blends funny visuals and amazing superhero action with strong characters and themes that a grown-up can sink their teeth into. Director Brad Bird puts his characters in real peril, keeping the stakes high and propelling The Incredibles far out of the world of ""children's movie"".<br/><br/>In a word: it is Incredible!"

"Rectangular_businessman","10","1","2","17 June 2010"," Incredible, indeed
","""The Incredibles"" is simply the best superhero movie that I've ever saw: It was much better, very much more interesting, and way funnier than boring and dumb live action films as ""Watchmen"", ""Daredevil"" and ""Hancock"". Directed by Brad Bird, the same director of great animated films as ""The Iron Giant"" and ""Ratatouille"" (Both jewels of cinematic history) ""The Incredibles"" must be his best work, with interesting characters, a great, fascinating plot and a great animation. The action scenes were great and the story was filled with tension and unpredictable twists, but also had many moments of comedy and sarcasm, something that made the film even better. ""The Incredibles"" it's a great film for the whole family, and could be enjoyed by children and adults as well.<br/><br/>11/10"
"Locut0s","7","1","2","27 February 2010"," Very good but not Pixar's best.
","While never achieving the hight of some of their later works like Ratatouille and Wall-E this is nonetheless still a very entertaining film. Expect the same masterful Pixar animation, rendering, and character design. Plot wise this is a twist on your basic comic book super hero. In this case we have a family of super heroes living in a world that no longer appreciates them. Think super heroes meet mid life crisis and you have the basic idea. Much of the film obviously borrows heavily from the James Bond genre from the music to the over the top villain and his evil super villain lair. One half expects to see Dr. Evil pop up somewhere. The writers have done a good job crafting a believable and charming family that you will actually care for, good dialogue goes a long ways here. They have also done a good job of finding creative and comical ways of using each characters super powers both individually and in tandem as a family super hero team.<br/><br/>My only complains with the film is that after watching the greatness of Ratatouille and Wall-E The Incredibles just sort of feels like Pixar was turning the crank with this one. It's still a very enjoyable film and heads and tails above most other animated works but it's not Pixar's best. It's a little too formulaic for that and the characters while charming never quite grab you they way some of Pixar's best creations do."
"dbborroughs","Null","1","2","27 October 2009"," Good, not great
","This is Pixar's tale of a superhero family in hiding, trying to cope with everyday life, only to have to step back into action when a villain seeks to destroy them and take over the world.<br/><br/>I like this film, I don't love it. I find that I really like all of the pieces but how they are put together and the pace at which they story unfolds kind of makes this a chore to get through. Trust me I am a huge superhero fan (I've had to get a storage locker for my comic collection) so it has nothing to do with the superhero s part of the story. Its just that this story just seems to ramble on and on in very good sequences which seem to me to be more about being clever than anything else. Actually I'm rambling here and the real point of this is I have no idea why this film is two hours long. Its really good, but someone need to tell Brad Bird the pace just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Still its a good film, though it should have been great."
"willingham73096","10","1","2","12 July 2007"," Wonderful movie for children
","I believe that a child's movie should be a child's movie. Which means there should not be any jokes or words that the children do not understand. If I go to watch a movie with my child, I enjoy it even more when I know that there is nothing in the movie that would make my child uncomfortable. I have a 12, 7, and 5 year. I love the way that regular people can be heroes also. I have actually walked out of a movie theater once because the movie was supposed to be for children and there was cuss words in the movie. Why???? Why do people do this? Do some parents actually like watching movies with children that have cuss words? I love the movie. I seen it at the movie theater and I watch it all the time with my children."
"robmeister","8","1","2","6 January 2007"," Pixar Does It Again!
","Okay, I'll admit it. I'm in my 40s as of this writing, and I am still nuts about animation! When Pixar and Disney teamed up for ""Toy Story"" in 1995, my mind was sufficiently boggled. Then came ""A Bug's Life"", ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."", and then other studios chimed in with their CG features, including ""Shrek"" and ""Ice Age"".<br/><br/>But this film is the one we're talking about, and ""The Incredibles"" shines as yet another feather in the Pixar/Disney cap. The movie begins with an event which leads to lawsuits and government intervention, forcing all the superheroes of the world into hiding. It asks ""What if a family of supers had to lead normal lives?"" and the answer seems clear: Dad hates his boring cubicle job, Daughter would much rather be invisible, Son lashes out too much, while Mom tries desperately to keep it all together.<br/><br/>I won't get into the plot beyond this, but I will say there are references to some of sci-fi's best in this movie. I easily spotted gags representing ""Star Trek"", ""Star Wars"", ""The X-Men"" and Disney's own ""The Black Hole"". I'm sure there are more; I guess repeat viewings are in store in order to catch them.<br/><br/>The voice cast is top-rate (Disney almost never fails on this front), with Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jason Lee leading an excellent cast. Longtime Pixar fans will also notice Wallace Shawn as Bob Parr's overbearing boss, and John Ratzenberger maintains his tradition of contributing to every Pixar film to date.<br/><br/>The animation quality is eye-popping, too. How Pixar seems to outdo themselves repeatedly is beyond me. I was particularly impressed with one shot involving a waterfall that parted so a vessel can pass through it.<br/><br/>Though it isn't quite as magical (or as innocent) as the ""Toy Story"" movies, ""The Incredibles"" is still first-rate entertainment for the family."
"Robert_duder","10","1","2","10 July 2006"," Possibly one of the greatest feats of Animation ever...revolutionary!!
","I finally got around to seeing The Incredibles which was exactly that!! Pixar has already struck gold long before The Incredibles came along but they continue to revolutionize animation making it a whole new genre that rakes in the cash and for good reason. Pixar and other recent animated features have managed to create films that kids adore but adults also love seeing and The Incredibles is the pinnacle of that conglomeration. The Incredibles storyline could have been a live action film that adults would have loved, the story, script and premise were as live action and real as it gets but instead it was animated in brilliant CGI that is stunning at times. I have to immediately point out how amazing t he water and fire effects were and I don't even have a high definition television and I was amazed by that effect alone. The story unfolds at a very nice pace without rushing to the action or funny scenes and never tries to hurry through anything. We are introduced to Bob, and Helen in their younger Heroic days and then we see them fifteen years later as the regular every day citizens trying to deal with the fact that they have super powers that they can't use to help people anymore.<br/><br/>The casting for the Incredibles is truly perfection. I've always said it's hard to judge an actor by their voice work mostly because I haven't done a lot of reviewing for animated films but The Incredibles truly captured some talented voice work. Craig T. Nelson IS Mr. Incredible and his alter ego Bob Parr. His entire performance just embodies the character and makes him come to life. His subtle voice changes and reactions and everything is just wonderful!! Holly Hunter is wife Helen Parr and also Elastigirl. She has such a distinct voice and it just melds so well with her character. I am amazed at both Nelson and Hunter's voice over work in this film. They are great together and make such incredible characters. Samuel L. Jackson to a lesser extent plays cool as ice Frozone and his alter ego Lucius Best. Jackson is terrific and his voice is distinct but completely takes over the character. I would love if either Lucius or Frozone played a bigger part in the film because Jackson is great. His voice takes new tones that I wouldn't normally associate to Jackson. Jason Lee is terrifically evil as Syndrome and Buddy Pine. He's horrible and malicious and one of the best villains in an animated film I have ever seen!! Spencer Fox and Sarah Vowell also do a great job as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's children each having their own unique powers that are utilized throughout the film.<br/><br/>I can't say exactly how much I enjoyed this film. It's probably one of my favorite cartoons hands down!! The story was brilliant and so not typical of an animated film. It held nothing back with big explosions, dangerous situations, and some very harrowing moments considering young children would be watching it. I think film makers are realizing that children aren't as fragile as initially thought with mature films like Harry Potter, Pirates of The Caribbean making huge splashes with the youngsters. And this is good because it means adults don't have to ""sit through"" a kid's flick but rather enjoy it as much if not MORE than the kids. The Incredibles is a riveting action flick with drama, tons of laughter and edge of your seat moments. The Incredibles is a must own and a must see classic for you and your kiddies. 10/10"
"jon2005","8","1","2","22 May 2006"," The Incredibles
","Pixar's sixth feature-length film is a very different approach to what they are usually associated with  instead of going with the ""cute and funny buddy-movie"", they have instead gone for a more action orientated approach, resulting in an unfamiliar yet no less entertaining film.<br/><br/>The story centres on the Parr family, consisting of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl  who were forced to go into a superhero relocation programme when the weight of the American legal system crashed down on them after Mr. Incredible is sued for rescuing a man who didn't want to be saved from jumping off a building  and their three children. Fed up with working in a dead-end job as an insurance clerk, Mr. Incredible longs for the good old days of saving lives and stopping villains. When a message comes through asking for his help he finds himself unable to resist the call to duty, but finds himself and his family in more trouble than he thought.<br/><br/>The inspiration for The Incredibles is obvious, as it takes off from just about every superhero film ever made, and sometimes it is even possible to guess exactly what film was the inspiration behind a particular scene. However, what the story lacks in originality is more than made up by its personality. The film is quite stunning to watch, raising the bar yet again for computer animation to follow (putting even Shrek 2 in second place), and the action scenes are all incredibly well put together. The script is also excellent, and although it is primarily an action film, the comedy that Pixar is so famous for has not been left out, with some truly laugh-out-loud moments dotted throughout the film (special mention must go to Edna, a 'Q' style character voiced expertly by the film's writer-director Brad Bird).<br/><br/>The Incredibles does not, however, try to give too much to the audience by simply piling on action-scene after scene relentlessly; it's too clever for that. In fact, after the beginning sequence, the superhero powers and costumes are not really showcased again for most of the first half of the film, allowing a slower paced introduction to the Parr family's new life. This is probably where the adults in the audience will find the most memorable scenes  it is a clever satire on the American legal system and an amusing take on suburban life, playing more like a domestic sitcom than anything else. <br/><br/>Both halves of the film, although made up of almost separate genres, mould together perfectly and result in a satisfying film to watch, which will certainly entertain all age-ranges. It may not be as classic or as funny as Pixar's other films like Toy Story, but it certainly proves that they are capable of more than just repeating their usual buddy-movie formula and provide some variation to their work. Pixar, it seems, are still going from strength to strength. <br/><br/>Rated: 8/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

"edinburghstoryteller","9","1","2","10 January 2006"," Pixar have done it again
","All the hype you've heard about this movie - all the people who've seen it and talk about how great it is - it's all completely justified. It seems that Pixar can do no wrong at the moment (although I'm a little dubious about the upcoming 'Cars', but we'll see). They've produced another movie that is so much more than mere animation.<br/><br/>The animation itself is breathtaking. They somehow manage to make it look very cartoony but remarkably real at the same time - almost like a cross between CG graphics, claymation and real materials. The way they handle hair, fire and water in this is simply unbelievable.<br/><br/>Setting the visuals aside, though, this film would be great if no animator had ever come near it. The script is genuinely funny and beautifully timed, the characters are good, the story is very simple but it works really nicely and the action sequences are magnificent, flowing displays of computer generated brilliance. All in all, you can't really fault this movie. It stands as one of Pixar's very best."
"harry0266","10","1","2","17 September 2005"," Visually stunning and hilarious.
","From the moment I saw the trailer, with Mr. Incredible, puffing and straining whilst trying to do up the belt on his super-suit, I was hooked. The movie itself was visually and audibly stunning, right down to the smallest details including reflection shadow, hair and facial expressions. The humour runs continuously throughout, leaving you little time to catch your breath. The viewer is almost seamlessly drawn into the intelligent and technically well crafted storyline right from the start. I can only imagine how long we will have to wait, until we're fortunate enough to see another movie of this calibre. And I can't help thinking that the cast and crew must have been, at times, crying with laughter, whilst meticulously producing this masterpiece."
"jboothmillard","8","1","2","9 September 2005"," The Incredibles
","I really looked forward to seeing this Disney/Pixar computer animated film while it was showing in cinemas, and I enjoyed all the same seeing it again, from director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant). Basically Bob Parr aka Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) with his super human strength and his wife Helen aka Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) with her super flexibility, with the help of their friend Lucius Best aka Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) with his super cool ice power, are the greatest superheroes of Metorville saving lives and battling evil with the powers every day. But after causing expenses damages and with many lawsuits, fifteen years later they have forced to retire and live as ""normal"" people in the suburbs, with their identities protected by the government. Bob and Helen during this time have made a family of three super children, with young super fast Dashiell 'Dash' (Spencer Fox), teenage invisibility powered and forcefield making Violet (Sarah Vowell), and baby Jack Jack. Bob is itching to get into the superhero business again, especially after being fired from his ""normal"" job, and he leaps at the opportunity to get it back on the mysterious Nomanisan Island, being given a new suit and some practise. Then he meets the one who made it all possible, and his new arch nemesis who will soon want to take over the city, Syndrome (My Name Is Earl's Jason Lee), formally his biggest fan Buddy, now gone bad. Soon Helen realises what Bob is up to, and with the help of Edna E. Mode (Brad Bird) she, and the two capable kids don the new costumes to go and save him, and then the city. Also starring Wallace Shawn as Gilbert Huph and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger as the Underminer. The animation is impressive, there are plenty of funny moments, the actors voicing are all good, and the action sequences are well timed, a very satisfying animated comedy adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Editing and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and was nominated for Best Sound Mixing and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. It was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"
"stormruston","10","1","2","21 August 2005"," Technically amazing and thats not even the good stuff.
","The core story, if I took the time to think about it is not that funny.Basically it is about a man who has lost his self-worth, sort of like a ex pro footballer trying to relive the glory days.<br/><br/>Fortunately the way Pixar handled the story MAKES it very funny. It is light-hearted and in very good and amusing taste.The CGI is nothing short of amazing,and the face close ups on these cartoon characters almost look real.All the voice actors are perfect, all the gags set up and animated with great comedic timing.The story is fast enough moving to keep any kid from about 4 to 400 glued and laughing for its full length.The villain is , in my mind, not going to scare any children, so tho this is not as ""kid friendly"" as say ""Finding Nemo"" it is still perfectly acceptable.<br/><br/>I laughed and was amazed all the way through this movie, I watched it with my whole family and they enjoyed it as well as I did.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"ryan_kuhn","8","1","2","12 August 2005"," ""You know I'm retired from hero work.""
","Oh how far we've come. Remember back in the 1980s when a computer generated cartoon character of a guy in sunglasses looked so ridiculous that some thought computers had no future. After the success of the Shrek movies and Finding Nemo in the early 2000s, the computer revolution reached a crescendo with Disney/Pixar Studio's movie The Incredibles. The richness and scope of the scenes in The Incredibles is what makes the movie so watchable. The story is pretty good too, a solid superhero story that appeals to both kids and adults, with a sly sense of humor that will entertain. The use of a newsreel montage takes older viewers back to the a day when all of the news came in grainy newsreel stories that had their distinctive narrators. But the punchline comes with the real modern concern presented in the newsreel: citizens suing anyone and everyone. The Incredibles tells the story of Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and how they cope with life after superheroes were ""retired"" by the government over growing legal concerns. The couple have three children, two of which have special powers of their own. Mr. Incredible takes on the name Bob Parr, with wife Helen, and kids Dash (Spencer Fox), Violet (Sarah Vowell) and baby Jack Jack, as they live a normal, boring life where they can't exhibit their powers. When Bob is given a chance to return to his suit, he takes it, working for someone named ""Mirage"" (Elizabeth Peña) who ends up working for the dastardly Syndrome (Jason Lee), who was once a huge Mr. Incredible fan. Mr. Incredible gets into big time trouble, and it's up to his family to save the day. The family becomes liberated at the notion that they can partake in their magic powers, and the energy of the movie really picks up. This leads to some standard chase scenes, but they look great due to the wonderful computer animation techniques used by the film makers. The richness of the colors and details on the screen pack the punch needed to make the silly movie believable. Samuel L. Jackson also plays a superhero, Frozone, who is mainly a background character. At nearly 2 hours long, The Incredibles is lengthy, though never tedious, and is the longest completely computer generated movie to date."

"thefuzzymeister","8","1","2","11 July 2005"," One of the best satires I have seen lately
","Helen: ""Everyone's special Dash."" Dash: ""That's just another way of saying no-one is.""<br/><br/>Polititcal correctness is one of the most detrimental things to cinematography. It says today that guns are bad, so the cannot be portrayed in kids movies, and that all kids movies must feature violence in a way which does not harm anyone. Thus, many kids movies make up the most creatively stupid ways of defeating ones foes. Another politically correct thing is to declare that all people are special.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is by no means that sort of movie. Pixar, and my hat is off to them for doing this, decided that they needed to shake things up before they went they way of Disney and started making bad cliché movies. to do this, they brought in Brad Bird, a minor director to bring in something new, thus spawning the incredibles.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this I didn't like it. The second time I saw it, it became one of my top five kids movies. What I have realized though is that this movie is not hilarious. This movie is satiric, and though it is funny, much of it is making points about the everybody's special philosophy. It demonstrates that America so wants everybody to be special, to the point that it disables the extraordinary. It makes this point very well, with a well written script, good characters, and good animated violence. For the first time since iron giant were guns actually used in a kids movie. It wasn't graphic, but it wasn't stupidly peaceful. It actually hinted at the fact that man is mortal, unlike spy kids.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson was hilarious. I personally would not have seen it again if not for him, but I loved his character so much, even when I thought I hated the movie.

","The Incredibles is a normal family in the past. There was a love and comprehension, virtues and debilities, dreams and realities. Family: a 'place' where each one was loved because of being, not by having. The Incredibles is real: a bad chief, injustices, an envious and power-lover boy converted in a real monster. But too, a baby with a beautiful future; a teenager discovering that love can much more than she think; a boy who find that the force to serve others is wonderful; a father who want justice and peace; a mother who knows be happy hidden while the moment come; all family helping, yes, ¡serving others! That's the clue: to put all capabilities and skills to service of all persons around us A family that could forgive and build a better world. Join to friends, that come out the light because someone need them. The director believe in this better world, he is not a dreamer, he knows that is the only future for the humanity: back to the true family. This family is possible now: it's real!

When the movie starts, Mr. Incredible does some showing off like getting a cat out of a tree, super hero style but after a few ""minor"" incidents all goes wrong and super heroism is forbidden.

I have seen Ice Age, Toy Story I and II, a Bugs Life,Shrek I and II, Antz,and Monsters Inc. and the quality of all of these are getting better and better as the various companies get a good handle on using the computer generated characters. I would recommend this movie to any person with or without small children.

The movie was spectacular, it had few nice thrill moments and had a nice voice cast. It is also very funny and entertaining. Visuals of the movie is very good and this movie demonstrates how CG has became natural part of animated movie production. In this movie you soon forget that everything is 3D - its like watching 2D animation movie. That's sign of good design. Soundtrack of the movie is very interesting as it combines something straight out of James Bond themes. I recommend! Certainly Pixar is improving movie by movie.

"dolneshom","10","1","2","16 April 2005"," Quite Possibly the Best Film I've Seen in Awhile
","I liked Shrek. But I had a problem with Shrek 2. It was a funny movie, but I couldn't help thinking if I would find it funny 20 years from now when all the recent pop-culture jokes referred to trends and events long forgotten by the public at large.<br/><br/>There will be no such problem with the Incredibles. 20 years from now, this film will still hold water. Brad Bird assured that by setting the story in a decidedly time-neutral setting (presumably in the '50s or '60s, though it doesn't feel like we're in either decade) and using a classic John Barry-esquire soundtrack (no modern pop tunes here -- completely analog and brass-heavy).<br/><br/>Yes, the film does pull from pop-culture, but only from time tested, canonized classics. I was born in the late 1970's but was still able to pick out the homages to the Sean Connery-era Bond films (most notably, ""You Only Live Twice"") and the golden age of superheroes.<br/><br/>In the commentary, the director speaks of melding the fantastic with the mundane. That's where the film most brilliantly shines. We know Superman's super, but what happens when he has a bad day at work and slams his car door? We've seen a bit of this in the Spiderman franchise, and I have no doubt that's what largely accounts for Spiderman's success on the big screen.<br/><br/>Most importantly, though, this is a family film for the ENTIRE family. While your kids will be astounded by Dash's speed, Violet's forcefields, Helen's shape-shifting, and Bob's super-strength, adults will identify with Bob go through a mid-life crisis while his employer forces him into a cubicle barely larger than he and his job sucks nearly every ounce of color from his life. Moms will understand the pressures of trying to raise two contentious children while dealing with the biggest kid of them all -- Dad. When not fighting crime, this family reminds me a bit too much of my own. For all of its attempts to be fantastic, the film is uncannily true to life.<br/><br/>Even though the movie runs 113 minutes, I still found myself wanting more at the end. Half the fun of this movie is watching the family interact. At the heart of the movie are the believable characterizations, excellent voice acting (You'll quickly forget that you're listening to Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter), and warm intrafamily drama. On more than one occasion, I saw my dad coming home after a hard day at the office, and my mom at home, trying to keep me and my sisters from killing each other.<br/><br/>I have heard balking that this movie was a departure from ordinary Pixar films. I have to agree, but I'm not balking. Though I enjoyed Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Finding Nemo, I thought they pandered to the kiddies too much. By contrast, the Incredibles doesn't compromise. Brad Bird is an especially gifted animation director. It was of little surprise to me to find out that he was the genius behind Amazing Stories' Family Dog. When I found out he directed a few episodes of the Simpsons, it made too much sense.<br/><br/>The movie was apparently intended as a two-dimensional animated release, but I'm glad they decided to render it in three dimensions -- both the film and the characters."

","The latest masterpiece from Walt Disney and Pixar was unquestionably to say the least ""SO INCREDIBLE!!"" <br/><br/>Robert ""Bob"" Parr (Craig T. Nelson)was once known as the world greatest superhero ""MR. INCREDIBLE"" fighting evil as well as crime on a daily basis. His wife Helen Parr (Holly Hunter)was also one of the world's greatest superheros as well: ""ELASTIGIRL"". Then you have Lucius Best alias ""FROZONE"" (Samuel L. Jackson) another great superhero considered to be cool and wild. But it's not long until a string full of lawsuits forces them to give up their costumes and enter the government's superhero relocation program where they're to live normal lives among today's citizens. Now Fifteen years later, Bob and Helen are now living in the suburban neighborhood raising a family of three children: Dash, Violet and Jack-Jack Parr. Bob wants nothing more than to relive the glory days as Mr. Incredible because whenever someone's in trouble, there's nothing he or anyone can do about it. Then one day he gets a mysterious communication from a secret agent to spring back into action which he reluctantly accepts and from there it's ""Showtime!"". But when he arrives, he is shocked to discover that the whole assignment was a trap set by a nemesis from his past: his ex-biggest fan Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) who calls himself Syndrome. After Helen discovers the truth, she has no choice but to return to her former superhero life as Elastigirl and rescue her husband. Along with the super speeding Dash and the invisible yet tricky Violet, the family must come together and save the world from Syndrome if they are to stop him from becoming a hero as he plans to fake to be one just by eliminating a high tech weapon only HE can defeat. In the end, the Parr family learn that when it comes to saving the world, they can never abandon their true selves no matter what. <br/><br/>There are so many elements this movie represents such as family, loyalty, yearning for another chance to be who you once were. But in the end, you come to cope with being who you are and who you want to be. In short, the story was excellent, the 3-D computer animation was completely awesome and the movie itself was truly, accurately INCREDIBLE!! I highly recommend it to all those who have not yet seen it."

After so many half-hearted or, pardon the harshness, half-witted movies, it is awesome to see a movie (an animated movie, no less) that operates on so many levels. The movie is hilarious while it comments on society's unwillingness to accept greatness without jealousy or fear. Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) said it the best, ""It's psychotic. They invent new ways to celebrate mediocrity, but when someone is truly exceptional..."" Very profound. Being in school, I see this the most clearly of all the movie's themes. Acknowledging greatness itself belittles none. Everyone is good at something. Sorry, a little bit of a sore spot for me. Moving along, the visual quality of this feature is excellent. The people at Pixar deserve a round of applause. Having programmed in 3-D a little myself, I have a little bit of an idea how much work they had to do. From the shape of the characters and the environments to the very physics of the Incredibles' world, they had to make it all. Bravo! I would love to see an ""Incredibles 2"".

You'll find yourself lost in the world that Pixar has created and awe at the stunning visual effects that make ""eye candy"" seem like an insult. Bring the whole family! ""The Incredibles"", aside from the action, is clean wholesome fun. Every member of the family will find something for themselves in this film.

","First things first- I didn't like Shark Tale, and Finding Nemo was borderline. My sister loves Finding Nemo, and it's my niece's favorite show (I don't know how they feel about Shark Tale), but Finding Nemo is not one I'm going to put on voluntarily. The Incredibles, though- that one I plan on buying. The movie starts by setting the scene, the way it should. Two superheroes, Bob and Helen, on top of their game, (and I love the way the ""interviews"" bring out their personalities) fall in love and get married. There's a little foreshadowing (well, not going to give that one away) and life changes suddenly, drastically. Forced to mothball his superhero outfit, Bob is hurt, bewildered, and even a little resentful. And this change doesn't just effect them- it effects their children, too. I read another posting that described the feelings of their girl, Violet, perfectly. She's a teenager, and if teenagers don't have a hard enough time already, she has a special power that she is forbidden to use, which makes her feel like it's something to be ashamed of. Stuck between a rock and a hard place (aka- protecting people and a greedy boss), Bob loses it- and then he loses his job. Then something happens that seems like the perfect solution. He gets what he wants, and his family doesn't have to move (again). He jumps at it, but doesn't realize how far down he can fall. I saw most of it coming, but that was due to the expert foreshadowing and the total believability of the characters (knowing by their previous actions and temperaments what they would do when facing a given situation), and not to a tired, cheesy plot. I loved the strong family ties, the strong friendships, the think-on-your-feet feeling that permeated the whole movie! This is not just another eye-catching, flashy show geared towards making you dash to the nearest telephone booth when you leave. This is the second time I've watched it, and if you're like me, you'll be checking your watch as you leave the theatre to see if you have enough time to watch it again. The movie's emotions are so real, so well done that you are drawn completely in. You'll laugh out loud at the wry wit, cry when they feel like crying, and get mad when they get hurt. Now, if I could change one thing, it would have been the very end, when the impossibly outrageous new villain comes to the surface. Puh-leaz! I expect that they took care of the bozo before dinner that night."

","I would like to correct ""the unemployed critic"" with his small mistake calling the film's design as ""Art Deco"". Art Deco was a design movement of the Twenties to the early Forties, more or less. <br/><br/>What makes this movie so much fun are the references to MODERN architecture and design of the Fifties and Sixties. Take a look at the Parr's house and you'll see influences by Richard Neutra, Pierre Koenig and the Case Study House project in California of the 1940's to 1960's. The flagstone walls, open rooms, kitchen miter windows and gorgeous interior design make it a thrill to explore. This movie has so many details you'll see new things with every viewing. Such refreshing and creative visuals. <br/><br/>There are many references to the modern era in general. What a forward thinking time with excitingly new architecture and design.

","Unlike DC's futuristic graphic novel series ""Kingdom Come"" which implied the children of heroes and villains unleashed Armageddon, or even Marvel's ""Earth X"" which had similar results by the heroes own doing, the premise of ""The Incredibles"" is that the very people they sought to help were ungrateful jerks - When a suicidal jumper sues for the right to die! This one act leads to an avalanche of suits against numerous heroes and eventually their forced integration into Society As We Know It...<br/><br/>Thoreau spoke of men who lead lives of quiet desperation, little realising how apt it was for Bob Parr, the ex-Mr. Incredible (very well characterised by Craig T. Nelson, whose history as an ex-football jock turned coach as well as a Commissioner of Police groomed him well for this vocal role - BTW: Ironic that Michael Chiklis... also a former Commissioner... plays a superhero too, The Thing of the Fantastic Four from which this movie under review pays tribute to), now forced to be a Claims Adjuster for an insurance company with an appropriately blood-sucking little leech for a boss...<br/><br/>However, Bob chose not to let the song die in his heart unsung and live to fight another day! At first, it was very quietly, using the company's own intricacies against it, and then finally he chose the Johnny Paycheck route, and boy - he did so in Spades! As Bob, not Mr. Incredible, he goes ""bowling"" on Wednesdays with his buddy the ex-Frozone (equally superb casting with Samuel L. Jackson - who gave the movie's best quote: ""Woman, where the hell is my Super Suit?""), but what they're really doing is listening to Police Scanners for minor crimes they can help ""solve"" with their ""incredulous"" abilities - an ultimate way of ""chilling"" with a buddy! Bob's son, Dash - short for Dashiell, like the man Hammett... an old private eye who was a real hero and and author - almost stole the show as the little Super who was not ashamed of his ability, and it's very obvious Bob is proud of his son. His sister Violet for most of the movie looked a bit like the Grudge...<br/><br/>One question remains begging is if Syndrome would still exist if Bob took Buddy under his wing, or maybe Buddy would be so much hamburger due to severe grandstanding? Perhaps that can be explored in future instalments? Their powers were Fantastic Four-ish (especially the creature who was obviously a take-off on ""Mole Man"" at the end). But the music amazingly was like James Bond, and yet it fit in well with the film, I hope they stay that way! This movie is good... but for the sequel? I think there should be an origin of ElastiGirl, Bob and Frozone and hopefully an expansion of Jack-Jack's abilities! Also I want to see more of Bomb Voyage, the idea of a French Joker looks rather intriguing!!

The costumes and the characters are carefully crafted and the voices rendered by the respective owners are quite apt and astonishing.<br/><br/>Great work by the guys at Pixar."
"supertom-3","10","1","2","7 January 2005"," Incredible!
","When you think of track records by companies that are entirely first class in the movie business, you'll be stumped but then consider Pixar. These are the guys behind Toy Story 1 and 2, A Bugs Life, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and now The Incredibles. That is a fantastic CV with nothing below very good. The weakest of the Pixar movies is A Bugs Life but that's only because it had its thunder stolen by Antz. Once again Pixar deliver a superb, exciting, funny, and all round entertaining family film. If anything this is their most adult because the first 40 minutes deals with Mr Incredibles suffering at his boring life, since he was fired as a superhero. The family of superheroes have to hide their powers and it plagues them. There is a surprising amount of everyday life, drama here and this was a brave move for a film primarily made to cater for youngsters. It has a similar thematic depth to it as another Superhero film by the name of Spiderman. They allow these characters to be real people in an extraordinary situation not just making it a simple and hollow superhero flick, all about their powers.<br/><br/>The story follows Mr Incredible and his family. For some time they have been living as ordinary citizens after Mr Incredible rescued someone who was trying to commit suicide and the guy sues him. This starts a spate of liable cases against superheroes (a thinly veiled jab at Americas sue happy culture.) and they are forced to live like normal people. This is all very well and good but Incredible yearns to be a hero again rather than a pen pusher. He and his friend Frozone go out on nightly rogue missions to help people getting into trouble along the way. The story soon has the Incredibles back donning their suits to fight a new foe, called Syndrome, also known as Buddy Pine who was once Incredibles biggest fan. They must fight giant robots on secret islands and in Manhattan as well. Rest assured the film is funny and has great action but more than that it is a change of pace for Pixar. This film is not as heavily comedic as their other films. There aren't a whole host of quirky and eccentric side characters. It's not a laugh a minute film because they have some family drama in it and it plays out more like and action movie. It never resorts to spoofing the Hero genre too much which I felt it would probably do. The film is entirely light hearted but it isn't scattered with jokes throughout. Some people may like this change while some may prefer to have more humour but in any case the film is funny enough.<br/><br/>Once again the film has the lush looking visuals and pushes the envelope even more than the last film but it works to its degree thanks to the excellent voice work. That has always been a Pixar strength, the fantastic vocal performances. You see some films where the vocal performance doesn't work, particularly in some recent Disney movies like Sinbad. Craig T Nelson is excellent as Mr Incredible and plays it very well, he makes the part his own and you must respect the fact that Pixar didn't just go for the biggest names on the block. The same is true of Jason Lee as Syndrome. The big names come in the form of Holly Hunter, as Elastigirl and Samuel L Jackson as Frozone. In one respect I can compare this excellent casting to Albert Brooks in Finding Nemo, Brooks not one of the biggest stars but he had the lead and did it well, with TV icon Ellen Degeneres superb at his side. These films could easily resort to brining in the Clooney's, Pitts, Farrell's, Blooms and giving them lead parts, without them really being suited to the parts, but they cast the best person for the job. Sure their first film might be accused of doing that by casting Tom Hanks in the lead, but he was perfect for the part of Woody.<br/><br/>This is another example of good storytelling combined with cracking visuals and its fun for all the family. It was risky increasing in the serious side and losing some comedy, because it could have alienated the kids, but the pacing is perfect and the youngsters never lost interest when I saw it, they were transfixed. As was I! *****"

","I can't believe a movie this good would rack up so many negative comments. I took my 8-year-old nephew and 7-year-old niece, knowing they both really wanted to see it, but dreading a ""kiddie"" flick. What a wonderful surprise! As others have said, this is easily one of the best movies, period, that I've seen all year, not just the best animated film. The story and the writing really appeal to an adult sensibility, especially a well-read comic geek such as myself, while the action sequences are plentiful and appeal to the younger crowd. If anything, there may be a bit too much of the family/work life scenes for younger kids--the movie is rather slow for long stretches. But I don't count that as a negative. The insights and the message which comes through is amazingly subversive--beware of a world in which there is nothing special, where mediocrity is celebrated. You don't expect that from a Disney film. The whole domestic take on superheroes and their secret identities could have come direct from an issue of Brian Michael Bendis' Powers or Alias, though not taken to those extremes. More importantly, not only did I have a great time at the film, my niece and nephew did, too. We're all looking forward to the sequel."

","An animated film that's decidedly not just for kids. In fact, kids (or adults who just want to see fart jokes and explosions) will probably find this film to be pretty slow and boring. Which, of course, it isn't.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is really a super hero/Bond tribute that deals with some rather grown up themes. There's still plenty of humour, not the laugh-out-loud kind, but more of a low key, intelligent one. It even seems wrong to call it a comedy - think of it as an action adventure, only animated.<br/><br/>Seeing this film, it's surprising that no one has dared to do an animated version on something like the Superman, Batman, or the Hulk (after all, the latest live action versions of those franchises really sucked). There's no need for photo realism, if the source material is a comic book anyway, why not go for it and make something different? The Incredbiles' plot may be far from just that, but it's a set-up that works pretty good. The voice work is, as always, fantastic. The fact that the characters have to adapt to their voices, and not the other way around, makes it seem more ""real"". It's a pain having to listen to re-dubbed versions with each country's own ""acting talents"". Subtitles is always a better alternative (unless your entire target audience is made up of kids).<br/><br/>What really makes the Incredibles so fun to watch is the amazing/incredible/fantastic/brilliant/superb animation. The movie has a style of its own, and the sets and action sequences are simply mind-blowing. This is a film that absolutely should get a sequel. [8/10]"
"TedSeay","10","1","2","18 December 2004"," Great for the kids, but better for the kid in you...
","Contrary to those who claim that, if you remember the 60's, you weren't really there, ""The Incredibles"" is a wild ride back to the future as it looked during the New Frontier. The plot recalls some of the better-known thought experiments of the modern comics era -- ""The Dark Knight Returns"" or even ""Watchmen,"" where caped superheroes are seen as the problem rather than a solution to evil, and are banished to anonymity.<br/><br/>Set in a 60's-era ambiance, ""The Incredibles"" follows Mr. Incredible through his new government-ordered existence as another ordinary guy (albeit a massively strong, hugely-muscled ordinary guy). You can feel him longing for the good old days of costumed daring-do as he strains to fit into his tiny office cubicle and his even tinier car (modeled after the Nash Metropolitan, the smallest car ever produced by Detroit -- just one of many ingenious touches by the writers and animators).<br/><br/>As other reviewers point out, this film has a deeply old-school, retro heart -- it extols the virtues of the nuclear family without being arch or ironic; it speaks to the importance of seeking excellence in all we do, despite the puny nay-sayers who surround us these days (like the ones who torment Mr. Incredible through most of the film).<br/><br/>Most of all, it establishes who the REAL Bad Guys are -- the nebbishes who insist on conformity to mediocre standards, the ones who don't want little Junior to get his/her ego bruised at the soccer match, the proponents of giving trophies to everyone who participates. ""The Incredibles"" dances all over their ilk, and has audiences cheering in the process.<br/><br/>There is enough fun here for kids to enjoy, but don't let ""The Incredibles"" fool you -- this is a movie for the kid inside all of us grown-ups."

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","1","2","26 November 2004"," slow starting but ultimately worthwhile
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Ever since ""Toy Story"" way back in 1995, the team of Pixar and Disney has produced some wonderful work. Always clever in design and graphics, the films are often fun with jokes which both adults and children alike would appreciate. With their latest feature however, they've produced a relatively slow moving film which feels more like a spoof of the Hollywood superhero obsession, than a family film.<br/><br/>Bob Parr (Craig T Nelson) is the legendary ""Mr Incredible"". Traveling around the city solving crimes, he is one of countless superheroes who are forever putting themselves out for the ordinary person. All this changes however when a spate of legal claims are made against them and the superhero relocation programme is introduced. Now placed in a monotonous job for a claims company, Parr spends his time listening to police radio bands with his friend Lucius Best (Samuel L Jackson) and arguing with his wife Helen (Holly Hunt) about their secret powers. Things are about to change for Bob however because a former acquaintance is about to make him an offer he wouldn't dream of refusing.<br/><br/>First and foremost, ""The Incredibles"" is a remarkably clever piece of animation. With characters who are stretchable, superfast and yet all too human, the animators must have had a tough job drawing scenes in the movie. When viewing the outcome, it becomes clear that they've succeeded perfectly.<br/><br/>Graphics aside however, the key issue must always be the plot and script, and sadly this is where ""The Incredibles"" slips down a bit.<br/><br/>In recent times, animation has become an increasingly family market. Producing films which contain jokes for young and old, companies like Pixar and Dreamworks always do good jobs at keeping everyone entertained. In ""The Incredibles"", questions must be raised though, over whether they've succeeded.<br/><br/>After a slow, but necessary start, the film does take off into an eventful piece. Unlike other animations though, it never really produces the jokes. There are some, there's no denying that, but the majority of times these don't really click and the audience seem almost confused by whether they were meant to laugh or not.<br/><br/>Children especially probably find it difficult to connect to this film. When so many jokes poke fun at suburban life or the general superhero lifestyle, adults and comic book fans will be enthralled. Unlike recent films like 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" however, there never feel like there are any jokes for the children.<br/><br/>In a way, the film seems to become entrenched in it's own philosophical and moral perspectives. In a similar way to the traditional Pixar short animation beforehand, the film seems to be more obsessed with teaching a lesson than with actually enjoying itself. The prefilm animation, about a lamb who looses his coat, is infuriating and annoying and tries to tell us that we should look beyond our own appearance. Whilst a worthy message, it's not something which people want to see. Then when we begin the film and we're constantly being shown how families might fight, but they come together when it matters. Again these are worthy ideals to support but it does feel like they take precedence over humour and fun.<br/><br/>To summarise, ""The Incredibles"" is a well thought out animation. It has amazing graphics, some nice spoof jokes about family life and superheroes. At the same time however, it does take a while to get going. Also, it never really seems to produce much for the children, and when a feature is a Pixar/Disney animation, surely that should be the target audience? Not as good as other animations, but for adults and comic book fans, worth a watch."

The characters were brilliant and the action was riveting. <br/><br/>I tell many of my friends how I think the Dreamworks films are way over-rated, and this drives my point home even further. While Shrek is aping the Macarena or some lame rap song, The Incredibles are making a classic. The jokes/humor in The Incredibles will still be funny in 5, 10, 20 years, while kids and adults both will be wondering what was ever funny about Shrek.<br/><br/>Sure, some of the humor in The Incredibles may be over your children's heads and the action may be a bit too intense - but it is rated PG, use your head.<br/><br/>I went without my kids.<br/><br/>Animated feature for adults made by adults. It has too many points of comic book culture to be for kids."

","You've landed here looking for what I was looking for and didn't find, a non-judgmental review by a conscientious parent that is detailed enough to contribute to your decision on whether or not you should bring your young child to see this film.<br/><br/>Naturally, you're interested because this is the first PG film Pixar has released and so you don't have a gauge. Maybe like me, you love all Pixar films. Have you seen Iron Giant? It was written by the same guy who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles,"" Brad Bird. If you haven't seen it, it's also a great film and has a lot in common with this film, though the subject matter of this film is more mature than Iron Giant (Iron Giant was, ironically, about the issues around solving problems with violence. Incredibles is mostly about mid-life crisis). <br/><br/>Here's my credentials: I have two kids ages 4 1/2 and 1. I am a strict disciplinarian but I don't have any set of religious morals I am trying to get my kid to espouse. I believe that violence begets more violence and is not a means to an end nor is it a way to solve problems. I also realize that kids are under social pressure to watch certain TV shows and movies in order to be considered cool and that sometimes I'm going to have to relax and just let my kid be a kid and satisfy his curiosity.<br/><br/>Enough with the background: Incredibles is a movie with characters most kids would love. But it is laden with mature content: violence, domestic squabbling, office politics, and subtle humor that left my child repeating ""What are you guys laughing about?"" You won't be able to explain the complexities of the humor to your child in the movie house and by the time you're done with the movie, your child will have likely forgotten what he/she was asking about. <br/><br/>The shooting and fighting abounds, though there is no death. There is more shooting and fighting per minute in this film than in Pokemon or Power Rangers. For some reason though, we parents seem to be more forgiving of comedies than of action/adventure, perhaps because the point of action/adventure is the fighting and comedies at least are about something else besides the fighting. Some young children might be scared, though my 2 (nearly 3) year old nephew saw this and had no problems and he's afraid of monsters hiding under his bed. <br/><br/>I took my 4 year old to see this and I wish I had waited until this came out on DVD to show it to him so that I could explain whenever he got confused. He was very caught up in the tension of the movie and was often so concerned about the fate of the characters that he would ask ""What's going to happen to so-and-so?"" I'd simply whisper, ""I don't know. Be quiet and watch to find out."" But it didn't do any damage as far as I can tell and now whenever I want my son to do something quickly I pretend to be Mr Incredible and get him to pretend to be Dash, the young kid superhero in the movie who has superpowers akin to The Flash. It works like a charm. And now that he's seen it already, we're going again because it really is a great movie."

","Without using the title adjective, it's hard to describe this movie and still capture all it represents. Just when we thought Pixar Studios simply couldn't top the genius of the Toy Stories, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, etc...they go and do it again. This time, however, Pixar elevates their game and content to a whole new level that makes this film a possible Oscar contender for not just Best Animated Film. Oh no. We're talking Best Picture of the Year. Why? Watch it and you'll understand. <br/><br/>Meet the Incredibles: Bob Parr (aka Mr. Incredible)- a superman with amazing strength, speed, and heart who after a series of lawsuits and anti-super sentiment must give up his superhero days for suburban life. Helen Parr (aka Elastigirl)- a superwoman who can stretch and bend herself in crazy ways to fight off evil doers or stop the kids from fighting. The kids- Violet Parr, very shy teenager who can turn invisible and create forcefields, and Dash Parr, a hyperactive superfast kid who wants more than anything to be able to run as fast as he can. Jack Jack (the baby)- superpowers? maybe <br/><br/>The Plot: Bob Parr is bored to death at his insurance job, so when the offer comes to resume his superhero work undercover, he leaps for it without telling his family. In an attempt to find her husband who she suspects is having an affair, Helen Parr finds she is accompanied by their kids who have left Jack Jack in good hands. So that I don't spoil the fun, let's just say the Parrs/Incredibles run into a whole lot of trouble before uniting into an awesome crime fighting family.<br/><br/>This summary is far from complete, but I'm telling you, give this movie a chance and you'll see what I mean (hopefully). I don't want to spoil the best parts, so I'm leaving a LOT out here, so watch a trailer to get an idea of what the animation looks like and other information. Enjoy!"

","I really liked this movie. I have seen it twice now, and both times it surprised me and made me jump. This is the first time in a while that my pulse got faster while watching a movie. It was funny, it was touching, it had action, and I didn't feel embarrassed watching a kids movie without a kid with me. ""The Incredibles"" provided some good food for thought. One I talk about with my family is why Violet has an extra power. Mr. Incredible is fast, Elastigirl can stretch, Dash can run fast, and Violet can turn invisible as well as create force fields. Maybe it was a way of showing her difference from her family. There are already obvious differences between her and her family. She has black hair while her family had either red or blond hair. And I guess one of her powers was a gimme. I mean, the girl who is shy and doesn't fit in can turn invisible? No way!"
"DICK STEEL","Null","1","2","26 November 2004"," A Nutshell Review: The Incredibles
","When I heard about the production, I wondered if it touched too close to Marvel's Fantastic Four, another superhero family of sorts - Mr Fantastic, with stretch powers, The Invisible Girl and Human Torch, self explanatory, and The Thing, with extraordinary strength. Even the villain at the end looked suspiciously like Fantastic Four's Moleman!<br/><br/>And yes, though the powers are slightly different, the bickering, interaction and relationships amongst the members are retained in the storyline. <br/><br/>Which works, wonders. Pixar has done it again, weaving strong characterization into their superhero storyline, with each family member having problems of their own, and tying it very nicely to their powers. Mr Incredible, being super strong, realizes his own vulnerability, Elastigirl using her powers to literally run and maintain the family, Violet with her powers of invisibility to hide her insecurity, and Dash, being young and eager to flaunt his powers of speed.<br/><br/>And any show which ties in huge doses of humour effectively will definitely win the crowd over, not to mention the strong supporting cast of Frozone (long lost cousin of Iceman?) and Edna, the suit designer. (I rate the scene between Elastigirl and Edna one of the best in the show)<br/><br/>Can't wait for the sequel (well, they did Toy Story II, didn't they?) to see if Jack Jack gets more screen time!"

"Thirtysilver","Null","1","2","14 November 2004"," The Layman's Word: The Incredibles
","What a film! The Incredibles is simultaneously fancifully melodramatic and viscerally real. It is fun and smart in simple ways, but not without filmic savvy. Honestly, it's the best superhero movie I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Pixar has broken the mold.<br/><br/>It was good to see (or hear, as it were) Craig T. Nelson back in action again. Sarah Vowell, a funny and talented writer and radio commentator, proves herself in this - her first film role. All the VO work was top-notch, but I was most impressed by young Spencer Fox as Dash. His delivery is flawless. He really had his character nailed.<br/><br/>From a cinematographic point of view, this movie is ingenious. Every shot is emotive. In a live-action movie, cinematography can only do so much. Most of the emotional energy needs to be generated by the actors; the best shots and angles and set dressing in the world won't make a bad performance any better. But in animated films, the actors' performances are designed down to the smallest nuance; this, I believe, can make an animated film's energy more reliable. The camera work in The Incredibles is a shining example of how competent film makers can make this advantage work.<br/><br/>I was worried that the plot would be rife with pop-culture references. Thankfully, that was not the case. The movie's story is adequately fantastic, but it stays grounded all the way through. That is to say it is a human story. And it's interesting - which is something even many live-action movies fail to accomplish these days. All the characters, even gimmicky Edna Mode, were functional. There was no one in this movie whose sole purpose was to deliver chillingly bad topical zingers and catchphrases; and I find that quite refreshing. Every character had a purpose, and that makes the plot. When you pack a film with allegorical one-liners about society or politics, you de-emphasize the plot. But this movie, as I said, stays grounded. It has a good story to tell and it doesn't sell its soul to marketers (see: Shark Tail).<br/><br/>All told, The Incredibles is probably the most entertaining movie I have seen in years. It is what a good movie should be, and it made me feel the way a good movie should make people feel - happy and excited and inspired. Watching it, I couldn't help grinning like a goofball. I was actually giddy. Five out of five. Good work, Pixar."

Well done him.<br/><br/>As for people who think the movie is too long, well errrm yes but I think it's movie that keeps on giving right up until the end. Frankly, I was disappointed when it DID eventually end! <br/><br/>One word of advice to the studio though; please, please, please don't do a sequel - it would be entirely rubbish as the family dynamic has already been explored and the only thing left would be to introduce a bigger and badder bad guy which... well, that's not the appeal of this film really."
"Captain_Jack_Sparrow_310","7","1","2","16 November 2004"," 'Incredibles' Wasn't What I Expected
","The Incredibles:<br/><br/>Toy Story, Monster's Inc, and Finding Nemo all had one thing in common, they were great family films! They were funny without being crude, and once in a while had some comical violence. The Incredibles was nothing like its predecessors! I was surprised at how much non-comical violence it had! Many bad guys met explosive ends. It is somewhat expected though because it was PG and it was directed by Brad Bird (director of the Simpsons, and Iron Giant). It nevertheless wasn't very funny like the other Pixar films, and it just didn't have the feel of a Pixar film, it was more of a mix between Spy Kids, and X-Men. <br/><br/>Bob Parr (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) was known to all as Mr. Incredible, but now the he has retired to a quiet life in the suburbs and a job as an insurance salesman. But after a mysterious person summons him to a remote island, he springs back into action, along with his superpower-endowed family; Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Dash, and Violet Parr. Then the plot thickens (maybe too much for a kids movie) when a crazy little scientist tries to take over as the Ultimate Superhero.<br/><br/>The movie is actually pretty good if you think of it more as an action film, then a comedy/kids movie. The effects once again have gotten even more realistic, every explosion actually looks real! The characters are also really funny at points! Especially Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), and a little man by the name of Gilbert Huph (Mr. Incredibles boss). There were parts where I laughed out loud, but they were few. One other upside is the previews before the movie! There is one incredibly awesome looking Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith trailer, due out in May of next year! Be sure to see that! <br/><br/>All in all: 7 out of 10 <br/><br/>Rated PG for action violence."

I'd have to say not quite, but it is great, just great.<br/><br/>It's got great action, great characters, a great story and great animation.

The action that it had was simply marvelous though, and I'm just an action freak so for me to want more action doesn't suggest much of a shortage at all. The same goes for the humor, I absolutely love to laugh. I hope I end up insane when I'm old, so I can just laugh until I die.<br/><br/>I voted a 9 for this movie, but that was opinion oriented, I recognize this movie as a 10.

"doctardis","10","1","2","14 November 2004"," Adult Pixar film
","This movie on one level is an action movie. Clearly the filmmakers are fans of action comic book heroes. The action is intense for a children's movie, and it may not be for very young children. It is more suspenseful than other Pixar films. When the characters are in danger, you think they are in danger. At one point, the mother, elastagirl, tells her children, ""remember the bad guys from the Saturday morning cartoons? These bad guys are not like that. These bad guys are going to try to kill you, and unless you use your powers they will.""<br/><br/>But the filmmakers go further to develop the comic book characters. Like Spiderman, Mr. Incredible is a flawed family man. He, after being force to retire as a super hero, is unhappy in his job as an insurance adjuster, ignores his kids, disagrees with is wife about how to run things, he is a little overweight, etc. He has the frustrations of your normal suburban husband. Adding to his frustrations is his grander image of himself. He wants to help people. He wants to be the hero he was. Mrs. Incredible has also fallen into the role of being a housewife. When she suspects her husband is having an affair she cries to a friend, ""what do I do?"" The friend, who is one of best characters in the movie, says, ""Do! You are elestagirl. You remind him who you are!"" <br/><br/>The movie beyond the fun of superheroes is about family and mid-life crisis, and it handles the issues as well as any drama. This probably the most adult of Pixar's movies, and the best."
"cobbler88","8","1","2","11 November 2004"," Slow to start, but picked up nicely *pseudo-spoilers*
","I found that ""The Incredibles"" was very nicely animated, and I enjoyed this much more than ""Polar Express,"" in which I found the animated characters to move a little creepy. It was nice that there were good family lessons taught in the film, that the children behaved generally as ""normal"" children would, and that there were positive female role models. I did think that the violence was a bit much, as well as the attempted suicide.<br/><br/>Just to be clear, by ""suicide,"" I don't mean that someone killed him or herself. But an attempt led to a rescue early in the film, when I thought there could have been quite a few other ways to set up a situation for a similar rescue other than a person intentionally trying to end his/her life via quick descent.<br/><br/>As far as the violence, I just think it sometimes departed a bit much from typical cartoon violence when ""real"" weapons were shot (as opposed to cartoonish, laser-type weapons) from time to time. There wasn't too much of that, though.<br/><br/>I just thought I'd throw those in for the adults who are concerned about bringing children.<br/><br/>I did find that the film sort of dragged for about the first half, until the entire family finally became involved in the adventure, and after that it was a very nice ride to be on. It was also nice that the heroes had to use quick thinking, and rely more on the females than most movies tend to, rather than always brute force to overcome obstacles. Even the brawn had to have some thought and strategy behind it. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I'd recommend ""The Incredibles"" for a full-price ticket, as opposed to those I'd only see for matinée prices, or wait for DVD."

","Film after film, Pixar continues its wonderful productions. They certainly understand the importance of making films that the adults in the audience would enjoy while children laughter rings loud in the hall. This film is no exception. Pixar created characters that will clearly be very memorable and may continue to survive long after the film finishes its run. Holly Hunter was great along with all her co stars. The concept seems to be a mix of the Bond movies and a touch of True Lies. The characters have been clearly immersed in reality, even named after the stereotype mother that is in reality expected to be made of stretch material to maintain the obligations and demands of her family. The relationships of the all the characters are in so many ways very familiar with a brilliant creative edge to sustain the freshness. Well executed from every angle.

I was thoroughly pleased with this movie and it was filled with a lot more violence and death than I was expecting for what appeared to be a kids movie. The voice acting was superb if the character design was a little too stylized for my taste. Jason Lee's character really brought this home. He was the perfect choice for the character, but the dragonball z look did not translate well to cgi. Also, Sam Jackson's part was not utilized properly and why was the mom's butt so big? <br/><br/>Still, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to all my friends, but maybe not their kids. <br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"Pavel-8","9","1","2","11 November 2004"," Yawn. Pixar does it again.
","As you probably know, ""The Incredibles"" is the latest effort from Pixar, the animation company that produced a few movies you might have heard of (""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", etc.). Not a bad track record, and one that The Incredibles does nothing to damage. <br/><br/>The plot itself doesn't contain anything extraordinarily unique, but it does combine familiar elements in a singular way. Take one part superhero movie, add in typical familial issues, shrink it to the level of ""Spy Kids"", animate, and you have The Incredibles. For this family with various super powers, the problems arise when they are forced to abandon their alter-egos for a normal life. Their difficulties adjusting to suburban life are juxtaposed with common family issues that are all humorously impacted by superhero problems. Despite the borrowed themes, the film still succeeds, due to the precise amount of seriousness written into the quality story and animation. <br/><br/>Somewhat like the James Bond movies, ""The Incredibles"" smartly doesn't take itself too seriously. Often accompanied by a score of also Bond-esque wailing horns, the tone of the film is serious enough to make the events matter, yet loose enough to inform the viewer that the creators understand the clichés that pop up throughout. You can envision the writers winking when the characters use the word ""monologing"" to describe the speech a villain makes right before his imminent demise. In ways like this, the movie gently and self-referentially pokes fun without the not-as-kid-friendly acid tongue of Shrek 2. <br/><br/>Unlike previous Pixar work, which dealt primarily, with worlds unseen (toys, bugs, monsters, fish), ""The Incredibles"" is a human story. Superhumans, yes, but still humans. This creates a greater challenge, as making animals and toys sympathetic is significantly easier than doing the same with humans, who need to be more rounded. But the movie uses numerous pieces from recognized types to accelerate audience connection with minimal introduction, diving directly into plot advancement. <br/><br/>Rather than lazily using those stock characters as a crutch, the movie deftly churns the known types into unique combinations. For example, everyone knows about the practically impervious superhero (Mr. Incredible), but he isn't very often a married father of three. Everyone knows about the shy teenage girl (Violet), but how often can that girl literally be invisible? This mixture of types forms the foundation of the movie's superb humor, which is largely based on the colliding worlds. I.E., what does a superhero do when an emergency arises while en route to an important event? Simple, he checks his watch, sees that he has time, and saves the day.<br/><br/>Because of the familiarity of the plot and characters, this is an important feature, as the film could easily have lapsed into superfluous clichés. Some will undoubtedly cite this triteness as a slight against ""The Incredibles"", but I would compare it to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", in that both movies simultaneously pay homage and parody the genres they reference, while still providing an expressly entertaining two hours. <br/><br/>As expected, the animation is once again stellar, not in an ultra-realistic way, but in the fully three-dimensional manner that Pixar has established. The character design is what stands out though. Since the story is set in a comic book world, the characters are all exaggerated in one way or another. Dash, a fourth-grader, is excessively short; his sister Violet is supremely slender; Mr. Incredible has a massive torso, etc. These physical features serve as personality traits of their own, and further acquaint the audience with the fictional cast. The rest of the world is similarly semi-real, which effectively matches the semi-real nature of the story and characters and completes the look for which Pixar is known. <br/><br/>Again the voice talent excels without distracting. Too often (""Shark Tale""), animated movies try to make the vocal actors the stars in lieu of highlighting a quality story. By generally eschewing A-list names for less famous but equally talented actors like Craig T. Nelson (Coach) and Holly Hunter (Thirteen) whose voices ring a bell but don't stand out, ""The Incredibles"" presents the animated equivalent of an ensemble cast. Even Samuel L. Jackson, whose voice is probably the most recognizable, doesn't draw undue attention. <br/><br/>This is the first Pixar film rated PG, and the rating is fully justified, due to plenty of action, explosions, and even a touch or two of innuendo (although it will likely go unnoticed by young children). If ""The Incredibles"" were live action instead of animation, a PG-13 would definitely have been the result. I wouldn't advise many against seeing it; just be forewarned that the movie is more mature than previous such films. The crises are a little more serious, the danger is more ""real,"" the humor is edgier. Not better or worse, just different. <br/><br/>Following in the metaphorical footsteps of Looney Tunes, ""The Incredibles"" continues Pixar's tradition of animation excellence in entertaining both children and adults. While this film is a step in a more mature direction, it maintains the youthful exuberance and wry sense of humor that permeate all of Pixar's work. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: One of the year's best. Call it a high 8 of 10, maybe a 9 as it grows on me."

For that matter, what kind of life would Batman and Robin have as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, a plain, ordinary gay couple living la vida loca in Gotham City?<br/><br/>That's the kind of question ""The Incredibles"" sets out to answer -- and fails. This animated film could have been a truly funny satire of married, monogamous (monotonous?), suburban society. Instead, it aims for the lowest common denominator and settles for being a cartoon version of your average ""guy movie"" -- an action-packed adventure filled with chases and things blowing up all over the place, but no real heart and precious few brains.<br/><br/>The only saving grace in ""The Incredibles"" is Holly Hunter's spirited voicing of Helen Parr (a.k.a. Elastigirl). Craig T. Nelson, as Bob Parr (alias Mr. Incredible), shows potential but is not allowed to develop it to the fullest. The super-children in this little family -- Dash, Violet and baby Jack -- simply fly under the radar. That's a real shame, because Violet starts out as a teenager faced with the universal adolescent task of fitting in and being liked, especially by a cute boy at school. But her character development is as flat and one-dimensional as a Marvel comic book.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" should have burned as brightly as Krypton's twin suns.

She was definitely the most annoying one, but not too much so. At first, I found the animation of the characters a little extreme... they were just all so ugly. But you get used to them after a little while. The scene where they are landing in the Winnebago was fun... one of those things that every family will relate to. Good job overall.

It was also 20 minutes overlong and dragged badly in the middle, and needed some good story editing to sharpen it up all the way through. It was very Ho-hum to me all the way and a mediocre effort at best. I generously give it a C-.<br/><br/>It's OK for kids and those others who think all animated films are just super great, but not much for one who thinks animation and its stories should stand up well against other film types, which this one doesn't do well."

"emdog15","Null","1","2","6 November 2004"," Great movie tainted by subtle propaganda
","While I loved the humor and animation of the film, is it possible that I'm the only one who noted the hidden pro-America/war-on-terror messages within its plot?<br/><br/>In the opening cartoon, the ""American Kangajack"" teaches all the other animals<br/><br/>a new, happy way of life (his way of life), and saves them from their despair. <br/><br/>None of the other animals' nationalities were noted.<br/><br/>Then we see ElastiGirl proclaim ""I'm not going to settle down. And leave saving<br/><br/>the world to men? Yeah right!"" And then shortly after we see her as the<br/><br/>domestic house wife, not only unemployed (unlike her husband), but even<br/><br/>opposed to the idea of employment (or reliving the glory days).<br/><br/>The first villain that we see is a very stereotypical French man, complete with a<br/><br/>striped shirt and beret.<br/><br/>Then we are delivered such wonderful lines as ""Mom and Dad's lives could be<br/><br/>in danger... Or worse, their marriage!"" Followed by the innocent child's<br/><br/>question, ""Why do the evil people want to hurt our marriages?""<br/><br/>The villains of the film are described as abnormal and beyond the caliber of any<br/><br/>evils the Supers have dealt with before. The mother even delivers the<br/><br/>frightening line, ""They won't hesitate to kill you"" to her children. <br/><br/>At one point the villain even mentions ""selling [his] weapons to other countries."" And creating a world in which no Supers (superpowers, anyone?) exist, and<br/><br/>thus everyone is super (the commie!).<br/><br/>And according to the film's portrayal of what is obviously New York City, Samuel L. Jackson appears to be the only person of color who lives in Manhattan.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is an entertaining, funny, and an enjoyable adventure. And though some would discredit my observations as conspiracy theory or liberal<br/><br/>spin, it is impossible for a intellectual to ignore the (intentional or unintentional) pro-America, pro-war-on-terror, anti-French, anti-gay, pro-WASP-nuclear-family bias that is subtly injected into this film."
"paragon-8","Null","1","2","6 November 2004"," Worth seeing, but perhaps not paying for.
","This film has some good moments, and my nephews, 5 and 8, found it to be quite enjoyable. It's worth seeing purely for the fashion designer, Edna Mode. I found it to be surprisingly action-packed for a Pixar film, and perhaps a little heavy-handed on the ""we are all special"" note. Compared to the absurd charm of Antz, or the mocking humor of Shrek, this film is quite straight-forward: the humor was largely slapstick or just absurd. However, Holly Hunter puts in a shining performance as Elastigirl, and Brad Bird, the writer and director, did a splendid job on voicing Edna Mode, the aforementioned fashion designer. However, Edna or no Edna, I'd recommend renting instead of going to the theater."

Pixar seriously cannot fail. Never before have I seen a company on a winning streak such as this. The film had just about everything from an excellent storyline to supercool powers. It allows time for each superhero to shine and show off their abilities. It gives us what we want to see. The parallelism between being heroes and a family was simply just outstanding, beautiful. It is so wonderful how these writers can mix in family theme with the ever-so-popular superhero theme. One sits there being able to relate to one's own family. Of course it has cool visuals and effects. Many times I found myself forgetting that this was animated. There is nothing negative I can say about this film, and usually I can pinpoint the little things. If you are looking for another excellent and fun Pixar film for the entire family, see this after reading this review.

","The Incredibles (2004)<br/><br/>Disney  Theatre  D: Brad Bird  3/4<br/><br/>Truth be known there is only one reason I went to see the new Pixar flick and that is simply the Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith trailer. Well the trailer hit all the cords it should have and hopefully Lucas may just not be washed up as a filmmaker. But May 19th is still a ways off; I better secure my tome off now. Anywho back to the feature, Incredibles is a clever take on the superhero tale. Mr. Incredible is your typical superpowered do-good-er that is until an overzealous fan helps to bring him down and all the heroes must stop using their powers and get day jobs. The film looks awesome as the Pixar films always do. But as we know graphics and effects only go so far. The clever plot hits a snag every now and then but nothing major. A lot of action with an occasional slowdown, The Incredibles will be a hit with the kids and adults alike."

","The Incredibles is simply incredible (sorry couldn't resist). This is a very entertaining movie and great to look at. It is a terrific premise. A superhero couple, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, is forced to retire after facing lawsuits from people they saved. Mr. Incredible is in a dead end job at an insurance company. However, he still wants to be a superhero. A mysterious millionaire contacts Mr. Incredible to be a superhero again with assignments for him. Who is this mysterious person? A villain from the past or a fan of Mr. Incredible? Or is both true? I like how Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and their children all have superpowers. The last half hour is non-stop action and excitement where you don't want to go to the restroom. See this movie again and again just like the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life, and Finding Nemo. 10/10."

This movie is slow and boring and with little to no laughs. One person actually fell asleep a few rows in front of me!. Its sad to say but Pixar is loosing steam, after mega blockbuster hits like Toy story 1 and 2, A bugs life and Monsters Inc. This one just lacks that magic spark that the others had. See this only only if your a die hard Pixar fan or if the kids are wanting to see it, otherwise pass and see something else."
"Scorching","7","1","2","5 November 2004"," What a pleasant surprise!
","Pixar has quite a good record when it comes to producing quality animated features. From it's pioneering 'Toy Story' to the fabulous 'Monsters Inc.' and the very funny 'Finding Nemo'. Now comes The Incredibles. This film explores the life of superheroes that all of a sudden are forced into a premature retirement, much to their dismay. However soon they are forced back into an action to counter an unlikely enemy. <br/><br/>Well because Pixar's last two efforts were comedies and based on the trailer of this one I was expecting this to also be a comedy. To my surprise their were only a few funny moments in the film. So guys don't expect to be laughing all through the movie. It was a little annoying at first but eventually I got used to it and was able to appreciate the movie more.<br/><br/>As expected the production team did a great job in creating beautiful characters and a realistic world around them. Even up to now I still can't help but admire computer made animation. I guess it has something to do with growing up and getting used to seeing animation done by hand and this one seems so different and unique to what I am used to.<br/><br/>My impression on the cast initially was not that positive. Seeing how past films would pack their rosters with A List actors to do the voicing, this one really didn't live up to that 'standard'. Plus the fact that I felt that Craig T. Nelson didn't really fit the role (as I had expected this to be a pure comedy). After the film I'm still not that convinced with Nelson but I thought Holly Hunter did a great job. You go just feel that Elasti-Girl's character fits Hunter's personality to a T.<br/><br/>I really cannot comment much on the plot line. Normally I wouldn't like this type of story which seemed a little predictable but this is after all a movie intended for the younger set and perhaps this can be excused.<br/><br/>In the final reckoning, it may not be as good as perhaps Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo but it was still a credible effort. Overall quite a solid movie which many will enjoy."

","I saw a preview of this, and while I really enjoyed it, I was honestly expecting more. ""Finding Nemo"" was a far more satisfying movie. I wanted to love ""Incredibles"", but just really liked it instead. I know Pixar are going for a more adult audience with this, but...<br/><br/>The animation is fabulous, and very ""Brad Bird"". The musical score is cool as cool gets....I want this as soon as it hits CD. (Think: a fabulous Bond/60s spy movie pastiche.) The production design is just terrific....total Ken Adam.<br/><br/>(The scene where Mr Incredible arrives on the island in the Manta Sub is so beautifully done.)<br/><br/>The major problem I have, is that the film feels like a compendium of scenes from other movies slapped together. The script just really needed some more work (some of the dialog just isn't sharp enough, and some of the plotting is a little flabby), and some scenes are just too talky. The big Omnidroid climax (I won't reveal spoilers) just didn't have much pizazz. The movie as a whole feels LONG.<br/><br/>What I did love about it: Edna Mode is quite simply the best character in the movie ( and her absence, along with the disappearance of Mirage, really hurts the movie's ending), and you'll be in hysterics every time she's on screen.<br/><br/>The scene with Elastigirl in the corridor is a classic.<br/><br/>My favorite moment: the Island Goons watching the mayhem on the video screens (you'll get it when you see it!)<br/><br/>Great stuff, but still could have been better."

","Of all Pixar's movies, this was probably the worst. What really bugged me about this movie was that the writers really tried to make it appeal to a more adult audience, unlike Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc, or Toy Story. The movie was OK in the beginning, but especially in the end the fighting kept going on and on and on. Even when they had defeated the monster, they kept adding more fight scenes. The short, however, was really funny; the people in the theater clapped for the short but not the movie. I think that The Incredibles should be watched on DVD or VHS, but it wasn't worth my money."

This movie is dangerous as it gives the sort of disgusting and dead inside people depicted as the ""heroes"" the idiotic idea that their worthless lives are worthy of cinematic treatment.<br/><br/>It is thus an insult to the abstract idea of movies.<br/><br/>The very fact that ""critics"" gave this movie such good reviews shows that even the so called intelligentsia of this country is assimilating to the craven aesthetic values of their mindless spawn.<br/><br/>First movies were considered entertainment, and some of it was entertainment.

I say kids because you will find the film very entertaining if you haven't seen a ton of movies before.<br/><br/>But if you HAVE seen a ton of movies before, there isn't a single surprise in the whole film, and its humor and entertainment relies heavily on the element of surprise. From beginning to end, there was not a scene I didn't see coming at least twenty minutes in advance. Before the film is halfway over, you pretty much know how the rest of the film will play out if you've seen many films.<br/><br/>Now, if the overused formulas and obvious plot developments are new to you, The Incredibles does it very well. Unfortunately for those familiar with how plots develop and why certain elements are put into place, you'll pretty much just be waiting for it to be over.<br/><br/>And by the way, they're working on a sequel. But Pixar and Disney have parted ways, so the sequel will be Disney ONLY. So what little innovation might have existed in The Incredibles will most likely be lost in the sequel.

This has to be the most overrated movie, unless everyone who voted is less than 13 years old. I was thoroughly disappointed.

","Superheroes start upsetting normal people through their extraordinary talents (according to the press - a-la: X-Men/Spiderman) but the time comes around when the world needs them once more. Sadly there are only 5 superheroes left: 2 white adults (male and female); 1 black man and 2 children (male and female). And it is left to this PC example of the USA to save from destruction the... erm... city that looks like New York - but isn't. The white folk are The Incredibles and the black man is Frozone because black men are really cool.<br/><br/>The animation on this film is as brilliant as any animation I have ever seen. That's my five points out of the way.<br/><br/>The story, dialogue, clichés and 'morality' of this film are as crass as any I have ever seen.<br/><br/>If you're still reading on I shall keep things to a minimum. Rejected youth becomes baddie. Yawn. Son of Incredibles (i.e. young child) is seen to celebrate when he kills off the 'bad guys'. Repellant. Daughter of Incredibles is awkward, rebellious teenager who wears her hair forward and covers her pretty face. In order to fulfill her 'super' duties she must wear it back. Her pretty face is revealed, she stops being rebellious and her dad likes it. And, of course, now she does too. Because there's nothing like killing off lots of baddies somewhere to make you realise you have to make the most of your good looks!!!!! And the film was only funny in three places. (Anything with the Rosa Klebb clone in).<br/><br/>And the music was almost totally ripped-off from James Bond because, let's face it, that's what Brad Bird wanted to make but, because he didn't have the courage of his convictions, he added a thin, underdeveloped, 1 dimensional character 'story' about familial relationships which can convince no-one who actually has a family.<br/><br/>This story is not about subduing the best or celebrating mediocrity. This story is about how killing lots of certain people is OK (whether you're a child or not) if your culture says it is OK and if your animation is brilliant. It has nothing to to with the Brothers Grimm or any dark fairy-tales. Sadly, I suspect it has too much to do with Brad Bird wanting to re-create an already popular adult franchise and market it at kids. Bad luck to him.<br/><br/>And Toy Story 2 is one of my all time favourite films. Check it out for story, character, humour and morality."

","I decided to go and see that film after seeing the commercials/trailers on TV. It looked like smart fun, for grown-ups as well as kids. Since my daughter came after Christmas for a week, I thought that's a good chance to see it. It's a cartoon about a family of ex-superheroes (Dad is super-strong, Mom is flexible, like she can stretch her arms 10 metres) and their two teenage kids and a baby. Ex-superheroes because all the superheroes got sued by people that got hurt by them in the process of getting rescued, silly things like that. Well it's completely imaginable that some American lawyers would come up with such ideas, just think of the granny that sued McDonald's because the coffee was too hot - give me a break! Anyway all the super-heroes retired to live a normal live, secretly, unknown to be those ex-superheroes. But since Daddy is a bit of the body builder stereotype (all muscles no brains) he gets the family into trouble with a bad guy and they have to fight. So apart from the story, which was okay, how did the film fare? I would say it was plenty of fun for my daughter, but it's not exactly what I would call a good cartoon that is also recommendable for grown-ups. If you're curious about the films, see all the trailers you can find on-line, and then you have seen all the good stuff of the film. The rest is a bit boring and a bit too long."

Did anyone else notice the cunning similarities? Well, watch X-men and you will see what I mean. I was waiting for the movie to be over after the first thirty minutes! I can not believe all the raving reviews I have read! They all must be written by teenagers and older adults still in love with superheros and fantasy lands, where role playing leads their life.

A good song could have helped a little, but there was none, or was there, I don't remember. <br/><br/>Animation is decent, but it does not save in the absence of a plot or characters. What kills the movie completely is a very slow pace. After 15 minutes of complete boredom one wants to live the theatre.

Bob Parr and his wife bicker all the time and there is no parent-child bond between them and their kids. I do like the Mirage character, who brought the plot some suspense when she asked Bob to do the secret mission.

","In ""The Incredibles"", Mr. Incredible wants to relive his glory days because he and Frozone listen to police scanners and because he accepts Mirage's secret message. Furthermore, he has his super suit on in the end of the film, which clearly shows both his determination to once more become a super and his desire to relive the old glory days. <br/><br/>I watched this film many times and I never got tired of it. Every time you view it you see something newsomething you would have never thought computers could do. ""The Incredibles"" is a computer animated film by Pixar about a retired super hero family living normal lives. They have average jobs and the children go to public school. Their powers aren't revealed to anyone but family.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible is married to another super (one who has a super ability) named Elastigirl. They have a family together with 3 kids, all with their own special abilities. Though the parents believe that their youngest child has no powers, in actuality he does. Unfortunately they don't use their powers but instead they live mundane lives. However, Mr. Incredible is bored out of his mind with his average life and he wants to relive his glory days. Those days consist of saving the town's people from criminals committing crimes and getting praise from the town. <br/><br/>Mr. Incredible spends his Wednesday nights with a fellow retired super named Frozone. They lie to their families and say they are going out to play bowling. But instead they listen to police scanners and wait for some local problems to arise and fix. Once they hear of a problem they put on masks and go hurry to the specific site. When they get there they play super hero and save the day. This act of rescue clearly shows that Mr. Incredible misses his super hero life.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible also shows his longing for the old days by accepting these secret missions from Mirage. She is one of the few who knows that he is a super. She asks him to stop this big machine that went out of control on this deserted island. He gladly accepts the challenge from Mirage and thinks of this as an opportunity to enjoy life and become a super again. And so he flies to an isolated island to stop this monstrous machine. He successfully accomplishes this difficult task and then continues on accepting more missions that Mirage offers him. He soon feels like a super again and enjoys life like it was back in the glory days.<br/><br/>Furthermore, at the end of the film Mr. Incredible has his super suit on under his regular attire. This new enemy arises at the end of the film and Mr. Incredible and his family are prepared with their masks and suits on ready to take on whoever is there to disturb the peace. They now are not hiding their powers but instead are using them to help the city. The glory days for Mr. Incredible have been relived and now he shares this experience with his loving family.<br/><br/>This is a great film so watch it for yourself if you have not seen it already.

"Punisher-8","6","1","3","6 December 2005"," The Incredibles is not a bad movie. It's not a masterpiece either.
","Since many advised me to watch this movie, I decided not to be a hard head and give it a shot. I wished it was good, since Pixar is one of the most respected digital animation companies around. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed. I am aware I'm stepping on a lot of toes here of people who completely disagree, so I'll explain, or at least try to.<br/><br/>Now to start with something positive. The style of the movie is based on the so called ""Kitsch"" art, a mid 50's pop culture style. Which is what gives the Incredibles the indistinguishable look of the 50's and class. Worked out greatly, since It's not an easy thing when you consider the movie is computer made, and the 50's didn't exactly have a lot of that at the time (read: nothing).<br/><br/>The movie ridiculous movies of the same time period it style is, like James Bond. And also newer ones like star wars. Unlike Shrek however, it fails. It fails at making a point and it fails at making it funny.<br/><br/>Now to the real downsides of the movie. However, simply getting the style and setting of the movie right does not make it a good movie.<br/><br/>The movie was empty. Empty, caused by a lack of emotional feeling and an catching storyline. While watching it, I simply couldn't care less about what happened to the characters. It was like watching Pokemon. It's watchable, but hey, nothing happens to call the queen about, it's obvious from the beginning how the scene will end. Which brings me to the script, which ending was also obvious from the beginning. Now, I know that is the case with many many movies, but with the good movies, It's often worked out in such a way the ending is still a revelation. While in other cases, it makes you drop a tear and feel warm inside. None of this was in the Incredibles. The movie ended, and I was untouched. Not just by the ending, but by the whole movie. The best it did was give a little smile from a simple joke.<br/><br/>This movie, sadly enough, could have been made by Dreamworks*. Except it did truly attempted, and at some points succeeded to make an animation movie different from all other ones. The Incredibles is not a bad movie. It's not a masterpiece either.<br/><br/>*Dreamworks, in my opinion has merely copied everything Disney/Pixar made to make cheap money, ever since Shrek (Shrek II does not count since that is just a sequel of their own work)."

","After the rather disappointing Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo, my hopes were definitely not high for this outing from Brad Bird. I was wrong to think that. Boy, was I wrong! <br/><br/>First, The Incredibles is not a comedy like Monsters and Nemo. Sure, there are comedic elements, but mainly this movie is just an extremely entertaining action movie. Which is kind of hard to take in at first since we're talking about a Disney/Pixar animation. The film has a warm and familiar feeling, which is a mixture of three things.. X-Men, James Bond and well, animation (duh!). X-Men, because the superheroes, or ""supers"", all have unique powers which resembles the tone of the X-Men. James Bond, because stylistically, The Incredibles has taken many references from the series in case of the production design and music. For example, the capsules that travel on the track around Syndrome's island are almost identical of those seen inside SPECTRE's fake volcano in You Only Live Twice. And not only that, the period is in general very much taken from the sixties, which brings back memories from the early Bond-films with Connery. <br/><br/>The voice talents are doing a great job (Jason Lee rocks!) and this film deserves an extra thumbs-up for containing some traditional emotional moments without being melodramatic or tasteless at any point.<br/><br/>***** / *****"

I certainly didn't think so, and after thinking a lot, honestly i didn't come out as satisfied as animated films like Shrek 1 and 2.

It's cool to see how much improvement computer animation has come in such a short period. The details of the tiniest objects are mind blowing. The powers of the super heroes in this movie aren't anything new from other superhero movies, comic books or TV shows but it was the way this movie put the superheroes into normal-everyday life that was new and interesting to see. As a result, this normal, everyday things may have made the movie drag on a little bit but I think it was necessary. If everything was just exciting and fast paced, then the excitement of seeing the climax ending would have been lost. I liked the old-fashioned, classic feel to the movie too.

","It's hard not to like a Pixar movie. I have enjoyed them since I first saw ""Luxo, Jr."" and their other exceptional short films. The animation in Pixar films is extraordinary, but it is the characters that make the movies so enjoyable. Since they are family-oriented, they also have to find the magic that makes the movies entertaining to both adults and children.<br/><br/>There are two distinct parts to this movie. In the first part, the Incredible family is trying to live as normal people in society, although they have extraordinary skills. In this part of the movie, the Pixar magic is in full swing. The characters are interesting and the humor is sometimes nuanced and sometimes right down the middle.<br/><br/>The second part of the movie is oriented more toward the action and the Incredibles as action heroes. I think this movie is oriented much more toward the kids and I found it to be less interesting.<br/><br/>It's still an entertaining movie, but I don't think it is quite up to some of the other Pixar movies such as ""Toy Story"". If you have young kids, it is a good bet. If your kids are grown, as mine are, and you are viewing this with adults, it's still entertaining, but not quite as much of an easy recommendation."

","What could I possibly add to any discussion of The Incredibles? Its popularity is worldwide, and its critical success sewed up with an Oscar. It is an incredible movie in many ways. It has some crazy, innovative animation that will leave your jaw dropping at times. It has some humorous looks at humanity that few films explore. It is in every sense a family film when so many pretend to be just that. But is it THAT incredible? Don't get me wrong. I loved the film. I thought how clever this was and all that, but I wasn't bowled over like I had been when I saw Finding Nemo...or Shrek...or even Shrek 2 or Shark Tale. It must be me. I thought the film was very good...even excellent...but not the best. The story was just not strong enough for me nor were the characters as to give them that kind of attention. The family members...and I am not going to give a general overview of plot when so many have done so...were interesting characters but when separated had little of the specialness of other animated characters when standing alone. I guess if you wanted Dora in Nemo or the Donkey in Shrek to do a film as the focal characters - they might be able to carry a film on their narrow shoulders (or fins) if possible. Would any of these characters be able to do that? Let's face it the most interesting character was the crazy, short costume designer(an obvious and funny homage to the late, great Edith Head). I thought the villain in particular was very weak. I'm not panning the film. It is a great animated film and is very funny and so on. I just don't know if it has earned all the praise lavished on it. Anyway, I want to recommend this film as a fun film and definitely as a fun FAMILY film. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunetr, especially Samuel Jackson as Frozone, and all the rest do a great job suiting their voices to characters and breathing life into this animated classic. (Yes, I did like the film.)"

""The Incredibles"" plays out like a collision between every superhero comic book that director Brad Bird has read in his whole lifetime, and the super-villain clichés are there too, and the bad guy acts as if he KNOWS that he is destined to lose the battle.

","While i usually steer clear of family movies, this one had a certain appeal. Not enough for me to pay to see it, but enough that i could watch it for free. And i had a good time. The Incredibles follows a family of superheroes who come out of retirement to save the world. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson provide great voice work, and and some of the flick's funnier moments. I was also pleasantly surprised that the action scenes were entertaining, including a battle with a robot that was much better than the crappy idiotic fights from Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The film has some amazing visuals, some of which i thought might have been real. The team behind it, Pixar, also made one of the only family movies i really love, Toy Story.<br/><br/>As much fun as the movie is, it gets a little slow at some points if your not under 12 years old, and the story is almost non-existent. Still, it is a great movie to watch on a big-screen or with the little kiddies, but nothing to replace a nice R-rated gangster/action/porno/comedy/documentary. 7/10"
"monkeeking","Null","1","3","27 February 2005"," Why is it that the genre ""Family"" is always attached to ""Animation""?
","""The Incredibles"" is the animated adventure about of Mr. Incredible, a former superhero who is trying to live life normally under his secret identity. This is all happening 15 years after a series of major lawsuits against superheroes by the people they saved. After much controversy the government had decided to offer the superheroes a relocation program. However, civilian life just isn't working out for Mr. Incredible, his wife Elastigirl, there 3 ""special"" children, and former superhero Frozone. Mr. Incredible, after losing his job in a fit of rage against his annoying boss (he is an insurance claim specialist; ironical since he likes to save people), is approached by a secret employer to once again don his suit and save the world. It soon turns out though that this secret employer is none other than a deranged stalker from Mr. Incredible's past, who now wants to kill all superheroes and sell his inventions (things that make people super, e.g. rocket boots) so no one will be super. It is now up to the Incredible family (kids too) to use their powers and save the world from this maniac.<br/><br/>Pixar has come a long way and this movie only goes to show us the progress they've made in the field of animation. Another plus this movie has is the sheer awe that we feel towards the animated action on screen. What suffers from this is that the movies relies too much on a theater's big screen and surround sound. The whole plot and almost every action sequence can be traced back to the classics. It is as if you were watching ""Star Wars"", ""James Bond"", ""Superman"", etc. over again just animated and replaced with dialogue filled with poorly timed and over-used jokes. Where these movies were fresh and groundbreaking, ""The Incredibles"" is clichéd and predictable. This should be acceptable since ""The Incredibles"" is a comedy, but the movie doesn't make fun of the clichés like ""Austin Powers"" or ""Space Balls"" do, which is the only way a comedy relying on them can survive. When you throw in the mushy morals of a Pixar feature (which were acceptable in their earlier movies but not after so much re-use), this movie becomes unbearable. It is still possible to find refuge in the wonderful plot which can still be fun despite all the hang-ups.<br/><br/>Why it that the genre ""Family"" is always attached to ""Animation""? 6/10"

The animation of each character was top-notch, in particular the females' faces were extremely realistic. It was fun to learn what ""powers"" each family member had, and to see them use those powers. Having a dysfunctional family, with all the family problems made the movie more realistic. It also helped you connect with the character when you saw their struggles. There are many adult overtones that make this much more than a cartoon, yet it still holds the magic for the children."

The family is a good bunch of superheroes. But the best part of this very entertaining film, for me, was the designer of costumes for the Incredibles. He/she is a truly hilarious character with overtones of Edith Head, a little Coco Chanel, a dash of Kenzo, and a tiny bit of Linda Hunt in Robert Altman's comedy ""Pret-A-Porter (Ready to Wear).""

","This was a good film for all the family. Once again Pixar and those people at Disney have put in enough humour for the grown ups along with all of the good clean wholesome fun that you want your kids to see. There were no moaning kids during this film, even though the popcorn had run out well before the trailers started. It's quite long, 2 hours, which is long for younger children but they sat still throughout the entire film. In fact the kids were so impressed my older two took themselves off to the cinema with their pocket money to see it 3 days later. <br/><br/>I wonder, did other adults notice how they'd modelled the older daughter on Sadako from Ringu? It was just something some adults might spot and would have one over on the kids when it came to one film fact.<br/><br/>The story follows the lives of two superheroes who after getting married are forced to settle down in the wake of public opinion no longer wanting superheroes. The kids they have, also become super-powered and soon enough the world needs superheroes again. The film is great fun with good effects, a fun soundtrack and likable characters. There are plenty of laughs and kids will be comparing who is the most powerful or has the best powers after it's over.<br/><br/>I'd have to rate this up there with or possibly above similar types of films such as Shrek and Toy Story. I'd say it was a better film than Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Definitely a good movie to see."
"movito72","8","1","3","19 December 2004"," Pixar creates another winner
","The animation team at Pixar has created another winner. In this fun, adventurous, and often hilarious film, they take the field of animation to new heights. During some of the scenes it was mind-blowing how fast-paced and sharply animated everything was, especially in the climactic chase. The film's director, Brad Bird, brings a new, adult depth to this Pixar installment that was never present in this fullness before. Both kids and their parents can enjoy the movie, although it will be different depending on who watches it. To kids, it will just be a cool, action-packed movie about superheroes saving the day, with many fun characters and locations along the way. To adults, the film will come across as a witty satire on pop culture and the world today, while still being a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The movie centers on Bob Paar, an insurance clerk who has a wife and three children. Bob has a past as a superhero, Mr. Incredible, but had to put it behind him fifteen years before after several mishaps turned into lawsuits. The resulting Superhero Relocation Program tried to blend the ""Supers"" in with the rest of the world, but so far for Bob it hasn't worked out very well. He can't seem to escape his urges to help other people, and because of his actions his family has been moved several times. After three years at his present location, however, he again becomes bored and starts longing to go on another Superhero mission. He gets his wish when a mysterious woman named Mirage invites him to an island in the middle of nowhere to fight a giant robot and dismantle it. That's just the beginning.<br/><br/>Bob's family consists of wife Helen, formerly known as Elastigirl; daughter Violet, who is able to use telekinetic powers to create force fields; son Dash, who can run as fast as The Flash; and infant Jack-Jack, who has no powers to speak of yet. The voice talent in Pixar films is always very good, and the roster for ""The Incredibles"" is no exception. Craig T. Nelson lends depth and humility to his role as Mr. Incredible, and he is aided by Oscar winner Holly Hunter as Elastigirl, Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone, Bob's best friend who can freeze even the moisture in the air, and Jason Lee as Syndrome, the twisted villain of the film. Director Bird himself plays Edna Mode, a fashion designer who makes suits for superheroes and is a very humorous character, looking frighteningly similar to Old Hollywood costume designer Edith Head.<br/><br/>While some plot points are predictable, mostly the film's structure veers off on its own course. I had no real idea what the film was about until I saw it. Bird spent four long years getting this made, and every frame is so beautifully animated and conceived that I wish I had a pause button so I could stop and look at some of the painting-like shots the animators have created. Pixar has proved once again that their name is synonymous with quality movie-making, and I tip my hat to them"
"thatafrofool","Null","1","3","18 December 2004"," Truly Incredible
","Brad Bird struck gold when he dreamt this up.I will not spoil the story for the few who haven't seen it at this point, but let's just say that The Incredibles' story is more than just a slight kiddie version nod to Alan Moore's nightmarish landmark comic The Watchmen, and any fan of the Fantastic Four would be interested in the similarities in the story, accompanied by animation virtually flawless- especially in the action sequences,Pixar keep on surpassing themselves.What's also cool is that is has none of the typical Disney shoot-you-the-head way too PC moralistic sentimentality- an adult can happily sit through the film and laugh at the in jokes the kids will miss without feeling like you've been bashed over the head with a message.The story, characters, everything about it is truly incredible.The film is flawless.Go see it.Excuse the lousy pun, but it is incredible."

The CG studio has a knack for producing films that appeal to adults and kids, with stunning visuals, great story lines and outstanding casting. This is no exception. With a lineup that includes Hollywood stalwarts Samuel L. Jackson, Holly Hunter and (underrated) Craig T. Nelson, the film propels by at rocket launcher speed with just the right mix of comedy, action and pathos. Though a bit predictable in a couple spots, it has lightning pacing and a wonderful script. Brad Bird has invented a whole world, combining elements of early James Bond, the Jetsons and classic serial comic books. He even manages to work in references to latter day classics, such as Terminator 2. I can't wait till my kids buy me the DVD!"

"oshram-3","6","1","3","7 November 2004"," Not all that incredible
","Pixar's latest offering, The Incredibles, takes a stab at the superhero genre. Saying it's better than most superhero films isn't saying much; is it really a feat to produce a better film than Daredevil, Hellboy, or Catwoman? The Incredibles does have a nice twist working for it: what if, like some demented Alan Moore comic, the supers were no longer welcome to do their job and had to settle for being normal people? How would they respond to that? That's the basic gist of The Incredibles, and we focus mostly on Mr. Incredible, aka Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson), who is definitely having trouble fitting in. His wife Helen (aka Elasti-Girl, voiced by Holly Hunter) is having an easier time of it. But when an opportunity to go adventuring again knocks on Bob's door, he furtively accepts it, not thinking through the consequences or asking too many questions.<br/><br/>By now Pixar has perfected their production abilities. Everything is flawlessly fashioned, and that other world they are able to create, while never before quite so close to our own, is still very convincing here. Though we see few other heroes (pretty much only Frozone, voiced by Samuel T. Jackson), we are given enough of the 'super' world to make everything believable. Pixar tends to excel at world-building, and since this film was handled by the talented Brad Bird, you'd expect nothing less.<br/><br/>The problem is, there's a certain indefinable something missing from The Incredibles. It's fun, mostly, and enjoyable, and pretty well paced most of the time; it gets a bit talky in stretches, and the multiple attempts at an ending irritated me (just end the movie already, Brad!). The villain Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee but damned if he doesn't look and sound like Mark Hamill) was well-thought out, even if his major scheme is lifted lock, stock, and barrel from The Watchmen. But unlike other Pixar films, this one seems to lack a little heart. The family scenes with the Parrs are all nice, and the kids Dash and Violet are well-realized, mostly (Dash gets all the best action scenes, especially the one stolen from Return of the Jedi). But this movie lacks that special spark that say, Finding Nemo or especially Toy Story had. At the end of both of those films, I felt a wealth of emotion that actually moved me (Toy Story 2 especially); here, there was nothing, just a recognition that the story had come to a nice place to end. That's not bad, and there's nothing wrong with it, but it certainly doesn't live up to the other Pixar movies (except Bug's Life, which I never cared for).<br/><br/>It doesn't help that it feels like you've seen so much of this before. Granted, there are so many superhero films, cartoons, and comic books that we've been inundated with variations on the idea. But while The Incredibles handles the genre reasonably well, there was a LOT of it that reminded me of other movies or stories, and thus at times it felt predictable (which you simply couldn't say about Nemo or either of the Toy Stories). Frozone is nothing more than a well-rendered Iceman; and while Elasti-Girl is pretty original, Mr. Incredible is simply the answer to the question, 'What if you had too much Clark Kent and not enough Superman?' and that's been explored a LOT, given that Clark's had two TV shows in the past decade.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film. Dash's action scenes are all a great deal of fun, and the Brad-Bird-voice fashion designer, Edna Mode is hysterical  really the best character in the whole thing. But Syndrome the villain is hackneyed, even down to the underground lair and the pseudo femme-fatale henchwoman; if you were going to do a fresh twist on the super-hero genre, why rely on so many clichés? Ultimately The Incredibles is a fun diversion, but little more. A lot of movies would be happy just to achieve that, but given Pixar's track record honestly I was expecting a little more. Certainly it's worth going to see The Incredibles in the theater, you'll have fun, it's just not the keeper that Pixar's other films are and doesn't merit a place on your DVD shelf like their other movies. Or like Shark Tale."

","This movie was exceptionally well done, and really makes me want to see Brad Bird's other film, The Iron Giant. The plot was well crafted and clever, and the entire theater was cracking up the entire time. The props has a retro flare, and the character development was really well done. All of the credits were at the end of the movie, and they held the entire crowd. The above-the-line credits were mostly shown over the pre-vis blocking, which was a really neat effect. The below-the-line credits were slowly scrolling vertical credits with a twist. Each block of credits was on a different plane and appeared next to a colorful design. This movie is anything but disappointing, and well done til the very end."

","Just after superheroes Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl tie the knot, a series of insane lawsuits by citizens affected by Incredible's feats of bravery prompt the couple to go underground as suburbanites Bob and Helen Parr; fifteen years and three kids later, Bob is recruited by a mysterious organization to fight a powered-crazed machine on a remote tropical island, but his association with this outfit may prove more dangerous than he's initially led to believe. Disney-Pixar animated adventure has flair and in-jokes (both verbal and visual) to spare, but only the canny opening moments are really engaging (with pseudo interviews and retro newsreel footage). By the second half, it has become another video-game-turned-movie, however it never looks less than stunning and almost retains its fresh wit to the finish line. Writer-director Brad Bird doesn't seem to mind if the overload of action completely self-destructs, as long as he can get in a few more visual whammies (while mounting three continuous endings--two would have been sufficient). A sequence with Mr. Incredible bound and tortured doesn't work at all, and neither does the second ending with a surprise from baby Jack Jack. The voice-over work is very good (with perhaps too much of Holly Hunter), and the film has amusing and amazing details throughout, but somewhere along the way the story comes undone. **1/2 from ****"

","i did not like this movie at all. They are trying too hard to be funny and its just 2 new. Like most films that are new.. they suck. But this film is just worse then suck, with the lack of animation, cheesy talking, and cheesy voices. They should make an entertaining, fun movie.. like Stuart little. It makes sense. It has somewhat reality.. and is performed with excellency. Don't watch this movie.. unless u like cheesiness. The movie.. has motivation.. but horrid animation. The attempt for 3D doesn't work for this movie.

","The whole Incredible concept is fine. The score is much better than the ""none-score"" from Finding Nemo. But again we have the same problem. Just the same problem from Finding Nemo. This movie is too long. The story in general is fine, but is some scenes were cut or shortened the movie would be much better. Some special effects are great but the characters design should be improved. Bob looks like a fat giant with a little head. Violet is like a stick with a basket ball on top and Mirage is even worse. Her face was fine, but while watching this film I always kept thinking that sometime her legs could break. Jack-Jack was just weird. Edna was so ugly. The only convincing character was Helen. Some positive points are the domestic relationship between Bob and Helen and some adult themes (the suspect that Helen had that her husband could be cheating on her). It's much more enjoyable than Chicken Little."
"whizkids","8","1","4","2 August 2005"," As far as Computer-animation movies have been going, this one is alright.
","In an imaginary world, super-heroes are real and there are apparently a lot of them with numerous types of powers. They use them for good to defend people against those who support evil, lust for destruction and have an itch for monologuing on their evil plots. But, lots of people are still unhappy with them, claiming sometimes that they didn't wanna be saved, have suffered injuries during those rescues, and so on. Super-heroes nation-wide are being sued for everything they've got. So they're put into a special government protection where their pasts are erased, identities are protected and they can live normal lives on the condition they never use their powers again. This isn't so great for Mr. Incredible (a guy whose super-power is super-strength)who misses the action, protecting the innocent and the glory. Then he gets an offer by a mysterious secretary who calls herself Mirage (which is very convenient since he's just lost his job again), but it's not all kosher as he finds out. It ends up he has to be rescued by his wife, Elllastigirl and their children, Dash (the name tells you his super-power) and Violet, who has the ability to turn invisible and project force-fields.<br/><br/>OK, I'd have to give it about five stars.<br/><br/>One star is for the animation. Pixar is very good at doing these animations, and this movie is no exception. Between the backgrounds, the explosions, and the characters, the animation is some of the best I've seen around.<br/><br/>The second star is for the funny moments. Unlike some other movies of this type, some of the humor isn't mind-numbing stupidity. There are some genuine humorous moments, such as when Frozone is looking for his super-suit and he's arguing his wife to find it.<br/><br/>The third star is for the morals. The super-heroes risk their lives to protect innocent lives. Mr. Incredible is tempted to kill Mirage to get free of the trap, but opts not to. Family is placed on a high pedestal and Mr. Incredible realizes that he shouldn't place sought-after glory of being a super hero for spending time with his family.<br/><br/>The fourth star is for the fact that they do a pretty decent job making fun of comic-book superheroes. From Marvel to DC, no super-power is safe from them. Flight, X-ray vision, the ability to freeze things, super-speed, the list goes on and they have a lot of fun poking fun at them all, even down to fashion (""Capes will be your downfall!""). As a superhero fan, I do like that.<br/><br/>The fifth star is because, well, it's just plain old better then the last one, Finding Nemo. Oy, was that a mind-melter.<br/><br/>If your kids enjoy superheroes, but you don't want to expose them to the life-action violence that X-men, Spider-man and Batman bring, then this is a pretty decent substitute."
"Skeptic459","10","1","4","16 February 2005"," What a cool movie!
","I thought the Incredibles was brilliant! There are few films that bring out your inner child. In fact, most irritate you! However, this film is like picking up your first superhero comic. What is truly awesome is when all the factors of a big budgeted film come together to make a truly great picture. Pixar cannot seem to make a wrong move. I have not seen any of their other pictures but they are meant to be very good. When effects, acting and story come together it is actually very impressive. George Lucas take note! <br/><br/>The voice acting in this film is very good. Craig T Nelson makes a very funny, kind of deadpan Mr Incredible. Also, Jason Lee was an interesting choice to be the baddie, Syndrome. Holly Hunter is also good as Elastigirl. They give the characters a lot of life, which is a good thing considering how flat comic book characters can be. But Brad Bird steals the show as Edna Mode. The superhero fashion designer.<br/><br/>What is refreshing about The Incredibles is that it takes a kind of Simpsonesque humour to Superhero movies. With so many 'serious' superhero movies coming out, it is a much needed change of pace. At the heart of this movie is a very well written and clever story. The Incredibles has a solid storyline, instead of being the usual one joke wonder that afflict superhero parodies.<br/><br/>The film cuts into the heart of suburbia and takes a look at things like boredom, mediocrity and a stifling sameness. The protests against everyone being the same. The Incredibles are superhero's! Why should they just be like everybody else? All attempts to suburbanize the Incredibles end in failure because they represent the forces of difference and uniqueness. Are not superheroes the ultimate or the most individual of individuals? The film amusingly gives us a look into the everyday lives of superhero's. Mr and Mrs Incredible get married, have kids and get a bit overweight. A very funny example of everyday superhero life is when Mr Incredible works for an insurance company. Another funny bit is when he states that he feels like the maid! Can't the world stay saved for at least 10 minutes? In these moments, that is where the inherent charm lies in the film.<br/><br/>There are many great moments in this film. When Frozone is trying to get his suit and his wife is yelling at him. The jokes about villains monologuing. The cape story of Isadora Duncan that not even I was aware of. The domestic over finding the way to the villain. The family squabbling. There are just heaps of funny bits and it does remind you of an episode of the Simpsons.<br/><br/>The animation is also really cool and everything has this awesome 60's retro look about it. In fact, I thought this was going to be another overrated, geeky animated superhero film. I have been very pleasantly surprised! <br/><br/>The Incredibles is a film that appeals to all ages. With themes like non-conformity, individuality and the strength of a family when it pulls together. How can you possibly go wrong? 10 out of 10. You would have to be a real spoil sport not to like this film. ALL HAIL BRAD BIRD!!! See! Superhero movies don't have to suck!"

I've heard some people whine about the fact that the teaser is not in the movie. Well, there are MANY hilarious moments in the movie so one gag less doesn't make or break the film. That's a problem of basing your whole movie experience on expectation, and then being<br/><br/>disappointed when you don't see what you want. Art is always vulnerable to<br/><br/>that.

I bought Spider-man # 2 when I was 11 years old for $50 bucks in 1976!)<br/><br/>First of all T.I. has the sophisticated wit ( like all the Pixar productions) to appeal to adults, while delivering the excitement and fun that youngsters want without being overly violent. Spidey, unfortunately was made for the middle of the road (aka 15 years old) viewers, so it has neither in great supply.<br/><br/>Second, among T.I.'s other triumphs is it's soudtrack.<br/><br/>Truly inspired and evocative of some of the greatest soundtracks of all time ( I won't name names cause that would give it away!) yet not cliché or bombastic, whereas Spider-man uses the same Tim Burtonesque slop we've been hearing<br/><br/>since Gremlins! Hey, it was great in Edward Scissorhands, but enough already!!! T.I.'s got it all. Emotion, great performances, awesome computer graphics,<br/><br/>clever dialogue, suspense. I can on and on.

"johnnyboyz","4","1","6","31 July 2010"," Bird veers more towards an audience of infants as pained formula and the drawn out unravelling of messages are the order of the day.
","The title of the 2004 animated, American, child orientated film The Incredibles is wholly ironic. Lauded by critics and audiences on release, presumably for being yet another feature animated film to have come out of the American stable of CGI infused pieces, the likes of which for some reason everyone feels the need to jump to both the defence and lauding of as quickly as possible, The Incredibles leaves a lot to be desired as it weaves its way down a plodding road to an uninspired finale of crashing; hitting and farce. Where Brad Bird's previous film, 1999's The Iron Giant was sombre; sweet and mature in its observing of a friendship between boy and machine, The Incredibles is loud; in-your-face; obnoxious and a gross muddle of cross-contaminated child and adult orientated material which does not work. The film is dull; plodding; limp; lacking in imagination despite the sorts of ideas it takes on; predictable and without a mite of peril nor interest.<br/><br/>Bird plays too many cards at once, he ruins the omelet with too many eggs; his film studying the progressive, domesticated lives of two superheroes of 15 years ago whom have gone into hiding despite still having wondrous superpowers before having them branch back out into a life-saving lifestyle once more. They are husband and wife Mr. Incredible aka Bob Parr (Nelson), an Hulk-like figure whom is incredibly strong and can withstand almost anything and Elastigirl aka Helen Parr (Hunter), a Stretch Armstrong-style character whom can extend her limbs to great length as well as bend and flex her way around mostly all obstacles. Incedible lives a mundane office life with an insurance company, longing for days of old but stuck with his wife and three kids Dash (Fox); Violet (Vowell) and baby Jack Jack in a detached suburban house with a car that conks out just as he's about to get home. The family is dysfunctional, but powerful; Incredible goes through an identity crisis in what he wants to be clashing with what his wife wants him to be and what the public want them all to be; they are the light of one another's respective lives just as they are one another's deathly foils.<br/><br/>By way of a mysterious gadget, Mr. Incredible is lured back into the world of superhero-dom with the promise of a top secret mission; his home based office-come-hideaway shrine for the days of old shedding the dull grey shade it carries and lighting up with a brilliant shade of red in the process. His life is changed, and a bad montage robs the audience of his character's development as his attitude to life begins to alter in what is a cheap way of skipping forward towards the formula rather than focus on observed character change. Where The Iron Giant was all about these intricacies, The Incredibles isn't. The film has fun with the parents telling each other that days of old have gone, and that raising the kids is what ought to be occupying both their minds; something specific watching audience members will relate to more than I did as office politics and what's right for the people and the company clash at another time; the film even finding time to have Elastigirl suspect husband Mr. Incredible of having an affair in what is another suburban drama cliché included that only appears as a self-aware jab but is actually played for dramatic effect. The opening plods, it churns along at a rather excruciating pace; devoid of much interest and coming across as quite repetitive.<br/><br/>Bird wants to play the revisionist card, beginning the film with a newsreel detailing interviews with Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and a token African American character in Samuel L. Jackson's Frozone whom acts as the film's comic relief. Jackson has one good scene, the film's sole laugh, during which he sends up a subway sequence from the second Die Hard sequel here involving a water dispenser at a jewellers. The interviews see the characters plead to be considered as equal to human beings, each individual covered detailing everyday lives and activities. Later on, one or so characters make light of 'monologuing'; the act which sees the bad guy waffle on before having the hero get the jump on him. For all the self-aware, self-reflective material such as this; The Incredibles is deathly quick to conform, indeed descend into, rock 'em-sock 'em action as tales of good vs. evil and plots to take over the world with showdowns at baddie bases which come complete with greyed out uniform clad henchmen play out.<br/><br/>As estimated, things don't go according to plan and the ill effects of idolising someone is promptly brought to the forefront in the form of Buddy Pine's alter-ego Syndrome, someone whom isn't actually a superhero but is just a kid with a qualification in design technology in that he's invented an array of gadgets to help form a superhero persona. The film descends into dull formula, Elastigirl and the kids having to come to eventually rescue their husband and father after visiting a Central European mentor whom provides ready made hero outfits and advice, people are quick to point out 'monologing', but nobody ever asks if eye-masks are really that good in terms of concealing identity. The film's painfully obvious message about responsibility on the kid's behalf is put across limply as the henchman of the villain begins to succumb to their own conscience and come around to aid the heroes in what is an arc that, if you cannot see coming, you just aren't at all trying. Its tone towards the end is grossly uneven, skipping from sentimental to action packed to comedic content in an uneven manner; the banter between mother and kids is annoying and whiny, when it ought to be bouncy in the vein of the two leads from Toy Story or Monsters Inc. The Incredibles was a turgid, predictable, messy farce that bores the senses."
"eratee","6","1","6","25 March 2005"," Comedy? This?
","Warning! May contain a slight spoiler.<br/><br/>This is the worst big budget (3d) animation I've ever seen. Ice Age was not too good either but it was honestly not trying to throw you with lame jokes.<br/><br/>The best 3d-animation experience was Shrek in 2001. The day Shrek came out I was so amazed. I had been living in a thought it was just a kiddo movie but it included so much clever Terry Pratchett-alike mixing of old tales&stories + adult jokes (all the measurement of the king's 'size' etc..) that it all was like the parody of the concept of a fairy tale... It made me laugh constantly, actually even cry at one point. <br/><br/>The Incredibles again... It felt just like one of those movies where someone gets a good idea and stretches it two hours long.. That really can't last. Not with this amount of badly written fillings which they dare to call jokes.<br/><br/>Consider how they could have made so much better parody like they did in Shrek : the rescuing prince is really an Ogre, the Wolf is a 'gender-confused granny', the mirror as a TV-screen and frightened by breaking a little mirror etc. But instead they just put the father Incredible to break things like a plate or a car when he gets nervous. Or the kids fighting each other with their super skills. Everything is just damn too obvious! Including the bond-alike headquarters of the bad guy. And of course the final battle is incredibly predictable piece of the usual Monday movie.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that recycling things is bad but comparing to Austin Powers, this movie is clumsy by not adding any good parody to the agent-touch. <br/><br/>I study this stuff. 3d-animation etc, and I hope that all the comments which are summarized as 'truly incredible' (very original, I must say) come from people who are just blinded by the look. I don't think they would've liked this one as much if the same story was done traditionally or with real actors.<br/><br/>Both movies, this and Shrek are dealing about being different. But In my humble opinion, Incredibles does it without the Heart. If you are seeking for a film about the hard part of being a superhero, I'd suggest you to watch Spider-Man 2 and leave this movie to your kids for whom it was modeled & rendered to."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","1","7","15 October 2006"," A mediocre celebration of... mediocrity
","Fifteen years ago Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl were at the top of their game, saving the world and being celebrated as heroes by the public. Today they lead ordinary lives under new identities in Suburbia: Bob and Helen Parr, with three kids. The family go to great lengths to hide their superhero powers but once a week Bob sneaks out with his friend to look for some action to provide stimuli in his mundane life. When one day he is offered a secret superhero job, he cannot resist the temptation...<br/><br/>First, let me debunk the myth that this is a great animated movie as the outrageous 8.3 rating here boldly suggests. It undoubtedly lacks that sparkle in the eye and it never once reaches the level of hilarity that Blue Skye Studios or DreamWorks Studios offer. As it is a Disney production, expect family morals and heartfelt messages en masse to compensate for the lack of clever things to say. That said, the superhero genre was in dire need of spoofing  Spider-Man most of all  and The Incredibles does a fine job in this aspect. From the villain's mandatory monologue, the burning house to the mad scientists, nothing feels missing or incomplete in the genre.<br/><br/>Considerably more things feel incomplete in terms of characters and humour, however. Because they are humans and most of them lack 'assigned quirks' (such as Scrat from Ice Age, or one of the Aquarium fish from Finding Nemo), the characters in the film are completely straight and realistic. Bob, for example, is a middle-aged insurance worker with an expanding waistline and a limited intellect  your average Joe in every sense of the word  it follows then that no amount of flashy superhero powers (which he lacks, even, he only possesses strength) manage to elevate him above generic formula. It is glaringly obvious that the filmmakers, for this reason, expected the audience to identity more with 'Suburbian Superheroes' which would be cool and all, had the audience been middle-aged family men. But it is primarily kids and kids do not typically seek realism.<br/><br/>Yet it needs to be said that for all its failures in fun and interesting characters, 'The Incredibles' is a fine film that is perhaps even better sewn together than your average animated comedy. The plot unfolds like a James Bond movie and is appropriately accompanied by a Bond-like musical score. It is an amalgam of a spy-movie, a comic-book flick and a Hallmark family feature. All the ingredients are present for the aforementioned templates and it is mixed by a fully competent blender and sprinkled with impeccable animation and special effects.

","I wasn't expecting a classic comparable to my favorite Disney movies when I saw this - nothing could surpass Toy Story in my view - but I wasn't expecting what I saw either. I enjoyed this movie somewhat when I first saw it but for each time I watched it afterwards, my opinion of it lowered rather than remained good. The plot is an interesting one with only a few problems: after being held accountable for several misfortunes such as injuring passengers when stopping a train heading for a bomb-made track gap, or ""rescuing"" but injuring a suicidal man (in a kids' movie?), Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) becomes the victim of lawsuits while his fellow ""supers"" are convicted or at least suspected of causing other problems (the most specific I can recall is that their masks let them spy on women - what a dark subject!), until it's declared they must hang up the suits and live as private citizens. 15 years later: though some of Mr. Incredible's last public words were his wishing to have less work and maybe a family, Bob Parr bitterly resents the fact that he's no longer a hero, or even a philanthropist (apparently illegally trying to literally play hero several times, he's been relocated enough that his current job, 1 of the few he hasn't tried his hand at, is insurance agent, which the 8-year-old I saw this with didn't get). He does more for his customers than his greedy boss Humph (Wallace Sheen) allows, and to compensate for his job he still attempts upholding justice while dragging best friend Lucius, once Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), along for the ride, and meanwhile seems little more than indifferent to Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and their 3 kids, except he wants his 10-year-old son who has the gift of speed to compete in sports where he'd have an unfair advantage. When Humph catches on that he's illegally helping customers and Bob loses his temper enough to throw him through a wall, he declines the offer to relocate again - but accepts an offer from ""Mirage"", claiming to be a fellow ex-hero who needs his help in destroying an amok robot. Having done this, he actually feels fine about life and does become closer to his family - until he's duped into meeting his employer (Jason Lee), who reveals himself to be a jealous, obsessed fan who wants revenge for his rejection of him when he was a kid. He learns that Buddy Pine, now known as Syndrome, has in fact gone mad, killing off many heroes (maybe all, since the only 3 shown definitely alive are himself, Elastigirl, and Frozone who appears to be his next target). Learning that his real goal is to ""defeat"" his own creations after unleashing them and thus becoming the world's sole superhero, the protagonist, now filled with regret over neglecting his family and endangering his friend (maybe their being seen together when Bob's discovered is why Frozone's location is known?), must call on his family to help him and outsmart Syndrome. Really, it's not a bad story except for a few dark elements here and there - still, there are other things to look at. Acting was good, but it couldn't improve the uneven tone of the movie; Syndrome joked about the heroes' having ""got busy"" as far as having kids, another joke which youngsters won't get, yet earlier the idea of his taking out heroes is underplayed - it's only a certainty when 1 whom we never meet but is mentioned as missing (noted since he too was resistant to adjusting to life without a mask) is shown on his list of targets dealt with, and was hard even for the adults I saw watching it to believe. There are some good scenes such as the daughter, who unlike her brother adheres to the family rule about ignoring her power (forcefields), gains self-confidence to use it for help, or Mirage's knowledge that indifference isn't strength, but these lessons are almost completely forgotten in other, twisted messages: (SPOILERS) Parr disregards the law and attempts to remain a hero (admittedly to a point one can sympathize since the community has gone far enough to crush individuality by making a ceremony of a grade's being passed) - and ends up protecting and being thanked by the ungrateful community that once rejected him; (SPOILERS END) Helen's advice of humility is tossed aside, while Dash (SPOILER), who does unfairly beat his track competitors (SPOILERS END), is ""right"" in his reminder that everyone's being special means nobody is, when Syndrome echoes it later. It seems even the youngest kid could realize faster than Helen that it wasn't pride but concern for his family that made Bob want to fight solo in the climax. For some reason the writers don't explain, crimes (obviously) continue in the decade-and-half long absence of heroes - though villains, such as the poorly-worked cliché French joke that is Bomb Voyage (and I'm sure there are some just as stupid as Underminer, who pops up later declaring war against peace and happiness), are also out of business...but I doubt they retired from growing bored with having nobody to oppose them! Lucius/Frozone is the coolest and my favorite character, but he has too little screen time even if it makes sense that he is absent for most of the middle since he never learns of his friend's imprisonment. (SPOILER); But why isn't he honored with a limo ride with the main family after their works? (SPOILERS END) I still see the true morals and his character as highlights of the movie, but I wish there was more I could enjoy."

","I must say, I don't know WHY everyone likes this movie so much. I for one was kinda disappointed. This movie is follows the chronicles of the superhero, Mr. Incredible, and his wife, Elastigirl, who're forced to retire by normal people for wrecking everything. 15 years (and 50 pounds) later, the couple is suddenly out of retirement battling some crazed fan-boy named Syndrome, who hates Mr. Incredible because he sent him to jail as a kid. Though the graphics and music are impressive, the movie lacks humor, which was Pixar's specialty. There just wasn't enough of it to sustain a Pixar movie. Even ""A Bug's Life"" was funnier than this. I tell ya, if Joe Ranft was still alive, this movie might have actually been better.<br/><br/>Overall, disappointing and overrated. 5/10"

","I am great fan of Pixar and I had really high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, I was completely let down. It seems to be one of those movies that do not live up to IMDb hype. The Incredibles had an amazing animation (I can certainly agree with that), but it was an extremely long and boring movie. <br/><br/>The plot was very predictable and the humor was really bad. Maybe it was too American for a European audience, dunno. In any case, it was an endless (and I *do* mean endless) series of action animations with a few (bad) jokes in between. There were some good lines and scenes in this whole 2 hour mess, but overall it was boring and by the end I was hoping for the bad guy to kill everyone else an then destroy earth as we know it.<br/><br/>6/10 for animation alone.

"solomondavid-93478","1","1","8","2 March 2018"," one of the worst animation movies I have seen
","I absolutely have no clue why this movie is so overrated.
What I like about the movie- This movie builds neatly till the second half.
What I don't like about the movie- Probably the biggest flaw of this movie is that it violates pixar's own rules of storytelling.
According to a rule of storytelling by Pixar- The hero may accidently get into a problem, but the hero should never accidently get out of the problem. In simple words, the hero should never easily get out of a problem.
After the villain ties up Mr. incredible, we imagine that something big Is probably going to happen. but the villain's assistant neatly unties Mr. Incredible and lets him go.
We see the same things happen again as the whole Incredibles family gets tied up and the assistant comes to the rescue again.<br/><br/>Predictability- This movie has got a lot of highly, predictable action sequences. 
To make things even worse these action sequences are very long.
This is seen in the boring chase through the forest.
The climax is pretty much disappointing, it starts after the assistant simply unties Mr. Incredible, and allows him to have a fight with the villain. The last action sequence is also really predictable.
 
The stakes are very low as the hero doesn't seem to have much to lose in this movie.
The jokes about the waistline doesn't seem to help either.
Easily one of the worst movies from Pixar, at least for me."

","With the great reviews this movie has received, my wife and I went and saw it even though superhero movie are not my favorite genre. I liked most of the humor, and the animation (or whatever technical process was involved) was very good. However, I found myself nearly falling asleep at times, and felt the movie just wasn't very engrossing overall. The scene with the flying disc vehicles in particular seemed to drag on forever, and the whole ""high tech marvel that learns from what it experiences"" wasn't exactly real creative. Perhaps my disappointment with the movie is simply because I'm not big on superhero movies, or maybe the movie is simply intended for kids.<br/><br/>It's just not a movie I'd watch again, even if it were on TV for free."
"Charley123","5","1","9","19 November 2004"," I DON'T GET IT
","This movie had great animation and some exciting action scenes. However, there was nothing new here. We've seen all these super heroes before. We've seen them all use their super powers in the exact same way. <br/><br/>Then there are the drawn out, cliché ridden, sopa opera-esque meaningful family talks where they stand around discussing what they all mean to each other. I don't even think the rest of the audience liked it. The theater full of kids were running around and talking and crying and screaming during all these scenes (and there were a lot of them) -- but then another action scene came along and all was forgiven. The film makers managed to avoid any of these mind numbing scenes towards the end of the film, so I guess everyone forgot how bored they were throughout. <br/><br/>What's most confusing is how much people LOVED it. Have you noticed that when it comes to PIXAR, no one even seems to make distinctions between their films? I liked TOY STORY and NEMO and BUG'S LIFE -- but wasn't crazy about MONSTER'S INC or THE INCREDIBLES (although I liked the director's other film IRON GIANT). But when you talk to most people they just sort of look at you starry eyed and say ""YES! ALL PIXAR IS WONDERFUL! THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY OF THEM! THEY ARE THE LIGHT AND THE WAY!"" It's strange. It's like they all drank the Kool-Aid or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, I guess part of my problem with both MONSTERS and INCREDIBLES is that they both seem geared towards a very specific (and unusual -- although clearly not nonexistent) audience -- toddlers and their parents who have been changing diapers for the last few years. It's a very strange demographic. No, I don't have kids, so maybe that's the problem. Not every movie needs to be directed at me. That's fine. But I think of myself as pretty empathetic -- but I still don't get it."

"leftistcritic","5","0","3","14 May 2019"," A funny movie with conservative undertones?
","Tonight I watched this film once again. It's not the best film but it has its positives. The superheroes are in hiding after lawsuits were brought against them for their damages. One, Bob (also known as Mr. Incredible), wants to relieve his glory days, and does so, a bit, with his friend, Lucius (Frozone), a Black man. Bob is married to Helen (Elastagirl) and they have three children: Violet (who can turn invisible), Dash (who can run very fast), and Jack Jack (a baby said to not have powers). Also, the designer, Edna, is a fun character who adds character to the film.<br/><br/>A messenger, Mirage, gives Mr. Incredible a message which Bob takes in stride to relieve his glory days, after he was fired from his dead end job as a bureaucrat who helps people go around the system, to benefit them. He goes to a secluded island and finds that a man with blown back and colored hair (white) named Syndrome, confronts him. This man was once a superfan of Mr. Incredible but he was turned away, saying that he liked to work alone, so he set out to get venegance once and for all. Soon, Mr. Incredible is captured, after finding out that Syndrome murdered superheroes, and the whole ""super"" family comes to save him. The movie, in that sense, becomes a bit of a family movie, which is why it was clearly a success, while also fitting into the superhero genre.<br/><br/>The villain, Syndrome, despite the fact he is a murderous and power-hungry psychopath has a plan to make technology that would make everyone superheroes available to all. But, perversely he wants to become a superhero himself and save the day. Not surprisingly, the elitist message of superheroes wins out, with people respecting these ""god-like"" figures by the end, like the ""old days."" Perhaps this is no surprise as the film itself is not set in the present but rather in the 1960s, with the ""glory days"" in the 1940s. This is interesting because Brad Bird, admitted to Michael Barrier in 2005 that he was ""not a big comic-book reader"" and argued that he tried to ""base the powers on family archetypes"" of the father, mother, teenage girls, ten-year boys, and babies.<br/><br/>While you could say this film is positive, it falls into the typical Hollyweird qualities you would expect, like the prominence of male superheroes (three of the five on screen) and possible sexist attitudes by some, like Lucius, or even Bob, who lies to his wife about his activities for MONTHS! While the writer and director of the film, Brad Bird, after noting he had the idea for the film for 12 years and that the film feels realistic even though it is animated, he told IGN in 2005 that people who said that the film had undercurrents of Ayn Rand or Nietzsche are wrong, as are those that said there was ""sort of a right-wing feeling,"" arguing that he is ""a centrist and feel like both parties can be absurd."" This brings us to how Frederica Mathewes-Green of National Review describes the film, in 2009, summarizing from other social conservatives, as skipping pop culture references and ""gross jokes in favor of a story that celebrates marriage, courage, responsibility, and high achievement."" It goes onto say that the film shows a ""family of superheroes...living an anonymous life in the suburbs, thanks to a society that doesn't appreciate their unique talents,"" but the society then ""comes to need them.""<br/><br/>In a large way, this is not wrong, and I would argue they are correct. After all,
the film is in some ways a criticism of the superhero genre, in that the superheroes have fit into society, a petty bourgeois ""middle class"" life to be exact, avoiding the spotlight. But other films, like Watchman, or the Deadpool films, are a bit stronger on this point. You could say that this film also is conservative in its criticism of bureaucracy and government as the enemy of the heroes, in some ways. So, I would argue that the film has conservative undertones, although it is not necessarily along the lines of Atlas Shrugged or something like that. Even so,it is still a funny movie that should have a rating of 5 out of 10."

","Before The Incredibles, Pixar made films like Toy Story, A Bugs Life and Monsters Inc. They've always avoided human focused storylines because of the lack of the technology. But they have got the animation down to perfection here from the facial expressions and character movements. The textures of hair and muscle movements are also a great achievement. Looking back today the animation still looks impressive. <br/><br/>There are so many films it pays homage to but to great effect. It's more of a satire of films than a spoof. It mostly deals with comic book films like Fantastic 4 but it actually works as its own movie. It also has a 60s Bond espionage feel to it. These heroes do their work in the shadows like secret agents, our lead character is cool and charismatic and the villain lives in a Volcano. Like every Pixar film before it, it's a cleverly written film because it's not just aimed at kids. It deals with subjects like political commentary, the mundane restraints of work life and letting yourself go. It's a film about family, redemption, rejection and consequences. Some films feel forced whenever they tackle social subjects but the writers manage to balance all of these subjects that work well within the story. <br/><br/>The action scenes are really exciting and inventive. There are so many subtle comedic moments and there are some heartfelt ones too. It takes so many risks and it's a surprise to see some of the darker scenes make it into the film. Voice actors Craig T Nelson, Brad Bird, Holly Hunter and Samuel L Jackson each give memorable performances and the exciting music score by Michael Giacchino elevates the action scenes to another level. Stan Lee once said it was the best superhero film he's ever seen, and he wasn't wrong. It puts a lot of superhero films to shame."

","I have to admit that I put off finishing this tale of superannuated superheroes for many years because of it's Randian overtones: Atlas involuntarily shrugged, if you like, with the vision of its evil villain a world where 'everyone is super, so no-one is'. The start of the movie is certainly fun, but it mocks a world recognise more in the 'polical correctness gone mad' stereotypes than the one I actually see around me. The message is thankfully tempered by the tendency of said heroes to actually cause disasters only marginally less severe than the ones they are saving people from, and the end of the film becomes more of a straightforward action movie, thankfully less solemn than the likes of Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' films but scarcely more absurd than a typical James Bond. There are good laughs (and typically stunning graphics) in this film, but overall, there's just a little less charm than in Pixar's finest offerings."

Whether they are exploring human's regard of life (Wall-E) or examining the sadness of children outgrowing their toys (Toy Story) the imagination is always juxtaposed against an important real life meaning, which is also now a huge dedication to Walt Disney and this particular picture brad Bird for a fast and relative action adventure.<br/><br/>Though The Incredibles' inside message may not be as obvious or as significant as those mentioned, it is relative when looking at the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>Starting off with Mr Incredible stopping a crime whilst in a rush to get to an important destination we are thrust into a cool and collected approach to the life of a superhero. The car is cooler than the Bat-mobile and the strength of the character is better than the Hulk's, not to forget the humor is better than both franchises put together.<br/><br/>Then the important messages come across. An unfortunate turn of events sees superheroes forced into hiding and are no longer able to fight crime and save lives. The rising levels of crime and the poor approach by the force shows a political nasty side of the law, choosing their pride over people's well being.<br/><br/>What is perhaps most touching about this picture is the look on heroes. Seeing a personal hero in the flesh and being turned away without regard for feeling is a crushing moment and the relevance is significant as it can change a person into the worst possible being.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a fast flowing adventure, looking at the importance of saving lives and also the importance of family. Though the family side of this film feels cheesy and over dramatic at turns, there is no denying its significance, especially considering the target audience is family. Typical family members include the obsessive controlling mother, the girl with a crush and the boy with mischief on his mind. Though occasionally stereotypical, there is plenty of humor and a change in character comes a certain point in the film, which again separates Pixar from other films."

","Well, I love super-hero comicdom, my favourite era being the DC range from the mid-60's to late 70's so this Pixar feature on the Incredible family was a treat for my sore eyes and plays so much better than any number of real-life action simulations to which Hollywood is so much in thrall at the moment.<br/><br/>Of course it's all in the writing, with a script that not only works as a comic adventure, but of course with all those sly, but never condescending digs at adult fascination with comic characters with their ridiculous costumes and of course personal problems. When not engrossed in the clever plot or laughing out loud at some killer one-liners (""You got me monologuing"" intones master-villain Syndrome as his long-windedness affords Mr Incredible some valuable escape-time), of course being a Pixar production, I was marvelling at the animation which depicts various super stunts with consummate ease.<br/><br/>The characterisation of all the characters is superb, with nods to ""The Simpsons"", ""Fantastic Four"" and even ""Married With Children"", plus the musical soundtrack, James Bond derivative, is also perfectly simpatico. The vocal characterisations are marvellous too. There are various well-signposted sub-texts at play too, for the more discerning viewer, better and more succinctly handled than in any Iron/Spider/Super/Batman film I've seen and there's some lovely detail too in the writing (witness Syndrome's demise down to that pesky cape of his!).

","As any Pixar film, this is a movie which appears to be sometimes a very funny comedy, sometimes a moving story capable of touching the toughest spectator. And, as any Pixar film (it doesn't matter if they use toys, bugs, monsters, fish or super-heroes) it remains a powerful story about relationships between human beings.<br/><br/>This time, they tell the story of a family of super-heroes using lots of references to super-hero movies, TV serials and comics, as well as adventure films. ""The Incredibles"" delights our senses with a powerful script full of sub-plots brilliantly treated, including several relationships inside the family (Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's love, parents and siblings, children's problems) which are easily believable as well as amazingly familiar.<br/><br/>By combining virtual people and real actors' voices, the characters (all them, not just the main ones, but every single one) end up having more personality than many human actors: nice characters whom we get attached to and whom we worry about. Their bodies and faces make us believe in them and create a favourable atmosphere for humour. Pixar accomplishes the most difficult thing in this kind of movie: credibility. And this is the point: when a character is beaten, we know it hurts; when a character runs, we know he's going fast. When a door is opened, a train is trying to stop and people or objects are falling, we are sure that they are all heavy, as if they were real elements. From the character's expressiveness to the fanciest effect seen in the film, Pixar's animators and programmers achieve the impossible.<br/><br/>Completely believable hair, muscles and fabric, including several costumes per character (for the first time in a movie like this). Explosions, water, explosions in the water, lava, ice, shattering windows, energy fields, invisibility effects, light beams, plane reactors, robots everything is possible, even stretching human limbs. We have no reason to not believe in it because it's very well done.<br/><br/>In regards to music and lighting, the film opts for a colourful environment typical of old-fashion comics and Saturday morning cartoons which turns into a James Bond-like environment as the story moves forward. Of course, every effect related with light and used to personalize each moment of the film (daylight, dust, clouds, fog) is perfectly created.<br/><br/>The ""60's 007""-like look is reflected as well in the multi-location design of the film. From the interior of a volcano to the open sea, from remote forests to common cities, we visit many different beautiful sceneries. Furthermore the director consistently uses the camera intelligently throughout each set (he seldom overuses the fact that everything is 3D to take odd shots), so we don't have to see spectacular yet absurd views.<br/><br/>It's difficult to decide if ""The Incredibles"" is only one of the best animated movies so far or it's one of the best super-hero films ever created as well. Whatever the case, this is not a story just for kids. In fact, this is the first PG (Parental Guidance) movie made by Pixar. And this only means that parents will enjoy as much as their children. Or perhaps even more.<br/><br/>So, technical perfection, an enjoyable story and tons of fun in a film which maybe is a bit long -for an animated movie- but is incredible in all other respects."

","I am torn about this movie. The ideas herein are great but somehow this film does not quite work for me. Maybe it is the voice-overs-Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson are not really up to it. As for Bird voicing a character himself I think that too was a bad idea. There is certainly something lacking for me. The humour is not as sharp as other Pixar movies and there were times when I was actually bored. It was too much like a Bond film at times, far too derivative. Pixar has made some of the most enjoyable movies of the past few years and the standard is so high it is difficult to achieve expectations - this film fell short for me as did Wall-E. Both are the sort of film I would normally love but neither quite float my boat. I look forward to seeing Up as I am told it is excellent."

","The Increadibles is a fun movie, and overall a good addition to the pixar franchise. It's entertaining and has a lot of good action. You also don't get the feeling you are watching a kids movie the whole time. In fact, a lot of animated movies lately have seemed more adult than the cartoons in the past. That's good though, cartoons also seem more intelligent now than they used to be. I would recommend the Increadibles for anyone who likes animated films. It's a decent movie. It's not one of those movies that holds up quite as well after the second or third viewing. I saw it in theaters when it first came out. Then once in school, then once while in the library. I was kind of tired of it after the 3rd time. This is a pretty solid pixar film, though maybe not the best one. I think other pixar movies, such as Cars, and WALLE, are just as good if not better. But I think that The Increadibles is still an improvement over Monster's Inc, and A Bug's Life. It's a good movie for kid's to watch, without being too childish for adult's to enjoy."
"Fred_Maxwell","8","0","1","18 September 2008"," Pixar bats another one out of the park.
","The Incredibles is a fun little film when you watch it; interesting, kind of engaging, but nothing terribly special; it's doesn't reach out and grab hold of your throat and slap you around the room with its greatness the way Monsters, Inc. does. It's only later, when you've reflected on the little details for a while, that you come to realize how much of this film is simply, as the kids say these days, made of awesome. Bird, one of the better directors in the Pixar stable, filled this sucker chock-full of fun in-jokes for the adults whilst keeping the action coming for the kiddies. In this installment of the great Pixar dynasty, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has been forced into retirement after a rescue gone terribly wrong in the opening scenes. Mundane life is, shall we say, not treating him terribly well. He and his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have moved to the suburbs and are trying to raise their family-- all of whom, as it turns out, seem to have inherited superpowers from their parents-- in relative obscurity. The most superhero-like thing Mr. Incredible does is get together with his old pal Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) and talk over old times. Until, that is, he receives a secret message saying that his powers are needed... It's a fun movie, the kind of thing you expect from Pixar-- lots of action, witty dialogue, visual gags, a good time to be had by all. You'll enjoy it. But then, go and read the trivia page over at IMDb and marvel at the number of in-jokes in this movie. There are homages to what seems like every superhero comic, every movie any of these actors has ever worked in, every member of the crew. And none of them interferes with the movie's plot or pacing. That's brilliant. Either Bird is the world's biggest geek and had this entire thing cast before he started writing, or his eye for detail is unparalleled. (Or both.) It's the technical equivalent of the emotional punch of Monsters, Inc., and what makes it great is trying to think of another studio that could have cranked those two movies out back-to-back-- and not being able to come up with one."

","By now, I've grown accustomed to mind-blowing CGI animation from Pixar Studios. But it's the blend of clever, funny, and zany storytelling and characterization made possible by the animation that has continually delighted me whenever I see a Pixar film. The studio continues this trend in The Incredibles.<br/><br/>I'm probably the second-last person in the U.S. to see the film, so I won't bore you with the plot details of a retired superhero family in the Witness Protection Program coming back to save humanity. A lot of the comedic gags depend on you being surprised by them, so I won't spoil the tremendous fun you should have when you first see them. Well just a little  the super-powered sibling spat at dinner scene will have every parent wishing for Helen Parr's powers.<br/><br/>Craig Nelson, who voices Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible, is the perfect choice for this character. His prior TV work (Coach and The District, in particular) have given him plenty of experience in conveying an engaging blend of bravado, sincere deadpan humor, and compassion. Likewise, Holly Hunter, who voices Helen Parr/Elastigirl, has plenty of range, conveying exasperated housewife, concerned wife, supportive and worried mother, and confident superhero with aplomb. The nice surprise is Spencer Fox, who voices, Dashiell 'Dash' Parr. His brash glee at finally being unleashed to use his super speed in ways he never imagined is thoroughly infectious. The script doesn't give Sarah Vowell, who voices Violet Parr, isn't given much to do, and doesn't even get a superhero name, so it's hard to say much of anything about her performance.<br/><br/>The movie's pace is frantic, but you'll be happily out of breath trying to keep up."

"rickhavoc1","10","0","1","5 September 2007"," Fantastic Job by Pixar and Brad Bird
","First, it's the most realistic looking animation I've ever seen. The water looks like water, the characters' hair looks like hair, etc. I think the primary purpose of any movie is to tell an entertaining story, and to use the story to explore truths that never change. Brad Bird delivers this in SPADES! I'm going to hit on the high points. One is where a series of lawsuits forces the government to place all the ""supers"" in a ""witness protection"" type program and prohibit them from using their special abilities. This commentary on our litigious society alone makes the movie worth seeing. Another is where Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible first loses his job, then gets a mysterious message from a woman offering him the chance to use his abilities. He jumps on it, and goes to a remote island where the woman, Mirage, tells him there's a robot called the Omnidroid running amok, and has to be subdued without destroying it. He does so, using his brains as much as his brawn, and tears his old costume in the process. He then goes to the woman who designed it, Edna Mode. She's a cross between ""Q"" from James Bond and a fashion designer. She doesn't just want to repair his old costume, she wants to design him a new one. He muses aloud about adding a cape. Edna goes ballistic, shouting ""NO CAPES!"" When he disagrees, she brings up examples of ""supers"" who got their capes caught on objects or sucked into jet engines and killed, and he relents. No comic book I ever read explored the disadvantages of a superhero wearing a cape! When Bob returns to the island, he is ambushed and defeated by an improved version of the Omnidroid prototype robot. He is held captive there by Syndrome, once a young fan named Buddy Pine. Buddy once wanted to be Mr. Incredible's sidekick, but was harshly rejected. Bob manages to escape from Syndrome and discovers that Syndrome has killed many of his superhero friends in the process of developing the Omnidroid. When Helen/Elastigirl finds a platinum blonde hair on Bob's clothes, she suspects he's having an affair. She then discovers the repair job on his old costume, and goes to Edna to ask her about it. Edna tells her about the new costume she designed for Bob, and reveals the matching costumes she designed for the entire family. Next, Helen is flying a Lear jet towards the locater beacon Edna installed in Bob's costume, which has caused Bob to be recaptured. She discovers two of their children, Violet and Dashiell, have stowed away in the plane, leaving the baby, Jak-Jak, with a sitter. Earlier in the movie, we saw that Violet has the powers of invisibility and force field projection, and Dashiell (Dash) has super speed. Syndrome fires missiles at them while making Bob listen to Helen's mayday calls and shoots them down. Everyone, including Bob and Mirage, assumes everyone in the plane are killed. However, thanks to Helen's abilities and her costume, (which can withstand a temperature of over one thousand degrees and is completely bulletproof), they all survive. Meanwhile, Bob grabs Mirage and threatens to squeeze her to death if Syndrome doesn't set him free. Syndrome calls his bluff, and he releases her. When Syndrome starts berating Bob for being ""weak"", she tells him, ""He's not weak, you know. Valuing life is not a weakness. And disregarding it is not strength."" Helen and the kids arrive on the island, where she tells them to hide in a cave. She then infiltrates Syndrome's HQ, just as he launches a large rocket to carry the Omnidroid to Metroville. Dash has gone deeper into the cave, and discovers that it leads to a vent for the rocket's exhaust, which is rapidly approaching. He rushes back to Violet and they escape. Later, when they're discovered by Syndrome's henchmen, they both come into their own. Dash starts running through the forest at super speed, (the scene where he runs into a swarm of insects and gets them splattered all over his face is PRICELESS), and Violet uses her invisibility to evade death. Dash has discovered that he can actually run on water, and also shows that he can THINK just as fast when one of the henchmen chases him into another cave. He sees another bad guy coming at him from inside so he just stops and sinks into the water, causing the bad guys to collide above him. He runs back into the forest, and runs right into his sister, who hasn't been able to sustain a force field. More henchmen arrive and start shooting at them, and she projects a force bubble around them. She tells Dash to start running, and he does, which brings her and the bubble with him. They literally run right into their parents. A battle with the henchmen then ensues, with the family fighting as a team. After taking out the henchmen, they go back inside, where Mirage helps them take off after Syndrome. They get to Metroville, where Syndrome tries to ""battle"" his robot, who quickly figures out he's using a remote control on his wrist and shoots it off. Meanwhile, Bob's friend Lucius/Frozone is looking for his costume so he can join the fight, and is shouting to his wife, asking her where she put it. I won't go into detail, except to say the woman needs to take some lessons from Mary Jane Watson on supporting her man. (Remember the end of Spiderman 2?) With a combination of teamwork and quick thinking, they defeat the Omnidroid, but Syndrome escapes. I won't tell you how it ends, but it's a great ending. With the voice talents of Craig T. Nelson (Bob/Mr. I), Holly Hunter (Helen/E-girl), Samuel L. Jackson (Lucius/Frozone), Sarah Vowell (Violet), Spencer Fox (Dash), Jason Lee (Buddy/Syndrome), Brad Bird (Edna Mode), and Elizabeth Peña (Mirage), it's a great movie and a great ride the whole family will enjoy. 10/10"

","This is one more well-produced Pixar movie. Technically, it is great. Also, there is much action and the story is even a bit interesting. It is also very funny in the early parts, where they try to lead a normal life with variable success.<br/><br/>But there are two things I really don't like with it: the violence and the morals.<br/><br/>For being a movie for kids, I find it daring to have the hero finding the corpse of a murdered man, and a list of victims that the villain has killed. We also see clips where several super-heroes are killed in accidents due to wearing capes. To top that off, the villain is killed in a brutal way.<br/><br/>My view of the morals comes from comparing to ""Robots"". In ""Robots"" we are told that you should be persistent in working towards your dreams and that anyone can make it. In ""Incredibles"", we see that if you are not born super, you can not be super, and if you try to be super anyway, you should... be killed by being sucked into turbine???<br/><br/>I know, the villain is made villain due to bad treatment by Mr Incredible. This is the good part, what excuses the otherwise horrible message. But it is sad that his creativity and ingenuity is only used for evil things, as if inventing things is evil. He is a classic mad scientist and science is evil.<br/><br/>So most of all, I question this is as a good children's movie. Too much violence and deaths, anti-creative and anti-science.

","Ahhh, Pixar... that animation company that dares to make movies with plots... and good animation to boot! Brad Bird brings us through Pixar animation studios a story about the hero in all of us... actually, that's a lie, as it's pretty much the exact opposite, it's about the hero trying to be just like all of us. ""Mediocrity, that's the hard thing to do,"" said Edna in her interview. Indeed it seems almost completely destructive to a family that just wants to do what they're good at doing.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with everything from the big to the small... big action with amazing animated effects juxtaposed with small moments like Mrs. Parr (Elastigirl) and Mr. Parr (Mr. Incredible) cleaning up around the house... characters with the big aspirations to save the world with characters just hoping to be happy for a moment... big superheroes being belittled by small fashion designers...<br/><br/>I suppose some could say that the story is ""predictable"" or ""formulaic."" Booo! It is both, but it's not like one can notice with all the other stuff going on. Everything from the story to the animation to the voice acting to the soundtrack is enough to keep anyone's attention on ONE good aspect. When the villain is revealed it's not about it being a, ""Oh my, that's who it is, I am so surprised!"" it's a, ""Oh of course it's THAT guy."" That's why he's revealed so early on in the movie... predictable. Ya crazy nitpickers.<br/><br/>At any rate it's a fun feast o' animation that, along with Pixar's other works, sets a high standard (that I have found contemporary animation studios seem unable to reach, in my humble opinion).

The Geek in me appreciates the reverential nods, in plot and characterisation, to the 1960s Lee & Kirby run of 'The Fantastic Four', Alan Moore's 'Watchmen' and 'Miracleman' and Brian Michael Bendis's 'Powers', but these are secondary to a sharp, funny script, well rounded sympathetic characters. Kids will love it, as there's plenty of colour action and slapstick, but the film is knowingly aimed at a more mature audience: the heroes are a dysfunctional family with genuine problems and aspirations. That they wear spandex and fight giant robots is just an added bonus.<br/><br/>That 'The Incredibles' should work on so many elements should also be no surprise. director and writer Brad Bird was also responsible for the splendid and underrated 'The Iron Giant', based (albeit loosely) on Ted Hughes 'The Iron Man'. Rent this film. Now. It has more heart than a hundred cynical 'Shreks'. Also  and this is most odd in a mainstream studio animation  Bird is listed in the credits as the sole scriptwriter.

"sageev","8","0","1","6 October 2005"," Why it wasn't perfect
","I wanted to throw out a couple of ideas as to why this movie wasn't completely perfect. The movie was slow in parts, and didn't always have the intelligence of other Pixar offerings.<br/><br/>1. The creator, Brad Bird, had a wonderful idea, but perhaps he refused to let other screenwriters fix up the problems with the script.<br/><br/>2. Or maybe Pixar's need to make a child-friendly movie resulted in the arch-villain being so lacking and the final scene being less than amazing, as compared to the action on Syndrome's island which blew my mind.<br/><br/>I realize that many fixes for the problems are probably to mature for such a movie. For example, Brad Bird mentioned that he originally had Syndrome taking the Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's baby in the beginning of the movie. Keeping that would have made me happy because I would see more of the humanity in the superheroes at the dread of having a kidnapped baby. Way too much for young kids to digest, though. The final scene would have been helped by having the bots actually cause harm to people. However, even the best cartoons on TV will only allude to death indirectly (bomb goes off.. No one gets out of the building.. All adults watching know that means death.. Children might not realize, though). But, at least having some normal humans getting really injured would have given the threat some urgency.<br/><br/>However, I did enjoy the quiet desperation that the family was suffering in the beginning of the movie. And, Bird was able to sneak in actual evil into the villains of the movie. For example, Syndrome came across as very inhumane in his commands to his henchmen to kill the Incredibles, who also showed their evil by being so compliant. Shoot down an airplane with children on board? No problem! Terminate all superheroes on the island, regardless of age? Sure thing, boss!"

"spyder7","7","0","1","29 May 2005"," Not impressed...at all
","Nearly every person who likes this movie mentions something about the art and CGI. Even though I'm not drastically in love with either Star Wars or LoTR, I'd much rather watch THAT kind of CGI and appreciate it rather than pretend I'm enamored by a cartoon. Granted, the graphic art was the best part of this film, but there is not much else that's even good.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film enough I suppose, to sit through it once that is. The story is adequate at best...anyone could write it. Yeah, there are some dispersed messages relating to life in general, but they feel preachy and forced to me. The film really never found an identity in regards to genre. Granted, this isn't always a problem, but it was here. I was confused the whole way through, waiting for a spot to laugh and trying to figure it if the drama was serious. The end effect was that it was not really ever funny and rarely had me waiting to see what developed.<br/><br/>The voices were decent, but I felt Jason Lee was ripped off by the animation. I think he knew where to go with the voice, but it didn't pay off in the graphic rendering of the character. Some of the script really disappointed me, e.g., ""I'm not strong enough...to lose you again."" Please, spare me. Again, I didn't buy into the drama.<br/><br/>To be fair, this is a kid's film (I'm definitely convinced this has no place among the ranks of non-kid films) and it passes nicely as one. Also, I tend to be unimpressed with most animated features, many for the same reasons as above. However, I knew this was below par when my wife, who loves so many Disney and Pixar films, looked at me at the end and just laughed (it was her second laugh in those two hours). It turns out that she was laughing about how mediocre the film was, which is quite the opposite of her reaction to most other Pixar productions.<br/><br/>I still give it a 7 out of 10, for two reasons. First, the CGI was impressive. Second, it was a solid kid's film, which is what it was meant to be in the first place. Why everyone is raving over it though, I really cannot understand.

","Where to start? The movie, written and directed by Mr. Bird, mingles superheros actions and mundane life. However, it is when you examine the mundane that you realize that Mr. Bird's own ideology is transferred to screen. Besides having an ineffective token African American character and a control freak stay-at-home mother, Bird likes to have ElasticGirl instill fear within her kids (probably justified given the circumstances of the film). She warns them that the villains at hand are not like the Saturday morning cartoons villains, they will not exercise any restraint because they are faced with children, they will kill them if given the chance. The following, very well done, chase, provides justification for her comments. But there has been so much fake creation of fear recently in real life that you can't but grind at such a suggestion.<br/><br/>The superheros are confined to inactivity at the beginning of the movie due to activist courts and lawyers, in spite of the fact that supers were saving Joe Sixpack's life on a daily basis. Sued for alleged incidents, Mr. Incredible is forced to retirement. Working, seemingly, with the government (the agent is present at Bob and Helen's wedding), the administration decides to go underground. The activist courts and lawyers reminds one of the Bush administration's recent claim that civil courts decisions to allow too much money in malpractice suits, for instance, cost society too much and is the reason insurance is so expensive. His next job as an insurance adjuster completes the picture. Interesting.<br/><br/>The movie, aesthetically, is an absolute wonder, though, good cover for a conservative message. Anyway, warmly recommended, so very good and, yes, can't wait for the sequel, if there is one."

","Generally not being a fan of Pixar animation (or most American animated films for that matter) I admit that while I watched ""The Incredibles"" with some trepidation, I was optimistic because of a couple of factors: First of all, I'm a comic book/super hero geek from way back and will see most of the films that fall into this genre. (I even endured the horrid ""Hellboy"" because of this ugly fascination) Secondly, Sarah Vowell voices the character of the Violet, the daughter, and pretty much anything that Vowell touches turns to darkly humored intellectual gold. And finally, the writer and director was Brad Bird, one of the original guys behind ""The Simpsons"", one of the greatest television shows of all time. So I asked myself, what could possibly go wrong? Thankfully, not a whole lot. From the action-packed beginning of the film where we are introduced to the majority of the characters, it is clear that this is going to be film that is going to appeal primarily to adults, with enough sight gags and silliness to keep the kids entertained throughout. Chronicling the lives of a family of superheroes, ""The Incredibles"" manages to create a plausible family story (though the family is certainly different from most). After a series of perceived screw ups, the government has cracked down on super heroes and have placed them into the witness protection program. Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Nelson) is now an overweight claims processor for an insurance company who is unsatisfied with his humdrum life and longs to relive his former glory. Helen Parr/Elastigirl (Hunter) is his wife, and seems to have adjusted to her suburban life nicely and enjoys taking care of the home and being a mother to her children Dash, Violet and baby Jack Jack. Sometimes at night, however, Bob has been sneaking out with his friend Lucius Best/Frozone (Jackson) to listen to police scanners and, when a crime or emergency occurs, answer the call of duty before anyone else arrives. When Bob receives a mysterious package from someone asking him to become a ""contract super hero"" and do various tasks for them, he jumps at the chance, a decision that puts himself, his family, and the world in peril.<br/><br/>Throughout my viewing of ""The Incredibles"", I frequently found myself forgetting that the film was technically a children's film, and also that it was even animated. The animation was nearly flawless and the presentation had many elements of a celluloid, live-action film such as various camera angles, etc. One thing that most impressed me was the voice talent; being a fan of some genres of anime, I find myself only watching the show/film in the original language because the English dubs are just mind-numbingly awful. So even though this was an American-produced film, I was still wary of that aspect. Early on it became clear that there was no reason to be concerned, because all of the voice talent (particularly that of Hunter and Nelson) were truly great. As I mentioned earlier, I was very excited about Sarah Vowell's involvement, because this is not something she normally participates in. She did a good job, but it turned out to be almost distractingly strange to hear her voice in this context; normally I'm hearing her reading one of her essays on PRI's, ""This American Life"". Obviously this isn't a criticism for the film itself, however. The story was remarkably compelling and clever, and there were a couple of good laughs, though not as many as I expected. Still, I would consider this film, rather than a comedy, more of an action film with some comedic elements thrown in, so I wasn't expecting a rip-roaring laugh fest.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""The Incredibles"", a critique that is all the more meaningful when one realizes how little I like or tolerate films that are aimed at kids (my disturbing obsession with Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" notwithstanding). As to whether the film deserves its current slot in the IMDb Top 100? That I'm not so sure about, particularly when I look at some of the films that are edged out when new films enter the list. But generally, ""The Incredibles"" is a decent film that was very enjoyable. 6/10 Side note: I rarely mention DVD extras in my reviews, but I kind of have to in this case. ""The Incredibles"" is really heavy on the extras, but the two that I happened to watch were wonderful, and shouldn't be missed if possible. The first is the Sarah Vowell video essay (it was absolutely hilarious and really does a good job of showing who she is) and the second was the short film that showed a scene between Jack Jack and his babysitter that was not a part of the film. The person I watched the movie with and I both agreed that it contained some better laughs than even the movie itself."

","This was probably the perfect animation flick. I got invested in the characters, enjoyed their sudden realizations of power, and thoroughly enjoyed the ride until the end. I was sad when the movie was over. It didn't seem like a 2-hour movie, which is very long by animation standards.<br/><br/>What blew me away though was the retro-futuristic look of the entire film. It reminded me of ""Gattaca"" but even better. Everything from the 50s-60s-style cars (with tailfins) to the font choices for the building lettering (very 50s GM/GE) to the upscale 50s suburb architecture (angular, with jutting eaves). And in keeping with that theme, when the movie first starts out, it's the late 30s - the cars are very curvy and low to the ground, the buildings are largely concrete (Empire State Bldg./Art Deco-ish).<br/><br/>Outstanding. 10 out of 10 stars."

","""The Incredibles"", without question, falls nowhere short of its title: a spectacular pack of dynamite thrills, comical and compelling humor, and stupendously dazzling visuals, an animated masterpiece for both adventure-craving children and cynical, adulterated parents alike, transcending a seemingly trite and cartoonish premise into marvelous entertainment that delivers all the goods that should be the standard for all Hollywood productions. Beginning with the exploits (or lack thereof) of a wrongfully disgraced gargantuan of a superhero Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible), his equally vigorous wife, and quarrelsome, prodigal children, ""The Incredibles"" could have resorted to strictly a nimble ""superheroes saving the day"" scenario, supplanting mindless action and explosion for character development and dialog. I am pleased to report that the film instead bypasses this clichéd premise and offers a simple, delightful, and often hilarious tale about a man who once conquered the scum of the earth in a supersuit, mask, and cape, who has now been reduced to intervening in family feuds, grovelling to his uptight boss, and combating the inconveniences of commute, his only escape being nights hanging out with his ex-superhero buddy Frozone (""Where's my supersuit?"") and reliving the ""golden days""; a perfectly endearing story we could all relate to and appreciate. Cleverly written, and with various cultural jabs (e.g. frivolous lawsuits), this story in and of itself would be plenty to be enjoyed; then again, with Pixar at the helm, it had to live up to its name and succeed as dynamite entertainment, now didn't it? One hilarious escapade leads to another, and soon enough, you guessed it, Bob Parr is once again called to arms as ""Mr. Incredible"". The dialog here is truly ingenious, offering distinct dimensions to each and every character and giving them their own valuable, memorable traits- with the family, these traits are brilliantly infused into their roles of action, which in effect, elevates all of their actions as superheroes to gratifying heights of excitement. Surprisingly enough, hardly ever is the dialog in this ""family-oriented flick"" ever bland or cheesy; it's almost entirely fresh and original, and always amusing. The visuals, without mention, are absolutely dazzling: the action mixes richly with the colors, the explosions are sheer dynamite- an amazing feat for ""animation"", and the characters' facial features and motions very much satisfy their accepted personalities; this is perhaps the most wonderful, ground-breaking animation I've ever seen displayed in film. The manner in which the film somehow achieves the weight of being a perfectly innocuous ""family flick"", gratifyingly clever and original comedy, and delivering some dynamite bang-for-your-buck, is enough to solidify this Pixar wonder (would you expect anything else from Pixar?) as a masterpiece. ""The Incredibles"" works ably and incredibly at balancing and surpassing so many expectations, and sustains itself from becoming a clichéd, brainless animated actioner, and rather succeeding as a clever, fresh, and marvelously rollicking entry in both the superhero and animated comedy genres. ""Dahling, Dahling... For incredible, eye-popping entertainment, rejoice with ""The Incredibles"": it offers nearly everything that's been sorely missing in the doldrums of Hollywood entertainment today. **** out of ****"
"schmimic","10","0","1","23 April 2005"," Maybe I'm biased, but I think this was by far the best movie of last year. Go watch it now.
","I wanted to see this movie right from the moment that I saw the teaser trailer on the Finding Nemo DVD. I love Pixar movies. I think they're great. I thought Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo were all top notch. That being said, The Incredibles blows all the aforementioned movies out of the water.<br/><br/>Back in the 60s, superheroes were everywhere. One of the most popular superheroes, if not the most popular, was Mr. Incredible. With amazing strength and a strong social conscience, everybody loved him. But then, one day/night while he's out doing his superhero thing, a few things happen. He saves a man from committing suicide, and breaks his neck in the process. The suicidal man sues Mr. Incredible. Also, when a bomb falls onto LRT tracks, Mr. Incredible has to charge in front of a train and use his body to stop it, throwing all the passengers around, sustaining various injuries. They all sue him too. As a result, the government forces all superheroes to hang up their capes and either get lost or enter civilian life.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Bob Parr, a.k.a. Mr. Incredible, is an insurance agent. He is bored, fat, middle-aged, and unhappy. He does everything he can to help his clients out, which obviously upsets his boss. What insurance company wants to be paying out fat dividends when their clients get injured? After Bob's boss has a little chat with him and Bob ""accidentally"" throws his boss through about five walls, Bob finds himself unemployed.<br/><br/>However, as he clears out his briefcase, he notices a foreign object. It looks almost like a little t.v. screen, only very thin. In true Mission Impossible style, it's a device used to contact Mr. Incredible with details on a new assignment. And then the device self-destructs, setting off the smoke alarm.<br/><br/>Bob is a little bit bored with his life, so it's a refreshing change to actually be needed by somebody to do something incredible (bad joke, I know). He gets flown out to a remote island to fight a robot, with the instructions to only shut it down and not destroy it. A little bit hard to do when it's trying to kill you, I think. But he does it. After all, he is Mr. Incredible.<br/><br/>So over the next few weeks, the Parr family thinks that their husband/father has been promoted at the insurance agency as he's having more money to throw around, driving fancier cars, dressing better, working out, spending time with his family, and just getting a general zest for life back.<br/><br/>Eventually he gets contacted with more assignments, all the while telling his family he's just going off for business meetings and things of the nature.<br/><br/>I think that's enough of a spill on the plot of the movie to hopefully work up the appetite of all of you who have not yet seen this movie. My suggestion would be to just go out and buy it. If I don't get this movie for my birthday, I think I'll have to buy it. Not because I want to, because I have to. It's just that good.<br/><br/>The animation is great, the action is great, the storyline is great. It has drama, action, humour, suspense, and oh so much more. In my opinion, this was the best movie of 2004.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)"

","You've read everyone else's comments, so these will be brief.<br/><br/>This production is as close to faultless as they get. But, if one wishes to go over the top with praise, it is for the 2-DVD set. Not only do we get the obligatory 'how it was made' blah, blah, blah; but all those extras that everyone else has been crowing about.<br/><br/>However, back to the film. Backgrounds: 10/10. Choice of vocal talents: 10/10. Storyline: 10/10. The reason it gets, from me, a 9/10 is due to the (apparently) problematic conversion to CGI that Pixar has in relation to their characters' faces. There are still too many similarities to 'human' faces as portrayed in ""Toy Story"". Indeed, at one point in the movie, I was drawing facial comparisons with those in same. Still, it's a minor quibble.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" is, without a doubt, incredible. Long may Pixar reign."

Of them is Mr. Incredible, who longs for the old days. At home, he feels unfulfilled with the family lifewife (Elastigirl, wonderfully voiced by Holly Hunter and able to stretch and bend to unbelievable lengths; daughter Violet, who has her own powers (invisibility and force-field creation) and looks eerily like Samara, the villain of ""The Ring""; son Dash, whose power is the ability to run at super-speeds and resents not being able to show them off; and baby Jack-Jack, who seems to have no powersyet!)

","As an animator of this film i would like to comment on some of the negative responses been made. <br/><br/>I am aware everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but The Incredibles was made purely for an action purpose, we ditched the moral side of previous Pixar stories alongside the flurry montage sequences and concentrated on the WOW factor, i.e. explosions, villains etc... This film was designed to fit a specific era, with characters, scenes and plots. 1950's era to be exact. This was to be appealing to both adults as well as children. <br/><br/>The Plot. What strong, flowing, plots do you see in most action movies? To be quite honest, if there is one, the audience tend to drift away from the moral of an action movie along with the plot due to the visually stimulating images and flashing/strobing sequences of guns and explosions. The plot was made thin to fit a criteria/genre. You guessed it, ACTION!<br/><br/>Being mainly a children's animation production company, Pixar unfortunately have to omit some of the blood and guts that otherwise may be installed. For goodness sakes, we don't want the children to fear the action, we want them to enjoy it.<br/><br/>As for the plot. Family, sticking together, a famous plot that drives most of Pixars films. A trademark of our company, and the plot is established and constructed throughout the slower half(beginning) of the picture, building up action nearer to the end. <br/><br/>What everyone seems to misunderstand is that companies and films need to vary with each picture. They need to complete a broad spectrum of films, not to just concentrate on the same genre all the time. <br/><br/>Anymore Questions i'd be happy to answer"

Shrek or Nemo movies seem to childish to me to spend one and a half hour of my time on Earth, yes I am aware that I may miss something, I was told it. I was however intrigued by the success of the 'Incredibles', rented the DVD and I am not sorry. It's pure entertainment, no pretensions, but still as good entertainment as many of the comics-inspired films I saw lately. Of course the imagination and creativity of the animators is key in such movies. Computer enhanced techniques help tremendously in creating a few characters that are better than similar cast in actor movies. The action is however somehow childish and with a better written story this film could have crossed the threshold into being good cinema, but still it's amusement of better quality than many other films lately. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","As many critics have pointed out, The Incredibles does not have an original storyline but is rather a combination of ideas and experiments throughout underground cinema history. Some even goes as far as to devalue its worth. However, considering that movies have been directed and produced for decades, it is not fair to argue originality when the sad fact is that the well of originality as been sucked dry a long time ago. This is not to say that The Incredibles did not have their moments of originality, because it had its moments (many moments to be fair) as well as something else that merits more than the desire to be something new.<br/><br/>As far as visuals go, Pixar once again reminds us just why they are the reigning champions of animation. Taking the world of animated movies by storm with their debut major film, Toy Story. With the beautifully rendered textures and visual effects (especially that of the fire and water scenes) the audience is again left wondering the thin line between virtual and reality. Incredibles, like its predecessors continues to boasts its accomplishments in the digital world, creating everything from rippling shades on costumes to the unshaven specks on Mr. Incredible's face. The only flaw in terms of animation is that on few occasions the lip-sync of the characters and the voicing is slightly off tempo.<br/><br/>Regarding, Brad Bird has certainly put today's movies to shame. With a world of infinite possibilities in the animation realm, Bird unleashes his pent up imagination, an imagination overlooked with the underrated Iron Giant. What Brad Bird has given us is something that few movies, animated or live-action, have today is something we call execution. It is true that it wasn't original, but it was directed to perfection with a completely believable plot. It was a balanced mix of clean comedy, family values, drama, action, visual effects, and social morals. With a jazzy soundtrack and classic looks as well as drooling visuals and fast paced action that appeals to both the old and young. Pixar must also be congratulated in maintaining a humor level appropriate for children in a world where crudeness seems to be the solution for box office hits. What Bird has done is deliver us an animated movie with perfect settings, the perfect voice cast, appropriate soundtracks, balanced drama, comedy, and action, and character development and balance as well. Though some may argue that in developing some of the characters, Bird had slowed the movie's pace, it is only in these tender moments that we can truly develop a character. Be honest with yourself, when was the last time you saw a movie not produced by Pixar/Disney or Dreamworks where you remember someone that wasn't the main character. The fact that so many reviews mentioned Frozone and Edna Mode is proof positive of Pixar's unique accomplishment.<br/><br/>In terms of themes, like many have stated before, with the leadership of outsider Brad Bird, this movie has taken a departure of the usually ""happily ever after"" or ""cute and fuzzy"" themes that Disney and Pixar normally follows, nor the superhero immortality that comics usually have. This movie was darker, dealing with issues of oppression and conformity while putting the very people we idolize in situations of life or death. No longer is it Joker trying to capture Batman to drive him to death with bad jokes but rather ordinary mercenaries truly out to kill our beloved heroes, adult or child. It talks about the greediness and callous attitudes of today's corporations who would do anything to earn the buck as well as the nonsense philosophy of giving everyone trophies in a contest so the losers will feel better about themselves. It shows the bitterness in the oppressed soul, whether it be a middle aged man forced into mediocrity as a sales person or a child unable to do his best, either out of fear of prosecution or the constraints of his or her parents. Yet, despite these dark themes, Pixar achieves a rare balance of a darker movie that still has the elements that appeals to children of all ages. With a comedy clean enough for kids and humor mature enough for teenagers, Bird and Pixar succeeds in finding a successful happy medium for humans of all ages.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is a brilliantly executed piece of cinema that the entire family can genuinely enjoy. With the mold of a typical family (minus their superpowers) thrust in a cruel and greedy world, this is a movie that even our beer guzzling, football watching fathers would approve of. While not exactly breaking new grounds of originality, The Incredibles holds its own and stands tall in its own uniqueness with a perfect balance of the original James Bonds and its accurate observation of today's ruthless society."

","Teaming up once again to bring an instant classic, Pixar animation studios and Walt Disney present ""The Incredibles"". Sitting down to this film, I was expecting it to be a heartwarming modern day fairytale like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""A Bug's Life"". Disney's latest animated movie delivered something a little more grown-up however. The film takes your modern nuclear family and swaps in a cast of super powered members, each with their own unique abilities that tie in with their role in the family. Mr. Incredible, who stars as the main protagonist, is a combination of the Hulk and your average middle class workaholic who is always dreaming about his younger years. His wife Elastigirl spends much of the film being pulled in several directions at once while trying to remain the perfect mother and wife. Playing the role of the younger child and average hyperactive six year old is Rush, who speeds around the entire film at an incredible rate. His older sister Violete, the shy teenager who shuts out her parents, later in the film saves the entire family several times with her ability to create forcefields and invisibility. While the movie is light in tone and humorous at parts, the focus is more so on the dynamics of family life then laughs, and each characters development and maturity is presented as a parallel to the adventures they each experience. And as always, good old Samuel L Jackson makes another appearance as the super cool hero Frozone, proving once and for all that the man is in fact trying to be in every movie every made. BOTTOM LINE: Not as gut-bustingly funny as Shrek or Monster's Inc. but a definite winner for kids and their parents to watch together. See if you can figure out which of the main characters go through the same incredible challenges you do!"

"newkidontheblock","9","0","1","25 March 2005"," Pixar/Disney, you've done it again
","Of all the great films Disney and Pixar have put out, I think this may be in my top 3, if not my favorite. The Incredibles was a great film that took a fresh look at the world of superhero's, one that didn't just have one, but had a full family. It's good to see that C.T. Nelson is still working, I though he did a great job as the voice of Mr. Incredible. With a supporting cast of interesting characters, its quite hard to not enjoy The Incredibles.<br/><br/>So, this film is about a family in your normal suburbia who may seem average (i.e. father with a job, mother at home, mischievous son, emo daughter)but actually have a very interesting secret. The film begins about 20 (?) years before the plot really starts to thicken. The great Mr. Incredible has saved the day again, but it would be the last time he would do it as a bachelor. That night, he and his Fiancé (Elastigirl) would wed. After that happened, he did a routine saving, at least that's what he though. He saved a man jumping out of a building. Everything was wonderful, that is until he found out the man was trying to commit suicide. The man slapped him with a lawsuit and superherioisim was made illegal.<br/><br/>Well, Mr. and Mrs. Parr (aka Mr. Incredible and Elstigirl) had to settle down to a normal life. Mr. Parr, though, still had those ""superhero urges"" and still wanted to fight crime. So on Tuesday's (it was Tuesday, right?) they went out looking for someone to save. This put the Parr marriage in jeopardy, but tried to control it. That is, until he received a strange call that asked him to join this special union of superhero's (which is really a trap). Will Mr. Incredible take the bait (of course he will, duh).<br/><br/>You have got to see this film, you will love it. Would I lie to you?"

The writing, the wit, the fast pace and the incredible technical aspects associated with the film's action is sensational. I loved this movie in the best traditions of family entertainment. Creator Brad Bird has made a film that took me back to my youth in terms of my memories involved with watching such classic shows as 'Batman' and 'The Incredible Hulk' and at the same time, mixed it with elements of my experiences of watching Disney animation from the late 60's to the mid 70's and this hybrid of mixing popular culture from the past with the technology of today is the best definition of ""re-invention"" that we have had in a very long time."

","Clever, warm, and very funny animated feature from the creators of Toy Story and Finding Nemo is an in-depth look at the life of superheroes after they get old and have to retire from the 'business' of saving lives. Engaging tale centers around the super strong and super cocky Mr. Incredible, his feisty and elastic wife, and their constantly bickering children, all of whom must 'adapt' to civilian life after the government places a worldwide ban on superheroes. Loses some momentum as it nears the middle, but it's filled with exciting visuals, excellent vocal talents—especially Jackson as Frozone—and more than enough wisecracks, some of which aren't aimed squarely at children.

","I found ""The Incredibles"" to be much better than anticipated. I'm not real big on Pixar movies, but they are growing on me thanks to movies like this. The opening scene where you see Mr and future Mrs. Incredible meeting at the scene of a crime, on the same day of their marriage to be, was just hilarious. Little did I know they already knew each other, let alone were getting married that night. Disney did a very good job of showing the flirtatious side of the two superheros there, had me laughing my butt off. The movie though, took a very slow pace for while the superheros were trying to live just normal lives, with very little action. But it made up for it in the 2nd half of the movie when Mr. Incredible (Bob) got into trouble and his wife (who thought he was cheating on her) and his kids (who snuck along with their mom) flew out to try to save Bob. One of the most riveting scenes was during the plane ride in to save Bob and the heat seeking missiles were chasing the plane with his wife and kids. It sounded as emotional as you would expect it to sound in a real life situation. Anyways, in the end, you learned that the youngest (baby) also had powers that were not revealed the entire movie before that, so it was a good ending. Everything came full circle, even down to the detail of the costume designer not wanting to put a cape on Mr. Incredible's uniform since she claimed it was responsible for several superhero's deaths. In the end, it was Syndrome's cape, fittingly that cost him his life. A well thought out movie, and very entertaining for the most part. I gave it a nine.<br/><br/>Jason"

","After such Pixar successes as Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc, it seemed unlikely Brad Bird could deliver the goods again with this tale of everyday superheroes.<br/><br/>Fortunately, he smacks the ball right out of the stadium with a hyperkinetic, sharply observed and wildly exciting movie with plenty to appeal to kids and parents alike.<br/><br/>Shut down as heroes by a litigation-prone America, 'Mr Incredible' Bob Parr and his super family now live a quiet life in the suburbs  until his secret freelance heroics land him in big trouble with a new evil genius and the gang goes back to work.<br/><br/>The astute digs at costumed crimefighters are spot on (from the accidents capes can cause to the cornered good guy tactic of tricking the villain into 'monologueing' while they figure a way out) and they're seamlessly integrated into a genuinely gripping, visually exhilarating superhero story that puts the likes of Daredevil and Catwoman to shame."
"film-critic","10","0","1","22 March 2005"," You sly dog! You caught me monologuing!
","This was an impressive film. I have not had the best of luck with PIXAR films lately. I didn't really see the creativity in Monsters, Inc and Finding Nemo literally gave me the sweats when I watched it, so there was some hesitancy to see what PIXAR could do to topple their past mega-hits. Well, what they crafted was something so out of left field that even I, the movie kinda guy, never saw it coming. They made a very witty, intelligently clever, powerfully smart adult cartoon. While there were elements throughout the film that I felt children would enjoy, I did feel as if 92% of this film was invested with the intelligent adult in mind. There is great respect paid to the superheroes of my father's generation as well as a specific intent to downplay the ""cute"" element and keep us glued to our seats with action, suspense, and some of the most ingenious animation to be seen this side of the Mississippi.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, this film reeked perfection in a way that other films only aspire to smell like. It not only gave us this huge pre-story about what was happening in the world of superheroes (a concept that seemed taboo in the past), but it also gave us this enormous family dynamic that allowed each character to be built from the floor up. Each of our characters has their own dilemma, their own style, and their own hurdles that they need to cross, and Brad Bird gives them each their moment to shine. While he does focus heavily on our ""head of family"" Mr. Incredible, he gives so much attention to detailing the rest of the characters and scenes that you never feel this uneven balance. This is a story about family, about realizing that you are ""super"", and that powers are not needed to realize this. These are huge issues to cover in a animated film, but Bird succeeds in these three ways: First, he gives the film the time that it deserves. This is not some mere 89 minute film that never develops anything, never takes a chance, nor allows our characters to shine, but instead a very hefty 121 minutes of sheer pleasure. This is also why I think Bird had adults in mind while creating this visual feast, I know of very few children's films that are that extensive, normally you loose the child too quickly, but perhaps Bird wasn't aiming towards that audience. At least, that is what I witnessed.<br/><br/>Second, Bird gives us this huge world that is not surrounded by animated boundaries. We do not stay in just one city, we do not loiter around the superhero's house all day, and we do not get pulled into normal animated clichés like the man saves the day and gets himself that woman he has always wanted. The Incredibles went in a completely new, fresh, and somewhat tangent direction that gave it the power to grow before our eyes. That is what I completely enjoyed about this film was the fact that I could not foresee the future, meaning that there were no building clichés that gave me a direct path to the end. I had to guess, consider all possibilities, and reason with new ones that were unfolding before me. It was an adventure, not just a simple piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Third, and this is huge, was the main worry that I had with this film was the possible ""baby"" moments. I was so worried that we would find ourselves wasting time watching, listening, or gasp laughing at the ""cute"" baby factor. I thought that this was a path that Bird was going to travel towards, and would have ultimately caused this review to be a bit more tilted. But, this wasn't a film for a child was it? So, Bird left out most of the scenes dealing with the child and thus forced us to see the adults dealing with very mature themes and scenarios. This factor was huge in indicating that perhaps Bird had a separate audience in mind.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an amazing film to watch, experience, and enjoy. The bold use of colors complimented the sensation of the characters that carried with them similar attributes. Brad Bird skillfully crafted this film that had every possibility of being clichéd and overbearingly geared towards children, but instead he took a higher road and gave us this film that will last the test of time due greatly in part to giving us, the adults in the world, an opportunity to indulge and enjoy the power of animated cinema. In every attempt not to sound redundant, this film was ""incredible"". The characters were beautiful, the story was solid, and the powerful voice acting allowed this film to rank among the top of my PIXAR favorites. I highly recommend this film to anyone that is an avid superhero fan or simply is looking for an adventurous ride into the future of our movie business. WOW. That is all I can say  ""WOW"".<br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"

My only question, and it may or may not have been addressed before, is: Did Pixar payoff Stan Lee and Marvel for the use of their intellectual property? The characters are a complete ripoff of the Fantastic Four. It's not even funny. Throw in an Iceman ripoff and you've got a real question about the originality of this movie.

","This is probably the second best superhero movie made so far (the first being Spider-Man II).

When I grew up ALL superheroes had insignias on their chests and capes. To have Edna totally run the idea of capes into the ground was hilarious.<br/><br/>The most incredible part of the movie to me was an in joke. However, I have yet to hear anyone mention it, but it seemed clear to me. At the beginning of the movie a small boy approaches Mr. Incredible and want to be his sidekick. The small boy has freckles and orange-red hair and is very persistent. This boy has to be none other than a thinly veiled Jimmy Olsen (Superman's Pal). When this orange-haired boy becomes Syndrome, he wears a large ""S"" on his body (Superman?). His orange hair is now flame-like (anger?). One could look at the confrontation between Syndrome and Mr. Incredible as a struggle (played out many times in DC comics) between Jimmy Olsen and Superman (often based on Jimmy's jealousy and second-fiddle treatment). Many times Jimmy somehow gained superhero-type powers and came into conflict with Supes.<br/><br/>Great film."
"chrisq28","9","0","1","18 March 2005"," Well-Told and Well-Animated
","With ""The Incredibles"" and the under-viewed masterpiece ""The Iron Giant"", as well as some fine Simpsons episodes under his belt, Brad Bird has shown himself to be one of the finest writer/directors in animated films. ""The Incredibles"" is simply a beautiful and well-done movie, with an exciting storyline, well-developed themes, and breathtaking animation.<br/><br/>In short, the movie tells the story of Mr. Incredible (played by Craig T. Nelson, who they picked after realizing they shouldn't use John Goodman again, I'm sure) and Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two superheroes who are shown getting married at the beginning of the movie. After a bungled rescue attempt (foiled by an incompetent fan named Buddy, who calls himself Incrediboy), would-be victims file civil suits against Mr. Incredible and other superheroes. After a developing public outcry, the government puts the superheroes in hiding, and asks that they refrain from publicly using their powers, even if it's for the greater good.<br/><br/>Cut to fifteen years later, and we see that Mr. Incredible (now Bob Parr) and Elastigirl (who goes by Helen Parr) are now raising children (Dash and Violet, who have superpowers as well, but aren't allowed to use them for fear of being found out) and Bob works at an insurance company that makes its business by screwing its clients in their hour of need. Unsatisfied with his job and stuck in the past of his glory days, Bob leaps at the opportunity to go on a secret mission and utilize his powers of super-strength. Of course, things aren't exactly as they seem, and the entire family ends up getting caught up in an adventure that allows them to utilize their strengths, rather than be ashamed of them. Their escapade changes the lives of superheroes all over the world from then after.<br/><br/>The film has strong themes of family, restraint, and individuality, the latter being the most well-defined. There is one line that is used at least twice in the movie: ""If everyone is special, that means that no one really is."" A lot of people have looked at the individuality theme and thought that Bird wants to make a statement about all people not actually being equal. I believe the statement is true, not all people can do the same things (although they should be given the same opportunities), but is an incorrect interpretation. Actually, Mr. Bird seems to be saying that people should be allowed to use and develop their strengths to the best of their abilities, and always in the best interest of the general public. (The movie's villain develops his talents, but for evil, and we see that he isn't rewarded for it.) After all, they're all much happier when they're allowed to be all that they can be (watch Dash's eyes light up when his mother directs him to run as fast as he can if he gets into trouble).<br/><br/>The animation is unbelievable in this movie. As it ended, I thought to myself that if this is the future of animation, then live-action has a lot to live up to. Of course, live-action will never be eliminated, there's too much to offer in the medium. However, there are some scenes that took place in The Incredibles that couldn't have happened without great cost, and likely with a loss to the scene. This is Pixar's first film in which all the characters were human, and I would be interested to see what it would be like if they took animation just a few steps (or less) further into other genres.<br/><br/>9.75/10.00 for The Incredibles."

As an example, there is one moment when ""Mrs. Incredible"" is getting ready to pull off a particularly amazing feat.

The 'Best Picture' accolade (whenever presented, by whichever group) recognizes the highest achievements in film making and in all the individual endeavors that make up a film. On this basis, I call 'The Incredibles' the best film of the year. The animation was superb, on par or better than any FX done in any other film in 2004. The acting, especially Holly Hunter's Elasti-Girl, was amazing (and yes voice-over is still considered acting). The script was as inventive and fresh as anything since 'Pulp Fiction' stunned the nation a decade ago.

The plot development was slow and a bit weak. I had a hard time finding a character to identify with. This wasn't the case with Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and the Toy Story films. Those movies all had solid plots and well-developed characters.<br/><br/>In sum: while the Incredibles sports excellent animation, its poor character development and a weak plot hold it a notch lower than the earlier Pixar films. They probably didn't spend as much time perfecting the story this time around."
"stamper","8","0","1","16 February 2005"," Suck on that 007
","I'll be the first one to admit that The Incredibles has a rather weak core story. It's a simple, familiar and easily conceivable good guy vs. bad guy routine and the basic plot becomes apparent very early into the film. This despite the fact that the actual bad guy is not exposed an until about an hour into the film. Now this set-up might work for 6-10 year old's, but it certainly doesn't work for the average adult watching this film. Despite falling into the latter category myself (being 23 years young) I neither found this simple core story annoying nor did I feel that it took anything away from the fun that became and is The Incredibles. Fact is, that the the great characters, the familiar situations, the great visuals and music all add up to make the simple set-up fade away into oblivion.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed by the apparent ease in which Brad Bird fused superhero and espionage elements with everyday situations every person knows so well. Especially family themes as upbringing and aging were addressed very truthfully and at times I felt myself chuckle, because it all seemed so familiar (either from own experience, or because I know people like that). These familiar situations along with the careful build-up of the story, are crucial for this film, because they allow it to last 2 hours without becoming boring and slow.<br/><br/>While The Incredibles may be very predictable at times, I still felt that the whole was very original. One example of this originality is the fact that everybody's super powers became useful (specifically and individually) in the end. In my mind, it is simply amazing what Brad Bird accomplished with this film and in my humble opinion The Incredibles is the best Bond film since Goldeneye (1995). But not only that, it is also the best Pixar film since Toy Story 2 or maybe ever (beating the (for me) disappointing, yet highly successful Finding Nemo with incredible ease), Disney's best animated feature probably since Hercules AND one of the best films of 2004. The film might not be as comical and hilarious as Disney's previous offerings, but it still is one of the best films the company has brought forward and it definitely deserves to win the Oscar for best animated feature. I for one CANNOT wait for the sequel, although I hope in the end they'll do better than what they ended with.<br/><br/>8,25 out of 10 <br/><br/>post scriptum: maybe I suck as a movie critic and I should stop writing reviews, but I enjoy it too much and luckily you're not forced to read this.

The main character had a nice touch of the 'high school heydays' that he needed to relive and a wife in which he seemed to have a natural relationship with.

"philip_vanderveken","10","0","1","2 February 2005"," The people didn't lie when saying this movie was excellent
","I just got the DVD from a friend and I have to say that I was very curious about it. Would it really be as good as people say? The answer is YES!!! Every time I see a new Pixar movie I think I've seen it all (Of course it is impossible to improve what is perfect, at least in the normal world). But somehow Pixar always manages to find something that makes the next movie even better than the previous ones. Still, I'm glad that I didn't see the movie immediately after it was released. I always prefer to let it all calm down and wait until the biggest commotion is over, because most of the time watching a movie that is praised by so many can be very disappointing. Not because it isn't any good, only because you expect the impossible.<br/><br/>All I can say is that it was excellent. This is a parody on all super heroes like Batman, Superman, Spiderman, even James Bond. Mr. Incredible used to be a superhero, but after making a ""mistake"" by saving someone who didn't want to be saved, he and his family are forced to become ordinary citizens. Now only known by his secret identity, Bob Parr, he lives with his wife Helen (formerly known as Elastigirl) and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack. He works as an insurance claims specialist, but he's fed up with his job and his boss who's always picking on him. He even gets fired and all he wants is to be a superhero again ... but he is afraid to tell it all to his wife. Then he gets a secret message that asks him to do a job as Mr. Incredible. He tells his wife that he will have to attend a conference meeting and leaves home...<br/><br/>What I liked so much about this movie was that it offered constant laughter, especially during the first part, where he is Bob Parr. The way he sat in his car, how he was treated by his boss... It all looked so sad, but also so incredibly comical. If you really can't laugh with this, than you probably drunk a whole bottle of vinegar or ate at least a dozen of lemons. But that's not the only thing that I liked about the movie. The story was great and of course the entire movie is visually stunning (can you expect any less). The action shots were awesome and the dialogs perfect... <br/><br/>It's been a long time since I've had such great fun with a movie. Still I won't give it a 10/10 but a 9.5/10. Why? Well, because I'm convinced that one of the next Pixar movies will be even better and even more stunning than this one."

The Pixar people are becoming ever more expert and convincing in their production of human (and incredible) figures. For the genre, this film is well-scripted and well-acted. Yes, some of the twists in the plot are predictable, but some are quite clever too. Besides, it is one of the best-paced and exciting films of any type. Plenty of appropriate humor. The animation is breathtaking; needs to be seen to be believed. See it on a big screen and then buy the video or DVD for home. This film is a tremendous accomplishment by all the creative people involved. PS It's worth hanging around for at least the first half of the closing titles too. It is very well conceived in the mode of the earlier James Bond films and is backed with excellent music."

","Writer/director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) maintains Pixar Animation Studios' perfect strike-rate with this marvellous blend of domestic drama and action/adventure.<br/><br/>What if superheroes were forced to suppress their superpowers and live as ordinary citizens? The first half of the film focuses on the effects of this scenario on a superhero family: Mr Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), his wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), and their superpower-endowed children. The second half of the film focuses on what happens when Mr Incredible accepts a call to return to duty on a mysterious island outpost without the rest of the family's knowledge.<br/><br/>The film's animation is distinctive, and distinct from other Pixar films. The retro stylings, gadgets, and locations recall James Bond films, Thunderbirds, and 60's film noir. On the other hand, the animation is sometimes photo-realistic (e.g. the vegetation on the island). And the action sequences put to shame those of many live action films.<br/><br/>The film's themes are worthy (but never rammed down your throat), the humour is subtle, and the pacing is perfect.<br/><br/>Wisely, the voice cast is not loaded with big-name stars (unlike the recent Shark Tale, for example), but chosen based on their suitability for the character. Craig T. Nelson is perfect as Mr Incredible. Holly Hunter is feisty and intelligent as his put-upon wife. Jason Lee is suitably sneery as the villain of the piece, while Samuel L. Jackson contributes a relatively minor turn as a superhero friend of the family. Bird himself delivers a hilarious turn as eccentric superhero costume designer Edna Mode.<br/><br/>There's the usual Pixar short film prior to the main feature - a particularly cute little number called Boundin'."
"cs100","9","0","1","11 January 2005"," Incredible fun for the whole family!
","My rating: 9/10 Pixar does it again: they are simply today's best studio (better than Disney, better than Dreamworks) at producing great animated films that appeal to the entire family. The Incredibles is destined to become yet another Pixar classic that gets played again and again, years into the future.<br/><br/>As the dad of my family, I appreciated The Incredibles focus on the male psyche and the pressures that modern-day dads endure. There is more than a little bit of Mr. Incredible in all dads these days, even if we can't lift our commuter cars over our heads. However, I also saw a lot of my wife in the character of Elastigirl, as did she (by the way, Holly Hunter does a great voice-over for Elastigirl). Almost all kids will instantly identify with Dash, the young boy, and they will be filled with joy as Dash finally gets to use his powers to help save the day. The only weak, unappealing main character is Invisigirl, who I felt was too much of a low self-esteem, angst-ridden, shy teenage girl.<br/><br/>The storyline of The Incredibles is remarkably grown-up, and even has bearing on aspects of our politics and culture. The main message is a valid one: don't accept mediocrity. However, this means that certain aspects of the film are politically incorrect (egads, we're not all equal  and that's OK!), which is refreshing to see in a mainstream Hollywood film. Yet the film is not preachy, and there is more than enough other material to keep even a 4 year-old riveted to her seat.<br/><br/>The PG-rating comes from the cartoon-like violence. If your kids have been previously exposed to this type of action, then there is nothing to fear from The Incredibles. My whole family truly enjoyed the film, and can't wait for the next Pixar release."

I have to say, first of all, that the art direction alone is worth going to see this film. And I never notice things like art direction the first time I watch a film, but the way the scenes were designed from the lava-flow walls to the golden fish (not goldfish) in a tank in Edna's place, just overwhelmed me. And unlike most animated movies, this one didn't feel rushed. The humour was there, of course, and it was clear that Bird put a lot of his Simpsons experience into the film. It deserves Oscar nominations, and not just in the animated features category. If I say something like, it's better than watching Shrek 1 & 2 back-to-back, perhaps that will sum it up the most."

","Pixar is six for six with the Incredibles. All six films have been smash hits, but more importantly, all six have been wonderful films. And every time they step up to the plate, they just hit it further out of the park.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is not Pixar's most visually compelling film (Finding Nemo is, by far), but it is the most entertaining, the funniest and the most mature. It cleverly combines incredibly realistic backgrounds with obviously cartoonish characters, to give the film and sense of realism and great comedy at the same time.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible is a happy super-hero, engaged to the sexy Elasti-girl, and with his best friend Frozone, he lives a wonderful life. Until one day, he saves a would-be building jumper who, just plainly did not want to be saved. This opens up a rash of lawsuits against superheroes, and forces the government to relocate them (a la the Witness Protection Program), and in exchange, the heroes will just stop being heroes.<br/><br/>The Incredibles now live as Bob and Helen Parr with their three kids, all of who have powers of their own. Violet, who can disappear and create forcefields, is entering that awkward teen stage of life. Her younger brother, Dash, can, as his name implies, move with lightning speed and only know how to use this ability to annoy. The baby, Jack Jack, has powers that are yet to be discovered.<br/><br/>Bob is a claims clerk at an insurance company, with a nasty boss (brilliant small role by Wallace Shawn) and he is just plain bored. He sneaks out at night and with the help of Frozone and a police radio, still fights crimes.<br/><br/>The Incredibles deals so well with mid-life crisis, that one can scarcely believe that it is primarily a kids movie. Bob's hair is receding, his belly bulging and his mind longing for the past. That is why he cannot resist the call when a mysterious woman contacts him and offers him a job that only Mr. Incredible can solve.<br/><br/>From this point, the film is just one delight after another. From Edna, the costume lady (a less-that-subtle tribute to costume legend Edith Head) to the far away island where an evil villain is plotting his master plan, to the ingenious ways the powers are put to use, this is a movie that does not take a misstep. This film is scarier than the previous Pixar offerings, but not too instense for young children.<br/><br/>The best scenes in this movie are when the kids discover the extent of their powers and learn to put them to use. Like any kid in an awkward situation, they are shy, timid, and shocked when things go right. Also pay close attention to Elasti-girl when she is caught in between sliding doors.<br/><br/>In the simplest of terms, The Incredibles is an animated super-hero movie, but it creates complete characters and wonderfully unique situations. Like all good superheroes, The Incredibles have flaws and short-comings that get in the way of their powers. I cannot recommend this movie enough. **** out of ****."

","You see the trailers, view the making of special and it still delivers?! What a terrific movie and a rarity these days, unless it is a Pixar initiative. While it seems to borrow the dual identity premise of Spy Kids (2001), the large variety of wacky superheroes like Mystery Men (1999), the reworked superpowers of The Fantastic Four, the excitement and energy of the best James Bond movies and the character fallibilities of Spider-man 2 (2004) it is largely a unique movie in its own right.<br/><br/>It is fundamentally an action movie but what sets Pixar movies apart, from not only other animated but standard flicks, is the humanity it imparts. There are elements similar to the Iron Giant (1999), also directed by Mr Bird, that are very touching. The characters have depth and by the end of it most viewers will have something they can take away from the experience. A bit like an Aesop's fable using outstanding animation.<br/><br/>This isn't a by-the-numbers movie where the film-makers left all their great work on a white board. These people obviously care deeply about the project, the story and the characters. This makes it easy for the viewer to feel compassion and sympathy for 'The Incredibles' and strongly dislike the villain. While the animated special effects are, dare I say it, INCREDIBLE, this movie has heart and any effects used have a purpose that enhances the story.<br/><br/>There is also a great sense of comedy. Some of the scenes featuring the parents in various situations had me laughing out loud. Like all the other Pixar movies there is plenty of fun for the adults. Not so many in-jokes as the Toy Story movies as this movie stands strongly by itself with its own style. Mr Incredible's ever increasing paunch is something I can really relate to. Whatever happened to the glory days when I could feel my ribs! I'm going to see this again. The movie reinforces the importance of family, to treat others as you'd treat yourself and don't take life for granted. In times of war and crippling natural disasters these messages couldn't come at a better time. Yet it avoids preaching to the audience and being overly overt in delivering its messages.<br/><br/>It is perfect for parents who want to do something entertaining with their kids or for people like me in their early-30s who appreciate good film making, a nice chocolate ice-cream/box of popcorn and laughing together with complete strangers."

","More Animated Than Most: The Incredibles is a Super Story By Shane Shellenbarger<br/><br/>If you haven't seen The Incredibles in a theater by now don't be disheartened. As of this writing, the movie about a very above-par family of superheroes is still playing at twenty-two theaters in and around the Phoenix Metro area. Granted, it moved from the largest screen at Harkins Metro where I saw it on November 6th to the smallest screen at the same theater when I saw it on December 23rd, but it was every bit as enjoyable during the second viewing.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is proceed by the western short tale, Boundin', an allegorical of a lamb, a jack-a-lope, and ridiculing prairie dogs. While I didn't care for the character design, and the story didn't have the depth of Red's Dream or the ending poke in the funny-bone of Tin Toy or Knick Knack, Boundin' is still a delight for children of most ages.<br/><br/>When The Incredibles begins, we're treated to what appears to be an old interview of Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson), at first fumbling with his microphone and then bemoaning the tendency toward chaos and entropy. ""I just cleaned up this mess,"" he says. Then we move to current times where we find a very busy series of events to complicate Mr. Incredible's day: A bank robbery, a cat stuck in a tree (these events become linked), an over-achieving fan-boy, a holdup followed by an unexpected assist from another Super, a foiled suicide, an coincidental encounter with a super villain, a second (and portentous) encounter with Buddy(Jason Lee), the fan-boy, culminating in a late arrival at his own wedding! An amazing first few minutes. But, marital bliss is not to be Mr. Incredibles fate. He and all of the other super powered peoples must soon stop their aid to the common good. Are the Supers brought down by alien creatures, bent on subjugating mankind? Has a plague robbed the Supers of their powers and abilities? Alas, the greatest examples of mental and physical perfection the world has ever known are defeated by lawyers. Sued by the man who sought suicide as a solution to his woes, Mr. Incredible hangs up his super-suit, a hero no more. Soon, the government places all of the Supers in a form of the witness protection program, calming the lawsuit-mania and forcing anonymity on the former heroes.<br/><br/>Flash forward fifteen years. Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, now known only as Bob and Helen Parr (voiced by Holly Hunter), their children, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dashell (Spencer Fox), and Jack Jack (Eli Fucile and Maeve Andrews), live quiet lives in suburbia. Unbeknownst to his family, Bob is living a quiet life of desperation. He can't stomach that the insurance company for which he works is more concerned about the quarterly profit statement than it is about the ruined lives of customers whose claims they constantly deny. One day, Bob snaps, puts his boss, Gilbert Huph (voiced by Wallace Shawn, but looking like a diminutive William H. Macy) in the hospital, loses his job, and risks revealing his superpowers and forcing a relocation on his family. Just as he is about to confess his dire state to his wife, Bob discovers a mysterious envelope containing an invitation to be a hero once more and the promise of financial freedom for Bob and his family. Little does Bob know, but his life and the lives of all of the Supers will be forever changed by what he does next.

","The secret Identity of SPOILERS may be revealed in this review! I wasn't too sure about this film when my girlfriend and i went to see this. In my mind, nothing could top the beauty and splendid magnificence of the film that was ""Finding Nemo"", especially visually.<br/><br/>I was wrong to be worried. This film ROCKS! I went to see it again in the cinema and recommend it to you for your list for must have DVDs. The story is excellent, the sly jokes are very good, and the music - v. Bondian - perfectly fits the mood of the film; a darker, more adult Pixar movie. That been said, I was probably the oldest member of the audience both times - I was 17 - and yet they still clapped and cheered. Proof that any age can enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter are great in the leads, and Jason Lee is very good as the bad guy.I love the part about villains monologuing, by the way, because it's so true! Just watch any Bond film - a good one for an example of this is ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".<br/><br/>Faults? One or two. Visually it's very impressive, but is a very different film to ""Finding Nemo"" - I suppose that could be the counter-argument. Oh, and the Pixar short before the film SUCKED! C'mon, Pixar, it was totally against the mood of the main movie. What went wrong there? Apart from that, no complaints! A superb film from Pixar.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The Incredibles is a CG movie with actual substance. I was not impressed by Pixar CG-animated movies in the past, except for Toy Story 2 which have a substantial character development with emotional payoff. Until I gave The Incredibles a chance on a cold winter night in January, being aversive to hype.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is the best computer-generated film I've ever seen in terms of story, character development, healthy dose of humor (amazingly, no toilet humor) and CGI animation. I don't know if the top-notch quality level of this film will ever be topped, even with John Lasseter's next Pixar movie Cars. I won't blather about the plot; the less one know before going in to see, the better. Video will not do justice to the animated film of this highest caliber. I'm sad to note that The Incredibles's astonishingly high caliber and Shrek 2's phenomenal box office success are the final death knell for traditional 2-D animation feature film-making, with the possible sole exception of Studio Ghibli of Tokyo, Japan (Hayao Miyazaki & Isao Takahata).<br/><br/>The movie-going experience - sitting in the dark screening room without distraction or disruption by the patrons at the theatre - is crucial to the overall enjoyment of the film, and this movie exceeds my (admittedly low) expectation in every way much to my awe and astonishment.<br/><br/>Brad Bird and Pixar production team should be complimented with utmost praise for their hard work and incredible creative energy that made the movie the highest quality and most enjoyable there is in the history of CGI cinema. The Iron Giant was the best movie of 1999 (I saw it at a dollar theatre on a 50 cent movie night with zero expectation and I was floored by the ending); The Incredibles is the best movie of 2004 (floored once again by the whole movie). Coincidence? I think not.<br/><br/>Brad Bird is brilliant and extremely talented, and he should direct more movies with total creative control and freedom. He definitely knows how to make great movies with enthusiastic energy and fusing creative output with impossibly high substance. The Academy Awards should give this man an Oscar for Best Animated Film.<br/><br/>**** out of four stars"
"BadWebDiver","10","0","1","27 December 2004"," Incredibly great fun storytelling
","This is a top class, incredibly great fun computer animated story that spoofs comic book heroes and Bondian adventure stories, in the guise of a look at a ""typical"" American suburban family.<br/><br/>Think the premise of the LOST IN SPACE movie where a sci-fi-ish type story acts as the basis for character conflicts of a small family group. Now think of the THUNDERBIRDS movie where those conflicts are played out on a large action-packed stage in a faraway tropical island. Now ... imagine a film where those ideas was played in such a creative way that they actually ***worked***!!! Then you have THE INCREDIBLES.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Warning)<br/><br/>The set-up is brilliant; starting off with a TRUMAN SHOW type idea of superheroes being interviewed about their work, and their reaction to their lifestyle. Then we have a set-up which demonstrates our main heroic lead, Mr Incredible, saving the day with bank robbers and a cat - all while on the way to his wedding with another superhero - Elastagirl. Then the complications set in; some unscrupulous lawyers are taking advantage of the consequences of our hero's good deeds, and superheroes fall out of favor with the general public. They all go into hiding.<br/><br/>Cut to several years later where the ex-Mr Incredible and Elastagirl, aka The Parrs, are trying to live ""normal"" lives as a suburban family; with their children - a angsty teenage daughter, a hyperactive young son and a baby. Mr Parr has a dead-end job at an insurance company with a midget of a boss; the two eldest children are having difficulties coping with the pressure of school life, and the tension is starting to cause things to break - literally. Then, suddenly, Mr Incredible is secretly called away to a dangerous mission requiring the work of a superhero again. But everything isn't as cosy as it seems...<br/><br/>In the style of playing a typical sitcom-type domestic drama up against the shenanigans of comic book escapist fantasy and James Bond type adventure, Brad Bird has managed to hit a winning combination that plays to the strengths of both genres without falling for the pitfalls of either mostly. Craig Nelson and Holly Hunter as the voices of the two leads manage a good balance of warmth and strength to their performances. In addition to writing and directing, Brad Bird does additional duties as the voice of the hilarious fashion Meister Edna Mode, with some of the best one-line throw-away situations in the story; and Bird's son Nicholas (who played Squirt in FINDING NEMO) gets to play a young boy watching on the sidelines who acts as a Greek chorus to the domestic situation. And Kevin Smith stalwart Jason Lee has a great role in the obsessed fan who becomes the prime antagonist.<br/><br/>The computer animation has again moved ahead with this film, the water effects (especially with the wet hair) was particularly impressive. I always thought that computer-drawn humans in the past have tended to look very anorexic; but finally they had some muscle added to their figures. And the set detail on the island, which is the stage for most of the action sequences, is very rich and colorful; it seems to be a homage to my fav Bond movie YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE with a bit of the THUNDERBIRDS, FANTASY ISLAND and THE PRISONER thrown into the mix. Plus the comic timing and panache of the whole story really holds the whole thing together - making for one helluva tight movie!<br/><br/>Great fun story, that should hold up for quite a few years. My biggest regret is that the brilliant scene in the initial trailer wasn't included. Oh well, can't win 'em all now - can we?"
"jrfranklin01","9","0","1","16 December 2004"," Incredible(s)!
","After watching this one in the theater I could think of little I was disappointed in. The animation mirrored ""Shrek"" and in some cases I think exceeded it. The story is action-packed with superheros and adds humor in their real-life depictions. <br/><br/>What surprised me is that the film also adds good family values and the usual cartoon programming, yet still delivers on an adult level. Some of you may remember Spielberg's ""Animaniacs"" produced by Warner Brothers. Now that was some great cartoon comedy that satisfied children and adults! I would have to say that ""The Incredibles"" also does a very good job of this. For good cartoon comedy sure to entertain the whole family, watch this one! 9/10"

","Mr Parker writes ""there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen"". Indeed, I went with my 7-yr-old boy and a 9-yr-old friend of him, and definitively: this is *not* a film for children. We were shocked at most by the scenes where the father (Mr Incredible) is being tortured and where the children (Violet and Dash) are attacked with machine-guns among other weapons. I'm sure I'd had enjoyed the film a lot if I wouldn't have gone with two kids. I find it disappointing when nobody warns one, and wanted hereby to let you know my experience and advise you to think it twice before going to The Incredibles with children.<br/><br/>This is not a criticism to the film itself, but to its certification."
"gooeysmoo","10","0","1","14 December 2004"," Great!
","I really enjoyed the movie. Pixar is one of the very few companies that seem to never make a flop. The film has a great script, plot, characters and animation. It is also a tad more serious than other Pixar films and includes some violence, such as corpses of superheroes, people getting sucked in to plane engines and giant robots. It also has more real life issues, such as troubles with the family and law suites and isn't very peachy like other Disney films. I also liked how the characters weren't tanned, slim, muscular characters. Elastigirl wasn't a thin, ditzy girl and Mr. Incredible did not have rippling muscles, which really added to the realism of the film. Other characters such as Frozone, Edna Mode, Violet, Dash and Syndrome are also unique and humorous characters. The film has enough comedy to keep it going, but it also knows when to be serious as well. <br/><br/>I think this film would be better suited for children 10 and over, since it may be too frightening for younger ones. Take your family to see this film and not the snooze fest that is known as the Polar Express (which will probably creep your kids out more than this film will)"
"kirasviking","10","0","1","14 December 2004"," Brilliant; best thing to come out of Hollywood pretty much ever
","The Incredibles is the first movie I've ever seen that is based on a non-contradictory value system. There is no Cinderella story here; instead we have an animated demonstration of what Ayn Rand illustrated in Atlas Shrugged, that it is the men of ability on which the safety and advancement of mankind depend. The characters are well defined and their actions are the logical outcomes of the values they hold. Those with correct, objective values succeed, those without them, fail. There is no sympathy for evil, only admiration for the good. It absolutely astounds me that a fantastic character like Edna (the arrogant, domineering fashion designer) has somehow emerged from Hollywood's, indeed the nation's, culture of moral relativism (I speak from personal experience, being a Californian by birth, not by volition), but it happened and I only wish it would more often."

","Pixar reaches new heights with The Incredibles, which covers the exploits of a superhero brought out of forced retirement, with his family along to boot.<br/><br/>The action scenes are absolutely amazing, especially the scenes involving Dash running from Syndrome's minions--it recalls and actually surpasses the forest scenes from Return Of The Jedi. The scenes where Violet & Dash discover how to harness their powers while running for their lives are very thrilling as well. The voice work is nicely done, and doesn't include the show-offy mega-star stuff that's bringing some of these big animated films down a little (Sarah Vowell is the standout as junior-high age Violet Parr).<br/><br/>The humor is a little more restrained than usual for these Pixar films (Toy Story & Finding Nemo provided more laughter), but the action scenes put this one on a pedestal all its own."

","Pixar has created one gem of computer animation after another, starting with the groundbreaking ""Toy Story."" Their latest, ""The Incredibles,"" is nothing short of a masterpiece! Brad Bird of ""The Iron Giant"" fame is the director.<br/><br/>The story follows Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson, a superhero who loves doing good. Even after he is forced out of the superhero game, he finds it hard to hang up his supersuit. A family man with a dead-end job, he yearns to play the hero again. The cast is excellent, voicing a host of larger-than-life heroic characters. The animation is awe-inspiring, and shows the animation expertise of the Pixar Studios. The story is clever, taking a look at midlife crisis. This is a departure for Pixar, making a feature that appeals to adults so much. This movie should be remembered as Pixar's greatest achievement!"
"Axel-9","8","0","1","5 December 2004"," Exhilarating action-adventure
","With The Incredibles Pixar have made a big departure from their standard story lines of cute critters on a voyage of discovery. With its opening pastiche of 40s comic book serials through to the Bondian stylings of the set and the super heroics of the finale, for me it was clearly aimed as being an action-adventure for the family, more Indiana Jones than Woody and Buzz. As such I think it succeeds wonderfully.<br/><br/>The opening sets the tone with a night in the life of Mr Incredible, as he foils bad guy after bad guy and even saves an elderly woman's cat! It manages to throw in a bit of satirical humour too, as Mr Incredible saves a man attempting suicide, he is thanked with a lawsuit, leading to a surge of lawsuits against crusaders, in a clever dig at ""compensation culture"".<br/><br/>15 years on we find ourselves in the suburban lives of the Parr's, headed by Mr Incredible himself Bob Parr and his wife Helen, formerly Elastigirl, as they pretend to be ""normal"". Seeing Parr at work as a pathetic insurance clerk grounds the movie with a glimpse into the mundane reality of his new life, as he tries (and fails) to forget the glories of his past. There is a Nietzchean undertone to this passage of the story, with a hint of Professor Charles Xavier's school for gifted children and the hounding of masked vigilantes from Watchmen. Why be normal when you can be special, why be a desk clerk when you possess superhuman abilities. The unfairness of having to hide what you really are, whilst being hounded from town to town to hide one's anonymity. He can't even get angry for fear of giving himself away by revealing his super strength. In a philosophical moment, his son Dash, banned from using his super speed, bemoans the fact that if everyone is special then no-one is.<br/><br/>The plot switches up a gear as a mysterious benefactor requests Mr Incredible's help, to subdue a giant robot running amok on his desert island. The classic Bondian set design of genius Ken Adam is strongly evoked by this setting. Mission accomplished Parr soon finds events taking a dangerous turn.<br/><br/>The movie does drag a touch during this section, before the family Incredible team up for the non-stop finale. However we do get the hilarious costume designer Edna Mode to give our ribs a tickle, in a treat of a scene, as she demonstrates the dangers of wearing a cape for superheros. It's actually pretty dark humour, as a succession of heroes are seen in flashback meeting untimely deaths due to their flowing apparel.<br/><br/>In fact there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout, if not of the belly ripping variety, they help keep the mood light. I particularly enjoyed Sam Jackson's Frozone, reminiscing as to how his life was saved by a ""monloguing"" villain. Anyway I feel it's become a trend for movies to have a few set piece moments, either comedic or action packed, to help carry them, something the more evenly enjoyable Incredibles does not do.<br/><br/>Overall I'd probably agree it does not quite enter the class of the Toy Story movies. There perhaps is a certain amount of charm lacking, but that's not to say the characters are dull, far from it. The genial and likable humanity of the Parr's makes that so. It establishes strong central character's by showing them going about there everyday lives and as far as superhero, action-adventure movies go it's all the better for it. Movies like this do or die on whether you care for the characters, and this set are strong enough to sustain the necessary hold on the audience, young and old. It's one the most enjoyable movies I've seen this year, I'd say up there with the web slinger. Overall 8 out of 10."

The second viewing was just as fun as the first in overall entertainment, proving to me that I will own the DVD when it comes out because of the rewatchability value. A lot of great moments of humour, as well as the action you'd expect from a superhero movie. I loved the character interactions in the family dynamics, as well as the character development and growth.

"logician1989","10","0","1","5 December 2004"," Reminds me of Alan Moore's ""Watchmen""
","I enjoyed ""The Incredibles"" thoroughly. The plot was engaging, and the characters were well thought out and vividly portrayed, both in the animation and in the voice performances. The movie deals with complex and yes, realistic problems (e.g.: the frustrations of a husband and father sacrificing his personal aspirations and his sense of mission and purpose for the sake of providing a stable life for his family) in a nuanced and (despite the ""superhero"" element) believable way. The movie deserves high marks all around.<br/><br/>Many other reviewers have said as much, and I add my praise to theirs. But there is an aspect of the movie that I haven't heard comments about elsewhere, and I wanted to point it out. I found in certain elements of ""The Incredibles"" some interesting echoes of Alan Moore's groundbreaking comic series / graphic novel ""The Watchmen"".<br/><br/>SPOILERS (TO BOTH WORKS) FOLLOW! --------------------------------<br/><br/>Both works deal with superheroes living in a world that has rejected super-heroism (or superhero-ism?). In ""The Incredibles"" we hear the term ""supers"", where in Moore's world they are metonymously termed ""masks"". but in both works their status is similar: public backlash against the (unintended, and arguably comparatively minor) bad consequences of the heroes' deeds has led to government suppression and the heroes' forced retirement. Each work revolves around the experiences of a central ex-hero character (Mr. Incredible in ""The Incredibles"", Night Owl in ""The Watchmen"") who is a misfit in his non-heroic life, a man of great potential gone prematurely to seed, chafing under his restrictions and pining for the old days when he could fulfill his real purpose. Each central character has clandestine connections to other ex-heroes, who are his only outlet for genuine friendship because only they can know his true self. Both works feature a female ""spouse"" character who has adapted successfully to the new world order (Elastigirl in ""The Incredibles"", Silk Spectre II in ""The Watchmen"" -- although in that work, intended for adult audiences, the character's role is more complex, since she is both the concubine of the successful post-hero Dr. Manhattan and the paramour of the hopelessly dysfunctional Night Owl). This female character may reminisce nostalgically about the old days but will take no action to revive them until catalyzed (for Elastigirl, by the threat to her family, and for Silk Spectre, by the psychological attack on Dr. Manhattan and the ensuing visit to Mars). I could go on drawing parallels: to avoid arrest and escape the consequences of having performed outlawed super-heroics, even in a good cause, Frozone chooses to incapacitate (harmlessly) a police officer; this is reminiscent of Rorschach's contemptuous refusal to retire, and the rapacious malevolence of the police when they finally apprehend him. Et cetera.... even the endings are similar: in both worlds, there is now a core group of superheroes who have been reactivated and will obviously continue to pursue their mission, while the surrounding society remains ambivalent or even hostile to them. In both worlds, we are left to wonder whether the good deeds the supers/masks do, and the manner in which they do them, makes them heroes or villains (or both).<br/><br/>I am forced to wonder whether Brad Bird was familiar with ""The Watchmen"", and consciously determined to work out the effect that the rules of Alan Moore's imagined world would have for a family of superheroes, or whether the parallels are simply the inevitable result of logically deriving the same consequences from fortuitously similar hypotheses.<br/><br/>I would welcome further analysis from those familiar with both works."

","As far as I can remember, this is the first time that I have (in 30 years of my life) seen a film twice at the cinema. While both times enjoying it equally. From the moment the film starts, to the moment it ends, is entertainment and filmaking at it's best. Digital or otherwise.<br/><br/>I have been a follower of pixar from its very early roots in Red's Dream, Tin toy and such, and they have always demonstrated the very best in Computer animation. But where they excel is creating fluid characters which move with expression and feeling, allowing the viewer to believe them. The Incredibles is really the fruit of years of labour in this field, and believe me, at times there is a real emotional connection between these digital 'actors' and the audience, not least in the young girl of the family.<br/><br/>From the purely technical standpoint, this film roars. I've never seen anything like it. The blending of brain melting fabric, hair, skin, fat and muscle simulation with fluid animation and some of the best set dressing and art direction ever seen in film, seamlessly melts together with story telling dramatics to create simple perfection. Brad Bird who directed (and also voiced the scene stealing 'Edna Mode), should be up on the stage come Oscar time, for best film, not simply best animated film. To best describe this, after seeing the film, I was describing the characters as he and she as they were actors and saying comments as ""did you see when he came up close to the camera"", camera?? he?? it's really that believable.<br/><br/>On another note, the new Disney film, which is Directed once more by our hero 'John laster; Looks absolutely terrible. lets hope it's not after this tour de force. While the Short film 'Bounding' which is before the feature, is Dull and demonstrates no clear technical advancements.<br/><br/>See on Digital projection if you can.<br/><br/>of course... 10 out of 10."
"filmbuff-36","9","0","1","2 December 2004"," PIXAR continues to prove its skill with this exciting, thought-provoking superhero cartoon
","It would seem impossible for an animated film to successfully combine family quarrels, mid-life crises and living in a world that squelches excellence along with the exploits of superheroes, but somehow, Pixar's 'The Incredibles' manages to get it done, and done right.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible's life is in shambles. Driven underground along with the rest of the Earth's champions, he is forced to live incognito in a world where superheroism has for all intents and purposes been criminalized due to excessive lawsuits from people claiming to have been harmed by their exploits. Using his alter ego Bob Parr (voice of Craig T. Nelson), Mr. Incredible now works as an insurance claims adjuster.<br/><br/>His wife Helen, the superheorine Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter) has been rendered a stay-at-home mom, looking after their superpowered offspring Dash (voice of Spencer Fox), who can run at superspeed, and Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), who can turn invisible and create forcefields. They are all being smothered in the suburban setting, forced to hide their powers and accept life in an increasingly mediocre world.<br/><br/>That is until Mr. Incredible is contacted by a mysterious woman named Mystique, who is in need of a superhero. Deciding to relive his glory days, he sneaks behind his family's back to do super deeds. Helen becomes suspicious, but discovers too late what her husband has been doing. It seems a supervillain named Syndrome (voice of Jason Lee) has been behind the plot to get Mr. Incredible active again. She heads out to rescue her husband, but must also contend with her children who have snuck aboard her plane.<br/><br/>As far as a superhero story goes, 'The Incredibles' is downright amazing. Every cliché is covered, from the island lair to the cackling villain who was a former admirer of the superhero, however they are all dealt with in such a snappy manner that one doesn't really care that it has been done before.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this isn't just a movie about a family of superheroes, it's about family bonding as well. It expertly handles the mid-life crisis angle, having Bob and Helen both feeling stifled. Bob's desire to relive his youth puts him at odds with his family, and he must decide what is more important to him.<br/><br/>Sometimes fantasy can touch on social commentary better than most drama does, and 'The Incredibles' does that fine as well. The filmmakers use the plot as a clever ploy to make some sharp comments on American culture. Such as how excellence is routinely suppressed in favor of conformity, with everyone being forced to lower their standards out of fear of self-esteem damage to the less gifted. Bob remarks at one point 'They're constantly finding new ways to celebrate mediocrity,' and one can't help but nod in agreement.<br/><br/>The voice acting is top notch, with Nelson providing the right tone to suggest both an overstressed white-collar drone as well as a superstrengthed champion of justice. Hunter brings a surprisingly nuanced performance to her character Helen, and manages to handle both the mom and superheroine duties effectively. Lee is wonderfully sadistic in the villain role, reminding us of his smarminess in Kevin Smith's films. Fox and Vowell bring life to their characters as well, which is commendable among actors their age, and Samuel L. Jackson is funny as Mr. Incredible's ice shooting superhero friend Frozone.<br/><br/>Pixar has really outdone themselves this time, bringing moviegoers a film that is, well, incredible. While it's not quite as good as 'Finding Nemo,' what movie could be? It's action-packed, suspenseful, and full of positive family values, plus it's just a hoot to watch. 'The Incredibles' will appeal to anyone with a hero inside of them."

","Pixar have always had a very adult feel to their movies. The balance has always been quite good between the parts of the film for the kids and the parts of the film for the grown ups. The balance for the incredibles is much more in favour of the adults and I can imagine many kids getting a bit restless especially in the first half of the film.<br/><br/>As for the adults this is excellent fayre and slightly darker than what we are used to from Pixar. The super heroes are retired from duty after having a few bad days at the office and have to live through the problems that everybody copes with such as tedious jobs. One of the real oddities in modern cinema is how many of the best characterisations are animated.

","I am in awe of the Pixar animation studio. As a hobbyist animator I can really appreciate the amazing effort that's gone into this movie, and it shows in every frame and every scene. This is the best Pixar movie to date, and undoubtedly their most adult too, featuring no cutesy talking animals and a fair bit of menace and mania from the main villain.<br/><br/>Top prizes must go to the designers for coming up with all the Dr Evil style Bond gear used on the Volcanic island and elsewhere, it's a delight just to watch the stuff working so well on screen. The waterfall scene and the underwater landing were particular favourites, worthy of live action movies.<br/><br/>The cinematography too, the best in a mainstream animation yet, really adds to the mature feel of the movie and just looks gorgeous. Final element has to be the music, which in many scenes just make you think you're watching Our Man Flint or a Bond film. I don't know if you can tell but I loved every second of those sequences.<br/><br/>Cinema fans will spot a ton of in-jokes, references and blatant rip-offs that just add to the fun. The voice acting throughout is great, with Samuel L Jackson once again being Samuel L Jackson in a movie, which is just fine by me. Frankly I'd like to have seen more of him, but what there was made me grin like an idiot. Craig Nelson suits the part to a tee, hell he even looks a bit like his character, and of course Elastigirl gets Holly Hunters sexy southern belle drawl. Mmm.<br/><br/>There you have it, it looks great, sounds great and gives real entertainment for 120 minutes of anybodys time. It gets a nine out of ten from me at least, and ten out of ten for the guys who designed the meshes for the sets and vehicles. How I wish I'd though of some of that stuff..."

","It is a laughter fest! High speed animated action at its best!!<br/><br/>This movie makes fun of the legal/compensation culture in our world today. Conveys emotions like frustration and anger and passion quite vividly!! It is a little bit like the original Shrek(made fun of every possible fairy tale) - this movie successfully makes fun of our lives today and yet manages to deliver the basics of human emotions in a very accurate way.<br/><br/>I loved every moment of this movie - someone said that maybe they could have made the movie shorter but while watching it, I never felt as if the movie was dragging on unlike Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>My favourite characters have to be Edna Mode and Dash. Edna is shown as a fashion designer who is eccentric to say the least. Dash is just brilliantly funny oh and brave!I also loved the little Tricycle guy - only 3 appearances though - so the directorial team have done a great job at not over-using the characters. This enables the characters to have the desired effect and punch!!<br/><br/>This movie also shows something that the watchers of superhero flicks are probably not used to like - Mr. Incredible worrying about his physical shape and then working out like a boxer who has been out of action for a long time - that was definitely a typical guy - I want good body definition moment :) . Elastigirl looking at her rear-end in a oh very human and womanly moment!<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who needs to inject a little bit of laughter into their lives because you can forget your troubles while watching this great flick.<br/><br/>Definitely the best animated movie of the year - by far!!"

","I'm now convinced that Pixar can do no wrong and Disney will rue the day they didn't offer Jobs a hundred bazillion dollars to buy his top shelf animation studio. That said, 'The Incredibles' is probably one of the finest family pictures available. <br/><br/>It's refreshing to watch a family movie that actually portrays a ~complete~ family. Witness the <gasp> stay-at-home-mom bathing, feeding and generally raising her children while the dad <shudder> singularly shoulders the responsibility of bringing home the bacon (a cliché' mentioned in the movie). Behold the 2 parent family dealing with their problems...TOGETHER! And Dash, Mr. Incredible's super son, giddy with excitement, actually exclaims at one point ""I love our family!"" Can you imagine that? Unbelievable!<br/><br/>The film's one point that really grabbed me is our society's obsession with celebrating mediocrity. Have you noticed how some schools have eliminated grades altogether for fear of damaging some poor kid's self esteem? Apparently, children today can no longer play dodge ball on our school playgrounds (God forbid we eliminate the weak players and one kid truly stands out in the end) and soccer/baseball/football games are no longer scored (You're ALL winners!). This is unfair to not only the best athletes who otherwise may be weak performers in the classroom but it also robs the weaker kids the chance to truly lose. If you never lose, there's no need to improve. The movie addresses this new way of coddling (and hindering) our kids quite effectively. Let's not 'kid' ourselves - our children keep score even when we don't. They know who won. Oh, and being picked last for the kickball team is OK. Really, it is. <br/><br/>In all, the entire presentation, from Bud Luckey's opening short ""Boundin'"" to Brad Birds' story (I'm glad he dropped the blatant anti-gun message) of family, sacrifice and cooperation is Pixar's best work to date. The action & story is riveting and the voice acting, as usual, is 100% spot on and perfectly cast. Even if you don't have kids you owe it to yourself to check out this outstanding movie. Rating = 10"

","Written and directed by: Brad Bird<br/><br/>Featuring the voices of: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, Wallace Shawn, Elizabeth Peña <br/><br/>There was a time when superheroes were in vogue. In those days, you could count on the likes of Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson), Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to get things right. But when the people they had saved became unhappy with their presence, they filed a lawsuit against them, forcing them to live normal family lives.<br/><br/>15 years later, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, now known as Bob and Helen Parr, are married with three children, two of whom have definitely inherited Mum and Dad's powers. Boring old Bob is struggling to hold on to his day job, so when a call from a mysterious stranger (Elizabeth Peña) alerts him to the possibility of using his powers again, it is an opportunity he cannot pass up...<br/><br/>Pixar's latest offering does almost everything right. The animation is wonderful without being show-offy, the voice casting is as good as, if not better than, ever before, and the story is incredibly enthralling and sometimes very funny. Nearly three years ago, I labeled Monsters, Inc. a mixture of ""drama, comedy and action which will please both kids and adults."" That is what all of the Pixar films have been, and The Incredibles fits that description perfectly. More of the same, perhaps, but as the saying goes, why change a winning formula?<br/><br/>Yet, incredibly (no pun intended) enough, Pixar have deviated slightly from their more traditional formula involving the linear ""buddy story"". One could be forgiven for thinking that Quentin Tarantino was an inspiration here - The Incredibles might not squeeze the strongest emotional response from its audience, but it's one of the slickest pastiches I've seen recently.<br/><br/>That's right, I used the word pastiche. Elements of Spy Kids, Thunderbirds, James Bond, Indiana Jones, X-Men, Superman and Spider-Man will all come to mind at some point or another when you watch this film. While the various homages are hardly subtle - indeed, it's worth wondering if certain cynics will view these homages as thefts - the film is enjoyable enough to stand on its own. The writer-director, Brad Bird (who was responsible for the sadly unappreciated The Iron Giant) recognises that the best superhero films are funny, human and kinetic. That's much more important than just flashes and bangs on their own, although rest assured, action fans, there are plenty of those. As a result, this is Pixar's most violent offering to date, explaining the PG certificate. Don't worry, though - Pixar are too clever to go all Bruckheimer on us. The only problem with all of this cartoon violence is that in the post-9/11 world, it might not be seen as appropriate for a family film. Thankfully, Bird knows better than to focus too heavily on it.<br/><br/>The Incredibles works very well for what it is. It's not as wholly satisfying as Toy Story, or even as funny, poignant or universally acceptable as the likes of Monsters, Inc. or Finding Nemo. But it does maintain Pixar's usual high standard of animation, whilst simultaneously providing perfect family entertainment for all but the youngest kids - and it shows that the studio are willing to take themselves in new directions.<br/><br/>Rating: **** (out of *****)"
"antialias11","9","0","1","3 December 2004"," Why this movie is fun...
","Is it the fact that it has an excellent Bond-esque soundtrack? No. Is it the fact that the action is non stop? No. Is it the fact that it has such a neat story and such lifelike characters that you hardly gawk at the pretty pictures and think to yourself ""Wow, neat computer graphics!""? No. Is it the countless homages and allusions within the movie? No. Well what is it?<br/><br/>To me its the fact the people at Pixar do something special. Other movie companies (especially Disney) seem to go out and ask people what they find funny. They seem to do surveys on laughs, clocking competitors movies for laughs per minute, and then average it out - trying to find some common denominator in 'funny' and generally doing 'humor by committee' - and consequently totally missing the point about what makes people laugh.<br/><br/>Humor is the unexpected. The extraordinary that wrenches our brain into surprising directions. Pixar people seem to just put in there what makes themselves laugh - without worrying if it is politically incorrect or unsuitable for the target audience. If it fits the mood it's stuck in. Maybe they will not reach such a wide audience (PG rating) but they surely create classics that way which will have a big payoff in the long run. Somehow this total identification of the makers with the humor is transferred to the effort put into animating the characters - giving them just the right kind of attitude and mimics because the people that animate them know exactly how the characters are thinking. They seem to have as much fun making the movie as we have watching it. <br/><br/>The result is the difference between a factory made pie and one made by grandma. Both may contain the same ingredients and be made by the same method, but one is made with love and one is made by machines - it shows in the detail, and registers with the audience. <br/><br/>Thank you Pixar for -yet again- an excellent movie that lets me forget all the mediocre garbage from your competitors I have watched the past year.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"

","""The Incredibles"" is a rollicking movie that adults can enjoy without cover of children. <br/><br/>The illustration of the basic set up of super heroes driven into suburban hiding is very clever, though it does borrow a bit from similar issues explored both for humor and seriousness in the TV series about young Superman/Clark Kent ""Smallville."" <br/><br/>While it does drag from time to time, particularly as the battle with the villain becomes a tad conventional for the genre, it's a lot of fun. The references to other movies, especially to James Bond villains and ""Star Wars,"" are fun to pick out, and I'm sure I missed other references to comic books and their movie permutations. I haven't seen any of the ""Spykids"" films, but the climax seemed similar to those. <br/><br/>The voice-overs are terrific, particularly Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson as the parent superheroes and Jason Lee as their nemesis. <br/><br/>The dueling for the last word in the credits between Disney and Pixar is amusing, given their contractual negotiations. How nice not to have any schmaltzy songs inflicted upon us in an animated feature!<br/><br/>The preceding Pixar short about a shorn lamb shown with the movie was corny and unoriginal, both in story and execution."
"flipflopfetish","4","0","7","2 December 2004"," failed attempt
","I was pretty disappointed when I went to see The Incredibles, and I think the audience agreed with me. We all laughed and clapped enthusiastically at the short, but at the end of the film, not only was there no clapping, but there were many grumblings. And this was an audience of mostly adults; this was late into the film's theater time. The problem of The Incredibles, I think, was that it was geared towards older people. In Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc, and Toy Story, the attraction was that we were watching a kid's film. There was no sex, mid-life crisis, or other icky adult seriousness. That is what I was expecting in The Incredibles, and I was surprised and disappointed when it was different. The change of audience wasn't the only bad thing about The Incredibles. The ending strongly reminded me of the ending of Lord of the Rings. Much, much too long. One (at least me and my friends) would think, in this type of movie, that Mr. Incredible would defeat the monster, he and his wife would reunite passionately, not sappily, superheroes would be back in business, and maybe as an afterthought the baby would begin to show signs of powers (but not in a huge long thing with the weird kid who used to be known as IncrediBoy). But there were monsters, monsters, and more monsters. The movie ended in an unresolved conflict which is actually really good in some movies. Also, there was just way too much fighting and running and weird, cheesy names."

"CustardChucker","Null","0","2","1 December 2004"," The Simpsons save the world.
","If only Bart or Homer Simpson knew they had super powers, they could solve all problems instead of getting pushed from pillar to post. <br/><br/>There are some philosophical leanings in the film, but either you discover these or they slip past your still-evolving mind. It's not laid on too thick, heavy-handed-fashion like Finding Nemo. We are nudged in a direction by the Good Ship Disney. Admittedly, the action is so fast, you will miss many scene details, but I think it does rival Shrek 2 in inter-weaving pastiches of classic films to appeal to hardened sci-fi fans. Shrek 2 also embarked on a dabble in reworking nursery rhyme characters in bizarre situations. I think you noticed that. <br/><br/>Mr Incredible is like a character from the British comic 'The Dandy' who ate cow pies called Desperate Dan. To say he is chisel-jawed is like saying Shrek is green. <br/><br/>In the showing of the film, in the middle, someone a row or so behind was fast asleep and had started snoring for England. <br/><br/>The humour in the action sequences did remind a bit of Road Runner, and sometimes you expected a little diagram to pop up saying<br/><br/>'ACME Industries - Top Secret, Mk 5 Space Transporter'. Isn't the son Dash another form of Road Runner?<br/><br/>I think if you substituted 'Watching football down the pub' with Bob Parr's nightly eavesdropping of Police radio transmissions, many women would empathise. <br/><br/>The film is about women doing two things at once, under-achieving jobs that do not give you full rein for your talents, annoying kids, husbands who miss the importance of their family, and reaching your true potential. After leaving university, I did a soul-destroying job, and using your talents was a dirty word. Some bosses deliberately subdue their staff to make themselves appear more capable as human beings, when that is the precise opposite.<br/><br/>The animation is the canine's conkers. Superlative artwork. It has the advantage over live-action films in that it can play with the laws of physics much more. I saw the Thunderbirds film a few months ago, and it has similarities with The Incredibles, except that quality and storyline did a nose dive. The bird playing Lady Penelope was a bit of a heart throb, and worth one in the sack.<br/><br/>Pixar are the Rolls Royce of animation films. They understand quality like no one else."

With a brilliant blend of James Bond, Marvel Comics, and a jazzy soundtrack(I'm buying it for Christmas), this movie captivates the audience through a wonderfully twisting plot.

I'm surprised by the direction of Brad Bird. This was a great film unlike Iron Giant. This film had the perfect blend of timing, sound, and humor involved that has helped us enjoy cartoon series such as The Simpsons and Family Guy. Maybe that ex-Simpsons experience has finally paid off for him. In addition, this film is perfectly timed for the holiday season to give audiences Pixar's version of the comic book adventure that audiences are craving today. Big T gives it a 94/100."

","Computer Generated animation doesn't thrill people as much as it used to. Any local podunk advertising agency can make them, and has. Innovators such as Pixar have helped keep Disney afloat since the 1990's, but the recent rift between the two companies has put movies like ""The Incredibles"" at risk of never seeing the light of day. Fortunately, there's still the chance of seeing it in the theaters as of this writing. For me, this wasn't the only reason to see it though. Two other reasons were that the trailers simply looked hilarious, and that one member of the sound crew(Dan Wallin) also did work on one of my favorite movies of the 1960's -- UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE(1967)! That was it, I was sold.<br/><br/>Bob Parr(Craig T. Nelson) is Mr. Incredible, a former superhero who like many others faced an onslaught of public hostility for unintended consequences of trying to save people's lives, and has to be put under government protection. Luckily he has someone to fall back on, like Elasti-girl(Holly Hunter), who he marries and makes into Helen Parr. Fifteen years later, Bob has three kids, a job as an insurance adjuster, the urge to do good, and the knowledge that he has to keep his powers under wraps. Two of his kids know they have powers as well. Violet(Sarah Vowell) who looks like Winona Ryder in the late-1980's, only uses her invisibility to dodge a boy she has a crush on, but otherwise could do without them. Dash(Spencer Fox) who can't wait to join the track team, because he knows that with his super-speed he'll kick butt. Little baby-boy Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers, or at least the Parr family doesn't think he does.<br/><br/>At night the former Mr. Incredible spends his time with his old buddy Lucius Best, a.k.a. Frozone(Samuel L. Jackson) where they listen to a police scanner in one of their cars and secretly perform heroic deeds in town. After witnessing a mugging he's not allowed to prevent while being lectured by his boss for actually helping customers, he decides enough is enough. And it's at that moment that he's hired on a secret mission to stop a killer robot. What he doesn't know is that the person who hired him on that mission, Syndrome(Jersey Trilogy veteran Jason Lee), created that robot and is a villain who used to idolize him when he was a boy until he was rejected as his boy wonder. From that point on, Elasti-girl and other heroes are called up again to save their father/husband and stop Syndrome from a fiendish plot, which does NOT involve taking over the world. I won't spoil that plot for you, or the ending, but I will say I would've like it better if Syndrome had suffered a different fate at the end, one which has to do with the hazards of capes for superhero costumes, something which the costume designer of the superheroes, and part-time normal fashion designer, Edith Head look-alike Edna Mode(voiced by writer/director Brad Bird) tries to warn Bob about when he seeks his new costume. Oh, that and it'll go down in animation history for both it's humor and it place in the Disney/Pixar chain."

","As the year of 2004 comes to an end it's OK to say that we had a generally good movie year. None the less, it's not over 'till it's over, and Pixar newbie Brad Bird is fighting for the years best movie. Big titles that we're really disappointing such as 'Troy' and 'Spider-man 2' could never live up to the very high expectations the audience had, none the less, they seemed to do big at the box office, I for one can speak freely and say, I've seen a lot of big budget crap this year. Movies that we're actually quite original like 'Van Helsing' where killed straight away by pro-critics. Maybe it lacked in script, but it payed out double maybe even triple when we check out the CGI that was created. However, nothing could completely satisfy my needs and expectations. I guess I just want to much on screen for the miserable 150miljon dollars, right?<br/><br/>I felt this way basically most of the time when I saw a big movie. OK, it wasn't all bad, but I wanted something extra. If a complete feature length movie can be as good as the trailer, I will be satisfied and guess what, 'The Incredibles' pull it of. I'll say even more, it gave me a complete 120minute during thrill throughout my whole body, and when I left the teathre, my mouth was still open. I just couldn't believe what I saw. The plot is as well formed as the characters developed. But and here is where the huge BUT comes in when we go and see a movie like this, we expect to be blown away by the graphics. And that's exactly what happened. I just can't comprehend what I witnessed during the whole film. It's amazingly exiting and fast. It contains look-a-like scenes from all the major films, but in stat of just doing it OK, it does everything better. To name one, the tree chase with Dash is simply outstanding.<br/><br/>Without any doubt, Pixar studio's has not only raised the bar animation wise, but this film will make us expect more from movies in general. This one has it all, and there's absolutely nothing that could have made it even better than it already is. I give it a big 11/10 and make a wish upon a star for sequels.<br/><br/>Pixar, thanks a million! You are well worthy of your 8euro's admission!!!"

I found the film entertaining but it just didn't pull me in like the previously mentioned Pixar films did. Nevertheless, The Incredibles has many good points. <br/><br/>Like every other Pixar film, the animation is stunning. Pixar has not done any backsliding here yet. The Incredibles looks just as great if not even more so than the other films. The locations vary from streets of a city, underwater, and on a tropical island. They all look equally impressive.<br/><br/>Two other strengths of The Incredibles are the action sequences and the humor. There is much more action here than any other Pixar film but the action scenes are thrilling and expertly done. The humor can be hilarious. The best jokes involve Mr. Incredible and his ultra-small car(at least for his size). <br/><br/>The vocal work is a little mixed. Craig T. Nelson does a solid job as Mr. Incredible. He makes him a larger-than-life character with enough human qualities to capture our sympathy. However, it takes too long for Holly Hunter to lose herself in the character. For a while, all I saw was an animated character with Hunter's voice, not Elastigirl. Samuel L. Jackson fares better but Jason Lee is no better than adequate as the villain. The actors who did the kids voice did a sub-par job. The kids were interminably annoying(especially Violet).<br/><br/>The Incredibles is also at least 15 minutes too long. It really starts to drag near the end and some trimming would have really helped out. Nevertheless, I do recommend the film.

The element of satire is somewhat abandoned.<br/><br/>In order to pad out my comments to at least five lines of writing, let's look at (or listen to) the soundtrack. Why is the music more evocative of James Bond than superheros? 007 May be classified as a super hero in this case only because he does manage to survive physical acts that would kill most people, but that is a movie convention more than a power. Also, I suppose the trope of the ""monologing"" villain allowing the hero to survive is less a super hero thing than an action movie or Bond issue."

But during the second half, things really picked up. The action was much more ubiquitous, with some of the most eye-popping scenes in animation. Scenes that made one forget that the movie was animated, which is basically the point of the Pixar animators.<br/><br/>But because of the slow first half, this movie didn't charm me as much as previous Pixar films had effortlessly done. In fact, the difference between the two halves of the movie is so stark it almost seems as if two directors were responsible for the movie. <br/><br/>There are also a few emotionally strong scenes that your youngest kidlets might not be too fond of, aside from the cartoon violence. There is a scene in which Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl argue loudly, a scene that might hit a little close to home for some children. And because animation is looking more and more realistic, it may be more difficult for kids to see this as a cartoon rather than a live-action movie, to a certain degree, so even scenes of typical cartoon-superhero violence might be a little intense. As it is, this is Pixar's first PG-rated movie, so be warned."

","There is something about Pixar that puts them above all the rest. As much as I loved the two ""Shrek"" films, Pixar just seems to bring things to a different level that puts Dreamworks feeling envious. ""The Incredibles"" is not only about being a superhero, it's about how to deal with the hazards of being a superhero, esp. when you no longer can carry out the task. Bob Parr is Mr Incredible, and when a mishap leads to the courts ridding the world of superheros, Bob must take an ordinary day job pushing pencils. He's married to Elastigirl and they have 3 kids who are just learning their powers.<br/><br/>Fifteen years have passed and Bob is getting a bit itchy. He's bored with his work and wants to fight crime again. After being lured into a case, Bob realizes that the whole thing is a set-up and part of a devious plan to take over the world and to create a new super human race. It's always about that, isn't it. <br/><br/>The movie plays out as sort of an animated Bond movie, with evil female henchman, giant rocket ships, secret island hide-outs, and the music is very retro. It looks great. All the characters are shot very cartoon-like so it would play out to a wide audience and not just an animated action film. It's very funny in places esp. a montage of all the mishaps of why superheros shouldn't wear a cape. That's great stuff. <br/><br/>If the movie has any flaws is that it's too long and drags in many places. A good editing job couldn't hurt. But the movie works in many ways and credit Brad Bird who made the under-appreciated film, ""Iron Giant"" for bringing these fun characters to life. (***1/2)"

A lot of movies now days, cartoons in particular, have a problem with creating three dimensional characters, but once again Disney didn't let me down. The development of characters, I think, is unbelievable. To watch Bob go from the best in his life to the lowest point he can and back is amazing.

When I did, I felt like slapping myself for ever thinking such bad thoughts before!<br/><br/>This has got to be Pixar's best movie ""yet."" The storyline alone is good enough to get me to see it again. But the life-like characters, the acting, the animation, all of it is priceless. (I'm not gonna waste time telling you the story). The humor is for everyone. I just laughed at so many points in the movie. I do believe this movie is for family, but don't let your tods see it. I can bet that they would be scared of it, with how much fighting and violence they would put into it. I have heard of men wanting to buy it when it comes to VHS and DVD because of the ""family man"" humor by Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson). I would recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Though I cant say this is my most favorite movie of all time, it is definitely the best animation film I have ever seen.

","I would say this movie is Pixar's best animation movie yet. The artistry in this movie will absolutely knock your block off.

It is about a world that has legislated away the need for superheroes and implemented a ""superhero protection agency"" that lets them blend into society. It's similar to the X-Men story, but with a sense of humor. One of the messages of the film is a personal favorite, and one I've ascribed to for years: ""If everyone is special, then no one really is"".<br/><br/>I was really surprised at how this movie scratched my James Bond itch rather than my superhero itch. The comparisons are unmistakable.<br/><br/>It's the most staggeringly beautiful homage to 1960s modern design and architectural ethos ever made. The leotard designer, Edna Mode's (Edith Head?) home was a masterpiece of mid century modernism. The cars, buildings and especially the bad guy's secret island fortress are the perfect tribute to production designer Ken Adam (all the 60s James bond movies, Dr. Strangelove). This movie deserves the Production Design award.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is the best soundtrack yet. So many have tried to knock off the John Barry vibe, but no one has done it so well, and with such a sly wink. Brilliant!<br/><br/>There is no way that this movie is for little kids.

","Pixar has already shown a propensity to place story and humor over digital gimmickry, but this time they've managed to find a tremendous balance between the two with The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Brad Bird's story about a family rediscovering itself is well executed if not unpredictable, but the humanity of the characters is unmistakable. Perhaps more scene-stealing however is the subtlety of movement in the character's acting. Clearly the animators have been doing lots of people watching because these people move and gesture in such small and true ways its almost thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>Digital movie making is pretty hit and miss. Basically Pixar hits and everyone else misses but this time they've really done themselves proud. Brad Bird's collaboration with Pixar produces a document of film-making excellence. Would that other animators could find the soul and depth of a Pixar movie, never mind the comedy. Finding Nemo and now this. <br/><br/>Digital acting took a colossal step forward with Andy Serkis' performance in the Lord of the Rings. In that one, the animators took Serkis out and left his intent on screen.

"japamo","Null","0","1","15 November 2004"," With great power comes great fun (finally!)
","For decades the predominant theme of the superhero universe is that possessing super powers is an angst-ridden burden fraught with eternal peril, lack of remuneration, and worst of all, an ungrateful public. The Marvel pantheon has promulgated that realistic but dispiriting notion through almost all its characters (notably the Hulk, Spiderman, the Thing, and especially the X-Men) to such a pervasive degree that DC Comics, home to the uplifting ""god"" Superman, had to follow suit. Superman, formerly invincible and infallible, also became lacerated with multiple vulnerabilities, inhibitions, and doubts. Again, this realistic approach is compelling and not a minor contributor to ""Spiderman""'s and ""Spiderman 2""'s success. But c'mon, if you had a super power, ANY super power, wouldn't you go to town?<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" answers this question with an exuberant ""yes!"". I will not dwell upon the movies many immaculate virtues, since other posters have already done a thorough job of that. I wish to emphasize that ""The Incredibles"" succeeds to a large degree by inverting the above-mentioned Marvel superhero theory and ""regressing"" back to the 50's and 60's and reminding us that, in the final analysis, being a superhero is @#$%^ great. Bob Parr (aka. Mr. Incredible) revels in his abilities and his responsibility to humanity. Unlike with Spiderman, et. al., his powers are not a curse but an unadulterated blessing and his raison d'etre. Unlike Spiderman, et. al. he does not want to be a normal member of the hoi polloi herd, to be equal to them. He wants to be, and is, different, and better. That's why his speedster son Dash (a.k.a. Dashiel's) remark that ""when everyone is special, no one is"" resonates and does Mr. Incredible's astounded reaction to the requirement to have a 4th grade graduation. Mr. Incredible was atrophying in Conformityville; to survive, he had to put on the tights.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" is thus not a scathing satire of superheroes, save for a few jabs at Mr. Incredible's spare tire, and Ms. Mode's expostulation and montage on the dangerous absurdity of cape (which Syndrome apparently did not hear or heed by the way). It treats them with respect, and not just Mr. Incredible. As the movie unfolds, it progresses from a stately (perhaps slow) state of domesticity and family to a crescendo of Action with a capital A. The movie is a burgeoning breath of freedom. Of course, ""The Incredibles"" just acknowledge and juxtapose super heroism with reality (at least the reality of tortuous lawsuits, oppressive ""Dilbertseque"" corporate workplaces, and the unpleasantness of adolescence through Dash and Violet). But throughout the movie, it gloriously breaks free, and so do Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, and Violet!<br/><br/>The only ""flaw"" I could perceive in ""The Incredibles"" is its somewhat derivative nature and amalgamated blend of every superhero, James Bond, Spy Kids, and Powerpuff Girls movie and episode ever made. Good for the movie! I eagerly await the family's next adventure and perhaps the obligatory ""origin stories"". I know it will continue to keep the proceedings fun.<br/><br/>A few random observations:<br/><br/>1. Mr. Incredible has his foibles (his expanded abdomen, his initial neglect of his family, and his occasional Buzz Lightyearesque imperiousness), but he is no buffoon and no joke by any stretch of the imagination. His family is recognizably human but quite laudable.<br/><br/>2. In an early scene in the movie, just before Mr. Incredible in his younger days confronts Bomb Voyage, the illumination hitting his old suit makes him look like Green Lantern.<br/><br/>3. The Omnidroids Mr. Incredible and family battle resemble a cross between Dr. Octopus's tentacles and a bathysphere.<br/><br/>4. Brad Bird must be a Fantastic Four fan!<br/><br/>5. Evangelical Christians will probably be aghast at Baby Jack-Jack's climactic encounter with Syndrome (which got the loudest cheer from the audience I was involved in).<br/><br/>6. Though spawned by frustrated geeky fan-boy aspirations, I thought Syndrome made a formidable and even occasionally sympathetic villain, channeling the Joker and an evil Mask (as well as, ahem, Heat Miser of course).<br/><br/>7. One cannot trademark a superpower.<br/><br/>8. I wonder if Marvel will contract with Pixar to do a comic rendition of ""The Incredibles"".<br/><br/>9. Apparently Mr. Incredible possesses strength in the ""Class 100"" range, easily able to bench over 100 tons. But does he possess other powers. He cannot fly under his own power, but is he invulnerable, have optic and auditory powers, etc.? What are the extent of his family's abilities.<br/><br/>10. I'm glad the Parr's did not have a super-powered pooch or other pet a la Krypto, unless that comes up in the sequel.<br/><br/>11. The PG rating is warranted. Pre-preteeners will find the movie by turns a bit too intense and slow-going, as the occasional infantile whines in my movie audience can attest to. Savvy adults and older teenagers will probably enjoy the movie the most!<br/><br/>12. Despite Bush's re-election, ""The Incredibles"" may signal the advent of a new age, where superherodom is a serious business, but also such a rush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Overall rating, by the way: 9.5! :D"

But to his avail he is stuck at a wishy washy job living in the suberbs. But everything changes after he is contacted by the mysterious Mirage who, by offering him a chance to be the superhero once more, takes him to an island to defeat a killer robot. His wife (Helen Parr/Elasticgirl) starts becoming suspecious and attempts to locate her husband which causes him to be captured. <br/><br/>Realizing her husband is in great danger she leaves her two kids (Violet and 'Dash') home to go save him. The story then continues onward as the kids sneak aboard. I'm not going to say anymore about the story so I don't give it away. But this is a truly great movie, not just because of the main story line, but also because of the underlying story. The story of how a family is starting to fall apart, but grows stronger through helping each other. The movie is also pretty dark and mature, some scenes were a big step from Pixar. And while some scenes were humorous, the movie was actually much more of a drama that you know weren't made for the tykes. <br/><br/>Another thing that sets this film apart from other movie is the detailed animation. You can tell that Pixar poured their hearts and soul in making this movie, it is simply a great looking movie. The settings feel and act like the mid-60's while some elements have a not-to-distant feel to it.<br/><br/>All in all this will be a smash hit in theaters and will definitely be on my top buy list for my DVD collection.<br/><br/>5 stars outta 5"

","When my four-year-old granddaughter Addison repeated a line from 'The Incredibles' about the harrowing adventure being the best vacation ever, I knew I had seen a true animation winner. Talk about 'family values,' and no, I have not turned neocon. The best animation of the year is 'The Incredibles,' a Pixar Studios ('Finding Nemo') adventure about a family of superheroes that stays together by doing what they do best, making life miserable for bad guys. Although 'Spy Kids' did a credible job of suggesting family unity to be the sanity solution to a fragmenting world, 'The Incredibles' soars beyond that film to teach lessons pleasantly, unobtrusively, but powerfully, like its titular family.<br/><br/>Writer/director Brad Bird ('Iron Giant') has laced humor, both visual and cerebral, with kinetic adventure to please kids who like to see fast vehicles and naughty pranks give into sentimental codas about love and cooperation. As for the adults, when was the last time you enjoyed an intelligent treatment of the middle-age crisis more than 'About Schmidt' with Jack Nicholson? The nicely layered 'Incredibles' tale attacks modernist notions about socializing children into underachieving in order to reach a silly equilibrium as it at the same time exalts the emerging persona's of individual family members embracing their unique strengths.<br/><br/>Along the way is the torment of a middle-aged, overweight Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr endangering his marriage by moonlighting his heroics after the family had agreed to retire from the business, and Mrs. Parr (formerly 'Plastigirl') regretting her ample rear end. The film exemplifies Dickens's notion that 'accidents will occur in the best regulated families.' Although the denouement goes as expected, the thrills, humor, and goodness transcend anything the current culture police try to force on the American public.<br/><br/>Andre Maurois in 'The Art of Living' expressed well the 'Incredibles' subtext that defies uniformity: 'The leveling influence of mediocrity and the denial of the supreme importance of the mind's development account for many revolts against family life.'"

","In general movie fans, the public at large is already very-well-aware of the ""retro""-influences on 21st Century American Films... nobody need point out the fact that 'Incredibles' follows suit. We are a nation of commercialism and various forms of capitalistic endeavors, and (I really needn't point out the most obvious) the fact that Disney/Pixar's latest (2004) animated feature is less about originality, and more about repackaging; you all know what inspired the creation of the Parr Family and their non-unique superpowers, et al, ad infinitum. <br/><br/>Yes, this computer-animated feature is all that it may have promised in the minds of children and adults; state-of-the-art cyber-generated realism, the importance of quality time spent with members of one's own family... the list goes on, again ad infinitum. <br/><br/>And yet... And yet I found myself eating up all this ""regurgitation"" and loving myself for doing so. Who cares right? This Disney/Pixar ""collaboration,"" however, is more Pixar than Disney (as was previous collaborations). After all, Disney only distributes and markets them, and after their next and last feature (""Cars""), Disney will have to fend for itself. <br/><br/>The general consensus (and admit it, everyone already knows this, so why point it out, right) that Disney used-up it's ""Last Leg"" before it went into business with Pixar in the first place (I didn't even bother going out to see that cow-cartoon ""Home on the Range,"" what was Disney Thinking!)<br/><br/>In ""The Incredibles,"" I found myself occasionally forgetting I was watching an animated feature, and (sort-of) viewed the action and character-interplay as if it was a real-life drama being filmed, with real-life actors and 'natural' settings. Case in point, I was impressed with the ""special-effect"" of witnessing a wall of water open up, curtain-like, to allow the bubble-shaped monorail car enter the villain's fortress of evil.<br/><br/>There are other things I liked about 'Incredibles, but see it for yourself. I believe you'll enjoy it immensely. Most amusing is male-director Bird as the gravelly-voiced female ""Edna"" (comic-relief on top of all the rest of The Incredibles' comic-relief).<br/><br/>But let's not forget that this is recycled material (the characters, the situations and the smarmy attempt to take more cash out of our wallets). Walt Disney once said something like ""Disneyland will never be completed, as long as their is imagination left in the world."" Well, Walt, Disneyland was completed a long time ago, you and your WED Enterprises Company just happen to know how to resell it in new and innovative ways. Take out the ""Energy"" exhibition at EPCOT and rebuild it as something similar and more up-to-date at Animal Kingdom, and call it ""Dinosaur"" (how generic is that!). And by the way, we already have dinosaurs on the ""Primeval World"" train ride here at Disneyland, in Anaheim, California."

","I haven't been so excited about a movie since I saw Moulin Rouge the first time years ago. I have been a fan of Brad Bird since I saw his episode of Amazing Stories way back in the day (""The Family Dog""...well worth renting if you can find it, incidentally). In any case, I'm glad Bird's finally at the top of the animated heap. I suppose things were looking somewhat bad for him back when his very skillfully rendered ""Iron Giant"" didn't make all that much money (which I am led to understand is more the fault of the distributor...was Warners just fearful after their Quest for Camelot and King and I flops, or did they have something against Bird?). Now he's directed a superb film for the premier animation outfit in the world. I hope he gets to do more. Indeed, I'm already hungry for an ""Incredibles 2.""<br/><br/>I've wondered when someone in animation in the U.S. would attempt to match the dynamic motion and speed in action sequences that you see in Japanese pictures like Macross Plus and Cowboy Beebop (thinking of the feature here, not the series). Disney's Tarzan had some pulse-heightening jungle-swing sequences, but it wasn't until the beginning of Toy Story 2, with the video game Buzz Lightyear doing battle with robot armies and his nemesis Emperor Zurg that I felt that American animators had really noted how exciting and mobile they could make their visuals. Incredibles will probably get a lot of praise for its humor, especially as it relates to the funny mixture of a standard American nuclear family and super powers. What may be neglected is the fabulous is praise for the very animated animation. Kudos for gorgeous action sequences. I'd love to see more.<br/><br/>I hope that Pixar will continue to knock 'em out of the park. So far, every story has been the sort of heart-warming, feel good stuff that we American (and probably international) audiences really adore. I suppose there are some Marxists out there somewhere that think this is a bad idea. I don't buy that. There are some things we need to believe in at a very personal and very profound level. I hope Pixar will never forget that the simple themes of love, family, belonging and such are the ones that we all seem to respond to the most. Disney tried the politically correct theme of tolerance and got their butts handed to them at the box office for it (thinking of Pocahontas here, and Hunchback, for that matter). I hope Pixar keeps it simple, and keeps to the things that really matter most to most human beings.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I hope Pixar can keep the artists and animators around who have the wonderful comic timing that their present crew has. These folks are so good at what they do, it's amazing. There's a lot more subtle and nuanced stuff going into drawing and moving characters in such a way that they turn out to be really good actors than one might realize. Right now Pixar is the reigning champ. I personally hope they stay that way.<br/><br/>A couple of last thoughts: if John Ratzenberger gets a role in every animated movie made from now on, I think that would be just great. Also, nice work Jason Lee. I've been watching his career since Mallrats. Very much enjoy his work."

","Mr. Incredible is a superhero that got sued by dozens of people after causing havoc in a city. He and his Newly-wed wife Elastigirl are forced to make their secret identities their only identity. 3 years later, they are now settled in a new home with 3 children, all of which have superpowers. Violet can turn invisible and make forcefields (or shields. Whatever). Dash can run very, very fast. But their not so sure about their baby yet. Mr. Incredible is umber-strong and can lift huge trucks or just about anything. Elastigirl can stretch far and wide. All of which make for a unique and interesting family.<br/><br/>Brad Bird, the writer and director of another favorite, The Iron Giant, also writes and directs the film. While I was quite surprised that the usual Pixar team wasn't writing the film (hell, throw in Joss Whedon too), Brad Bird was able to handle the film pretty well and knows his stuff. The movie doesn't have any cheesy, ""I love you family,"" type of speeches that becomes quite awkward for the audience to watch and doesn't leave any eyes rolling. Bird knows how to handle each scene and doesn't chicken out on anything.<br/><br/>While the first hour or so isn't as funny and gets uninteresting in some parts, the rest of the film makes up for it. The animation is amazing. I was quite unsure how Pixar would be able to handle an animated film with human beings as their characters, but there's no need to worry. The design of the characters are flawless. The jungle and underwater scenes are handled very carefully and the result is magnificent. Dash running around in the island and the jet explosion was one of the most impressive things I've seen this year. <br/><br/>All of the character's powers are shown in outstanding detail but never becomes forced or feel that the creators showing off their visuals. And while his powers are only shown at the climax of the film, Frozone sliding at his ice thingy is outstanding. Same goes for Elastigirl, who we once see jumping around buildings. All of the action scenes are very, very impressive. The jet exploding, those circle blade thingys chasing Dash and blowing up and the ending are astounding. And the lack of action in the beginning doesn't become a problem at all.<br/><br/>Brad Bird never forgets the characters and excellently develops all of them. Instead of going with the action and developing characters along the way, the big trouble doesn't even start until the audience knows each character well enough to care about them. None of them are left behind and gets to do at least something important. All of the voice work are excellent and makes the characters believable and often times hilarious. But still, Ellen DeGeneres as Dory is tough to beat.<br/><br/>The Incredibles is quite different from all the other soon-to-be-classic-films that Pixar made. It has a different feel that I can't really explain. It doesn't have many kiddy moments and was shot in 2.35:1 aspect ratio (besides the usual 1.85:1 flat). It's more mature than all the others and the villains actually get killed in explosions etc. It's not as funny as the Toy Story movies or Finding Nemo, but The Incredibles is just as great and sits comfortably among them, just waiting to be a classic. One of the year's best and most impressive films.<br/><br/>9.0"

","First of all, all you nay sayers out there who don't want to see this film because its animation (there are a few) I tell you to stick it where the sun doesn't shine. This film not only takes the crown from Shrek or any other film that you may think is better but it will probably keep it for a while. This film appeals to anyone of any age (always a bonus). It has jokes and jabs that people can enjoy watching. The Incredibles has surpassed all my expectations coming into the film and then jumbled them all up in a blender and made this opinion for me. The character voices were fantastic. Holly Hunter was perfect and Craig T. Nelson couldn't have done a better job. The fact that Brad Bird (the director) thought of the idea that people would sue super heros for helping them out is pure genius. Jason Lee stands out as the evil super hero in this film. Samuel L. Jackson does an excellent job as well (as if he needed to be patted on the back) Any who sees this film will immediately realize what i am talking about when I say that The Incredibles has raised the bar from Shrek and Finding Nemo to a whole new level."

","Well, after the Lord of the Rings trilogy was over, I thought I'd never see movies more than 5 times ever again! But wow, this movie was good. I could see it 5 times in the theater easily. <br/><br/>I think you need to have a close family to really understand this movie. (or at least wish you had a close family) I thought it was funny how my family's a lot like this...minus the baby. (me being the role of an older Violet, heh) Anyway, I thought Mr. Bird did a great job on the whole family thing. The arguments between the parents were perfect, and the way they all interacted with each other was very realistic! It was cute how all their powers complimented each other, as they should in a family.<br/><br/>The plot was wonderful! I'm not sure why some people got bored during the middle; they only showed and talked about important things. Maybe I have a high tolerance to long dialogues and emotional scenes or something. (well, you gotta have that if you love LOTR, hehe) Syndrome was a good villain (But Hades from Disney's Hercules will always have a special place in my heart), and his death was just perfect. The story was creative and pretty well-explained. I don't remember there being any major holes or anything.<br/><br/>I don't usually say this, but I loved every main character in this movie! Mr. Incredible was very sweet; I loved how much he cared for his family. Elasticgirl was a great mom and kicked butt. I'm sure all moms want to do that! (I just love the part where she turns into a parachute! that was awesome) Dash was adorable, and I usually find little brothers to be annoying :P Violet was your typical preteen girl, which worked for her. One of my favorite characters was Edna; she was just too funny. I loved every scene that had her in it. And the cape scene...heh, that was great. Oh, and Frozone! I loved him, too. He was just..lovable. Syndrome was funny, too. He has one of the most memorable lines: ""and you got biz-ay!""<br/><br/>Woo, so overall, this movie was amazing. I can't compare it to Finding Nemo...they're 2 completely different movies that I love a lot! I guess I'd have to say I love them both the same. The Incredibles may bore people with ADHD, but come on, how can you not like this movie? I'd give it a 10. Ha! ...okay can I see it again? Now?"

","The ""Incredibles"" is a good movie and another great creation by Pixar. I have to admit, when I saw the trailers, I didn't believe it was good, maybe a kid's movie with some cheap jokes. I even thought it was a ""spy kids"" copy on CGI. But I saw it just last week, and I am glad I was wrong. I loved it, my kid siblings loved it, my parents loved it; everyone from old too young loved it. I like how in the beginning (spoiler) Mr. Incredible is being interviewed and when asked about not being a superhero, he's like "" well I do think about, living a simple life, raising a family."" (Not a direct quote.) And ElastiGirl is like No Way! 'I'm on the top I'm game here.' Yet, 15 years later, Bob Parr is sneaking off to save people from a burning building, while Helena, hoping he isn't doing that sort of thing, thinks he's out bowling. When they were younger, it was different. Makes you think about a married couple today. I hope Pixar's next project will continue the to be just as great as the past ones. Until then, when this comes out on video, I am so buying it."

"Thunderbuck","9","0","1","16 November 2004"," Pixar strikes out in an ""Incredible"" new direction
","I've long been a fan of Pixar's work (MONSTERS INC. being my personal favorite), and I've long been awed by their insistence on strong storytelling at the heart of their technological masterpieces.<br/><br/>While all of the Pixar films have been great family movies, THE INCREDIBLES moves into more sophisticated, more ""adult"" territory, with themes of mid-life crisis and marital discord. It is also somewhat more violent than previous Pixar efforts, with a darker overall tone.<br/><br/>Far from being a bad thing, I like that the studio is striking out for new creative ground. For this particular outing, they had the capable guidance of Brad Bird. A veteran of Disney, ""The Simpsons"", and the similarly dark THE IRON GIANT, Bird has brought a remarkable vision to light.<br/><br/>And ""vision"" is the key here. The best part of this movie is its look. The retro feel here is wonderful, and created by a variety of details. The cars in particular struck me; almost all of the cars in this film were custom designed, but carried an authentic retro look. The villain's island had a wonderful James Bond kind of feel to it, in a way that James Bond movies themselves quit feeling like way back in the sixties.<br/><br/>The whole world, in fact, looked a lot ""realer"" here than it has in any previous CGI film, though human characters apparently still need a little work; rather than make them real here the animators elected for a kind of ""Thunderbirds"" marionette feel, with a few detailed features thrown into the mix for a little texture (see Bob's eyebrows or Syndrome's hair). The retro feel actually almost seems like a further development of the robot in THE IRON GIANT.<br/><br/>In terms of narrative, Bird's script avoids the obvious pop-culture shots that have become a clichÃ© in this genre. SHARK TALE proves that this kind of storytelling may very well be dead (or at least seriously stale), and it's wise that they've abandoned it here. There do seem to be some VERY subtle references here, and I look forward to buying the DVD to search them out, but the ones I did pick up were all pretty subdued (like baby ""Jack-Jack"" Parr... hmmmm...).<br/><br/>The characters themselves were all pretty good. I found the story a little more engaging than FINDING NEMO, though perhaps not quite as good as MONSTERS INC. or THE IRON GIANT. Though the fabulous visuals make up a little ground; I frequently found myself grinning at the sheer visual invention of THE INCREDIBLES. Right down to the credits at the end.<br/><br/>This is a fun movie, and a great addition to Pixar's already-considerable portfolio. It also shows an intriguing new direction for animation in general."

","the latest from Disney and pixar is good enough. but i was expecting more especially after producing great movies such as finding nemo and monsters inc. it was a little disappointing. it still had the comedic touch here and there. the story is interesting enough. with the father wanting to reclaim his old glory. he goes back to being a super hero blinded by his ambition that his family needs him and the bad guy is out to get him. finally he is caught and his family tries to save him. a great big family reunion with each one having realized their worth and the importance of their family.<br/><br/>good enough story. however this movie fails to keep up the excitement. fight scenes are few and far apart. the bad guy here in the movie is not given his proper due. he was only there for about 20% of the movie. the scenes mostly gives scene after scene of how miserable mr. incredible's life was before and how he worked out to be this new man again. this is not an action movie but of self-discovery. but in the end mr. incredible just realized he has a good family and he still wants to be a hero. <br/><br/>this is a good movie. pretty interesting and lovable characters. it was just not as good as the previous Disney pixar movies. but it is better than the shrek movies."
"MovieTrey","8","0","1","15 November 2004"," Great from beginning to end, but meant more for the adults.
","The Incredibles is great from beginning to end. However, with some scenes of fantasy violence and some sexual innuendos this movie is meant more for the adults. The movie stars Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible, an out of work superhero, who has been recruited to find out what has happened to some missing superheroes. While Mr. Incredible has been in retirement from the superhero game, he has married and had three children. His wife, voiced by Holly Hunter has the ability to stretch, his daughter Violet has the ability to become invisible and his son Dash has the ability run at lightning speed.<br/><br/>The movie also stars Lucius Best a.k.a. Frozone, voiced by Samuel L. Jackson. They all face off against Syndrome, voiced by Jason Lee, from Dogma and Almost Famous, who plays a super villain who wants the world for himself. The movie was great from beginning to the end. It had great visual and sound effects, the characters were well developed and overall well done. Overall I gave The Incredibles an 8 out of 10."

","I haven't seen too many of these computer animated films.... but this one really stood out for me.

The characters are very well-rounded, particularly for an animated film. <br/><br/>The villain was especially well done, and I liked the way he was introduced in the early part of the film. I kinda hope they find new villains for the ""Incredibles"" sequels that are sure to follow.<br/><br/>I didn't want to see this film because of all the hype around it, but if you can get past that and just take it for what it is, ""The Incredibles"" is a movie that will entertain everyone in the family. A lot of people are going to see this movie and most of them will like it, so you might as well just succumb to the pressure and see the movie!"
"ajwright1981","10","0","1","15 November 2004"," One of the best movies of the year!
","I was fortunate enough to see The Incredibles this past weekend. My family was the odd bunch. My mother, stepfather, sister (age 25), my boyfriend (age 27), and myself (age 22). At first I was apprehensive about seeing a ""kids"" movie at 3:00pm, but I will say it was quite the experience. <br/><br/>In my many years of film watching this was the first animated film where I almost never heard children talking. Getting bored. Crying. Etc. They seemed just as enthralled as the adults. <br/><br/>I believe this movie is something special. I feel like many Disney cartoons have attempted to bridge the gap between kids movie and movie for all audiences. I feel though that this is the first case where they have been 110% successful. Adults can full relate to these people's lives -- which for being Super Heroes, I feel Mr. Bird made them so real that it all seemed actually plausible. <br/><br/>The Incredibles will hold it's own for years to come. I also expect it to stay #1 at the box office for quite awhile too. And lastly, any year where The Incredibles and Fahrenheit 9/11 are two HUGE front runners for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Well, that is a good year my friend. A very good year."

","My hats off to Pixar and Mr. Lassater (exec producer) for creating one of the most entertaining family action movies I have ever seen in my life. The writing is superb with all the elements for success, the animation is breathtaking... (how did they DO that!) the sound design should win an Oscar. I don't very often see movies twice, but I would see this again anytime. Pixar is what Disney was in the 60's; the most innovative and creative studio to produce cutting edge animation that families can enjoy together. Disney now has to settle for at least second or third place and has been settling for copy cat wannabes like Shark Tale. The Pixar short called ""Boundin"" was excellent too with creative involvement from Joey Muskilin(sp?)from Riders in the Sky. That short should also win an Oscar. I want to thank and congratulate everyone at Pixar who worked on this film. You guys ROCK!!!! Mr. Lassater, thank you for keeping creativity alive! Keep up the excellent work. <br/><br/>Everyone, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not be disappointed."

","Pixar may very well be one of the few name brands you can trust when it comes to movies. Nearly every studio, director, and star occasionally (or in some cases, frequently) missteps, but the products of the first and still the best of the computer-animation studios are at the least enjoyable and at best phenomenal. Their latest film, ""The Incredibles,"" falls firmly in the latter category, taking its place beside ""Toy Story,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" and ""Finding Nemo"" as an instant classic in the genre.<br/><br/>Meet Bob Parr (voice by Craig T. Nelson), a man who's not anywhere near as average as his name would imply. He's really Mr. Incredible, one of many superheros (""Supers"" for short) who go about defeating costumed villains, rescuing cats from trees, and trying to make the world a better place. Mr. Incredible loves his job, and he does it well. But a string of lawsuits force the Supers into hiding, casting aside the capes and Spandex forever. (One does wonder, though: what happened to all the supervillains when the heroes went away? Wouldn't they have taken the chance to run rampant?) Bob settles down with wife Helen (formerly Elastigirl), his 2.5 children (the elder two of which have developing powers of their own), and gradually feels his life being drained away by a soul-sucking job and a seemingly purposeless existence.<br/><br/>In this, Bob is more than a washed-up superhero: he is every person who's sat in a claustrophobic cubicle, glanced at his current humdrum life and the faded dreams of his youth, and thought ""I know there's more to life then this."" His social conscience refuses to be repressed: every week he goes out with an old superhero buddy and trades stories of the ""good old days"" while looking for a chance to do some clandestine heroics. When a mysterious woman offers him a chance to break back into the hero gig, he of course leaps at the chance. It's all a trap of course, masterminded by the evil Syndrome (Jason Lee)--part comic-book geek, part celebrity stalker, and part Bond villain--who's motivated by a combination of petulance, disenchantment, and misplaced ambition. Like the best hero/villain matchups, Mr. Incredible and Syndrome share common ground--both long to be extraordinary men in an ordinary world--which provides for an intriguing dynamic between the characters.<br/><br/>Director/writer Brad Bird knows (as Sam Raimi and Bryan Singer knew and Joel Schumacher was never able to grasp) that the ultimate appeal of superheroes and their adversaries lies not in their extraordinary feats, but their ultimate humanity. The Parr family isn't just a collection of butt-kickers extraordinare, they are people struggling with mid-life crisis, youthful insecurity and frustration, and the mixture of love and exasperation which comes with dealing with one's family. A quarrel at the dinner table is heightened by the presence of family's powers (Mom stretches her arms in a vain attempt to corral the kids, who go at each other with force fields and supersonic speeds), but isn't overwhelmed by them--it's the people, not the powers, that are center stage.<br/><br/>There are plenty of humorous moments in ""The Incredibles""--among them, a discussion on the supervillain's tendency to get overly verbose when he should be taking out the good guy, and a diminutive fashion maven (voiced by Bird) who's passion is superhero wear. But there's also a lot of insight as well. Pointed jabs are made at the pressure to conform and the litigators and bureaucrats who increasingly value the bottom line over the betterment of humanity. The heroes learn a little about themselves, while the bad guys are undone by their own hubris and near-sightedness, and both are engaging to the audience.<br/><br/>The first Pixar film with an all-""human"" cast, ""The Incredibles"" is a testimony of how far the technology has advanced since ""Toy Story"" (remember how plastic Andy and his mom looked?). But as with its ancestor, the triumph here is not merely that of the brain, but of the heart. This isn't just the best animated film so far this year--it's one of the best films of the year period."

","This is a must see movie, and not just for children. Unlike most pixar or animated films, this one has some three dimensional characters, and spends the right amount of time on character development. Mr. Incredible, while incredibly egotistical at first, is also incredibly human, and the other superheroes in the film (at least the ones seen in more than a quick glance) are human also; with human weaknesses that threaten to overcome their superhuman powers. But good triumphs in the end, after the kind of cartoon violence I grew up with (no blood, use your imagination a bit), and personally I left the theater feeling a little more uplifted than when I entered it. On a scale of 1 to 10 (considering this is an animated feature), I give it a 13."

","It was funny, it was clever, it was exciting, the animation was truly Incredible, but I still don't think this stacks up well to Pixar's other offerings. While all their films are impressive, I think Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc. set the bar (mainly because they can hold their own next to any live action film, which you can't say for a lot of animated stuff). I was expecting ""The Incredibles"" to match the perfection of those two, but it fell short. It is pretty predictable and unoriginal. Plus, although it has a fun, light-weight atmosphere to it, it wasn't quite as funny as I expected. In fact, it had some rather dry moments (the mother's long speech to her daughter reminded me of the smarmy life lesson at the end of every ""Full House"" episode). <br/><br/>I'm not really complaining, however. I had a blast watching it. The animation is their best yet (during the island sequences, if you took out the cartoon characters and just focused on the backgrounds, you would think you were looking at a real setting). The cast is great, too--both the characters themselves, and the voices behind them (Craig T. Nelson happens to be one of my favorite actors, and it's good to finally see him in a high-budget big screen flick again). All in all, it is another impressive movie from a VERY impressive company... but it still hasn't matched their own standard.<br/><br/>8/10 stars."

Too many lawsuits from collateral damage caused by their super-hero activities.

In some ways, it even surpasses it. The pacing, writing and visualization are all first-rate. Easily the best film of 2004, even with the likes of 'Kill Bill Volume 2' competing against it. No doubt this film will cater to a MUCH larger audience than Tarantino's recent masterpiece, and is actually much more fun to watch!<br/><br/>The style hearkens back to the days of the late 60's, early 70's, with a huge dose of James Bond influence, and a bit of the 'Bat Man,' 'Jonny Quest' and 'Thunderbirds' TV shows thrown in. Of course many people have mentioned the Fantastic Four connection, which is very obvious, though the trials and tribulations of the Incredibles are unlike anything the FF crowd ever had to endure. <br/><br/>But don't take my word for it, go see 'The Incredibles' for yourself, and enjoy the best treat that Hollywood has given us this year. <br/><br/>My rating: 10 out of 10."

(There are some ""scary"" parts so I'm not recommending it for all 3-year-olds...)<br/><br/>The plot of this film was unique while at the same time, borrowing from familiar comic book- super hero myths. The themes of family unity and good vs. evil were presented with a fresh perspective and were thoroughly engaging. <br/><br/>As I thought about the film later that day, I realized that the special powers of each family member were specifically suited to their familial roles. Their powers were metaphors for their personalities and how they each grew as a person. Am I reading too much into it?? <br/><br/>The fight scenes are suspenseful, the story is intelligent, the voice talents are top notch and I left the theatre wanting more...I can't say enough about this film...there is not one thing I would change! Our family will absolutely see this film again and I am recommending it to all who want full value for their ticket price!<br/><br/>I was eagerly awaiting this Pixar release and was not disappointed. I predict The Incredibles will win some major awards this coming season..."
"dreams_sahara","8","0","1","14 November 2004"," Best Animated Of The Year
","The Incredibles will be another box office hit for Pixar/Disney. This animated film is good for children of all ages. We are allowed to take a glimpse into the lives of superheros. We see what they do in their down time. We see how they try to manage taking care of their family and saving the world at the same time. And we also get to see what happens when you aren't able to do the job that you love anymore. The characters are believable and easy to relate to, even the bad guy character who you want to hate, but end up feeling sorry for. Overall, I'd say this is a fun movie for kids of all ages. It will definitely win the Oscar for best animated. I would have rated it higher, but I liked Finding Nemo better."

"seaview1","Null","0","1","13 November 2004"," The Incredibles is super for fans
","Pixar Studios has become the premiere animation studio and The Incredibles supports that ranking. With Dreamworks' claim to the mantle through its Shrek films, an interesting battle for best animation film shapes up for the 2004 Oscars. The Incredibles represents Pixar's first animation film to feature human (albeit superhuman) characters.<br/><br/>The story starts with superhero Mr. Incredible who, like other superheroes, fights crime until some of the public sues them for super damages. So all the heroes go into a kind of witness protection plan and raise families. Years pass and when a fateful call goes to Mr. Incredible to be a superhero again, he jumps at the chance. But what seems like a great opportunity turns out to be an evil plan by someone from Mr. Incredible's past who wants to eliminate all superheroes until there is no one left to save humanity. What follows is a clever mix of comic book derring-do and a plot lifted from a dozen James Bond films. Even the musical score by Michael Giacchino oozes so much horn and percussion, it is hard to tell that John Barry himself did not repeat his famous scores of past Bond films.<br/><br/>The whole family is comprised of super humans (whose powers emulate heroes from the D.C. and Marvel Comics canon.) Mr. Incredible is a super strong hero (like Superman or the Hulk), Elastigirl can stretch her body rubber band thin (like Mr. Fantastic of The Fantastic Four), daughter Violet can turn invisible and use force fields (like Invisible Girl Sue Storm), and son Dash can run very fast (like The Flash). There is also the baby who seems normal, but you just know something's going to happen by movie's end. The only thing missing is maybe a super dog or cat. Syndrome, the bad guy, gives a sort of John Lithgow villainy and even has the hair of TV's Mr. Heat Miser. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, there is always the connectivity of family and responsibility. This is not about good versus evil and showing off great animation effects. What the writers do so successfully is to take the hero mythology and turn it on its ear. Fans of super heroes are going to be in heaven here. There are the requisite demonstrations of super powers and the threat of danger and death. The animation is so good and the plot line so full of threads that one wonders what Pixar could do by recreating other superheroes or reanimating classics of television past like Jonny Quest.<br/><br/>Craig T. Nelson finds the right intonations to give his Mr. Incredible a sympathetic, yet heroic voice. Holly Hunter has such an attractive lisp of Southern womanhood that she is perfect to voice a strong female who leads the triple life of hero, wife, and mother. Samuel L. Jackson is amusing as Frozone, Mr. Incredible's best friend. Even writer/director Brad Bird (Iron Giant) voices Edna, the costume designer for superheroes, in a deliciously funny turn; imagine Truman Capote crossed with Linda Hunt!<br/><br/>The film is almost too sophisticated for young children and yet perfect for adults who are kids at heart. Some of the action scenes, while exciting and intense, may prove a bit too dark for really sensitive youngsters. The film lags a bit in the middles stretches as the story gets more complex. There is also a cute animated short that precedes the film. All in all, although The Incredibles is not the funniest animated film of the year nor necessarily the best, it sure is pretty terrific!"

","Personally, I never really liked Walt Disney or Animated films, except Shrek, but, this movie was highly INCREDIBLE!!! What made this animated film so great was not just the graphics but the characters and the storyline. It is a typical action/adventure film, but it is animated. The various abilities of the heroes were fantastic, the humor was unstoppable, including some inaapropiate as I say ""fat jokes"", and brief sexual dialogue. But I love this family film, understanding the PG rating though.

The main character has super-human strength, as expected, but then you get Elastigirl and the two kids who don't have superhero names yet but have growing powers. They have found ways to use their superpowers in creative and unique situations unlike any comic book story I ever read.<br/><br/>The graphics are amazing in this movie, and they should be. I was surprised by the absolute creativity throughout the entire movie.

","After seeing the superb ""Toy Story"" duo as well as the heartwarming ""Monsters Inc."", I went to the movie theater with hopeful anticipation, expecting to be floored by yet another Pixar gem. But I came out only partially satisfied. Maybe I'm old-fashioned; maybe I didn't grow up on superhero/comic book mythology; but to me, notwithstanding the breathtaking computer animation work Pixar has long been known for, the movie lacked one very important element which makes a film memorable - soul. In the end, it turned out to be a soulless movie with amazing graphics. Most of the running time I felt like I was playing an endless video game (which it will undoubtedly become). I laughed twice during the movie, and was genuinely taken with only two characters - the hilarious Bomb Voyage, whose time on the screen was - sacre bleu! - way too short, and the snootily hip fashion designer Edna M. Mode, who added the few degrees of dimensionality and soul to the film.<br/><br/>I still fondly remember the first Pixar short, ""Luxor Jr."". Who would think that one could pack some much grace and soul into two minutes, two desk lamps and a bouncing ball? Of course, CGI has taken a giant leap forward since then, but I still get a lump (lamp?) in my throat when I think about Luxor Jr. In my book, that little film has more soul than all the characters of ""The Incredibles"" put together. ***4.5 or 5 out of 10***"

Primarily though, it was nice to have an animated film, (notice I'm not calling it a cartoon,) which didn't pull any punches, and didn't aim itself at kids. It was new, cool, and nostalgic all at the same time. Kudos to Pixar as well, for reintroducing the short at the beginning of the movie. Makes me want to dig out one of the old RPGs, and start running a supers campaign again."

","This movie is 11 out of 11... Three thumbs up... 6 stars! Finally we have a plot for the older folks who appreciate good animation. I appreciated the genuine 007 motif. I related to the over-40 get-a-little-hefty-live-it-all-over-again Mr. Incredible with a heart of gold, Elastigirl who is not only sexy, but has the right moves (and the right hips) and seems as real as a super-hero wife and mother can get while keeping the hubby in line, the daughter Violet who is the shy yet budding beauty that finds her confidence through personal struggle and heroic instincts. And, of course, the adolescent, rebellious yet loyal Dash who knows no fear and is central in the hero line-up that provides the most excitement of them all. I must say that these heroes form a believable family unit that is destined for greatness. A real treat that most definitely screams for a sequel! Oh, yeah. The bad guy is very much worth mentioning as he is genuinely irritating as a 'Dr. Doom' type that never had a father! Hope he lived through the explosion!"
"Attila-2","6","0","2","12 November 2004"," Most over-rated film of the year
","This really isn't a very good movie. It's just that simple. The story line is weak, character development all but non-existent (the most interesting character is the costume designer who is clearly based in part on Edith Head), and most important it just plain drags. This is not to say that the movie doesn't have its moments. It's in fact a perfectly OK ""flick"" but it is nothing special and it is a big disappointment coming from Pixar whose previous work has been so good.<br/><br/>We aren't told why Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl were attracted to each other and we don't see much of their relationship. I guess we're just supposed to accept that all superheroes eventually get together, or something like that. Their children are introduced and then sort of float until the plot needs their help. The motivation of Buddy is too easy, not very interesting. <br/><br/>The notion that Mr. Incredible is driven from crime-fighting by law suits is inventive and funny. That the government would pay the judgments is -- well, incredible. Comic book superheros do not work for the government or even accept pay from the government. They generally exist more or less in a netherworld between government power and the world of crime. But the Incredibles end up in the superhero equivalent of the witness protection program. To coin a phrase, what's with that?<br/><br/>So, overrated and disappointing. Wait for the DVD. I wish I had."

","Here is another ""Incredible"" Pixar presentation, branching into more teen-adult entertainment quite nicely. The storyline is great: force super creatures out of their familiar elements and give them a non-super existence. Next, tempt them to use their powers. Upon seeing the end of this gem, I immediately prayed for a sequel, something that John Lasseter and company will likely (and wisely?) not do. Pixar is king because the story drives the animation. The voice talent does not overwhelm the story, forcing characterizations to bow to preconceived images. Nightmareworks still shouts about the ""Look at all the important stars who appear in our work"" while delivering the same tired smirks since Ants. As for me, I'll take Pixar's balance every time. As for 2D animation, some of it has worked quite nicely (Mulan, Aladdin). Give a good story line to talented people and wise audiences follow. Thanks for the early Christmas present, Pixar."

All of the family members have individual strengths and weaknesses, they bicker and quarrel a lot, yet they ultimately love each other--and you feel it all in this film.<br/><br/>In the periphery, there were numerous supporting characters with decidedly less dimensionality, yet there wasn't a trite character in the lot. They were quirky in new and interesting ways.<br/><br/>To be fair, this is no romp-in-the-park light-hearted film like Toy Story or Nemo. This film is a bit darker and more violent than other Pixar films, but it is one of the best--if not the best--of the lot. I gave this film an easy 10."

","This movie is a classic homage to super hero shtick. As a lifelong reader of comic books, I spent a fair amount of mental energy ticking off producer Bird's various hero tributes. I won't spoil the movie by listing those here, just point out for those thinking this is a kid's movie, that it certainly is not. <br/><br/>Holly Hunter was wonderful as Helen. The animation and voice overs were so good in spots, I stopped seeing this movie as a cartoon. Bob and Helen really love each other, and their kids, and Helen's solicitude for her family is the most touching element of this picture. <br/><br/>Samuel L.

Her gawkiness, and timidity, painfully shy, her contentious relationship with her brother, her first failure which gave rise to her ultimate victory not just over villainy but over the vicissitudes of life was charming. *So* poignant, it tugged at your heart. <br/><br/>You'll notice I haven't said a lot about the special effects, or the battle sequences. These are the hook that draws many to see the movie, but they are not what is most memorable about it. What makes The Incredibles ..well, incredible .. is how fully realized they are as people, with real feelings, real aspirations, real successes and failures, and real frustrations and disappointments. <br/><br/>Can't wait for Incredibles 2: Attack of the Underminer!"
"sslcynic","10","0","1","12 November 2004"," Incredible!
","Pixar's The Incredibles is the best animated feature I have seen in a long time. Sure, Shrek and Finding Nemo were good. But since Toy Story, no animated film has been as captivating, witty and beautiful to behold as The Incredibles.<br/><br/>A lovable ensemble cast (something that often lacks in animated films) supports a strong, compelling storyline about one superhero's (Mr. Incredible) midlife crisis in light of an era of petty law suits that has driven all superheroes (a.k.a ""The Supers"") into hiding. Although all superheroes have weaknesses that their archenemies exploit, subjecting the Supers to the constraints of the legal system puts a refreshing spin on the genre. In combination with aspects of the spy genre, The Incredibles packs a powerful punch, offering an animated movie that may be even more entertaining to adults than the primary target audience.<br/><br/>The characters are well-developed throughout the story, as they showcase their superabilities in unique and unexpected ways. Though the cast works well together as an ensemble, Holly Hunter grabs a bit more of the limelight as superheroine (and supermom) Elastigirl. Her performance is witty, empathetic, caring and sexy all at once. Also among the best performances is director Brad Bird as the voice of Edna the superhero seamstress - a funny, energetic cameo. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Frozone, is a brilliant combination of the Silver Surfer, Mr. Freeze and Spiderman, but gets unfortunately little screen time. Jason Lee is perfectly annoying as the ability-less, but scientifically adept Syndrome. The animators both did an excellent job in creating unique personalities and physical features for all of the characters, which only adds to the fluid wittiness of the writing.<br/><br/>One of the most popular, but difficult, things to do in animated films is referencing other films or pop culture through visuals and dialogue without either: 1. dating the film or 2. relying on them for the majority of the humor. Pixar seamlessly integrates hints of Star Wars, James Bond, and Mission:Impossible, to name a few, into The Incredibles. The references are just enough so a typical (adult) moviegoer understands that there is a glimpse of something they've seen before, but only the most versed fans will know exactly where they come from. By incorporating these kinds of tidbits indirectly through the settings, minor plot elements and music, Pixar succeeds in creating a timeless cast and story - the mark of truly great film-making.<br/><br/>Possibly the most perfectly executed aspect of The Incredibles was the score. Plays off of Mission:Impossible and Bond themes of yore lays a perfect groundwork for the film. The music compliments the on screen action perfectly by adding the ""spy"" spin to the Superhero storyline.<br/><br/>Without a doubt Pixar's best work to date, and one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences of the year: 10/10"
"merrywood","8","0","1","12 November 2004"," Terrific popcorn muncher
","As intellectually sweeping and philosophically cavernous as a tin thimble, THE INCREDIBLES remains the best film thus far (the latest in an astonishing series of continuous hits) to issue from the Pixar group (Disney distributed). This studio's founders are former Disney people. Whatever, they really know how to win and win again, something that Disney itself has forgotten how to do. <br/><br/>The 3-D, CGI animated film is a fast moving trans-genre (action-adventure, comedy/parody) picture that all can enjoy at the visceral level. If fun is your thing this one is for you. It's clever, witty, brightly written and directed by Brad Bird whose credentials include The Iron Giant (1999).<br/><br/>The only downside for me was the use of very well known live-action voices for the leads, whose real life images kept intruding and competing with the graphically rendered characters. As I said in previous comments on animated films, this is a personal irritant. For some it might not even be an issue.<br/><br/>However, I fail to understand the need for 'known' voices. <br/><br/>Not in the farthest reaches of my imagination would I suspect that Holly Hunter's voice, for example; though stylized, very rich and easy to discern, was a box office draw for this product. When looking at the rendered character I kept wanting to see Holly Hunter. This is as disturbing as watching a badly lip-synced foreign film. Again, it's the reason that Walt Disney chose the unknown Adriana Caselotti for the voice of Snow White (1937) as opposed to some giant box office voice of the period. <br/><br/>It might be noted here that Disney's early films all had intellectual levels of meaning as well as the entertainment values. Both today's Disney and Pixar seem not to care about this. Yet, depth is what gives a film legs and renders it a true classic. At the bottom line, nevertheless: The Incredibles is highly recommended for the sheer, if easily forgettable, fun of it."

","The Incredibles surely live up to their name this weekend on screen and in the box office. The first PG animation released by Pixar studios takes its' medium to new heights with impeccable resolution and an emotionally mature story. Packed with comedy, action adventure, and pop-culture references The Incredibles takes a commanding presence on screen. <br/><br/>The movie is about a family with super human powers that has been forced to live an undercover average suburban life. The reason for their underground existence arises from the great American tradition of insolent lawsuits. While having to suppress their superhero identities, the father falls victim to the doldrums of an unrewarding job. Being over weight and restless the dad seeks to find ways to return to his once established greatness. This path leads him and his family to face an evil nemesis that tries to come into power through technology and manipulation. With their various super powers, the family pulls together to form an ultimate crime fighting force. <br/><br/>The movie is wonderfully directed and written by Brad Bird whose previous credits include The Iron Giant and The Simpsons. Bird seamlessly ties together multiple story lines and issues that reflect a modern world. The story examines the tremendous strength and responsibility it takes to deal with the difficulties of family life, adolescence, and reaching ones' full potential. With great realism and charm these animated characters have dynamic personalities and roles that mirror human society. The dialogue is smart and witty, which can relate to both younger and older audiences. This presentation of the story creates a greater impact on moviegoers then the average animation moral-of-the-story formula. <br/><br/>Also making a dazzling impact on the screen are Pixar's state of the art graphics. Their cutting edge technology brings to life brilliantly colored images with depth and complexity. At one point the graphics are even rendered to resemble grainy film stock that convincingly looks like an old newsreel. <br/><br/>The combination of amazing technology, emotionally rounded characters, and an action packed story line, create a hilarious and truly incredible movie that is absolutely a must see."

","IMHO this is the best of all the superhero movies. One gets the feel of a comic book, with the humor--including a malicious comic heavy--reminding me of the original Captain Marvel comic books. The characters are ""human"" enough to grab our sympathy but ""cartoonish"" enough that we suspend our disbelief gladly to see them exercise their magical powers. In some ways this is as ground- breaking as ""Snow Whites,"" even though ""Polar Express"" has more of the same ""feel"" as the Disney movie. It has, I think, taken what old Disney films did in two dimensions and extended it into three. The voice characterizations are well-done. It may be nothing peculiar to this film, but the actors seems to have fun doing things verbally that they cannot get away with while doing live action. I expect to see sequels of this. Indeed the film ends with the cliff-hanger than seems to lead us toward one."

I appreciate the Pixar folks not just trying to repeat their formula in a different setting, but doing something more subtle and exploring a new idea--- here, the horror of being forced into submission by a mediocre society. Maybe I just relate. The family together are a poignant and deeply familiar picture of love and struggle, as well as a truly interesting and exciting super-hero team.

","Interesting how being a hero is not so super and that doesn't just pertain to those select few who decide to wiggle into a tight spandex suit and fight for truth and justice. However, in this film, being a superhero has been for naught, thanks to litigation entered by the very people whose lives they have saved. Now these crusaders must retire the masks and lead ""normal"" lives as, say, an insurance agent; however, even as the days turn into weeks, then months, and finally years, the longing for the past eats at them from the inside, especially Mr. Incredible, our title character. So what sort of outlet eases those tensions? Well, for that answer, you'll just have to see the film.<br/><br/>Pixar takes a step in a new direction; as it's first full-length feature film not to be rated G, there are several instances of suggested violent death sequences that take place off-camera, so it's still safe to take your little one even if you might have some explaining to do later. There's also been a little more injection of subtle adult humor that should fly high above those adolescent heads. The plot is a little choppy, but it's a well-presented, albeit predictable, story and, of course, the high-tech animation continues to appease the audience. In short, it's what you would expect from Pixar and should not disappoint fans of the studio's past work."

","I am such a big fan of Jason Lee when I found out he was in a cartoon I went nuts. That and in the months leading up to the film I heard nothing about his role until nearly a week or two before the actual release. I was extremely pleased to find out that he was the villain as his role in Dogma was awesome but combined with his sarcastic nature like that seen in Mallrats purely describes who Syndrome (Lee's Character) is. Now the movie of course was based around this family of superheros and forced to retire do to lawsuits from people not wanting to be saved. I nice spoof on today's culture and for a Disney film the amount of death and off the wall humor presented in the film is a shock. I guess pixar takes it's own approach to family entertainment but I guess you can't prove these people ""DID"" die. But you crash something and it goes boom your general consensus is... He's toast!. All in all this movie is so cute and the performances not just by Lee but the entire cast work quite well. I can't wait for the Incredible edition DVD ,as one can assume that's what it would be called, to hit my local suncoast. Oh and I am going to say it was way better than Finding NEMO!"

","First off, as a father of three in my mid twenties, I think this is one of the best Pixar movies, right up there with Toy Story.

Fox does manage to capture really big voice talent, though...<br/><br/>Now, I am by far not a comic book geek, I own none but I used to runa hobby store and sell (and play) heroclix, a miniatures game based on the DC, Marvel, and indy comics.

","If this is not an animated film for baby boomers, I don't know what is. Borrowing bits and pieces from everything from James Bond to the Fantastic Four, Bird successfully creates a world that once more WANTS saving.<br/><br/>The film opens at the height of the ""glory days"" of the superheroes (estimated sometime during the 1960s), flashing magazine clippings and news broadcasts immortalizing superhumans; and Mr. Incredible is immediately identified as rightfully named so. He is the manifestation of every great heroic trait from Hercules to Superman, courageous and strong, suave and quick-witted. But then, on his wedding day, everything changes...<br/><br/>Following a lawsuit over a saved suicide, Mr. Incredible and his wife, formerly Elastigirl, are forced underground, along with the rest of the superhuman population. (Noting the success with Mr. Incredible, the rest of the average population sues until no superhero is left to protect them.) There, hidden among everyday citizens, they remain...until the need for their strength is too desperate to ignore. <br/><br/>The progression America's superheroes have taken from kryptonite to the kitchen and back again is one worth tracing. ""The Incredibles"" does a remarkable job commenting on the places we've designated for our superheroes over the course of the 20th-21st centuries. In the 1950s and 60s, we NEEDED superheroes like Superman, who is not really of this world, and is therefore a real phenomenon in an almost-divine sort of way. But, faced with the cultural revolution of the 1970s and 80s, our superheroes became more like the rest of us. We moved from adoration to emulation, not necessarily by improving on ourselves, but by stripping those we admire down to their most human qualities. In this way, everyone can be a hero. I think ""The Incredibles"" villain, Syndrome, actually suggests studying the superpowers until he can package and distribute them to everyone so that everyone can be super, and at the same time NO ONE WILL. In the 70s and 80s, we needed to see ""everyday heroes,"" heroes who weren't necessarily SUPERhumans, but simply super HUMANS. Through the 90s, we needed to be reassured that we are all indeed special and capable of accomplishment. From the commercials for ""The Incredibles,"" I expected it to feed this need further, coaxing audiences in with that old ""everybody's special"" crazytalk, especially thanks to the scenes of the domestic supers keeping house and paying bills. But I think I was wrong to think that. <br/><br/>This is not your run-of-the-mill superhero movie. It's not about the hero overcoming his weaknesses in order to save the world. The superheroes have always been ready and able. No, this film is about the world overcoming its pride and finally...after nearly half a decade of denial...admitting that it needs to be saved."

","Overall, this is the best movie I have seen this year, Shaun of the Dead is a near second. The one thing that should get applause would be that they captured Jason Lee's personality perfectly for the villain. If you were a fan of Dogma just picture that character done as a cartoon. This would also work for fans of Chasing Amy. <br/><br/>When watching cartoons made by Pixar you are always entertained. The big jump that they made was by eliminating the 10 minute plot set up, or as I call it- A BORING FIRST TEN MINUTES. This is most obvious in Finding Nemo. In the Incredibles the story is off and running and I was entertained. I give the movie a ten, if anyone was reading this solely for that purpose, and i will buy it on DVD."

","Definitely a film worth seeing.<br/><br/>It wasn't perfect, but I'm planning on seeing it a good number of times before it leaves the theaters. The animation was fantastic, as we've come to expect from Pixar, no worries there. And the scripting was very nicely done. I can definitely see why it has a PG rating, but all in all I don't think that it's something that a kid couldn't watch (I mean, The Justice League is generally darker and more violent as it is).<br/><br/>I could understand how a traditional Pixar fan might not like this one, though. This is a step away from their normal ""Epic fairy tale"" story. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but don't go expecting to see another Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>My only real problem with the film was the lack of characterization. The characters of Dash and Violet - Violet especially - deserved more story time so that we could get to know her. This is a long film as it is, though, so cutting off a little of the many characters in this story is understandable.<br/><br/>8.9/10"

It will be the benchmark by which other films are judged. The character designers used a more cartoony look, which was an advantage because they could go wild with the hair and faces. The film itself, backgrounds and action sequences are so well rendered that they are sometimes hyper 3-D, where you can see more than you would in live action film. <br/><br/>The plot was multi-layered, if a little slow in the beginning.

","The Incredibles is a great story with unique graphics. What stops me from giving it my 'highest' rating is that it just felt long. At a run time of almost two hours, I found myself squirming just a little. There are reasons for the long running time of course, because the writer takes the time to develop his characters. I wasn't particularly looking for serious character development but Brad Bird does a great job with Mr.Incredible, voiced by Craig Nelson, who suffers a mid-life crisis. I think most men would probably relate to him even without having super powers. I'm not sure if kids will appreciate all of that, but it certainly it will help all those men out there take there little kiddies out and still enjoy the film. The animation is the best of the best of the best! It's better than ever here and it puts 'Shark Tale' to horrible shame.

The story, while fairly simplistic, is a timeless rendition of classic comic book greatness. There's plenty of excitement, tension, action, emotion, humor, and enough romance to appeal to women without in any way making it unappealing to men. The ending is perfect, wrapping up the story, yet leaving open the possibility (make that inevitability) of a sequel, just as happens in comic books.<br/><br/>While totally appropriate for children, The Incredibles has plenty to offer for anyone, of any age, of any sex.

","Pixar continues its winning streak, with an assist from Brad Bird, director of the wonderful Iron Giant. This time, we have a superhero family story, ala the Fantastic Four, plus some nice homages to James Bond and Jonny Quest.<br/><br/>Spoilers: Mr Incredible and Elastigirl are retired superheroes, raising their kids in the suburbs. Bob (Mr Incredible) works for an insurance company, but longs for the old days. Helen (Elastigirl) has her hands full with the kids. Son Dash has super speed and a personality to match. Daughter Violet creates force fields and can turn invisible, which matches her shy nature. Baby Jack-Jack does what babies do.<br/><br/>A secret benefactor offers Bob a chance to relive the glory days; but, all is not what it seems. It will take the entire family to save the day.<br/><br/>The film features the dazzling computer animation we have come to expect from Pixar, but they have added subtle nuances. Human characters are the hardest to render, especially with realistic hair and expressions. The Incredibles features new triumphs in character animation. The colors are dazzling and the effects are stunning.<br/><br/>The characters are brought to life vocally by Craig T Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L Jackson, and Jason Lee. Nelson brings an everyman quality to Bob, while Hunter shows flair for both the spectacular and the mundane. Wallace Shawn brings some Rex-mojo to a supporting role, while Jason Lee indulges his inner-Brody.<br/><br/>The design is wonderful, with nods to Ken Adams' James Bond sets, Modern architecture and design, and a little Jonny Quest for good measure (spiders!). The music also hearkens back to the 60's jazzy sound, part John Barry, part Hoyt Curtain.<br/><br/>This is the ultimate superhero film, replacing Superman and the X-Men. It remains to be seen if the upcoming Fantastic Four feature can live up to this; but, here's hoping for more adventures from the Incredibles."

Children and infants may enjoy it, but I was bored to tears by Monster's Inc, Bug's Life and most of Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>But I can't say the same for The Incredibles, which doesn't even feel like a Pixar film; yes, it's that good.

","Exciting, witty, and beautiful CGI film about a family of superheroes trying wthout success to live a normal life in a governmental relocation program, after litigation has forced all caped crusaders underground. The father's altruistic impulses are frustrated at work, where he is forced to deny benefits to insurance policy holders; and the rest of the family suffers in ways nicely appropriate to their superpowers (the lightning-fast son is disruptive at school, the daughter with the power of invisibility is a timid wallflower, and the wife, formerly known as Elastigirl, feels stretched trying to hold the family together). The subversively conservative moral of the tale is that society loses when it suppresses excellence through a misguided egalitarianism. In an Aristotelian spin on self-esteem doctrine, it is only when the Incredibles brave the envy of others and accept themselves as gifted that they find contentment. Cool early 1960s decor!"

","I saw Pixar's latest on opening day and I saw it once again the day after. I say with no reservations that it was well worth it and just as entertaining (if not more so) the second time.<br/><br/>The CGI film focuses on a family of superheroes trying to fit into conventional suburban life. But this is easier said than done as a threat from Mr. Incredible's past endangers he, his wife Elastigirl, and their kids Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack.<br/><br/>The animation is top-notch. The characters don't look very photo realistic like the humans in the Shrek films, but they're not supposed to be - it's a world with a cartoony, comic-book feel. Hair and cloth effects, lighting, and explosions are all accurately and intricately conveyed for a very immerse experience.<br/><br/>There are laughs for both young and old alike, but the story is what really drives the film. The characters' motivations are well-developed, and the plot is creative. The average kid may actually find it a bit complex, in my opinion. It's a little more violent than I expected. Nothing graphic, but there's a lot of combat (your typical punch-and-kick fare) and deaths are implied. As usual, the best bet is to simply know your kid.<br/><br/>I wish Samuel L. Jackson's character, Frozone, was in it more. But hey, you have to save some things for the sequel, right? That is, if Disney and Pixar can kiss and make up. How does ""The Incredibles"" stack up to Pixar's other masterpieces? Well, it could very well be their best yet. The only one I might put before it is the classy laugh-riot that is ""Toy Story 2"". I guess time will tell, but if I had to choose right now, I'd put ""The Incredibles"" in at #1.<br/><br/>In the end, I think ""The Incredibles"" really reminds me of what a blessing Pixar is. Few other studios have been able to make films that equally entertain both children and adults and actually have heart. All of these classics, in less than 10 years! I hope that Pixar will continue to make innovative animation, unforgettable characters, and great movies.<br/><br/>10/10"
"marcG106","10","0","1","5 November 2004"," PIXAR & BRAD BIRD - Incredible.
","First things first - Brad Bird is a genius. The dozen people who were able to see THE IRON GIANT know that. Pixar knew that, and they knew he'd shake up the status quo. Take the company to places toys and bugs don't go. Redefine what people thought a ""Pixar Film"" was, while allowing their unique style to temper and shape his wild creativity.<br/><br/>This movie had no focus group-pandering changes, no product placements. Just everything that a cartoon and comic book admirer dreams of seeing on the silver screen. It's hours later, and I'm still giddy.<br/><br/>I can't remember how many times I would stare at the screen and wonder in awe, ""Is this really Pixar?"" Death. Sex. Suicide. Angst. Dysfunctional families. Real guns, with bullets. Torture. People being sucked into jet engines. Mentions of ""God"". Toned down, true, but their presence is a quite bold move. I imagine parents will be sitting their young children down for a long talk afterwards.<br/><br/>I can't see how Pixar can ever top this. It's an amalgamation of the entire wonderful James Bond universe and every comic ever printed from 1930-1970. It's also a wonderful allegory for the evolution from the Golden Age of comics to the Silver (Marvel) Age.<br/><br/>While there's no knock-down drag-out fistfights, the action is still spectacular. CG is the perfect medium for superpowers because every element of the world is on equal footing. Once you get past the fact that they're CG, you accept anything. The upcoming FANTASTIC FOUR movie is already dead in the water, because a real Mister Fantastic will never look as good as Elasti-girl.<br/><br/>Like SPIDER-MAN 2, this film is mostly a grounded story, a story of family relationships, a long for the good old days, a biting look at the modern office workplace. Fusing suburban life with the super heroic elements just gives it a flavour that no other superhero film can match.<br/><br/>So many things to mention - the wonderful, retro '60's Spy score - what Evil Lair is complete without appropriately sinister music? The breathtaking art design - this was the first film I've seen in a while that actually looked like its pre-production art. Some of it even invoked the old Fleischer serials. While the rest of the world's superheroes didn't get as much screen time as I'd have liked, their vignettes still added plenty of depth. And when you learn their fates - a truly, truly chilling moment.<br/><br/>The action scenes stand alongside any major blockbuster film, and the wonderful humour allows you to accept the inherent silliness and enjoy it for what it is. It has a powerful, if slightly under-used villain. And what classic superhero story doesn't have a huge, evil robot? I wish that Violet had more screen time, though, but she really shone once her powers were under control. Edna Mode is delightful. I wonder how many people get the inspiration, but she works either way. <br/><br/>(I use ""she"" loosely, since she was voiced by Brad Bird himself.) While Samuel L. Jackson's Frozone was a supporting character, he made every scene count. And what better way to end it than with John Ratzenberger's vengeful Underminer? The entire voice cast was brilliant, really. They all deserve the highest accolades.<br/><br/>What more can I say about Pixar? They've not only pulled off human animation, they blew it away. This makes the already soulless SHREK look like a PS2 cut scene. Speaking of Dreamworks, they can't touch Pixar now. They're like the Sony to Pixar's Nintendo - heartless drivel for the masses, churned out fast, full of look-at-me pop culture references that audiences may find funny, but won't be laughing at 5 years from now. Pixar's humour is genuinely timeless. Even Disney's own foray into CG, CHICKEN LITTLE, seems hollow in comparison, as if they're trying to fool people into thinking it's a Pixar production. Instead of making soulless CG films just because they're trendy, Pixar makes them because they genuinely believe in them. They're the most talented group of cartoonists in North America, and they could be making beautiful cel animation if they wanted. But they chose to break boundaries. Pixar is the new Disney. Thank god for that.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours. I'll try to reach John Lasseter next week to congratulate him and the whole team. And who isn't hoping that a sequel will arrive in the near future?<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that this film more than deserves to stand alongside Pixar's past classics. It is, in a word, Incredible."

","We took the whole family today, and I sat between my husband and my 15yo. I thought my son was going to laugh himself out of his chair during Dash's dash through the woods. (Not bad for a kid who basically only watches movies in Japanese) My husband leaned over in the middle of the movie and said ""I thought that they had run out of creativity in movie making, but this movie is great!"" And he usually only watches movies with a high body count! :-)<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie for the entire family. Don't analyze it too hard, or you'll miss out on some great comedic moments. I will say that it did have a number of good messages in it, especially for girls, though."

","This was a truly incredible movie. For Disney/PIXAR this movie really raises the bar. The story of an ex-superhero turned 9-5 working Dad who has to come out of retirement to fight his arch-nemisis, who he had a hand in corrupting, is a great new idea for a film. The story is very funny, both for adults and children, and remains kid-friendly for the most part. For a Disney movie there is a lot destruction when it comes to escaping the bad guys henchmen, they even had guns! Gasp! (The henchmen, not the good guys)<br/><br/>The movie had great humor at both the adult and child level and I found myself laughing almost the whole time. Except, that is, during the more emotional parts of the film where it's discussed that this is a life and death kind of scenario and the kids might have to take care of themselves. ""These men won't distinguish that you're children. They'll kill you."" But seriously, who's gonna take out the invisible girl and and Dash? All in all, incredible action, incredible humor, incredible movie."

","Go to the biggest, loudest theatre you can find and see this movie. I repeat, do not wait for the DVD as it is worth every penny to see it on the big screen. Like an animated James Bond flick, the evil villain, his lair and his dastardly plot keep the action moving, yet the coalescence of the super hero family add a very touching story line in its own right.<br/><br/>Pixar has done a job and a half tuning their animation engine to recreate a comic book feel for this movie, yet they employ maximum realism on occasion with superbly beautiful results.

","This is probably the least of the Pixar films, not at all for young children, who will be bored out of their minds during the extremely long set-up to a second half filled with pretty clever action. Fans of comic book superheroes will enjoy it the most, the rest will forget it about five seconds after leaving the theater. Good vocal work all around, some clever design elements, the character animation is up to par. The script could have used some work, better pacing, a bit more fun early on. This is nowhere in the league of ""The Iron Giant,"" which was Brad Bird's last feature, and written by Tim McCanlies from the wonderful book. Here we have an okay super-hero story that looks good."

","The Incredibles was by far the best animated movie i have seen this year. If it is the best one ever, is yet to be seen. I loved this movie, there was a lot of hidden humor in it, and at 2 hours long, was by far its best feature.<br/><br/>The way they respect the ""real"" superheros of our life is great. I especially like how it did not make any mention to any of them, such as ""Batman"" ""Superman"" ""Spiderman"" and so on. These refreances would have made the movie good, but dated. Not mentioning any of them, gives this movie virtural immortality, as 1000 years from now, when Batman, Superman, and Spiderman are long forgotten, Mr. Incridble will still make sense."

","With every new release from Pixar, I have higher expectations. Incredibly (ha ha), they hit the mark every time. Not only did Pixar improve on their human characters (not their strongest in the past), they have more personality and expression than most actors out there. I'm not exaggerating. I was enthralled by every bit of the movie. The characters were very well-developed and the writing, as usual, was priceless - whether it be through dialogue or simply the situations the characters get themselves into. The story was, again, the best part of the movie but that's what Pixar's all about and that's what I love about that studio. Story first. Eye candy second. And let me just say there is a hell of a lot of eye candy. On top of a great story with more-than-believable characters, the graphics and sound floored me. I caught myself a few times with my mouth gaping open in sheer awe of what I was witnessing. From the explosions, fast camera action, and scenery to the character animation, ocean water and wet hair, you will be amazed. If anyone doesn't see this movie in the theaters, it would be an incredible shame."
"Pulpmariachi","10","0","1","8 November 2004"," Just So Awesome!
","This has got to be one of my favorite animated films, ever. Ranking up there with The Triplets of Belleville. Everything in this film just works so well, falling together perfectly. Each voice casting, the visuals, and the story. Brad Bird has to be one of my favorite animation directors (creating the excellent Iron Giant, and directing one of my personal favorite episodes of The Simpsons, ""Krusty Gets Busted"")and he masterfully displays his skill here.<br/><br/>This blows Finding Nemo away (which, I feel, was overrated) as well as anything else that Pixar released. And it deals with issues you'd never think you'd see in a Disney movie. Like infidelity and fights that occur within families. And then so many of the heroes die, though this is usually told in a flashback way and is really funny. <br/><br/>The story is excellent and the action sequences are intense. The forrest chase between the two kids and those razor bladed hover-things was great, reminding me of the speeder chase in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, except done MUCH BETTER. The final fight was just as intense. This time, with Samuel L. Jackson's Frozone coming in to kick some robo butt as well. Oh, and note how Samuel L. Jackson plays a character that freezes things, further defining how cool he actually is.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie is just so awesome. Better than a lot of things I've seen this year. Shrek 2 and Shark Tale, two other big computer animated releases, are left in this film's dust. In means of story and visuals. Visually, sometimes landscape scenes look so REAL, that you wonder if George Lucas is going to use them for the upcoming Star Wars film. And the characters interact in a real way too, that it seems the animators at Pixar had to hold themselves down so people remember that this is still an animated movie.<br/><br/>Kudos to you Brad Bird. For 115 minutes, you kept us gripped!"

","Following in the tradition of making family friendly, fun, beautiful and truly enjoyable animations, Pixar strikes another major hit with this one. They always stick to what kids love, and they don't forget that it's for the kid in all of us. Dreamworks' approach of trying to use flatulence humor, bodily functions, and other [they would call progressive] contents is appreciably absent from this masterpiece.

","Watched the movie with no expectations, but not a single cell of 'film' seems to have been wasted in this wonderfully crafted movie. Best all-round animation, with a fresh twist of fun, humour, and emotion since Shrek (the first one). It's a close call between the two, but if my life depended on it, I would go with The Incredibles. A shoo-in for the Best Animation Movie Oscar.<br/><br/>It's not just the animation, but the 'animotion' that captures the heart like no other animation film has done before, in my humble opinion.

"d_art","9","0","1","8 November 2004"," Look up in the sky! Is it a bird? Yes, it's indeed Brad Bird
","There's something very homey/cozy about The Incredibles the way Iron Giant (also directed by Brad Bird) was. It had a certain quietness to it where jokes don't need to be happening every few seconds (which Disney tries to do a lot--which also tries to cover up the shallowness of their storytelling), because, well, the whole idea and genre is funny in itself. The whole idea of an overweight, aging superhero working in an ill-fit cubicle with that certain expression on his face speaks volumes. It's not a type of joke you get by trying to verbally explaining it to somebody. Unlike the previous Pixar film ""Finding Nemo,"" this film goes for a more minimalistic, almost 2-D in nature, more expressive and animated. It's not breath-takingly realistic (although there are moments that blew me away) as it's more stylized, cartoony. Some will complain about certain slow spots as the story builds on the characters and situations (not much unlike Iron Giant), but that's where moments of clever ideas and dialogue sets in. While I visually enjoyed ""Finding Nemo,"" I have to say some of the inventiveness of such films as Toy Story series and Incredibles wasn't as prevalent in that movie.<br/><br/>In that sense, I found Incredibles to be much more satisfying than ""Finding Nemo"", ""Bug's Life"" and ""Monsters Inc."" It's not as up there as ""Toy Story 2"" (which I consider very very high in terms CG movies, and probably one of the best sequels ever made) but comes pretty close. I must say one of the reasons Pixar movies tend to be a step above most animations (even Shrek 2) is that beyond all the technical aspects, there's often something a little more deep, if not poignant, in the stories. Incredibles is no exception. The characters go through human struggles and obstacles that many people (even the fishes in Finding Nemo had human struggles) go through. They may not be exactly the same struggles we are familiar with, but there are certainly parallels. We may not have super-powers, but we all have certain gifts which we can maximize for good, or purpose. Many adults, who grew up with Superman, X-men, and Fantastic Four will find a lot of the powers quite familiar, and I must say I'm happy to see Ice-M..I mean, Frozone, utilize his powers in so many clever ways as well as all the other great characters. The way the film goes, it's pretty inevitable that there will most likely be a sequel, although I'm not sure if that basically means Disney, and not Pixar (which will move on from Disney), will work on the sequel (I'd love a sequel, only if Pixar does it). Overall, ""The Incredibles"" is clever, satirical, thoughtful, heart-warming, and extremely enjoyable. Among films I've seen this year, this film leaves a nice, satisfying grin in my face. 10/10"

","Every few years, the good people at Pixar Animation Studios see fit to bless us with a new masterpiece; thus has it been since they first revolutionized the world of animation with ""Toy Story"", one of the films that defined my childhood. For my money, ""Toy Story II"" was the best Pixar film; up until I saw ""The Incredibles"", that is. Now I'm not sure. After a second viewing, perhaps, things will be more clear. What is clear is that this is a remarkable film, one of the year's best. ""Shrek 2"" isn't fit to kiss it's boot. Pixar has always cast actors, rather than stars, in their films, and their outstanding casting work continues here; the only person who sticks out is Samuel L. Jackson, but he's just so cool that it doesn't matter. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are superb performers, and everyone contributing does a great job (including the director, Brad Bird). The film deals with some quite mature subject matter for a children's' film, including marital difficulties, midlife crises, and the hardships of normal life. The action in this film is a leap beyond anything that has ever been animated before, and puts most action movies to shame. I look forward to Brad Bird's next project, which I'm praying will be a sequel."

"Ziman","8","0","1","7 November 2004"," Another winner from Pixar
","In recent years, since the success of X-Men, we've been bombarded with superhero comic-to-screen conversions some doing a good job, others not so good. Needless to say, it's a new genre that seems to already be getting tired of itself as well as the fan interest. The Incredibles however is a refreshing new superhero film. Unlike the recent lore, it's not based on a comic book series and therefore does not need to conform to nor preserve any preconceived notion of what it 'ought' to be. Instead it is a completely unique creation from the folks at Pixar animation, who once again have dished out a winner.<br/><br/>As the story opens, we find Mr. Incredible (Bob Parr by day, and Craig T Nelson by voice) is one of many superheroes living in [insert name of anonymous metropolitan city here]. Co-existing with other heroes like Elastigirl and Frozone, who we also meet, they all hear the call of duty and rushed into action as regular as clock work Mr. Incredible is loved by the public, revered by law enforcement, and even has followers of fan clubs.<br/><br/>He is proud to serve, but also balances his own personal life as well as being a superhero.<br/><br/>That is until one member of the public sues Mr. Incredible and wins. This begins a long string of lawsuits against Mr. Incredible and various other superheroes that wind up placing them all into hiding never again revealing their super-identities to the public. That is until someone discovers Bob Parr's REAL identity and persuades him to come out of hiding to perform on more deed that only Mr. Incredible can accomplish <br/><br/>The Incredibles is yet ANOTHER amazing Pixar accomplishment. Each animation feat since their feature Toy Story has been an improvement on the one before. The animation details on several of the water and natural elements in The Incredibles leaves me to wonder at times, if it was shot photographically, rather than computer generated, the animation is THAT well done.<br/><br/>The Incredibles differs from its Pixar predecessors. Films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and even Finding Nemo are all targeted at children and have child-like qualities. This, however, is the first film from Pixar to achieve a PG rating and aptly so. The Incredibles' humour, dialogue, and story line surpasses the G-rated audience. Nothing in the film is offensive, mind you that's just not Pixar's way but I doubt most of the story would be appreciated by a younger crowd. However, since the original Toy Story audience has grown perhaps Pixar is merely growing up with them.<br/><br/>The voice acting was well chosen. I think Craig T Nelson was an incredible selection (if you pardon the pun) for the voice of Bob Parr. I'm curious as to how he Nelson has escaped voice acting until now. A decent actor in his own right, he possesses a commanding voice for this type of work, and especially this character. At times, I thought I heard hints of Adam West (TV's original Batman) coming through Nelson's performance a sure sign of his 'hero' quality. Holly Hunter also was well picked for Elastigirl. She comfortably strikes the medium between heroine and housewife by being commanding and authoritative, yet 'homey' and sweet. Samuel L Jackson serves up a comedic presence as Frozone, Bob Parr's best friend and a performance for Jackson that rivals his own from Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Although slow in spots, I still thoroughly enjoyed The Incredibles. It offers a great blend of action sequences and super-heroics, has fun with a bit of a satirical poke at superheroes in general, while at the same time offers it's own flavour of comedy that seemingly only comes from Pixar."
"Anansi00","10","0","1","7 November 2004"," Beyond Incredible
","Hardly an inspired header, is it? However, there is not a more fitting summary of this movie's merits. Pixar and Disney have given us some of the greatest animated movies ever created, as the IMDb's own Top 250 can attest.<br/><br/>However, it is not entirely accurate to say that they have raised the bar with every production--from ""Toy Story"" through ""Finding Nemo"", since every movie is its own, unique masterpiece. ""The Incredibles"" is a brilliant movie, a shining example of everything it has attempted to be: children's movie, blockbuster, superhero adventure, animation milestone, voice-acting standard. From a moviegoer who patiently waits the long months between the release of quality movies, this is one worth bragging about, a truly exceptional film.<br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" is about a world in which superheroes have been suppressed from public service after a wave of property-damage lawsuits and negative media coverage. The protagonists, husband and wife Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, are forced into a middle-class suburban life, where they and their children, Dash and Violet, languish in their pretentious lives. However, Mr. Incredible is soon contacted to don his costume again in secret, and soon the entire family is engaged in a battle against the sinister Syndrome, bent on revenge against all superheroes. The movie has plenty of excellent dialogue, clever humor, heartfelt emotion, and high-octane action. The general message of the movie (obligatory to every Disney production) is to never hesitate to be proud of your talents, and to not hesitate to be the best you can be.<br/><br/>I suppose this movie is, first and foremost, is a well-executed and entertaining kids' movie, fully in keeping with Disney's tradition of delighting children. Some say that the superhero theme, with so much violence and death, does not lend itself well to a movie for little kids. I say that superheroes have been a fundamental part of every generation since World War II, and that they have been a source of entertainment and role models in spite of, or perhaps in part because of, their serious aspects. Furthermore, this movie does an excellent job of keeping the violence non-threatening and generic; while there are cascades of explosions, there is no blood at all, and the few deaths are subtly implied. In fact, I would say that this movie takes the lightest tone throughout of all Pixar movies (there is nothing like the barracuda scene from ""Nemo"" in this one). Children will love the hilarious and heroic protagonists in this movie without being sacred by the antagonists, and at no point does the story lose their interest. The good and evil are clear and the moral is wonderfully delivered. As a children's movie, this is a definite classic.<br/><br/>While ""The Incredibles"" takes the cake for children's entertainment, ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Shrek 2"" have set box office records by being appealing to adult audiences. With explosions, colors, and an advertising blitz, this movie fits the characterization of blockbuster. Fortunately, it shares with ""The Return of the King"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" the distinction of being a brilliant job of screen writing and directing. The motivations of the characters as they exercise their powers are very real, and the James Bond-like plot takes its time on the establishment of backstory, character, and setting. This film is that rare wide-release that is driven by plot and character, not action sequences, yet has enough graphical and choreographical eye-candy (the latter must be a director's dream when done in CGI) to appease the most die-hard ""Die Hard"" fan. This is a movie with all the right ingredients for a blockbuster with staying power in the box office and in the years to come.<br/><br/>The past few years have been a blessing for the comatose superhero genre, with the production of Marvel Comics' ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" series, which have brought new credibility to the cape and cowl. ""The Incredibles"" is at once the superlative superhero adventure and an excellent spoof of the genre. The superheroes and villain, primarily Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, Violet, and Syndrome, are at once familiar (translations of Captain America, Mr. Fantastic, the Flash, Invisible Girl, and Lex Luthor), and yet innovative, with their powers both pertinent to the story and also used in innovative ways. The action sequences are captivating, inspired, and expertly executed, and the conflict, though generic, seems entirely original in this interpretation. Yet, the movie makes hilarious digs at the staples of the genre, scoring big laughs off of the impracticality of capes and villains' tendency toward ""monologuing"". Faithful but funny, this is exactly what a true superhero fan wants to see.<br/><br/>As regards animation, I have never seen a movie with better graphics. While we have been impressed by the milestones of ""Final Fantasy"" and ""Monsters Inc."", ""The Incredibles"" touches on the superlative. The streamline world within the movie is accurate right down to the reflections on the windows and the smoke from the explosions. The technology of the heroes and villains (the planes, the weapons, the doom robots) are inventive but as convincing as the latest in military technology. Though caricatured and stylized, the characters are genuine: Dash's movements are dead ringers for those of a little boy, Mr. Incredible's face expresses emotion as well as any actor's, and Violet's hair and Syndrome's cape are managed with astounding detail.<br/><br/>Finally, the casting and acting is superb, and not just the main characters--while Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter play both hero and parent flawlessly, and Jason Lee is a terrific villain, the minor characters, Wallace Shawn as Mr. Incredible's diminutive boss and director Brad Bird as costume designer Edna Mode (a lampoon of fashion icon Edith Head) make the movie complete. The dialogue, particularly amongst the family, is witty yet realistic, and the characters are no more outlandish than the characters you know in everyday life. Simply terrific acting, as it were.<br/><br/>That pretty much sums it up. ""The Incredibles"" is everything it wants to be, and everything that this viewer wants it to be."

","I'm not very good at reviewing movies. I just wanted to say in contrast to the other reviewer, that I thought this movie was wonderful and has now become my second favorite Pixar movie behind the lovely ""Toy Story 2"". The animation is, of course, top-notch and the characterizations are absolutely wonderful. Although the voices are not universally known, they are absolutely perfect for their characters. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are superb as the father and mother of this amazing family and Brad Bird is a hoot as the superhero fashion designer Edna Mode. There are lovely little moments in this film (though I think only the adults and older children will appreciate them) and there is certainly enough action and ""fun"" gross-out moments for the kids. My husband enjoyed the movie (he normally does not like animation) and my five-year-old tolerated the movie fairly well (some of the exposition was not ""stimulating"" enough for him). Having said that, I feel that small children (say four and under) will not get much out of this movie. In fact, I would say that this film is probably the most ""adult"" of the Pixar line. There are some great points made about relationships (mother/father/children, husband/wife) that may go over the heads of small ones. All in all, a pretty terrific movie that I would not hesitate to recommend with the small reservations listed above."

","The Incredibles is about a pair of superheroes who get married and raise their own family of super-power children. Trouble is, Mr. Incredible (the father), gets sued and the whole group has to be relocated several times to keep their identities hidden. A brewing crisis eventually causes the crime-fighters to take up old habits.<br/><br/>The film is action-packed and the animation helps to carry the plethra of jokes and sight-gags that The Incredibles and cast offer. This film is great fun for anyone, not just kids, and not just Pixar fans. With a solid story and unpredictable turns of events, this is definitely one worth the trip to the cine-plex."

","This movie is fantastic! Great direction, great script, great animation, great cast of characters! Considering how there has been a spew of family superhero films out there, this animated one is quite remarkable! And I think it works exceedingly well because it doesn't throw you into a mighty morphin mindset-- don't get me wrong I love the mighty morphin power rangers, especially the black ranger!)-- but back to this, the live people playing superheroes bit is getting old again. The new CGIs do a much terrific job, and the Incredibles is a case in point. <br/><br/>Bottom line, I left the movie theater wanting to see the next Incredibles movie. Even though this is a family friendly movie, there are a lot of explosions and somberness going on; but all in all, this movie has heart, comedy, and fun all rolled into two hours of incredible entertainment!"

","This movie is not what the previews and hype make it appear. It is not as funny (usually) as Toy Story or some of the others. It is not as ""kid-ready"" as the others. It has a real story. I read an interview with the Pixar people where they said they did not want to keep making the same movies with different characters. They wanted each movie to be really different. This movie is that certainly. <br/><br/>There is funny stuff in the movie but pretty soon, they do not seem like cartoon characters any more. They seem more like the comic book superheros.<br/><br/>I am a Plaintiff's lawyer but even I found it humorous that lawsuits drove the superheroes into hiding. Sad commentary but pretty humorous. The movie is really about how those superheroes would fare, and cope with, no longer saving the day. How do their children cope with having super powers they have to hide completely? As Mr. Incredible hits mid-life, and no longer looks or feels Incredible, what does he do? It would be wrong not to mention the son (Dash), who has superspeed and the fun he has in school with it. Who among us who ever read comic books or watched cartoons did not dream of having superspeed and doing the stuff he does? <br/><br/>I have heard people complain that the Incredibles are a lame knock-off of the Fantastic Four. Well, while it is true there are similar powers, this is really nothing like the Fantastic Four and it really does not attempt to be. If you are among those who hate the movie for this reason, you ought to find some better reason because the whole comparison to the Fantastic Four is pretty far out there. <br/><br/>This is a movie you should feel taking your children to see. It is also one that will keep the adults' attention. This is not one of my all time favorite movies, but it was a very good movie, presented in a very interesting way and something I enjoyed seeing. As I say in many of my reviews, if you enjoy the movie, it has done its job. Don't miss this one."

","This movie was wonderful. It was one of those movies that works on several levels effortlessly. I took my wife and kids (age 5 and 8) to this film and we all enjoyed it immensely. The audience applauded at the end. What was especially astonishing about this film was that, although it was an animated film about superheroes, it was more ""real"" than any movie I've seen in the last decade. The characters were well-developed and the dialogue was really genuine. It is seldom you can see an animated film where you can say the acting , character development and plotting were excellent!! This was better than ""The Lion King"", better than ""Beauty and The BEast"", better than ""Finding Nemo"", better than ""Spiderman I and II"", better than any other movie of 2004. It should definitely win an Oscar for best animated movie, and should be nominated for Best Picture also. Oh, and the special effects were masterful also."

","The Incredibles is another great movie in a long line of quality work from Pixar Studios. While The Incredibles will not be held in the level of esteem that Finding Nemo was held; it is still high end work. <br/><br/>The Incredibles is a story about superheros. Our hero's are sued for rescuing a victim and this act creates a domino effect. The rest of the world starts suing superheros and the superheros find that they are no longer wanted or needed. Thus, superheros now are ""retired"" and the government puts them into a program to find jobs and normal lives. The story shifts, from that point, to a time 15 years later. We find Mr. Incredible dealing with being an average joe, dealing with his family life, with his three children, dealing with his midlife crisis of wanting to get into the action again, and dealing with the fear of not being strong enough. The Incredibles works at every level of movie making. The acting (voice overs) are wonderful. Craig T. Nelson is great as Mr. Incredible. He plays the aging superhero as a man entering his mid-life crisis years. A man yearning for a chance to be a superhero again. Samuel Jackson is terrific as Mr. Incredible's friend Frozone. Jackson brings a very good comedic performance to the movie. The story was well written. The Incredible's script is probably the most complete script ever written for an animated movie. While it has it's aspect that children will enjoy (the computer animation); the movie is directed to all audiences. <br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend The Incredibles."

","I can't believe how inventive, fun, referential, cool, well acted and above all well-written the Incredibles was. The movie pieces together plot lines and ideas from stories as diverse as Robert Mayer's SUPERFOLKS and Alan Moore's WATCHMEN to make a very human story about a very Fantastic-Four-like family that we believe in and are amazed by. I've read comics all my life, and I'm also a graphic artist - so the mental images of 'superheroes in motion' has been part of my imagination since I was a child, but Pixar and Brad Bird reinvented the wheel with so much of what these characters do on screen, in clever and emotionally realistic ways. The action scenes were better than any I've seen in even live-action films for years.... The comedy and voice acting were impeccable. Craig T Nelson and Jason Lee were amazing... Syndrome was really fun, and it's about time someone found a way to bring the character look of 'Heat Mizer' back from those old Rankin Christmas cartoons... :) If you enjoy that feeling of 'Wow, that movie was so good I wanna see it again', then go check out the Incredibles asap.

This is a movie that can truly be seen by anyone, with plenty to appeal to both kids and adults. My friends (all childless people in their 20's) loved it and I spoke to a man who took his grandson and they both loved it. This is an example of what's missing in the movies these days: good, clean movies with redeeming social values that leave you with a positive feeling as you exit the theatre. This isn't just a movie about retired superheroes; it's also about a family that is bordering on the edge of dysfunction until they all begin to live up to their potential and start seeing the potential in one another.

I've never seen an animated feather that was as well thought out as this one was. So many different slants on a superhero story were considered and added, even ones from a ""typical"" American family were included but with the superhero twist. Those just made it that much funnier. Not only is the story top rate and totally enjoyable, the animation is also. PIXAR has really taken it to a whole new level with how they've developed their animation. Its getting to the point where unless they morph everyone just a bit its tough to tell the real thing from the animation and I love that! On an informative note for those wanting to see the movie with their kids? Not only is it completely appropriate for kids (despite some adult humor sprinkled in), there's even a quaint little movie short in the beginning that seemed to enthrall all the kids. I say that because while the laughter from the crowd was loud, there wasn't a single issue from any of the children there. EVERYONE got their money's worth down to the youngest child.

The writers are able to portray how this family has to struggle to ""fix in"" in the ""normal"" world around them and hide their ""gifts"". The story is well played out, though it does lag in parts, that doesn't last very long and although a few scenes may be too intense for younger child, they play out quickly. The animation is so realistic that you won't believe your eyes. Pixar just keeps getting better and better. They keep raising the standard of animated features.

","This is probably my favorite Pixar picture to date. The animation is top-notch, including several very high-speed action scenes. The characters are believable, and arguably developed quite well, not to mention very well-cast (particularly Gilbert Huph, played by Wallace Shawn, whose brief appearance is reminiscent of his role as The Great Vizzini in ""The Princess Bride""). There's just enough satire and predictability to both satisfy and amuse all but the most critical audience. And the humor is prevalent throughout, but never detracts from the point. All in all, I'd say it's everything you could want in a movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm sure I'll be seeing it again soon."

","Superman, Daredevil, The X-Men, and The Amazing Spider-Man  classic comic-book superheroes that have captured the imaginations of not only young children, but those young at heart as well across the world. Though they may have started off small in the two-dimensional world of the nickel comic-books, their popularity began to grow and expanded into spectacular franchises that were developed in the areas of television series, movies, and merchandising. Some have done better then others  as of this writing, Ben Affleck is still not speaking to Tobey Maguire  but no matter what the success, there will always be an audience for these fascinating figures. What is the cause for our fascinating fixation with these individuals and their seamlessly conventional plot-lines that are all basically a regurgitation of the vintage hero myth? In a way, we understand what the hero is going through and connect with the overwhelming obstacles that block his/her path to achieving his/her goal, what ever that may be. These amazing individuals are experiencing the same events we have experiences in our own lives, on an obviously different plane of course, and as they go about achieving their objectives, we look to them for inspiration in do so in our own time and place in the world.<br/><br/>The story centers on a family of superheroes that try and go about their daily, normal lives as civil citizens while at the same time concealing their extraordinary powers in an effort to blend in with the regular populous. Bob Parr, a faithful husband and father of three children, drives every day to work for a sleazy insurance company that cares more about their stockholders then their own clients, only to drag himself back home and repeat the process for the rest of the year. While at work, Bob dreams of the glory days when he was the world's greatest superhero, known exclusively as Mr. Incredible! That all came to an end when he was sued by a man he saved who apparently didn't want to be saved (he leaped off the top of a building in an attempt to commit suicide). This, of course, set off a string of frivolous lawsuits against all superheroes, costing the American government, as well as the taxpayers of this country, millions of dollars. The league of superheroes were eventually forced into retirement and relocated to new locations in order to live out a life of solidarity and blend in with the rest of normal society, never to use their powers for the collective good of humanity again. One night, Bob discovers an envelope in his briefcase that holds a communication device asking him to come to a secret island and take care of a rampaging robot located there that has been terrorizing a scientific organization established on the tropic location. When it turns out to be a trap, the rest of his family, including his wife, daughter and son, must summon up their abilities in order to rescue the patriarch of the Incredible family and save the day before the world is doomed. The story for The Incredibles is, for the most part, unfortunately clichéd and excruciatingly predictable, but, then again, isn't every film about superheroes that way? How so? Within the first five minutes of the film, you've discovered who the villain is and determined in which direction the storyline is heading toward, which, in essence, eliminates any real surprises that would occur within the course of the two hour feature. Don't let this matter bother you too much though. The more appropriate question that should be asked about this film is whether or not The Incredibles still manages to be overly entertaining and the answer would unanimously be yes. See, that's the amazing thing about Pixar  they can take a cookie-cutter storyline, throw in a few dozen lovable characters, mind-blowing visual work, and pure-concentrated emotions, unveiling an absolutely genuine and memorable experience at the movies.<br/><br/>Once again, as was the case with Finding Nemo, Pixar decides to live on the edge and create an animated film featuring few famous voices  actually, the only truly recognizable name would be Samuel L. Jackson  but if it worked before, it is certainly worth a second attempt at least. Craig T. Nelson, best known as for his television series Coach on ABC, fits perfectly into the voice-role of the leading man, Mr. Incredible. Nelson truly puts effort into voicing the emotions of Bob Parr  from being frustrated at work, to uninterested and down in the dumps back at home, to emotionally distraught at the possible loss of his family. This is another prominent area where Pixar excels beyond other studios, namely in choosing figures who are perfect for the leading role, not just because their name would look good on the marquee, but that they effectively move the film forward consistently and thoroughly with their emotional performance. Samuel L. Jackson, who voices the ultra-cool Frozone, is unfortunately underused in the film. Granted, he isn't a central character  he's more of a supporting role, the buddy figure to the Mr. Incredible figure, but still essential none-the-less  but he could have been given more scenes then the ones you can just as easily see located in the film's trailers. An absolute waste of perfectly good talent it would seem. John Ratzenberger, known exclusively as the lucky charm of the Pixar Animation Studios, is highly underused in this feature. This isn't asking for him to be given a leading part or anything of that sort, but let's not wait to use him for the very end, and if you do, not just a mere few words. This was disappointing to say the least but nothing to go ballistic about. And last, but not least, Edna Mode, voiced brilliantly by writer/director Brad Bird  is there anything this man can't do  is the most original and effective creation presented in the film. Viewed as the fashion feminista to the superhero stars, she may not be a central character based on the actions on screen, but audiences won't care as she manages to deliver the most laughs out of anyone else.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredibles, despite lacking the tenacious punch of such previous Pixar success stories as Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc., still manages to engage viewers and connect with them in such a spectacular and seamless way that it makes them - well, incredible. One of the film's main problems is its serious lack of humor, at least early on, but even when it is able to get revved up by the second half, the laughs aren't as consistent and thorough as they were in either Monsters Inc. or even Finding Nemo. Don't take this the wrong way, there are plenty of amusing sequences to be found throughout the feature  this bears repeating, Edna Mode practically steals every scene she's in  they're just fewer and farther between then has been seen in previous Pixar efforts. In reality though, this helps a lot as it allows the story to be set up properly, as predictable as it may be on the surface, and the emotional attachment to the characters to set in with audience members, so that when things really do begin to pick-up, we are in eager anticipation to witness what comes next. Another problem the feature has to deal with, besides the 'been there, done that' atmosphere it invokes, is the fact that the actions of the film begin to feel like a broken record. It just begins to feel like a continuous loop of sequences  someone's in danger then they get out of it then they're in danger again, etc. As Mr. Incredible said once, 'I feel like the maid  can we try and keep this clean for ten minutes', how about we try something and then move on with a vastly different story idea instead of the same one over and over again. These are relatively minor quips though and shouldn't be taken for too much face value when evaluating this film with your family. The talented artists and animators at Pixar Animation Studios have truly out done themselves this around. And to think, you thought you've seen everything with Finding Nemo! There are moments where you'll believe Syndrome's Island is an actual island  the palm trees, the ocean water, and the daunting aerial view of the location are astonishing. And the waterfalls  truly breathtaking. There are so few words to accurately describe the feeling you get watching the visuals of this film  this after drooling over the latest Star Wars prequel teaser trailer moments before. And finally, in all honesty, The Incredibles has to be Disney and Pixar's most adult-skewed animated feature to date  not only does it showcase an array of dramatic explosions and presumed deaths, the touchy subjects of adultery and suicide are even touched upon in the two hour film. Even though a lot of this material will probably go over the head of youngsters, be well aware that questions may pop into their inquisitive minds and may be asked of you later on, so be prepared to answer them should they come up. Bottom-line, The Incredibles may not be Pixar's most superior film to date  Finding Nemo had more adorable characters and Monsters Inc. had far more laughs  but its an entertaining family film that gives every single member of the family something to talk about for weeks, or even months, to come going into the busy holiday season.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A-)"
"pete-131","Null","0","1","5 November 2004"," Pixar gets better and better
","This was the first time I decided to go and see a Pixar movie in a theater, and had been the first time I had seen an animated movie in a theater in...almost 10 years I'd say. I had seen for months and months the work and promos going into this movie, ""save the day"" and boy oh boy they didn't disappoint. Pixar has blown my mind with this movie, when I went to see it, it was mostly older teenagers and adults, so you can see that Pixar is really starting to expand their audience. The movie didn't have to be funny, but when it was funny it was worth a laugh, but the action sequences, and animation was the real story here. I always relied on past Pixar films to get me with their comedy, but this movie was all action and superheros. For once I felt like a kid again seeing a movie that I totally went nuts over. Animation with Elastigirl was stunning, Mr Incredible's heart will own you, Dash was the fastest thing I had seen to ever hit the big screen, Violet is so quick to make you try to find her with her invincibility and the age old forcefield, Jason Lee as Syndrome was killer for me, as a bad guy I loved him. Edna Mode was hilarious and so well done.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of action in it, so if parents have taken their kids to see previous Pixar movies, approach it with caution as there is a fair share of violence, but it is done in good taste and enough that the whole family can enjoy it.<br/><br/>Bravo Pixar! you all did it again! see it on the big screen, it is totally meant to be seen this way, and I can't wait for the DVD as I am sure the sound will be spectacular for home theater.<br/><br/>Cars....2005"

","One of the best action films I've seen in a long time. I've read many suggestions that it is borrows from Spy Kids, James Bond, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yes. Yes. And yes. But personally, I thought differently. Remarkably, I had the same response to this film as I had when I first saw Star Wars. For those of you who have seen this movie, your response to that statement might be, ""huh?"" Let me explain. When I originally saw Star Wars, several things happened: first , I was absorbed into a world so different than my own, but when all was said and done , it became as real as anything I've ever experienced. Secondly, we all knew then and there that this was the future of special effects. Thirdly, be it ultra cool Han Solo; wanna be hero Luke; or uber-female Princess Leia, many people could identify with the characters. This film transforms animation, like Star Wars did for it's genre, from the present into the future. It does so because everyone involved aspires to excellence. They succeed by creating animated landscapes incredibly rich in detail, by developing movement and action that is, at times, simply exhilarating, and by brilliant ""acting"" so rich with nuance, humor, and emotion that voice and drawing merges into a full fledged human. In fact, when I think about it, other than Harrison Ford, the one lingering difference between Star Wars and this film , other than the obvious - plot, was that the acting was better in this film. If you saw Star Wars ... and you did ... you saw the future of science fiction. If you see this film, you will see the future of animation. And the force is with them both."
"tcutbirth","10","0","1","5 November 2004"," Quite possibly the finest Animated feature...*ever*
","I've said (to anyone who would listen) that ""The Iron Giant"" is the finest animated film of the past 30 years. Unbelievably overlooked, and under-promoted, the film scratched at perfection on several levels (character design/development, casting, direction, scripting, artwork, performance, etc.). Now Brad Bird has finally done it - after first viewing, I honestly can't think of a way to improve on this film. It was amazing on every level that a film can be - you simply have to see it for yourself to understand what I'm talking about. If we treated film makers the way we treated silly (but outstanding) athletes, we would hoist Brad up on our shoulders, let him cut down the net, then dump Gatorade over his head while interviewing him about being MVP of the Millennium. I'll stop now, because Bird and Pixar achieved, through film, what words are completely incapable of describing or accomplishing.<br/><br/>Whew...I got that off of my chest! <br/><br/>P.S. It was also fun to see the ""Revenge of the Sith"" trailer, accompanied by shouts and enthusiastic applause."
"somf","10","0","1","5 November 2004"," Sure is hard not to use the word incredible in this one line intro...
","I saw this flick and thought to myself that Pixar has actually bettered themselves once again. It is truly an amazing achievement by this company. Each and every one of their films has gotten better. A part of this can be attributed to technical proficiency of the art form, but more important is the terrific stories. I really enjoyed myself throughout this entire film and often had my jaw open in amazement during the action scenes. And one more important achievement of this film is the unique vision that Brad Bird brought to the table. It really offsets ""The Incredibles"" from any previous Pixar film. The PG rating is a bit telling in that my 5 year old daughter didn't enjoy this one half as much as her mom and myself,but from 7 or 8 on everyone will love this film. I do not mean to imply that ""The Incredibles"" is too intense for 6 and under. I'm just not sure it plays as well to them as say a Shrek or a Disney animated tale. Of course it may play better to boys of that age. Which brings me to my next observation. NO way , and I repeat NO Way will Pixar outdo themselves once again in 2005. The trailer at the beginning of the Incredibles was for next years release ""Cars"" which looked fairly pedestrian. However if I were an 8 year old boy...then maybe I'd be getting excited already."
"DataDroid","10","0","1","5 November 2004"," The best superhero movie ever made.
","If you are reading this and haven't seen The Incredibles yet, slap yourself in the face for being stupid and go out and see it now!<br/><br/>. . . OK, now that you've hopefully seen the movie, let me tell you my thoughts on it. <br/><br/>Superhero movies seem to be all the rage now, and no wonder. Superheroes let the producers' imaginations run wild with fantasy in the modern (or near-modern) day. Just look at Spider-Man, the X-Men, Superman, and the list goes on. These are people with whom we can relate but who can do things that, while we know them to be impossible, for just a moment in the light of the silver screen, we can believe. While the X-Men movies were good, and the Spider-Man movies (particularly the second one) were great, I say now that Pixar has just created the best superhero movie ever made, and quite possibly the best movie of the year. <br/><br/>Bob Parr, a.k.a. Mr. Incredible, is a man blessed with super-strength, a beautiful wife (Helen, a.k.a. Elsatigirl), and three children. Oh yeah, did I mention he's stuck in a superhero protection program, working a lousy job at an insurance company and growing more and more frustrated with being unable to use his superpowers? <br/><br/>You see, superheroes, while they do save the day, tend to cause a lot of collateral damage, and with damages come lawsuits. You didn't think the secret identity was just for mysteriousness, did you? In fact, in order to keep them from having their spandex sued off, superheroes are given new identities and locations by the government in the aforementioned superhero protection program. Besides lawsuits, superheroes have to deal with people who idolize them, sometimes to the point of extreme annoyance. All in all, life for Bob is less than it could be. <br/><br/>His only outlet for his frustration is his time with his good friend Lucius Best, a.k.a. Frozone (voiced hilariously by Samuel L. Jackson), who go out on ""bowling night"" to perform undercover superhero work.<br/><br/>This all changes when he receives a message from a mysterious and beautiful blonde, offering him a chance to get back into superhero gear again. What he does and how his family gets involved will not be covered in this review, just know that The Incredibles has scenes that will make you split your sides laughing, ones that might make you cry, action scenes that put Jerry Bruckheimer to shame, scenes so tense you will bite your nails, and ones that may even make you think about your own life a little. Not only is this the best superhero movie ever made, but it is the best movie I have seen this year. <br/><br/>10/10"
"Belledandy","Null","0","1","5 November 2004"," Brad Bird, welcome home
","Most people have said it already - fantastic movie. <br/><br/>However, this is a cue to those of you debating on whether to see it based on previous Pixar movies: It's very much more a Brad Bird film than a Pixar film. If you loved Iron Giant, you will love Incredibles. If you loved Nemo and Monsters Inc because they were cute and endlessly gag-packed, be warned - Incredibles is definitely more an action-adventure than a comedy. It's rated PG for a reason. But unless you have toddlers, don't let that stop you! It's another amazing world created by Pixar, an intensely involving story and another wonderful of characters to embrace. enjoy!"
"gob_666","8","0","1","5 November 2004"," Pixar Saves the Day!
","With their most recent effort, championed entirely by Brad Bird, Pixar saves the day fashionably.<br/><br/>With their most interesting effort to date, The Incredibles, Pixar at last factors in human characters (much more associable to the average family, superpowers excluded) and puts their special effects wizardry to work in new, exciting ways. I thought the action scenes would be boring CGI circle-jerks, but instead were genuinely interesting and added to the movie.<br/><br/>It had plenty of great laughs (from seeing Mr. Incredible work at an Insurance Firm, to the brilliant character Edna 'E' Mode) excellent effects and action, and enjoyable (even rich at times) characters.<br/><br/>But, like every other Pixar movie, its strongest asset is its core idea (it is the antithesis of what made movies like Shark Tale fail): The story has a simple, universal core idea: Evil is afoot, and those who are good most conquer obstacles to stop it. Like Finding Nemo (where the goal was for little Nemo to make it home to his dad to be happy again), it has such a central, universal theme that works so well. <br/><br/>The Incredibles raises but one question: Is Pixar capable of making a bad film?"

","Coming out of the theater, kids were absolutely charged after seeing this movie. My group of 50's, 30's and kids all had a good time. The plot is solid tale of the Disney genre focused more on the moral lesson of self-esteem than being particularly original. Craig Nelson and Holly Hunter give decent voice performances, but the rest of the cast (in my opinion) far eclipse them. The film is entertaining, has a good amount of humor, but holds very few surprises. I think the disappointment some expressed in the animation fails to appreciate that the dialog, direction, visual style and backdrops are all appropriate to the particular time period a given scene is set in. The animation is secondary to the artistic effects. The film is shot primarily as if traditional live-action cameras were used, with very few artificial perspectives. I think if you look to what are now animation classics, like ""The Lion King"" - you'll find that it is the attention to the background detail that gives the film such visual appeal. ""The Incredibles"" is very focused on that same idea. It is for that reason that I rate it very highly - it's a fun evening out with the kids, and the creative attention to setting and detail that make it stand out."

Why not add Jack Jack in there.<br/><br/>They were all animated brilliantly. Edna Mode was written and designed so well. Elastigirl really looked, and felt like a mother in trouble, always having to stretch to make the family work. Dash was amazing, funny, and had one of the best chase scenes I have ever scene in a movie. Violet to me was underrated. She wasn't used enough but still amazing.

","I dislike misleading advertising. I shared the impression of many that this was another Pixar comedy. I was surprised by the longer movie that had far fewer jokes. However, this is not a negative, simply a difference.<br/><br/>This is one of the better super hero movies of all time. In a year that saw Spiderman 2, this is some extra comic book goodness that is totally unexpected. It has introduced a new universe for the 'talented' to play in. It was a great ride, well balanced and the action felt far more real than I would have expected from an animated film. <br/><br/>The one thing I wish had been pointed out is the fact this is NOT for young children. While one of my kids loved it, the other was very scared at several parts. If your children have seen past action movies and were okay with them, then they're safe for this one. There is no gore, but many deaths and jarring scenes with sudden appearances of 'bad guys'. The very end especially was difficult for my youngest. I don't want to spoil any story points but take it from me that this type of ending is hard for kids.<br/><br/>I found that I wished I had seen this with just my husband, but I think that's because I just didn't want to share. I didn't want to be distracted by my children's questions. I wanted to enjoy the movie just for me. I will defiantly be seeing this one again."
"cafesmitty","Null","0","1","5 November 2004"," Pixtar ups the Ante (and then some)
","This film is simply amazing and is such a joy to watch. The animation is so fluid,colorful and so first class. Pixtar made a film which combines not only top notch animation, but a very good story and great action. At times you your jaw will hit the floor and your mind will be will with such wonderment on how well the film flows and the incredible scenes you are watching on the screen. You can tell that such care and master craftmanship went into the production of The Incredibles. Wonder voice overs are provided by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson. The film is about retire superheroes who have adjusted to their humdrum life and having to reluctantly (and not so reluctantly) come out of retirement and do the superhero thing all over again. If you are an adult, this film will turn you into a kid again. Between Dreamworks (for Shrek and Shrek2) and Pixtar (Finding Nemo, Toy Story and The Incredibles), it is now safe to take your whole family to the movies again. For your hard earned dollars I can't think of a better film to spend your money on then this one. So go see it for yourself. Take your kids, take your nieces and nephews, your grandkids, your grandparents and perhaps the family dog and go see a movie that is all of that AND a bag of chips (in this case popcorn)."
"kgprophet","8","0","1","5 November 2004"," Not the Best Pixar ever - but great anyway
","One thing I will hand to Pixar, they are acknowledging their adult fan base. Adult oriented animation is growing mainstream. This animation feels more like a regular film in that respect. We now take for granted the spectacular animation, so we pay attention to the story and characters. The story is not the most original - some have brought up the similarity to ""Spy Kids"" and I will concur. The very thing you will notice is much less humour. Once again this is not a bad thing, because we are given a more fleshed out relationship between the father and mother. Also, one of the kids definitely is a rebel, a nice touch to show that there no longer is such a thing as a nuclear family in this day and age. <br/><br/>The film tries to unshackle the world of make believe as you watch this film, though only so far. With heavy music cues and 60's era production design, we are left no doubt that the audience is supposed to be thinking ""James Bond"" as we watch our hero's venture on to the villain's island base of operations. But there is one cool difference with this film. In many recent live-action adventure films, there would be a point where it was obvious that we were no longer looking at live actors, but pure CGI. The complaint rising out of this was ""I can just stay home and play a video game"". In ""The Incredibles"", we know this all pure CGI, so we don't need to lodge that complaint. Also, Pixar shows that our heroes are sometimes fallible. <br/><br/>Now to the technical side of things. I liked ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" purely because of it's loving depiction of the cool look of the era. In this case, all the cool things from the early 60's are lovingly rendered in this film, from cars with lots of chrome, to traditional ""Metropolis"" skylines, to the jazzed up mega-stylish sets from the old Bond films. Indeed, it seems that Pixar polled their animators to see what their dream animation pieces would be, and they are all lovingly displayed neatly into the storyline. There is the ""Doc Ock"" machine, giving it realistic destructive capabilities. Then is the completely left field character who designed the superhero costumes. Her house is all things art-deco. There are comic book moments, car chases, tremendous point-of-view action shots, realistic lava, a fantastic waterfall, and on and on. <br/><br/>I do not know the budget for this film, but there are many many setups, all with greatest 3D animation so far ever scene (until ""Cars"" comes out next year). Some looking far more realistic than the previously mentioned CGI shots from other live-action films. The shirt and coat the main character wears is far more realistic than the CGI coat worn by CGI Keanu Reeves in ""Matrix Reloaded"". Water, hair, and fire effects are similarly realistic. <br/><br/>The only complaints? We see too little of Samuel Jackson's character, and we don't get too concerned about the peril our heroes get in, because we know they will survive to get our prerequisite happy ending. But then again, everyone knows that this will spawn a sequel, so who cares?<br/><br/>I give this a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Added 6/13/08: Alas no sequel is in the cards, it shows how much work went into the success of the original project. This film still remains one of my favourites."

"tylergfoster","Null","0","1","2 November 2004"," Pixar saves the day again
","www.funkdiggityfresh.com<br/><br/>Some movies take the world and look at it from another angle. The wonder of Pixar movies, however, is that the filmmakers there create the world, down to the tiniest detail, before they turn it upside down. Each of their films is its own universe, viewed through a special set of eyes, and The Incredibles gives us the life of a superhero: not as funny as the life of a toy or a monster, maybe, but still thrilling, inventive, and action-packed.<br/><br/>The Incredibles follows Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson), whose career, along with all of the world's superheros, is put to rest by a string of lawsuits. In the aftermath, the government initiates a superhero relocation program, giving these men of steel office jobs, normal lives, and suburban homes. But Mr. Incredible simply can't stand it, and when a mysterious offer shows up dangling the possibility of being super again in front of him, he snatches up the opportunity, behind the back of his wife, Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter). <br/><br/>Of course, Pixar is one of the best studios working in film today, much less animation. Their films always contain great characters, story and visuals, and up until now, they've also been hilarious. The Incredibles, however, turns out to be more of an action-adventure than a comedy, but don't worry, it's one of the most fun action-adventures of the year. The superhero element adds a fast-paced style to the movie that never lets up, with death-defying stunts, explosions, close calls, and some showstopping fight sequences.<br/><br/>Of major note is that this is the first Pixar animated feature to contain human characters. While of course these characters are not photorealistic, ala Final Fantasy, Pixar has managed to breathe more life into their animated heroes than some live-action movies can. The characters are fluid, likable, and can display as wide a range of emotion as any actor. Add to this great performances by the voice cast, including Nelson and Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, and you have some well-rounded performances by the voices and the bodies they're meant to go with.<br/><br/>Then there's just the look in general. These are the coolest CGI worlds Pixar has ever done, and on top of that, they're infused with a great retro style, bringing to mind adventure serials, superhero comic books from the 60's, and some modern touches of today (not to mention a little dash of Star Wars). There was an art book for Finding Nemo, and that movie was beautiful, but I'd be even more interested to read a book on The Incredibles. <br/><br/>All of this is thanks to the direction of Brad Bird, who also directed the great 1998 feature The Iron Giant. Bird keeps the story moving, the energy high and the movie fun. The Incredibles crackles, alive in every corner of the frame. The movie is exhilarating to watch, and a lot of fun to look at. Brad Bird deserves to do more movies in the future, his eye for visuals and action are excellent, and he knows how to keep a movie from dragging. He also doesn't include unnecessary parodies or references to pop culture, a relief after the oversaturation of PDI's Shrek 2. <br/><br/>But having gushed about the movie, because it deserves it, now the flaws have to be addressed, because The Incredibles is not perfect. Compared to the other Pixar movies, the plot falls a bit flat. It seems the script could have used a few more runs through their genius machine to iron out a few predictable points, and to make the script more accessible to anyone -- more than any of their others, The Incredibles feels like a children's film. And yet, the movie is off-puttingly violent. Sure, it's no worse than Star Wars, but that's certainly more intense than the other films that Pixar has made. Lastly, the finale feels rather flat, unlike the exciting blasts of energy provided by the door vault in Monsters, Inc. or the baggage carrier in Toy Story 2.<br/><br/>In the end, however, The Incredibles is solid entertainment. John Lasseter and the incredible amount of talent at Pixar, and director Brad Bird are superheros in themselves. Somehow, they've managed to dodge the bullets and lift the obstacles that most filmmakers encounter, and they've done it in the most perilous movie genre ever: the family film. The Incredibles marks their sixth success in a row, and it reminds us that we're all safer, at least, in the world of computer animation, knowing that Pixar is around to save the day."

","I was lucky enough to see this movie at the London Film Festival yesterday. I am in the CG industry myself (I direct an animation company and I am an animtor myself) so, of course, I was eager to see this release. Every time I watch a Pixar movie it blows me away, much more so than any movie from Dreamworks (PDI, Shrek etc.). But this movie went way beyond my expectations for a CG movie. Pixar have the most talented animators and software engineers in the world of CG there is no doubt about that. They seemingly effortlessly blur the boundaries between 2D animation and 3D animation which until now has been the goal of any CG company. The movie is fast and furious and the characters feel real. They mimic real life in a way I've not seen before, the heroes are a whole family so the movie will touch every member of the family that watches it. I have to say that ""The Incredibles"" is the best animated movie I have ever seen ! I really cant say much more than that apart from ""how the hell can Pixar top this movie ?"" I guess we will have to wait for ""Cars"" to find out."

","Without giving anything away, there hasn't been a better film this year. Hands down the best superhero film yet made. Exceptionally well written, paced, acted, and designed. The voices work well, too. I cannot wait to see this film again, which is not what I can say about most recent films, especially superhero films. Hellboy was OK, but the script by Peter Briggs was obviously an amateur effort. Spiderman was fun, and the sequel was even MORE fun--but like Hellboy, for kids. The original Superman Movie was the best until The Incredibles, however. <br/><br/>Kudos to all the workers at Pixar who've now hit 6 for 6 . GREAT JOB!!! And Thank You."
"geesuz","Null","0","1","25 October 2004"," The BEST Pixar movie yet GO SEE IT! NOW!
","It was worth going through the extra security for the advance screening. This is an excellent movie. Go see it. Go see it ten times. I think it might just be the best movie Pixar has put out - or at least a tie with the first Toy Story. It combines all the best of both the James Bond and Super hero genres...go see it! Sure, it looks cool - but the character work and the script (pay attention Dreamworks and Disney) is what makes it spin. You can bounce a quarter off of any part of this film - it's solid storytelling. It's one of those films that you want to see again - right after you just saw it. Brad Bird is a genius. And a big thank you to Brad for giving us a lil' Frank and Ollie, animation legends, one last time."
"kurtliu","10","0","1","23 October 2004"," The Newest and Best Disney-Pixar Movie
","I saw this movie at a screening couple days ago. It was very hilarious and entertaining. The storyline is pretty interesting, with many twists and turns. The movie is full of excitement, action and humor. It's so much fun to watch it. There are many movies that's been made about a single superhero, but The Incredibles is about a superhero family. Each member in the Incredibles Family has his/her own special abilities. They work together as a team to save themselves and the world from evil. I liked The Incredibles a lot not only because it showed how the superheroes are extraordinary, but it also presents the ordinary lives of the superheroes when they are not using their special abilities. Even though this movie is presented in a very funny way, it emphasizes themes such as love, family, growing up, conscience, and of course, good and evil."

","I got to go to a screening of this film as well -- and I've gotta tell ya, this movie was great. If you miss this film this fall, you'll miss an incredible film.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil it with writing spoilers -- but this movie is fun, funny and absolutely great. Pixar does it again, Brad Bird also makes his mark here with a wonderful funny, family and friendship story.<br/><br/>Take the kids (6/7 years old on up), take the parents, grandparents, college students, and all your rowdy friends...<br/><br/>I'm a fan..and cannot wait to see it AGAIN on its Nationwide opening!!!"
"junkmail-5","10","0","1","12 October 2004"," I saw it. Absolutely INCREDIBLE
","I got to go to the first public screening of this on Monday, and holy holy holy crap.<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely incredible (har!). I'll even go out on a limb to say it's the best pixar movie yet. I got to talk to the director and got his autograph on a poster too, in an unrelated side note.<br/><br/>Pixar movies always have some of everything and something for everyone, but this one had MORE of everything and MORE for everyone. On top of that, in many ways it could be a standalone action movie, whereas previous pixar movies had to support their action with sight gags and comedy - they've evolved to being able to keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat with straight-up action.<br/><br/>I'm trying not to say too much because Brad Bird asked us not to give anything away, but I'll say that the preview, as awesome as it is, really doesn't scratch the surface. Right from the opening scene I was laughing, and straight through I couldn't stop. Even the tense suspenseful parts, I found myself laughing at the sheer *goodness* of it, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again on Nov 5!"
"email-erin","8","0","1","11 October 2004"," Incredibly Fun
","Overall, clever, funny, very well animated, and a lotta fun.<br/><br/>I saw this movie as the first public premiere followed by a Q&A session with the director. First of all, I was very impressed with the CG work ... especially the fine details of the characters' hair strands. The depth of the characters' personalities was also quite appealing, superheroes with real life issues. The story was pretty clever and not very clichÃ©-laden with the usual superhero works (even though it might remind you of a coupla movies). There's also some humor that'll fly over the kiddies' heads which surprised me a little.<br/><br/>You're probably wondering how it compares to other Pixar films ... well, I really do feel that each film they produce just keeps getting better but each one stands on its own. The Incredibles was definitely more PG-ish than the others. Anyhow, this movie blows Sharktales outta the water!"
