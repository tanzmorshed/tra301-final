","I thought this was a film about Navajo code talkers. Well, it's not.  While there are a couple of Navajos in the film, the story revolves  around Nicolas Cage winning WWII all by himself. This guy's incredible  and makes John Wayne look like a wimp. Every time the Marines are in  trouble, up jumps good old Nicolas Cage with his Thompson and POOF! the  battle is WON! I wonder how we won WWII without Nicolas Cage? The film  has a LOT of combat footage and most of that is very well done. That  alone is worth a watch but don't expect to learn much of anything about  the Navajo code talkers. You should read about them, because theirs was  an important part of history, but they're a minor part in this film. I  gave it a 6, only because of the good combat footage."
"bmyers22","3","327","451","28 October 2006"," The most realistic war movie ever made
","I learned a lot about World War II from this film. First of all, during this war it was a custom of both the Japanese and Americans to scream every time you shoot or get shot (even with about 30 bullets in your chest you can still scream apparently). Secondly, Japanese soldiers do not like cover. They like to stay out in the open, and will not fire their rifles unless they're within 15 feet of American soldiers. Thirdly, one man with a Thompson sub-machine gun can take out an entire regiment of Japanese soldiers in an afternoon.<br/><br/>This film was completely first rate, start to finish. From the soldiers who flail about wildly as entire belts of machine gun ammo are pumped into them (before they drop to the ground mind you), to the 12 soldiers that Nicholas Cage shoots with a handgun while laying on his back wounded in the space of about 15 seconds, this film just screamed realism and authenticity. Highly recommended to history buffs and people who can appreciate some of the best acting ever put on film."
"ridleyrules","8","51","67","26 October 2005"," The Director's Cut is an improvement
","I just watched the director's cut on DVD after having seen the theatrical cut some time ago.<br/><br/>Plot summary: In WWII, a code based on the Navajo language was used to securely communicate between US troops in the Asian Pacific, without the Japanese eavesdropping. We follow two Navajo code talkers and their US Marine ""bodyguards"" as they go into combat on a Japanese island.<br/><br/>A lot has been written about this somewhat flawed John Woo movie. After having seen both versions, my main disappointment is still that the two code talkers seem like background characters. A movie with a lower budget, without big Hollywood stars put in the foreground would probably have been more satisfying. Maybe that movie should have been done by another director too, I don't know. <br/><br/>Enough good ""general"" war movies have been made. The code talker part of the story should have been made much more pivotal as was done here.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Woo's Hong Kong and Hollywood work. The director's cut of Windtalkers doesn't turn a mediocre Woo film into a masterpiece, but it is certainly an improvement.<br/><br/>Main advantages of the DC are more fleshed out characters. You get more background on all main characters, including the two Navajo code talkers. I felt more involved. As a result, the code talker part of the story is served better, but still not enough to my taste. The DC also has more uncut battlefield scenes. Woo really shows his talent here, with raw yet beautifully shot war action. You get the sense that you are in the middle of the action.<br/><br/>I was particularly interested if a scene was put back in where a US soldier takes a golden tooth from a Japanese corpse. This scene was described in several documentaries about censorship by the US Army. Not completely surprisingly, this scene was also absent from the DC.<br/><br/>If you are a Woo fan or already appreciated the theatrical cut, it may be worth checking out the director's cut.<br/><br/>My ratings: 6/10 for the original cut. 8/10 for the director's cut."
"rah25","7","53","74","24 November 2003"," Great action sequences but little emphasis on story
","When watching the trailer of Windtalkers, one gets the impression that this film is about the Navajo indians and how their native language was used to create a code that could not be broken by the Japanese.  However, it turns out that this film is really about a white army seargeant (Nicolas Cage) and how he eventually befriends the codetalker (Adam Beach) that he is responsible for protecting.<br/><br/>Director John Woo doesn't disappoint with the action sequences.  All of them are breathtaking and highly detailed.  However, all of this action tends to take away the emphasis on the story.  No matter, the scenes that show the developing friendship between the two seargeants (Cage and Christian Slater) and the codetalkers (Beach and Roger Willie) gives Windtalkers its heart. (7/10)"
"Critical Eye UK","1","88","130","21 April 2004"," Hot Air 1/10
","Warning: SPOILERS<br/><br/>If you live in the UK, a good guide to the quality of any movie is the review it gets in the best-selling 'News of The World' Sunday paper. Because the NoW's critical faculties are arguably less than those of an ant, a good review equals lousy movie; bad review: probably worth seeing. On which basis, the endorsement `One of the best war movies of all time -- News of the World' that features on the cover of the UK DVD Collector's Edition says it all: here indeed is one of the worst war movies of all time.<br/><br/>Quite why it should've been so is mystifying, for in the subject of the Navajo code talkers there's a genuinely interesting story: how they were recruited, the dilemmas they faced in signing up to war, the problems of integration, the heroism they showed and the regrettable secrecy that for so long obscured the nature of their contribution. . . in the hands of half-way proficient moviemakers, the code talkers' tale would've made for first class cinema.<br/><br/>Instead we get 129 tedious minutes of pyrotechnic mayhem, and a plot so ludicrous it's astonishing it even survived first pitch: that a codetalker has to be 'protected' by a guardian angel lest he fall into the hands of the enemy. Oh really?<br/><br/>The premise might've had some passing credibility had director Woo understood that remaking 'War and Peace' was not, in this instance, A Good Idea. But no: Woo moves remorselessly from one major league set-piece to another, in every one of which bombs, bullets, bayonets and shells rain down upon the unfortunate Navajo from left, right, behind, in front and above (thus making Nicolas Cage's advice to `make sure you follow my ass if you want to stay alive' one of the transparently daftest script lines of recent memory).<br/><br/>Far from taking care of the windtalker / codetalker, the US Army ensures - in this movie at least - that he has a survivability prospect of thirty seconds. Still, he is assisted by Cage, whose uncanny ability to survive veritable hails of gunfire is in inverse proportion to his ability to act: you'd have thought 'Captain Correlli's Mandolin' would've been disaster enough but no, Cage goes for broke in this one, distraught, depressed, dysfunctional, and alarmingly indiscriminating when it comes to shooting people (his own, and the enemy).<br/><br/>The good news though is that he doesn't get to play a musical instrument.<br/><br/>Two sequences do, however, stand out in this turgid mess. In the first, Cage allows himself to be captured by the enemy whilst pretending to be a prisoner of his Navajo charge, this sleight of hand being accomplished thanks to the fact that Adam Beach (who plays the Navajo) looks, er, Japanese.<br/><br/>Woo seems not to have noted that Beach doesn't even look like a Navajo, let alone a Japanese, but then, nor does the enemy, which for reasons known only to writers John Rice and Joe Batteer decides in this screenplay to implement a policy of actually taking prisoners instead of shooting all Americans on sight.<br/><br/>But perhaps they guessed it was Nicolas Cage.<br/><br/>In the second sequence, Cage rolls drunkenly around a battlefield graveyard, weeping for the souls of all the men who were killed when he was single-handedly taking the Solomon Islands at the start of the movie. (Seeing as they were spared from the rest of 'Windtalkers', it's not at all clear why anyone should feel sorry for them). Anyway, Cage rolls around, and the non-Navajo non-Japanese lookalike Beach comes to his aid. . . and brushes against a cardboard cross which promptly falls over.<br/><br/>Yup. That's how they did it during the war. Buried each individual soldier under a highly photogenic if insubstantial cardboard cross. And never mind the tropical rainstorms.<br/><br/>Still, at least it's consistent: cardboard plot, cardboard direction, cardboard acting.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Depressingly inept; a missed opportunity -- considering the nature of the source material -- and, sadly, yet another question mark over John Woo's career.<br/><br/>RATING: 1/10."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","23","32","18 November 2007"," Well, at least it has an interesting original concept.
","A war movie done John Woo-style sounded like such a good idea on paper. The slow-motion action sequences and other typical Woo-ism elements are often even more laughable than beautiful or realistic. Same goes for the deeper and sentimental meanings of the movie.<br/><br/>It's obvious John Woo wanted to make a ""Saving Private Ryan"" realistic like war movie but the movie gets stuck somewhere between Hollywood action/war entertainment and a serious war movie.<br/><br/>The battle sequences look too fabricated and planned out, which is of course a killer for the movie its realism. Sure the battle sequences all look fine and it obvious cost some serious money to make this movie.<br/><br/>Between all of the battles and action within the movie, there are lots of slow moments. Guess it tries to be deep or something, also about the Navajo-culture, in those moments but it instead feels pointless and often like a drag. Same goes for most of the sentiments within the movie. It's also the reason why the movie is quite long.<br/><br/>The movie is an underwritten one that for a genre movie is too formulaic. It's mostly a predictable movie that offers very few surprises or original moments. A shame, since the concept of the movie is definitely an original one. The movie also doesn't bother to tell where and why they are fighting. What are all these battles? Why are they being fought? And yes, of course the movie also finds room to put in a love-story. All of the character also remain pretty shallow one's, no matter how far they dig into their past.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage just wasn't made for these sort of movies. The movie is filled with some other well known names in it and most of them do a good job. It's not like the acting is one of the weakest elements of the movie but that still doesn't mean that everyone was correctly cast.<br/><br/>It's definitely a watchable movie but its shortcomings just prevent this movie from being a great or really memorable one.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Leofwine_draca","7","7","8","4 December 2016"," A pleasingly old-fashioned war epic
","John Woo's Second World War film is, it has to be said, no equal for his 1980s classic HEROES SHED NO TEARS, which pushed the boundaries of cinema whilst at the same time offering a decent war-time actioner. WINDTALKERS reunites two of Woo's previous heroes – Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater – into what is a generally effective war film, chronicling the lives of those courageous men who risked and more often than not sacrificed their lives in battle against the enemy. Woo charts the expected friendships, post traumatic stress, injuries, and racism with moderate success, and he's helped by a good quality cast – especially the unknown Beach as the sympathetic Native American hero. Cage is introspective and tormented, which is something a little different from his usual characters; I liked him, and I also liked Slater's work here immensely.<br/><br/>But things never change and, as usual, the cinematography and action sequences are what work best in this movie. Woo offers tons of bomb-laden action and doesn't shy away from the full horrors of warfare either – there are decapitations, throat-slittings, and limbs being blown off, all shown in unflinching detail. The film does become a little repetitive as it shows Cage machine-gunning dozens of the Japanese enemy but hey, COMMANDO was a repetitive movie and still stands as one of the action genre's best. The special effects are tremendous – especially the CGI bombers flying over the lush countryside – and war fans will be left happy with what is a pretty good genre effort, and pleasingly old-fashioned in this post-modern era."
"rixrex","Null","22","32","18 June 2005"," Good parts are good, bad parts really bad...
","First, the bad: Nicholas Cage's over-the-top, suicidal maniac, idiotic self-pitying marine played with no subtlety at all. Peter Stormare's lousiest performance to date, he's been going downhill since the excellent work in FARGO. Perhaps that one was just luck for him, and a good script. Excessive battle scenes, so much so as to give the viewer shell-shock too. For these, a ONE.<br/><br/>The good: both Adam Beach and Roger Willie give solid, well-bodied performances as the Navajo code talkers. The effort to recognize the contribution of the Navajo code talkers is a very positive aspect here, and for these reasons the film deserves a NINE. I give it an average of FIVE."
"alamosa","1","35","57","26 June 2002"," The boys over at Mystery Science Theater 3000 should have a crack at this mess.
","What's that you say?  ""Windtalkers is a war movie, not science fiction!""<br/><br/>Let's see...Cage's character fires his pistol in no particular direction yet takes out large numbers of enemy soldiers who also seem compelled to present themselves as clear targets at the most inopportune moments during the countless firefights.<br/><br/>The bodies of enemy soldiers are hurled through the air in unbelievable symmetry as a result of conventional World War II ordnance detonations that contradict the laws of physics.<br/><br/>While under ferocious enemy attack, a Navajo code talker invokes the code (his native Navajo tongue) to request air strikes from the American battleships offshore. A less dramatic, more expedient request for assistance would have gone something like this: ""Holy crap, we're getting pounded here on the island by the enemy! Anything you fellas can do to kill the Japanese soldiers who are killing us would really be helpful!  Just look for the smoke, fire and bodies flying through the air!"" No code needed, just plain old conversational (albeit very animated) english. No problem if the enemy hears the radio transmission because everything is ... what's the phrase?... happening right now!!!<br/><br/>I saw this movie a year ago during a pre-release studio screening in Laguna Hills, CA.  John Woo and about 35 movie industry types (each armed with his or her own water bottle) were in the audience.  When the movie ended and the audience members began filling out the obligatory evaluation forms (the price of admission) the stillness in the theater was deafening.<br/><br/>I assumed that the film would be severely re-edited.  Apparently it wasn't.<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" was as much about the American Indian's (90% Navajo) unique contribution to our prevailing in World War II as Tom Sizemore's character -- collecting souvenir soil samples -- in ""Saving Private Ryan"" contributed to the study of geology."
"jimmylee-1","4","22","34","16 September 2006"," Blowing in the Wind
","This showed up on the history channel and with the husband once again off playing poker I thought, OK, time to ingest a little more history. Only to end up retching over yet another Nicholas Cage bad movie. <br/><br/>Now, I just recently saw Con Air for the first time on STARz, so the juxtaposition is unfortunate for his rating, but is he letting his lizard tattoo or Elvis visitations determine his movie selections? Are the script readings done by a psychic? Does he gravitate to stupid characters?<br/><br/>I thought I was going to see something that was about World War II, but actually I got to see a silly film filled with characters I've seen so often I could have written this script myself during a silicon valley traffic jam, and done a much better and far more historically accurate job. They all trotted around after the usual conflicted Sergeant - or is Nicolas Cage always conflicted (see fixations above)? - with a Navajo Indian (instead of a representative of some other ethnic group) thrown in to cause racial tension.<br/><br/>Let's see, we had the bullying racist, who then has his life saved by an Indian (gee, there's a surprise), the panicking recruit who can't take the pressure and trips the mine field (wow, didn't see that coming), the accepting comrade who (symbolically) blends an harmonica with the Indian's flute (but dies saving the Indian's life, ditto, ditto), the young boy who must grow up too soon (ah, the poignancy), the Army lieutenant that treats everyone like tools (not again!), the mystic wisdom that teaches us all a little something, the constantly breathy flute music (used with all cultural lessons) - have we endured this one before? <br/><br/>Not really, because we've never seen quite so many battles, with so many bodies (tossed so high in the air) before, or filmed in Utah while pretending to be Iwo Jima. Was John Woo trying to win some kind of battle-filming contest here? Well, I hope so, because he sure lost a battle with the script.<br/><br/>Of course, we had the added stress for poor battle-worn Nicolas Cage that he might have to shoot his code talker rather than have him fall into enemy hands. Quite the sophisticated plot twist, that! Oh no, will Nicolas get too close and feel bad if he has to shoot his young trustee? More conflict! More angst! Cage's specialty! Makes the story so much better, right? <br/><br/>Better, but not accurate. Reality: the code wasn't the language - it was a derivative, based on, the Navajo language. If someone was captured, the code would be changed. The prisoner might understand the base language, but not the code itself. <br/><br/>Oh, yeah, periodically the Indians, who I believe were the original inspiration for the movie, would get to talk back and forth in Navajo, and we would get to see the translation on the screen. They would say their position (not in actual code). Oh, and one time in the movie, the Japanese noticed the Americans weren't speaking English. <br/><br/>And another time, according to the movie, the Japanese attempted to capture an Indian who was just standing around the front line because somehow they knew he was a code talker. Right. They guessed in the middle of combat that he wasn't Hawaiian or Japanese American, he was an American Indian. And they also had somehow figured out that the language that wasn't English was a derivative of an American Indian dialect, and therefore this man must be a Code Talker. Right there in the middle of the battle. Alrighty then. (It must be similar wisdom that causes me to doubt the veracity of this incident.) <br/><br/>These incidents brought history alive for me, alright.<br/><br/>Reality: Code talkers were translating messages NON STOP throughout the taking of Iwo Jima. Which makes it difficult to understand how the Navajos would have been hacking and shooting away on the battlefield, or standing around the front lines, and going through that growing-up-too-soon stuff. Reality: They were able to communicate three times faster than previous codes had hustled along, but like any other job, the number of messages increased to fill the time available. Seems to be a bit of a discrepancy between busy busy real code talker life and Hollywood. Oh, sorry. That's a duh.<br/><br/>In addition to not understanding the difference between a language and a code (is this rocket science?) the soldiers in the film didn't even wear the right dog tags. Reality: I've got my dad's dog tags from WWII, and you can get a lovely facsimile at the Smithsonian gift store right now. Were they not stylish enough? Was it more exciting to use choke chain dog tags? Every time I saw a soldier I saw an anachronism. As in big fat mistake.<br/><br/>I do appreciate that at least we have a movie in these Politically Correct days where we had two sides to a war: good guys and bad guys. You don't see that very often any more, so points to John Woo for that one area.<br/><br/>But I'm getting away from what was really going on in the movie, which was all about battered, bruised, benighted and badgered Nicholas Cage, who talked to the Navajo like Clint Eastwood talked to the trees in Paint Your Wagon. Not to mention the usual angst-ridden and conflicted stuff he faces. I got very little wind talking, and an awful lot of wind blowing out of this movie. <br/><br/>All it did for the important role the Navajo (and Comanche in the European Theatre) Indians played during WWII was bring them up in conversation - too many inaccuracies to be of any other use."
"m0rg16","1","41","70","7 July 2005"," Possibly the worst war movie ever...
","-Some spoilers- There's a rule in Hollywood that states, ""If you're making a war-movie, you better make it damn patriotic"". With patriotic, ridiculous often follows. This film presents it's patriotism in FORM of ridiculous scenes. For example, there's a scene where IL' Nicholas Cage gets blasted and falls to the ground, wounded. Quickly, a group of Japanese soldiers start running towards him, but Nick managed to kill them all in one second... Using one gun... Without even aiming. The scene made me laugh out loud, and could be classified as one of the funniest moments in film-history, ever, but unfortunately this gem is overlooked.<br/><br/>Throw everything you know about films out the window. This film doesn't have a plot, or any deep character. It doesn't have any realism, which is customary for war films, nor does it have any good acting. So what does it have? Lots and lots of action. More action than you can imagine, actually. The film only has one purpose, to show off how the brave marines kill as many enemy soldiers as possible. Explosions, gunfire etc. etc.<br/><br/>Ed Wood could not have done a worse job than John Woo did when he put this film together. It's simply that bad. Gather your friends, bust open a few cans of beers and enjoy the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of the 21st century!"

","If you are looking for a film that will provide you with the story of the Navaho Codetalkers, this really isn't your film. If you're look for a war flick with plenty of gore and where everything seems to explode in massive fireballs (just like in the Simpsons!), this is your flick.<br/><br/>While the title focuses on the Navaho Codetalkers, most of the film is really taken up with inflated actions scenes and stock characters. While there is some effort to show the training of the Codetalkers, how they were actually used is obscured (they didn't call in coded fire missions) and some of the scenes are just ludicrous. The scene where one of the codetalkers poses as a Japanese soldier taking a Marine prisoner is pretty silly. I guess the Japanese officer they approach must have assumed this soldier was from Japan's wild west.<br/><br/>In essence, the ""Windtalkers"" theme is just something to catch you eye and make this film ""different."" John Woo really didn't want to make a film about the Navaho Codetalkers. This film is just an exercise in explosive excess."

","It's nice to see World War II films making a comeback, as they have seemed to do since the arrival of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in 1997. This is another of them and with modern technology the viewers get to experience some very realistic action scenes. The main thing is that the story is interesting.<br/><br/>With a John Woo-directed film, you know are going to get tons of action, almost always too much, and that's the case here. However, some of the scenes are fantastic. You also get some beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>Still on the positive, the acting was good in here with Nicholas Cage in the lead role and a lesser-name-but-good supporting cast. The story, although fairly long at 134 minutes, was never boring.<br/><br/>On the negative side, as mentioned, Woo tends to overkill and this movie must have a set record for number of people killed. It also leans on the politically correct side, of course, with Native American spirituality given complete reverence as usual and the Catholic (Cage) looking like a very weak in his beliefs. In modern-days, you'll never see the opposite shown on film.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a good action movie that certainly entertains. The intense and long action makes it almost too much to watch in one viewing!"
"bkoganbing","8","5","6","20 November 2016"," Protecting a most valuable commodity
","I think the closest film analogy I can come to in describing Windtalkers is that of Go For Broke, the MGM classic film that starred Van Johnson. It told the story of the division formed by the Nisei of Hawaii, Japanese-Americans who fought in Europe in the Italian theater. Johnson's not thrilled with the prospect of commanding them, but he learns to respect their spirit and by the end of the film has bonded nicely with his Asian troops.<br/><br/>In the Pacific Theater somebody got the brilliant idea to use Navajo Indian language as the code during battle. Up to that point the Japanese had broken all the codes the Marines had devised. That meant enlisting Navajos in the Marines to be given specific radio training.<br/><br/>The catch is that these Navajos become a most valuable commodity and have to be protected lest they fall in Japanese hands as prisoners. That's where Nicholas Cage comes in. His specific assignment is to protect Navajo communicator Adam Beach and his radio. Like a defensive lineman protects his quarterback.<br/><br/>Windtalkers unlike Go For Broke is not a story of the program itself. It concentrates on the special bond that forms between both Cage and Beach. To say Cage develops a political consciousness would be about right. By the end of the film Cage is protecting Beach for personal reasons. In fact there's a postscript at the end of the film with Beach back at the reservation that is beautiful and sublime.<br/><br/>Of course there's enough blood and guts for any war film fan as well as the Navajo communication program is given its first test in the bloody battle for Saipan in the Pacific. Still the focus is one the respect and friendship that Cage and Beach develop for each other.<br/><br/>Windtalkers, a really fine war film."

","Windtalkers is a war movie and one that some people may not have heard of. It's a mediocre war movie to say at best, but it does have its moments. There is a question of authenticity related to the movie. The story itself may be factual, but the movie's interpretation of the story is questionable. However, there are some redeemable qualities such as the fine acting, a good amount of action, and a solid score by composer James Horner.<br/><br/>John Woo's film is about two U.S Marines named Ben Yahzee and Peter Anderson who are assigned to protect several Navajo codebreakers from falling into the Japanese hands.<br/><br/>I did like the acting of the film. Nic Cage does a great job in the center role and he shows great chemistry with Adam Beach, the actor who played his Navajo Marine. Christian Slater does a good job as Anderson, and I also liked the performances of Mark Ruffalo and Noah Emmerich.<br/><br/>Overall, Windtalkers is a war movie that is driven on a clichéd story. Some people may like the film, while others may despise it. I am stuck in the middle. I liked many aspects of the film, but other aspects were just doomed to failure such as the story and authenticity. But I will give the movie points in part due to Nic Cage's powerful performance. A loud, bloody, war movie is a good way to describe the movie.<br/><br/>My Grade: C-"

","Just a brief review. I expected more of this film, and I fault Woo's direction for not giving us more.  There is such a story to tell about the Windtalkers, and he hardly told anything.  The action was convincing enough but I wondered about some of the characterizations. Actually this was just an ordinary action film under the guise of telling the story of the Windtalkers. I guess I was just expecting more of a story, and a little less of the noisy action."

Here goes...<br/><br/>Yes, the film-makers have stereotyped Japanese soldiers to be sacrificial lambs to the slaughter for the sake of this 1980's Rambo style shoot-em-up. The irony of a 'This film shows how different races can work together and we are all the same etc' approach is exposed with the Yanks taking all the incoming and remain standing while the Japs instantly get slaughtered (in their hundreds). Did no one have the guts to tell the leaders of this project in production that it was a**e? Or did 'market pressures' (eg: target audience) mean that Woo was thought the best man to entertain the youngsters with his pyros? What's with all the mindless, boring, repetitive slow-mo blow 'em up shots? And the gratuitous use of exploding gas cans for a humble mortar shell? And the soldier seriously expecting for a girl terrified out of her wits to run after a CHOCOLATE BAR after he chucks it to a mate? Thanks for that wonderful, thoughtful piece on war.<br/><br/>The dialogue - oh, come on! See the quotes from earlier posts. It WOULD be hilarious if this wasn't portraying real events. Just cheese, cheese, and more cheese. Cage made a good stab at it but the lines that he and the Navajo was given were just awful. A no-win situation.<br/><br/>The 'love' interest was a load of ****. Betraying trust by cheating to get Cage back to war, ergo: putting lives at risk. AND happening to turn up at his leaving do in full titilating dress uniform. Yeh, right.<br/><br/>The music was stilted and unmemorable: no real life or recurring theme that I picked up on. Bring back Ron Goodwin.<br/><br/>Special effects: Fantastic vista on the opening invasion scene with good aircraft CGI (for once, no 9G pull-outs), but spoilt as usual by high-octane explosions more suited to a low-budget shoot 'em up. The trampolines sure saw a lot of use, well done everyone for jumping so high with flailing arms and legs in front of all those petrol cans going 'whoosh'. Again and again and again. And again.<br/><br/>Realism: Nick Cage, when saving co-lead, shoots 4 Japanese WITH A PISTOL from at least 30' while on his back after having taken incoming. They all simultaneously fall like flies with the usual dramatic 'aieeeee!'. What a joke. I often miss a 5' x 3' range target at 10m, holding the weapon steady.<br/><br/>That's it, I can't even bring myself to write any more, other than for you lot to have a laugh at my expense: I bought this film cheap at Tescos 6 months ago and saved it until tonight when I had a bit of quality time .

"Dark Eye","1","14","25","15 June 2002"," More splatterfest than Friday the 13th
","Let me be harsh here. I ponder what went wrong inside John Woo's head when he made this stinkbomb? Has he finally succumbed to the big dollars of Hollywood, so much that he has the nerve to make movies like M:I2? Although Windtalkers is nowhere as bad, nonetheless its still a shallow exercise in style. I sat down with a couple of friends, and throughout the movie we were bombarded with nothing but the sounds of guns, explosions, and flying corpses. Never once the movie made me feel the destructive power of mankind's stupidity. Even though some war movies depicts a lot of violence, movies like Saving Private Ryan was never gratituous. Windtalkers - or John Woo - is more in love with explosions, slo-mo gunfights and painfully cliched dialogues than its purported subject. At the end, I asked myself ""Where on earth were those noble Navajo Indians???"" Like many people, the ""subject"" of the story drew me into buying a ticket. On the big screen, the Native Americans have rarely been portrayed correctly (which also can be said to many minorities living in the states). So I thought everyone will finally get to see them being heroic and brave, and Windtalkers does that to an extent, but not nearly enough. Alas their presence and contributions here were so numbed down, and instead we get too much of Nick Cage's character, (whose job here is to sell movie tickets) looking like a madman spraying bullets to no end. Why can't we get Windtalkers starring a real Navajo Indian anyway? The entire movie feels like a false advertisement to me."
"Iain Burnside","7","21","41","9 September 2002"," Woo's most mature mainstream movie yet.
","Following the justifiably forgotten Hard Target, the formulaic Broken Arrow, the magnificent Face/Off and the trash metal Mission Impossible 2, Windtalkers marks the next step in John Woo's unsteady path through Hollywood, and his most mature mainstream movie yet.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicholas Cage) and Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), two members of the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, and their burgeoning friendship in the middle of their battalion's costly advances on the Japanese army in Saipan. Cage is a world-weary misanthrope who has successfully found his niche in the military, and now finds himself struggling to come to terms with it. He is assigned to protect Beach, one of the 'windtalkers' of the title, during the upcoming mission that could help turn the tide of the war in America's favour. Ultimately however, his orders are to remain loyal to the code that Beach speaks, which has been based on the Navajo language, at all costs and not to the man himself, who is to be treated as expendable... What will happen under the intense pressure of a war zone, where men are forced together in the most extreme conditions for any hope of survival?<br/><br/>Perhaps because he finds himself dealing with real material, Woo seems to have let his characters become real people more than in any of his previous work. The fact that two actors as talented as Cage and Beach are involved certainly helped matters, and in fact Beach even outshines his more decorated peer, as his progression from a happy-go-lucky, rather naïve family man to a battle-hardened warrior is nothing short of exemplary. Woo's direction is again the true saving grace though, in particular the marvellous shot that introduces us to the war: a butterfly flutters over a beautiful clear river, which slowly turns a vicious shade of red as the mutilated corpse of a soldier floats past... gunfire breaks out and we find ourselves in the middle of hell.<br/><br/>Of course, what would a war film (or, for that matter, a Woo film) be without discussing the battle scenes? The sweeping Japanese landscapes are really Hawaiian but hey, they still look the part and do more than enough to reaffirm the trailer's message that `... the world's a beautiful place.' Woo's skilful use of contradicting beauty with violence can prove to be rather repetitive but it is certainly utilised in droves in these settings and, even though the carnage is certainly not on the traumatic levels of Saving Private Ryan, it is certainly vivid enough to deter the squeamish. Limbs are blown off, bodies are scattered without a second thought, and as for the fate that awaits Sergeant Ryan Anderson (Christian Slater)...<br/><br/>
In the end it is clear that Windtalkers is not a perfect film by any means. Although the acting and direction are terrific the writing lets the end product down, particularly as it feels like there is no real end in sight, or even anything to aim for. We are never told why Saipan is worth fighting for, while the love interest (provided by Frances O'Conner in a thankless role) disappears without trace halfway through the film. Luckily for us though, this time Woo has managed to mould his uniquely romantic violence around an intelligent observation of comradeship amidst the most unfriendly of conditions, with an end scene that is genuinely moving.<br/><br/>

","In WWII Navajo men were used as code talkers in the war--they translated messages while in combat into their own language, and transmitted it that way. This was done so the Japanese were unable to understand the messages. It's a very interesting little known fact about the war. It's a good thing they made a movie about it--it's too bad the movie is so lousy.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Every single clichéd line and character found in WWII movies are all here. There's the sergeant who is suffering from a former war trauma; the eager young kid (who you know is gonna get it); the racist (who sees the error of his ways); the nice guy who is horrified by what he sees; the saint-like Navajos etc etc. The dialogue is astonishingly bad. I've heard these same lines from other war flicks--some of them are lifted verbatim (it seems)! Every single line and conflict is predictable. I was able to tell in the first 20 minutes who was going to die--that's how predictable this is! <br/><br/>I almost left but the movie DOES have it's good points. For one thing, war is not glorified. The battle sequences are bloody, loud, very graphic and upsetting...as they should be. However, director John Woo has always been good at shooting violence. Also there's no stupid obligatory romance--heck, there's virtually no females here! There's some good acting also--Adam Beach as one of the Navajos is fantastic--handsome, intelligent if a little too saintlike. Mark Ruffalo is also affecting and Christian Slater (not playing a jerk for once) is excellent. Unfortunately, Nicholas Cage gives another lousy performance as the main character. Can we take back the Oscar he got for ""Leaving Las Vegas""?<br/><br/>So, aside from some good acting and extreme violence (be warned...it's VERY explicit...some people walked out because of it), I can't recommend this. Too bad...the subject matter is so interesting."
"hdjones-imdb","4","5","7","21 February 2011"," Not much plot and lots of overdone battle scenes
","Windtalkers (2002) is a World War II action flick with plenty of overdone action and not much of a story. At 2.25 hours in length, it overstayed its welcome by an hour or so for me.<br/><br/>The windtalkers referenced in the title are Navajo marine codetalkers dispatched to the Pacific theater during World War II. They were trained in a special code based on the Navajo language, and distributed among units in an attempt to provide coded radio transmissions that couldn't be understood by the Japanese. This was accomplished both by using the Navajo language and also using coding within that language to add a complication that the Japanese were never able to overcome during World War II.<br/><br/>Sounds like an interesting story, right? Maybe so, in another movie. The only real reason to include the codetalkers in this movie was to provide a focal point for a storyline about bigotry and personal biases among some of the troops. That's also a legitimate storyline for a movie, but it's been done many times before with other targets. The title seems to hint that this movie will go beyond that aspect, but it doesn't. Actually, even the storyline about bigotry doesn't matter much in this movie. Everything is just an excuse for action battle scenes.<br/><br/>This movie is all about the battle scenes, and it contains a lot of bad ones. I guess this is supposed to have been a modern, therefore realistically portrayed, Pacific Theater World War II movie. The photography and noise and gore are done with modern techniques, but not the story or scenes. All of the worst battle clichés of war movie history have been brought together and updated. Hand grenades, artillery shells, land mines, everything explodes with giant fuel-laden fireballs. There are slow motion sequences of soldiers successfully diving away from exploding artillery shells and fiery eruptions. There are enemies too stupid to recognize infiltrators of a different race and language.<br/><br/>And always, always, always, there is the crazy protagonist who goes nuts in every battle and charges headlong into the enemy fire unscathed as bodies are being torn apart on all sides of him. No marine-issue semi-automatic rifle for this guy-- as a Sergeant he has a sub-machine gun and indiscriminately sprays hundreds of pounds of rounds in all directions, never running out of ammunition. While in the middle of one heated battle he over-ran an enemy foxhole with a dead soldier at the bottom and stopped for a few seconds to spray a couple dozen bullets into the body while screaming triumphantly. Why not? His magic gun isn't going to run dry.<br/><br/>The movie is supposedly about the codetalkers, or at least about how the Navajo code was used, but that hardly gets addressed. The code is used in a couple instances when a non-code English transmission would have been fine, but when two American soldiers transmit from a Japanese radio at an over-run enemy post and might be expected to use code to provide verification, everything is done in open English. Of course, the Japanese radio also conveniently had Arabic numerals on the frequency tuner so they could change to the correct transmission frequency.<br/><br/>If you like this type of battle footage, I recommend that instead of devoting your time to watching the movie straight through you just drop in somewhere in the middle and watch a few minutes of battle. If you want more than a few minutes you can either continue with the movie or just keep re-watching the same few minutes you already saw. There won't be any difference."
"forty_7","Null","5","7","4 September 2003"," Off the mark... (Slight Spoilers)
","""Windtalkers"" was a movie I was definitely looking forward to from the time I saw the teaser on TV.  I've been a big fan of John Woo for several years, as well as a fan of Nic Cage ever since I saw ""Leaving Las Vegas"".  That said, please do not confuse these two things with the fact that I enjoyed this movie at all.<br/><br/>From the opening of the film until the credits, I was absolutely lost on why I should actually care about the story being told.  My grandfather fought and was wounded on Saipan, but this film didn't even begin to convey the story of those battles during the Pacific campaign.  Sure, we see Cage's character in his lowliest of times in the opening sequences of the movie, but for some reason...they look and feel like exactly that: a movie. There is no real heroism aside from one or two events that are flat-out depressing, and there is no successful cinematic attempt to portray what was going on as the very real nightmare that it was.<br/><br/>Woo, IMHO, has always been about conveying feeling through any sort of means.  Whether it be bloodshed, tragedy, heroism, or sheer irony, he has always succeeded on some level.  But within this film his technique and form just feel static.<br/><br/>Now, on to the acting.  As one might expect, Nicolas Cage does his usual bit of soft-spoken and understated emotion, which more or less works for the film's entirety.  It is the rest of the cast that is lacking in their portrayals, and therefore, substantially lowers the effect of what is attempting to be said through the film.  Christian Slater DOES do an excellent job with the little talent he has for dramatic acting, and Peter Stormare fits the part.  Sadly, that's about all that can be said for the acting in this film.  Also disheartening is the fact that the good acting in this movie is not what is focused on, rather the character of Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) seems to take center stage next to Mr. Cage, and therefore, his inadequacies shine through in every scene.  Not only does Beach seem insincere, he also seems completely lost, and his character's transformation toward the end of the film seems silly, to say the least.<br/><br/>The saving grace of this film is the few and far between effective battle scenes. All in all, ""Windtalkers"" is disjointed and off-the-mark.  If you're looking for a more interesting take on war, check out Woo's ""A Bullet in the Head"" - it's not a war epic like ""Windtalkers"" attempts to be, but it most certainly conveys it's intended message."
"Wuchakk","7","6","9","18 April 2015"," Imagine ""The Thin Red Line"" if it were more conventional
","""Windtalkers"" (2002) stars Nicolas Cage as a follow-the-orders-at-all-costs soldier who's assigned to protect a code talker (Adam Beach), a Navajo who speaks his native language on radio transmissions to conceal the data from the Japanese. Christian Slater plays a similar soldier assigned to another Navajo (Roger Willie). The movie details the Battle of Saipan and also stars Noah Emmerich, Mark Ruffalo, Brian Van Holt, Peter Stormare and Frances O'Connor.<br/><br/>I was surprised by how good ""Windtalkers"" is. I say 'surprised' because it lacks the mass hoopla surrounding other WWII films, like 1998's overrated ""Saving Private Ryan"" (don't get me wrong, the first act of ""Ryan"" is great, but the rest of the movie leaves a lot to be desired. Remember the lame dog tag sequence?). The film was made by John Woo who knows how to make an exciting and colorful action flick, as witnessed by 1996' ""Broken Arrow."" ""Windtalkers"" cost a whopping $115 million to make and you definitely see it on the screen; unfortunately, it 'only' made back $75 million worldwide.<br/><br/>Both 1998's ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Windtalkers"" involve the Pacific Theater of WWII and the taking of Japanese-held islands. While I consider ""The Thin Red Line"" a nigh-masterpiece, it's too meditative and spiritual if you're in the mood for a straight war flick. When that's the case, ""Windtalkers"" satisfies just fine. Remember the incredible air raid sequence in 1979's ""Apocalypse Now""? That's the impression I got with the opening scenes of the Battle of Saipan in ""Windtalkers."" <br/><br/>Some complain that not enough emphasis is put on the code talkers, but the two Navajos are major characters throughout the story, particularly the one played by Beach. As for their actual code-talking, what else needs to be shown? The complaint holds no water.<br/><br/>Others complain about the utter annihilation of throngs of Japanese soldiers, but the statistics support this: There were 71,000 allied forces and 31,000 Japanese soldiers in the battle. 'Only' 3,426 allied forces died, while another 10,000 were wounded, but 24,000 Japs were killed and another 5000 committed suicide, while 921 were taken captive. On top of this 22,000 civilians died, mostly by suicide, in obedience to the imperial order of Emperor Hirohito encouraging the civilians of Saipan to commit suicide promising them an equal status in the afterlife with that of soldiers dying in battle.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Windtalkers"" lacks that special flair or perspective that denotes truly exception war movies, like ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""The Blue Max,"" but ""Windtalkers"" isn't far behind. The main difference is that it's more of a conventional war flick but, of course, that's all it needs to be.<br/><br/>The film runs 134 minutes and was shot in Hawaii and the greater Los Angeles area.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

The whole movie looked like it was shot on the backlot used by the TV series ""M*A*S*H"" and some of the sequences to show the windtalkers at work were petty.

"funkyfry","4","2","2","17 October 2007"," a disposable war movie?
","This is a pretty disappointing movie considering the kind of resources that were spent on it and the apparent care that went into the production. It looks fantastic but there just is not a real core of human feeling, at least nothing that I personally could connect to. Partly that's because the first half of the film seems to have a very confused narrative focus. It's partly the film about a bitter Marine (Nicholas Cage) who gets injured and has to take a relatively peaceful assignment with a group of Native Americans who are enlisted by the Marines so that their language can be used as a basis for an unbreakable code. For no particularly compelling reason the story focuses on Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) and a friend he brings along to the war.<br/><br/>Beach put in a decent performance but doesn't have much to work with. There's a lot of talk about past racial history and the irony of the fact that the ""Indians"" are now fighting with the Americans. One character even speculates about how we might be sitting here 50 years from now with the Japanese trying to figure out ""how to kick somebody else's butt"" (or words to that effect). Stuff like this is really annoying to me because it's not the kind of thing that anyone would be talking about in that situation; it's obviously just some junk they thought would seem ironic to people nowadays. So much of the dialog in this movie is forced and awkward like that. The movie is crushed beneath the weight of its pretenses. After the end of the film there's a beautiful shot of Cage in a close-up with a weary expression on his face. I saw that and I said ""oh, there's the performance! Why don't I remember him showing his character like that in the actual movie?"" And it's because the movie doesn't even dare to stop long enough or to slow down so that you can appreciate anything that's happening. From the very first scenes it's just action action action, and I really felt a bit sick especially as the film went on because it seemed to me to blur the lines between action and violence. Kind of like ""Rambo II"" and about equally worthless, although at least that film didn't burden itself with hokey reflections of racial politics  and perhaps more significantly it didn't take place during a real conflict. My girlfriend (who has a brother in Iraq) was so offended by the tone and style of the movie that we got in an argument just because I wanted to finish it. I think if you just wanted to see this as an action movie and ignore all the other elements it could be an OK action movie. But since this movie pretends and/or attempts to be much more and fails so horribly I would not recommend it to anyone. It didn't make me feel anything dramatic until maybe the very end because it never felt like anything more than a video game shoot-em-up. I can't say it's a reprehensible movie without watching it again, but it made me feel pretty uncomfortable in an unconstructive way if you know what I mean."

The usual Woo themes are here, friendship and honour etc but for once its the action that lets Woo down, the action scenes seem very `staged' and it seems like you are watching an early rehearsal or a TVM. Cage sleepwalks his way throughout the entire film and this ranks as his worst performance since `Wings Of The Apache'.

I was pleased to see that they used real Native Americans(instead of latinos or white men with deep tans); and (SPOILER?) I especially liked the scene when Ben Yahzee is explaining to Cage that he too is there to fight for his country.  I think that one of the main reasons that war movies are made is to teach people about war, which is what make movies such as Saving Private Ryan so good (since it was so realistic).  Furthermore, war movies have already been made from so many different points of view (American, Japanese, Russian...), and I think that it was time to tell the story of the Navajo who made winning the war possible.  However, I do think that the action scenes could have been much better.  One might to better to watch one of the documentaries made about the subject rather that watch Windtalkers (which focuses more on Cage than on the Navajo)."

","My wife and I went to see Windtalkers on Saturday night. I have been studying World War II, and for the past six months have been plodding my way through 3600 pages of Winston Churchill's History of the Second World War, so I thought this movie might be interesting. For the most part, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Windtalkers is a story about the U.S. military's use of a top-secret code based on the Navajo language. Because the Navajos could cipher and decipher messages faster than via telegraphic codes, this was supposed to bring a great advantage in battlefield communications. Each Navajo coder was ""protected"" by a marine assigned to him, but according to the movie, it was actually the code, not the coder, which was to be protected ""at all costs"".<br/><br/>The thing that I found most disappointing about the movie was its depiction of battlefield conditions. While a great deal of effort was clearly made on depicting realistic battle scenes on the level of hand-to-hand combat, the overall understanding of battle tactics was missing. In one scene, the Marines had invaded Saipan, and individual troops on the ground were being bombed on the battlefield by Japanese Zeros (fighter aircraft), while no U.S. aircraft were in evidence. It is well-known that as a prelude to any land invasion or advance of troops, from D-Day to the Gulf War, that air supremacy must be achieved first. On an island like Saipan, The enemy air force would have been completely annihilated before a Marine set foot on the beach. As another example, the movie depicted heavy Japanese 14"" or 16"" guns (of the type used in WWII for coastal defense), being used to fire at troops on the ground, instead of targetting the enemy (our) warships which were firing at them. This is just plain silly.<br/><br/>I was willing to overlook these flaws, however, for a good story. Here again the movie fell short. There was very little character development, which left one wondering why characters behaved the way they did. This was especially the case with our main character, played by Nicolas Cage. Nothing was told of his beliefs, such as why he volunteered to return to battle, even enlisting the aid of a nurse to fake a hearing test, after he had been wounded in action. All in the all the story development was flat and left me less than satisfied."

","The word ""windtalker"" is not in my dictionary, but if you were to ask the man in the street he would no doubt think it meant something uncomplimentary, such as one who talks nonsense or talks too much. It refers, in fact, to a programme during the Second World War when the US armed forces made use of a secret spoken code based upon the Navajo language. The idea was that native Navajo speakers would be trained both as code-speakers and as radio operators so that they could broadcast battlefield messages that could not be understood by the enemy. Although the code is sometimes described as ""unbreakable"", many experts believe that it could have been broken by a skilled cryptographer who was also a fluent Navajo speaker, which explains why it was used only in the Pacific theatre of war. Comparative linguistics is something of a national sport in Germany and the Germans, unlike the Japanese, had plenty of linguists and anthropologists with knowledge of Native American languages.<br/><br/>The story of the code-speakers is a potentially fascinating one, although not perhaps one that could easily be told through the medium of film, unless it was a film made in Navajo for speakers of that language. ""Windtalkers"" revolves around the relationship between two men, the code-talker Private Ben Yahzee and Sergeant Joe Enders (an Italian-American despite his Scandinavian-sounding name) who has been assigned to him as his bodyguard. (Most of the action takes place during the American assault on the island of Saipan in June and July 1944). What Yahzee doesn't know is that Enders has been ordered to protect the code at all costs, which means that, if necessary, he will kill Yahzee to prevent him from falling into enemy hands.<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" uses the buddy-buddy format, a familiar plot device in both war films and other genres (such as cop dramas). In keeping with the normal conventions of this format, the two main characters have diametrically opposed characters. The rookie Yahzee is idealistic, polite and friendly, a happily-married family man. Enders is a cynical, hard-bitten, battle-scarred veteran. They start off disliking one another, but develop a mutual respect which turns to friendship. Eventually the two become so close that Enders realises that he will not be able to kill Yahzee if duty demands it.<br/><br/>The actual mechanics of the spoken code might have been difficult to convey in an English-language movie, but I was disappointed with ""Windtalkers"" because other potentially interesting themes were ignored or treated perfunctorily. The tone is notably patriotic, with the Navajo soldiers depicted as even more ardent American patriots than their white counterparts. (Significantly, Yahzee's young son is named George Washington Yahzee). The film does not explore the issue of what motivates the Navajo to fight for America, a country into which they were forcibly incorporated in the nineteenth century, whose watchword seemed to be ""government of the white man, for the white man, by the white man"" and which in the 1940s still treated American Indians as second-class citizens.<br/><br/>One theme that the film does treat is, of course, that of racism. Indeed, some critics such as James Berardinelli have criticised it for dealing with this theme in a too heavy-handed manner. We see the Navajo soldiers being abused by racist whites, and then saving the life of one of those who have abused them. War films, however, strike me as being a curious vehicle for propagating anti-racist views; war, after all, is about fighting people who belong to a nation other than one's own, and in this film the Japanese are simply presented as the enemy, to be slaughtered with a clear conscience. The message of an anti-racist war film seems to be that to abuse a man because of the colour of his skin is wrong, to kill him because of the colour of his passport is acceptable.<br/><br/>There are some occasional fine directorial touches, such as the scene where we see a butterfly above the surface of a stream, which then slowly turns red with blood as a corpse floats into view, juxtaposing the beauties of nature with the horrors of war. There are, however, also some remarkably silly scenes, such as the one where Yahzee poses as a Japanese soldier and Enders as his prisoner so that they can capture a radio-set from the enemy. Adam Beach might ""look like a Jap"" to a bigoted soldier who cannot tell one non-Caucasian race from another, but I doubt if the Japanese themselves would have been fooled.<br/><br/>Second World War movies were something of a rarity in the eighties and early nineties, but have made a modest comeback since the success of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Windtalkers"" seems to have been modelled on the earlier film. The advance of special-effects technology means that it is now much easier to create realistic battle scenes, and John Woo follows Stephen Spielberg's lead with plenty of graphic scenes of carnage. The film, however, is less successful than ""Saving Private Ryan""; that film had its faults, but the battle scenes had an immediacy and emotional impact much greater than anything in ""Windtalkers"". If Spielberg's film is a flawed epic, Woo's is little more than a standard wartime action movie. It is also, at about 2¼ hours in length, rather too long-winded, which gives an unfortunate sense to the title. 5/10."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I think of Woo like I think of Oliver Stone, not a particularly intelligent man, but one that from time to time shows a worthwhile cinematic vision. Parts of `Mission Impossible 2' were very nice. Parts of `Face Off' were visually exciting, even with the two clumsy actors involved. One of those is back again, annoying as ever. But I just ignore the actors and story. After all, dePalma made one of the best camera-centric movies of all time with Cage in `Snake Eyes.'<br/><br/>But I searched in vain for anything to like. You already know the story is vapid and the acting childish. But where is the vision? All the attention seems to have gone into coordinating the fireballs and body parts. Ridley Scott can do this with real visual effect. Malick can even do it with poetry.

"nafps","1","5","8","29 July 2018"," A Historian Review for Accuracy: See True Whispers Instead
","There are already many reviews panning this film for simply being poorly made, badly acted, directed, and written, unbelievable, and gory and exploitative. A smaller number of reviews rightly consider it an insult to the memory of WWII veterans and more specifically Native vets and Navajo Code Talkers.<br/><br/>I'd like to focus my review on its many historical inaccuracies. The biggest one is that its central premise is wrong and appallingly offensive, the false claim that Marines assigned to be bodyguards to Code Talkers were ordered to kill them rather than let them be taken prisoners. Not only is it utterly wrong, it's near impossible to imagine any Marine killing another Marine, or any Marine officer giving such an order. <br/><br/>The claim ignores that some Code Talkers were, in fact, captured. The scriptwriter also seems to have not known that the famed code was not just two Navajos talking to each other. The original 28 Navajo Code Talkers composed their own complex code. Navajos who were not Code Talkers could not understand nor reveal that code.<br/><br/>This code was never written down until after the war, committed solely to memory, a great intellectual feat. Imagine the main character in The Imitation Game never writing down a code he'd written, for example. The Navajo code was also never broken, nor were any transmissions ever incorrect. This was a huge strategic advantage, and the entire USMC in the Pacific Theater came to depend on the code.<br/><br/>None of that is mentioned in the film. It would have been far more accurate and interesting than this film focused almost solely on Cage's fictional character. The Navajo Nation did make their own film, a documentary, True Whispers. See it instead.<br/><br/>There are also many good books discussing the Code Talkers: Chester Nez's Code Talker (autobiography); Doris Paul's and Nathan Aseng's Navajo Code Talkers (two separate books); Jere Franco's Across the Pond; and my own book Medicine Bags and Dog Tags.

","Nicolas Cage stars as a soldier who has to protect a Native American code breaker in World War II along the way there are many battles and people fight it out and this reunites Woo with Christan Slater and Nicolas Cage. If anything else Windtalkers explains exactly how far Slater's career had fallen, Slater has a pretty big part and despite being a major character is billed behind Adam Beach and like a couple others. Considering that he hasn't done much since, it goes to show that Slater hadn't fallen on some career speed-bumps. Although this is slightly before Slater made a comeback in the movie we all remember him for Uwe Boll's Alone In The Dark (Not!) Windtalkers itself is a sub-par effort that is closer to Platoon Leader than Platoon and basically we sit and watch as the various soldiers are marked for death and watch as Woo tries extremely hard to make this more interesting than it is. Nicolas Cage also tries hard but once again the movie is so clichéd and tries so hard to be uplifting we never buy into the concepts the actors try to sell with what can only be interpreted as performances.

","To me, any war or sci-fi movie is a guaranteed winner. The construction of sets and direction or battles sequences and special effects all have to be at very high degrees in order to look even remotely real. In order for a war or sci-fi movie to be bad, the sets, special effects, and battles scenes all have to be poorly done. I have encountered some sci-fis that had poor CGI, but I have not yet seen a badly made war movie. Even heavily clichéd war movies have realistic violence and spectacular action sequences. I noticed Windtalkers got bad reviews, but everybody must admit it was good for what it had.<br/><br/>Windtalkers is about a group of soldiers (including Nicolas Cage, Christian Slater, Mark Ruffalo, and Noah Emmerich) during World War II who must protect two Navajo soldiers from the Japanese, as they are the only ones that understand the codes in Navajo language. I am not a history guru nor an expert on any wars, so I very much enjoyed this. John Woo is an action master that did great action scenes and the acting is great by almost all. There was some bad acting, but most were good. Nicolas Cage was good, as this was before his string of bad movies like Ghost Rider and Bangkok Dangerous. He is our main character who is similar to Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now and Charlie Sheen in Platoon--all men are haunted by the horrors of war. The story is a little slow, but is sugarcoated with great action. Also, there are nice shots such as the opening scene as the camera hovers around mountains in the desert. The music, provided by legendary James Horner makes every little thing that much greater. What I saw critics and general reviews poke at the most was the fact that the Navajo soldiers were minor characters and that there was no ""windtalking"" or codecracking. That would be my biggest complaint. It is clear that this draws influence from previous war classics, mainly Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, and this may be inferior to those, but it is still and great flick.<br/><br/>3/4"

","Anyone who has seen John Woo's appallingly comic-bookish early HK actioner, Heroes Shed No Tears, will understand the summary line after watching Windtalkers.<br/><br/>I'm a HUGE fan of Woo's Triad shoot-em-ups, esp Hard Boiled, but his lackluster Hollywood efforts have taught me to keep my expectations low. Still, I wasn't prepared for a regression of this magnitude.<br/><br/>Woo's style is completely out of place for any kind of film with historical import. I kept shaking my head during battle sequences, wondering ""What were they thinking?"" Every grenade, bomb, and shell seems loaded with gasoline, and the gunplay is absurd. There was very little (if any) tactical sense to the battles, and the battlefield deaths were so impersonal or hackneyed they lost any intended ""horror of war"" effect. The discontinuity between the terrain and foliage of the establishing shots of Saipan and the character scenes was so severe, I really wonder if anyone was in control of this movie. Was there no military/historical advisor on the set?<br/><br/>It's a shame that the true tactical and strategic importance of the Navajo codetalkers (peripheral to this film, as it turned out, and hamhandedly implemented when addressed) had to be frittered away on this film. Like Pearl Harbor, it's not likely to be revisited soon. Without knowing firsthand, I'd say The Thin Red Line recreates the terror of island fighting in a much much more realistic manner. Woo, the action god, needs to stick with quasi-exotic urban locales with gangsters and good guys."

","John Woo should definitely stick to action films and steer clear of the niche market of war films.  Sure, Windtalkers was eye candy abound, but it was a lightweight compared to relatively recent Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, and Black Hawk Down.  The plot was barely plausible as these things go, but the way the film was presented was just wrong for a war flick.  Grenades that produce huge fireballs and wildly aimed shots with a pistol hitting targets galour just insults the audience's intelligence. And does no one know of such a thing as ""taking cover"" in the movie?  Woo sure takes the easy way out in churing out casualty after casualty, making poor stunt guys take leaps of death left right and centre for the sake of showmanship.<br/><br/>I hope John Woo never makes another war film again.

","I was asking for pain tonight.  I knew this would be a horrible movie, but my wife was out of town and I grabbed a few war movies at the video store.<br/><br/>I had no idea it was this bad.  John Woo has made a truly trite, shallow, Z-grade, 1940's war movie.  Please kill the writer!  It's beyond description how leaden and cliche'd the dialogue is.  Witness the crying child, reaching out as his father gets on the bus (of course he's the last one to get on as the door closes and he looks back...  GAG!) See the well-worn exchange between the ""nurse"" and the ""grizzled vet.""  Watch as the Norwegian guy from Fargo & Big Lebowski plays a Marine officer with a very strange accent.  It just keeps going down the comode.<br/><br/>I can't help but wonder if the Chinese influence is at work here.  Woo's early films, and others in that genre (HK gangster action) rely on the conventions and cliches of American film noir and action cinema.  They try very hard to be Western movie stars in a vaguely eastern context.  Is that what is happening here?<br/><br/>It's the voice in Windtalkers that gives it away for me.  It's so clear that Woo wanted to make a film like ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" or ""Battleground"".  But he simply copied the surface and not the spirit of those classics.  He takes the easy way out.   <br/><br/>I have to bitch about the introduction of Cage's character because it will make me feel good to get this out.  After watching Thin Red Line, Terrence Malick's flawless film of the Pacific War, I can't help but make comparisons.  As Cage is hiking through the jungle, his men are chopped to pieces by bullets, bayonets, and swords.  Cage and 3 other forgettables are gathered around a tree trunk to make their last stand.  After 2 characters have yelled, ""we're out of ammo!"", the men continue to pour lead from their eager weapons into the swarming Japanese.  As they were on patrol and moving moments ago, Cage now informs the 3 survivors that , ""We're MARINES, and we've been ordered to hold the position!"" Everyone is handily killed except for Cage (who's name is JOE, perfect for this era of chest-thumping film). After this trauma he works hard to be cold-blooded killer of ""Japs"".

It describes the importance of Navajo code talkers to the US army during World War II. At the same time it describes the view of the American army to these same Navajo soldiers who were just as other minorities seen as inferior.<br/><br/>The two main aspects why I thoroughly enjoyed this movie: the excellent combination of John Woo's fantastic direction and the editing and cinematography. Both in big, wide shots and in close by scenes the movie is brilliantly made with great eye for detail with fantastic shots. Of course a number of scenes are not very realistic. Of course John Woo goes over the top completely with explosions, according to some. But search for the described battle: looks like they went over the top there as well.<br/><br/>Second reason: as the main character, a marine traumatized by previous experiences and always justifying his actions because he followed his orders and at the same time doubting that principle, Cage showed again that he is a great actor. He was impressive! Never mind the reviews of people who are negative about the film because they don't like Woo and/or Cage.

","""Windtalkers"" is the latest action film that contains a lot of unnecessary action sequences and war epic that is an embarrassment to a genre that has brought excellence and honor to those who served and a world, which have been witness to films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""We Were Soldiers."" Overblown action sequences, phony sentimentality and zero character development should give everyone enough reason to pass by ""Windtalkers"" and choose another film to watch. Nicolas Cage, Adam Beach, Roger Willie and Christian Slater unsuccessfully attempt to salvage a film that has lost so much with its writing and senseless action sequences.<br/><br/>Following my exit of the theater, I had to ask myself one question: Have there been too many war films made in Hollywood? This question is very difficult to answer, but fans will avoid them if films like ""Windtalkers"" are made because they will cringe at the senseless action and violence.<br/><br/>It disappoints me to watch a film that has such great potential but buckles under the poor execution of a script that was dead from the start. Fault must lie with the writers as they took a concept and failed to take advantage of the great potential it contained. <br/><br/>Instead, they turned it into a collage of excessive action sequences with no attempt to develop the characters and create valid empathy toward those involved. For example, the writers failed to capitalize on the plethora of opportunities to delve in the background of the code talkers portrayed by Beach and Willie.<br/><br/>Another missed opportunity was the failure to capture a true sense of bonding among the soldiers. The ideal opportunity to capitalize on this occurred between the battle scenes, but there was one major problem; there was little time was spent between battle scenes.<br/><br/>Cage is one of the most versatile actors starring in many different roles and becoming a success with each part, for this reason I jumped at the chance to watch ""Windtalkers."" Portraying everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and ""Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess"" as well as action star in ""Con Air"" and ""The Rock,""<br/><br/>Cage has solidified himself a spot as one of the top stars in Hollywood. However, his performance as Sgt Joe Enders was lackluster at best showing zero charisma and containing no sense of taking the leadership role. As I was watching the screen, I was shaking my head in disbelief at the number of times I asked myself where his dominating presence went.<br/><br/>For all the talent Cage has and success he has received, I have no doubt that Cage will bounce back and climb out of the valley he is currently in after ""Windtalkers.""<br/><br/>While it wasn't his best role, it was a delight to watch Slater because he has a spark that comes out of each performance he gives. He has always been an actor that viewers can relate to as he has a youthful look of innocence and can be depended upon to deliver time after time. I knew it would be extra special watching Slater in this movie since it is a departure for him from the roles he has been taking. <br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" didn't fail due to his lack of effort because it was clear that he took his role seriously and wanted to do well. There is one guarantee I can make; Slater will not disappoint the audience with the performance he gives as Sgt. Ryan 'Ox' Anderson, a soldier enlisted to protect a code talker.<br/><br/>For all of the faults it contained, ""Windtalkers"" can boast of one bright spot; the name of this bright spot is Adam Beach. A virtual unknown, Beach comes out of obscurity to grab the spotlight from veterans such as Cage and Slater. <br/><br/>Beach's performance was so good it nearly made forget how bad the movie really was. Beach is one of the brightest young stars I have seen in a long time. Beach has won my respect and has proven that he is an actor who can give performances utilizing little effort.<br/><br/>Aside from the premise ""Windtalkers"" is supposed to based upon and Beach's great performance, this film falls flat on its face. Director John Woo missed the mark, Cage and Slater made the wrong choice to star in ""Windtalkers"" and Beach starred in the wrong movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Windtalkers"" is a film for those who don't mind watching an overblown action film with zero story development and no character development."

Instead it's about Nicholas Cage's angst.<br/><br/>Nicholas - I'm just letting you know that I changed my name from Coppola so I wouldn't get any special treatment - Cage did some decent stuff a few years ago: Valley Girl, Raising Arizona, Moonstruck, Vampire's Kiss, Wild at Heart. In the last he was on the edge; after that he just stopped trying. Since then he gets by with 2-3 facial expressions and doesn't do much more. He's the same guy in every movie: he stares meaningfully at the camera and doesn't talk much until he's ready to act.<br/><br/>So Windtalkers: Here he's a tough Marine who has an amazing ability to dodge bullets & explosive bits while the folks around him are shredded. And bayoneted - whew, I'd never seen so many people killed with a bayonet.<br/><br/>If you like WWII stories that involve blood, explosions, death, more death, and lots of knife/bayonet action, you may like it. Don't expect anything of a story or plot. Don't expect even a line of good dialogue. And look away when the Marines are overrun by a regiment-sized sneak attack on their secured position."

","Possible mild SPOILERS- you really can't talk about this movie without revealing some of the action because it's the sort of movie people have to know something about to decide whether to see it) <br/><br/>	My family has been looking forward to this film for some time because my Dad was a Captain in the Marines at the time and spent some time with the Navajo code-talker operation. He has a wonderful documentary that was put out a few years ago on the subject and this dramatic presentation naturally peaked our interest. But my parents wanted me to see it first because Mom hates violence and Dad has some trouble seeing, which makes it hard to follow some movies. Perhaps there are people out there with the same sensibilities who might like to know what I told them.<br/><br/>	The film is an excellent drama with wonderful, Oscar-caliber acting. Nicholas Cage's forte is playing world weary types and he gets the role of his career here, (much better than in ""Leaving Las Vegas""). he's a guy who was never any good at anything until he became a soldier. Even that wouldn't have worked out except there was a war on and he found he was very good at killing people. But he's not so impressed at that, especially after his squad is wiped out-except for him in the opening battle. He winds up with a symbolic injury- an inner ear problem that effects his sense of balance. He hates war but isn't any good at anything else so he feels compelled to return to it. He doesn't fight out of patriotism or beliefs because he doesn't have any. Maybe he never did. <br/><br/>   	Adam Beach is just the opposite, a real ""Sunny Jim"" type with a family, a religion and a country he believes in. Page starts out having utter contempt for him and doesn't want to be his friend because he might have to kill him. As the film progresses, they move closer and closer to each other from decidedly different directions as Cage finds his humanity reawakened, (or awakened), as his admiration for Beach grows, while Beach has to find it in himself to hate someone enough to kill them. They wind up comrades in spirit as well as in arms and watching these two actors perform this gradual transformation is one of the best pieces of acting I have seen in a movie in a long time. <br/><br/>	But you have to be able to sit through the movie first. The plot has it's contrivances and turns from merely dramatic to almost absurdly melodramatic at the end. To John Woo's credit, he keeps the blood and gore to a bare minimum, considering all the death he depicts. You never know when a terrible fire fight is going to break out and when they do, an awful lot of people die in front of you. Probably a hundred people do ""the dance of death"" while being riddled with bullets, (including one guy who pirouettes several times for some reason). A couple dozen guys go flying through the air after explosions, one of them landing without his foot. Improbably, a guy gets beheaded with a samurai sword in the middle of a modern battle. In the worst scene, a marine with a flame-thrower is offering some candy to a crying girl in what is supposed to be a ""secure"" village. A battle breaks out, his tanks are ruptured and he gets incinerated right in front of the girl- and us. Even if you are used to action or horror movies, there's a certain  amount of battle fatigue that sets in here. <br/><br/>	I had to tell my mother she would not enjoy watching this film, even if she might be impressed with the acting. I told Dad that, due to his vision problems, there would be long stretches where there was nothing but noise and he would not know what was going on. There are also subtitles that would have to be read off to him. I suggested the documentary he had was a better way to remember the code takers. One of the weaknesses of the film is that there really isn't enough about the code talking program. it's already been thought of and is already underway when the film begins. There's a brief early classroom scene but the real story of the code is not told here. It's really just a plot device to set up the moral dilemma the Cage character faces. A dilemma, by the way, that is pure Hollywood, according to my Dad. The only people they were told to kill were the Japs."

","Nothing against Navajo and there way of life but this movie just planed suck. This just adds to many of Cage's disappointing films. These movie really reminds me of The Thin Red Line. As you may or may not know this movie was based on the top secret language of the Navajo. The army used the Navajo language to transmit messages to other friendly people, without the Japanese knowing. Though it was obviously a war movie, and poor at that, I think Woo should have gone more in deep  with the Navajo people and their way of life.We don't get to know the characters. The war scenes had a Arnold Swar.....(terminator), how ever you spell his name ,tune to it. ""I'am (Cage)going to stand straight up and shoot a pistol at hundreds of Japanese soldiers, killing all of them, at the same time protect a Navajo man with no military training who doesn't use his language maybe but twice in the movie and not even get dirt in my eye, not to mention getting shot."" It was way below realistic. If you want to know anything about the Navajo involvement in WWII, your better off reading a book because this movie is just a John Woo 'kill them all' movie."""
"Aylmer","9","8","18","16 June 2002"," a movie for guys who like movies!
","John Woo may possibly be the best director working in Hollywood today.  He has a perfect sense of balletic style to his action scenes unseen in this country since Sam Peckinpah.  He also seems to derive a lot of inspiration from Italian filmmakers.  He has the best slow motion since Enzo G. Castellari and the use of zoom lens since Umberto Lenzi.  Blend this technique into an ultra-violent war film and you get quite an entertaining package.<br/><br/>People interested in well-told stories and believability should skip this one.  This movie is far from realistic with lead actor Cage easily mowing down scores of Japanese soldiers without even looking at them.  Every American soldier killed in the movie takes at least 2-3 bullet hits before biting the dust (eventually) while the Japanese soldiers instantly die once a shot is fired in their vague direction.  However, the film has lots of action, lots of killings, and actually a couple fairly suspenseful scenes to keep you more-than awake.  Those of you B-movie fans out there will be pleased to see the triumphant return of stock war footage in place of cheesy CGI for the battleship scenes... though there is light use of CGI later in the film for the airplanes.<br/><br/>This is the true victory of style over content.  Although the film wanders from its original path and gets lost in the action, you'll be far too entertained to care.  Those of you viewers who are like me and like to turn your brain off and just watch hundreds of humans blow each other to bits, those of you who were angered by how WE WERE SOLDIERS kept cutting back to ""the home front"", should waste no time in seeing this film.  It's a classic action-packed and violent war film which pulls no punches and has no romance... just the way we like it.  The story of Navajo code-talking is negligible and barely scratched, but the acting is decent, photography and set design excellent, and action/stuntwork absolutely spectacular.<br/><br/>The film is mildly repetitive and overlong, but a lot of us out here like this kind of film that way.  Now if only they'd make a film presenting the war from the Japanese perspective... (besides TORA! TORA! TORA!, which was only 1/2 Japanese anyway)"
"joeypogi","8","6","13","29 July 2002"," John Woo's Best American movie
","I think this is John Woo's breakthrough American film. He did things here that he didn't do in his earlier US movies. And he did things here that he could not have done in Hong Kong. Too bad it didn't make that much money. But I believe that you will see even greater US movies coming from John Woo from now on."
"Bezenby","5","3","5","28 April 2009"," Deserves the scorn it receives...but it is funny
","I thought that since the release of Saving Private Ryan, World War Two movies had moved into the realm of the ultra-serious, but this ain't the case with Windtalkers, which somehow manages to be utterly ridiculous, boring, and hilarious.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is Joe Enders, a guy who watched all his buddies getting wasted before surviving a direct hit from a grenade. After miraculously recovering, he is sent to Saipan to watch over a Navajo radio operator, who is using some new encryption to call in air strikes. We follow the two, and their fellow soldiers, as they lay waste to Saipan and several thousand Japanese soldiers.<br/><br/>The film drags at first as we're introduced to various squad members: the standoffish Enders, the Navajo guy, the other Navajo guy, the redneck racist, the family man, and Christian Slater, but when they reach Saipan things kick into gear.<br/><br/>Every grenade explodes with the power of a 20 megaton warhead. Each bullet fired by Cage brings down 10 Japanese soldiers, who don't use cover but just run straight at the marines. Cage's squad always seems to sprout new marines to be blown into the air. Every action scene takes places in a storm of explosions. Most of the marines are indestructible until the script says it's time for them to die.<br/><br/>...and now and again, the fighting stops, so the men can gather round a campfire and wonder what the war is really about...<br/><br/>...But not for long as another 100,000 Japanese guys charge towards them, starting yet another protracted battle sequence.<br/><br/>The worrying thing about Windtalkers is that even at first glance there's dozens of moments where you're thinking 'this is really stupid' or 'that's completely clichéd' or 'well, that bit was quite funny'. I guess it all depends how you approach films in general.<br/><br/>Best bit: They can't get through a fortified Japanese position, so Cage and Navajo simply walk around the back. Magic."

","This was by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen (for a major Hollywood release). They took a fascinating story and totally ruined it. The historical, political, and emotional significance of the actual story could have made a great movie. Instead we got Nicolas Cage as the oldest corporal in the history if the modern Marines Corps, lousy directing, lousy locations (filming in the desert when the action is supposed to take place on a Pacific Island--do they think viewers are stupid?) After watching this, I really felt like the director and studio just threw this together as quickly as possible after the actual code talkers were recognized by the US govt. Hollywood should be ashamed."
"bix171","5","3","5","23 November 2002"," A Sappy Screenplay
","A well-paced second half almost redeems John Woo's war picture, which suffers from a first half bogged down by awkward exposition and some amazingly corny dialogue throughout courtesy of screenwriters John Rice and Joe Batteer. Though he attempts to bring a heightened realism to the genre (a la `Saving Private Ryan' and `The Thin Red Line'), Woo seems stuck in a forties time warp when it comes to character development and interaction (everyone's here: the racially divided loners, the white bigot, the Greek, the Italian, etc.) and the material's surface skimming is frustrating. But there's an interesting performance from Nicolas Cage as a tormented World War II Marine assigned to protect (along with counterpart Christian Slater) the code needed to attack the Japanese on Sai-Pan; that the code is held by two Navajos is less important than the code talkers not being captured alive and forms the crux of Cage's dilemma as he begins to form an uneasy bond with one of them (Adam Beach). Cage, who has a tendency to overplay, remains fairly sullen and though he threatens at times to explode into parody thanks to the sappy screenplay, he manages to stay in character for the duration and any sympathy we feel towards him is well-earned. After the impersonal hack job Woo did on `Mission: Impossible II', he seems gratified to return to his usual theme of male bonding between opposites and while the setting should be a good one for him, the bad writing keeps the film from coming alive. Jeffrey L. Kimball's sharp cinematography is a plus."

","To begin with, I am a 56 year old male, a veteran of 28 years active duty in the Marine Corps.  I am a graduate of both the basic and advanced communications officer courses at Quantico, as well as the career cryptologic officer course at Fort Meade, Maryland.  Coincidentally, I was also present at the retirement of one of the last, if not the last, Navajo code talkers from the Marine Corps in 1973.  I can't guarantee that I have seen every war movie ever made (both pro- and anti- and neutral on war), but I've probably seen 95% of them.  I'm confident that I've seen every talking movie made about Marines.<br/><br/>In my personal and professional opinion, Windtalkers is absolutely the WORST war movie I have ever seen.  If someone was born yesterday and had no knowledge of the Navajos' performance for the Corps in WW II, it might rate one tiny point of redeeming social value.  But otherwise, the movie not only was useless as a historical portrayal (even a fictionalized one), but it perpetrates a lie as well --- that any Marine was under orders to kill another Marine to prevent him from falling into enemy hands.  Suicide MAY have been an option discussed, MURDER was not.<br/><br/>I have neither the time nor patience to list all the faults and inconsistencies with the movie, technical, tactical, moral and simply good storytelling.<br/><br/>Director Woo and lead actor Cage owe the Marine Corps and the American people an apology for perpetrating this travesty on the public.<br/><br/>And for the record, the Navajos were neither the only nor the first native Americans who used their native language to foil enemy communications intercepts."
"Ten98","Null","3","5","15 August 2002"," The worst film I've seen in 10 years
","Well, where should I start? This film is so monumentally bad it almost defies description, but here goes:<br/><br/>I normally have a lot of respect for Nick Cage, he plays his roles well, but in this he seems to play every cliché in the book. He is Sergeant Joe Enders, a man seemingly so disturbed by the loss of his platoon that he's popping pills every five minutes, and constantly losing himself in flashbacks. He can't hear one minute, and is fine the next, and develops a love interest so cheesy, clichéd and predictable that you half expect something more interesting to be going on... But it isn't. Adam Beach plays a reasonably convincing Ben Yahzee, a Navaho Indian who signed up to help protect his country as a code-talking radio operator, but isn't quite ready for combat. We all know the drill here, it's the seasoned disaffected veteran and fresh faced rookie ""getting to know you"" double act that we've seen a million times in a million different scenarios.<br/><br/>I defy anyone not to roll their eyes back in their heads and say ""oh my god"" at least once in this movie. Peter Stormare's attempt at an American accent should get most people going, but if that doesn't do it for you how about a Harmonica / Weird Native American flute thing duet, or the tedious love letter scenes, in fact just about every scene elicited the same response: WHY?<br/><br/>To call this film derivative is being generous, to even compare it to another film is doing that film a disservice, Imagine World War 2 being fought by the most idiotic bunch of soldiers you've ever seen. The gun battles are hilarious, they are so unrealistic you wonder who the hell said ""yes, that looks good, let's put that in the movie"" because whoever it was sure smokem um peace pipe that day. Nick Cage seems to be the only person who can actually fire a gun, and boy can he fire it, he mows down at least 8 people in one scene with a single clip, holding down the trigger, making his game face and spraying wildly into the air. You can see in some scenes he's not even pointing the gun at them and they're Falling over dead. Apparently getting your whole unit killed gives you some kind of super powers that allow you to run headlong into the enemy and shoot anyone without ever getting hit. The explosions and effects are all very cheap, it looks more like a fireworks display than a battle most of the time. In one scene, a battleship shells the land from out at sea. It literally looks like someone's taken some footage of a battleship firing from CNN, and spliced it into the movie.<br/><br/>I could go on for many many more pages about all the bad points of this movie but I won't, suffice to say AVOID IT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT."
"TheFly-2","9","3","5","8 June 2002"," Enjoyable film, good depiction
","I had the opportunity to see this film Thursday evening during it's press screening here in Tampa.  My first barometer in measuring a movie is my watch.  Am I tempted to look at it and, if so, how often?  The answer for this film was a flat zero.  The film was engaging and had a good story to tell.  It handled the Pacific Theater fighting of WWII pretty well and made it very believable.  I can't comment on how accurate the story itself is but it is based on a true story.  The action often springs up on the viewer and can be a bit unsettling, but that's war.  The depiction of war is along the lines of Saving Private Ryan - it is not flattering or heroic.  The heroes of the film are flawed human beings who sometimes let their prejudices and emotions get in the way.  I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one. John Woo is known as an action-film director and I've never been a huge fan of Nicholas Cage.  Both did their job well.  In all honesty, this film may deserve to be remembered when Oscar time comes around.  If you want to see a good, fairly realistic, WWII film then this one may be for you."

However, I had to walk out after about 45 minutes, because the direction was so godawful.  The combination of wholly inappropriate uses of slow motion and swelling upbeat music while the bodies fly, made all the violence in the movie seem more like 'A-team', and less like 'Saving Private Ryan'.  If you want a war movie, this is not it.  If you want a Hong Kong action flick with the characters dressed as Japanese or US soldiers, this may be the movie for you.

"Sharkey360","6","5","11","2 August 2002"," John Woo does it again with greatness! Cage's act is his best in years!
","WINDTALKERS is a World War II movie that takes a close look on why the US forces won the Pacific...the Navajos and their code. Along with them came John Woo's style of story telling, namely human relationships between characters ala 1989's THE KILLER.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays Joe Enders who is assigned to protect the force's Navajo codetalkers but most of all, protect the code at ALL COSTS. Adam Beach plays Yahzee whom Enders is assigned to, and with his part you can see the Navajo culture. Christian Slater, who expectedly did not have that much screen time as one might think, plays the friendly soldier Ox who is assigned to another Navajo named Whitehorse.<br/><br/>Cage's performance in this movie is nothing less than excellent, in fact I believe it's his best performance since his award-winning role in 1995's LEAVING LAS VEGAS. Enders is traumatized in the beginning, has personal clashes, suffers from his left ear, and tried so hard to relate with others before finally realizing his mission and its value. Cage also showed A LOT of emotion throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The Navajos were well portrayed. Not only did they have to leave their homeland and families to train and fight, they also had to deal with the realities of war, war horror and even discrimination in their own army. The movie showed that Navajos truly deserved honor right in the beginning, and they had to wait over 55 years for it. Another thing here...you can really feel the pain Navajos get when they're discriminated or snubbed or used.<br/><br/>John Woo's directing in this movie is rather different from his other movies. Don't expect any 2-fisted gunplay here, don't expect any of his action gimmicks but the one thing you should expect is the way he directs his characters...through human relations. Just like the classic THE KILLER, Windtalkers showed deep character development between Enders and Yahzee. While The Killer showed the boundary between an assassin and a cop gets erased, the boundary between the white man and the Navajo also gets cleared off leading to one major cause to fight and stand for in the war.<br/><br/>There are several slow motion scenes here as well, although I do find them shorter played and seemed to run kinda faster than those in old movies. As for the violence, expect A LOT of bombing, firing, killing and other elements of destruction to fill the screen. It is John Woo's most violent film since his Hong Kong movies, but they are not as graphic as that of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's not a bad thing though because the violence on-screen is very well worth watching. Woo surprised me with the fact that he is truly CAPABLE of directing a war movie. He can really direct thousands of extras to run forward with all those explosions and still make it look realistic and convincing. Woo is indeed not limited to the ""lone action hero"" style of screenplays with this movie, and aside from violence he can really bring out the act and emotions from his characters.<br/><br/>In concluding this, I give TWO-THUMBS UP for Woo's direction, the expressive cast and the story. WINDTALKERS is one of the best movies I've seen this year and it easily kills the earlier war movies like HART'S WAR, BEHIND ENEMY LINES and WE ARE SOLDIERS.<br/><br/>WINDTALKERS is not SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but it sure sits up there beside it. Easily one of the best war movies ever made.<br/><br/>Salute to Woo, the stars and the Navajos!"

He must have told them the outcome would look much different after editing. Nicholas Cage is no stranger to action flicks, where he has performed admirably in the past, but he definitely couldn't pull this one out with the guidance of Mr. Woo.

"dworldeater","8","1","1","3 May 2020"," My favorite of John Woo's efforts in Hollywood
","Windtalkers is a very underrated and misunderstood movie that was critically panned and did poorly at the box office. In some ways I can understand, as a realistic or historical accurate WW2 movie it definitely isn't. But as a long time admirer of John Woo's body of work I can appreciate this and enjoy it for what it is. This has Woo going back to more of his style of movie, but with big Hollywood budget and an American cast. In some ways I am reminded of Woo's A Bullet In The Head, but not nearly as dark . To say this is action packed is a serious understatement and the carnage on display here is nothing short of insane, but also in the tradition of John Woo action films, it also is beautiful. No one can shoot an action scene like John Woo. Even though this is heavily stylized, the dramatic scenes are really strong too. This does well showing the comaradery and bonding between these Marines at war and makes these characters able for audiences to relate to and care for. Nicolas Cage plays the lead and is a complicated and self loathing man who is ridden with guilt and is in conflict with himself and what his mission might entails him to do. At the same time, while a dark and conflicted character, Anders(Cage) is ultimately a righteous guy who always tries to to the right thing. To be honest, before seeing this I was not much of a fan of Cage's work, but I learned if he gets a good role he can take the ball and run with it. That is not to say that the support cast was not excellent as well. Adam Beach and Christian Slater were really good as well and were a good contrast for Cage's more downbeat performance. While Windtalkers is very stylized and brutal it is not without emotional resonance. The film is also beautifully photographed and scored . This is not Saving Private Ryan, but it is far from stupid and well above average when compared to lots of more standard run of the mill action movies that get heaped with more praise."

","Windtalkers is a war film with enough technical efficiency(which is a given as this is helmed by John Woo) to recommend any war buff and yet this film came and went without any notice. Why? Because Windtalkers is one of the least distinguished entries into the new genre of war movies. This film proves that more is needed than visceral displays of battle carnage, digitally amplified gunfire and explosions, and a camera that won't keep still. Woo is unquestionably a director of great talent and ability, but he went into this movie with too weak a script, and the result is little better than a mediocre and repetitive depiction of one offensive in the most important war of the last century. Another major flaw is that Windtalkers has a serious underlying message about the folly of racism. Unfortunately, Woo's approach to this subject matter is anything but subtle or thoughtful. The result is that the film comes across as preachy and cliched."
"anselmdaniel","6","1","1","2 December 2018"," A fun but historically inaccurate movie
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Windtalkers is an action movie that premiered in 2002. The movie is directed by John Woo and stars Nicolas Cage, and Adam Beach. The movie is inspired by Navajo code breakers on the
Pacific theater for the United States military. The movie follows two USMC Soldiers in the invasion of Saipan.<br/><br/>Windtalkers is a movie with a lot of problems. This movie is not historically accurate. I would treat this movie as freely influenced by real events. Much of this movie simply uses real events however it likes for its own benefit. This makes the movie feel contrived as so much of the movie felt like a Hollywood action movie. To some audiences, this is perfectly acceptable.<br/><br/>The movie follows two soldiers: Sergeant Joe Enders, played by Nicolas Cage, and Private Ben Yahzee, played by Adam Beach. These two soldiers are the protagonists in this movie but do not undergo a satisfying story. Much of this story felt contrived and their character interactions artificial. The dialogue felt so artificial and forced. Each of these characters have backstories that are simply given to the characters and not explored thoroughly. This makes the plot and characters in this move incredibly weak.<br/><br/>The movie does do its action well. John Woo can direct adrenaline pumping action scenes that dazzle the audience. This movie is filled with these scenes. These action scenes make the movie worth watching but are not particularly memorable. These action scenes are not like the fun ballet of bullets from John Woo's Hard Boiled movie and instead are more grounded in reality.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage does deliver a classic Nicolas Cage acting moment here. He is more restricted in his role here but he does have insane freak out moments. Nicolas Cage makes this movie entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>I would still recommend Windtalkers despite its obvious flaws. It is an entertaining movie that only uses history as a setting.<br/><br/>Grade: C"
"vchimpanzee","Null","1","1","2 September 2015"," Educates about code talkers, but not really about them; pretty good otherwise
","I had heard about the Code Talkers and understood their efforts were important to winning World War II. I found the idea of watching a movie about their efforts interesting.<br/><br/>I didn't really understand how Nicolas Cage getting in a jam in the Solomon Islands and acting heroically contributed to that, but I kept watching. Eventually, I made the connection. His flawed and damaged character was being put in charge of keeping a Code Talker safe. <br/><br/>I hadn't considered the possibility of a Code Talker being put in a combat situation, and yet this movie made clear how vital their efforts were even on the battlefield. We also got to see how risky it was to be a Code Talker in this situation, since the Japanese somehow knew about these people and would find them valuable. Yes, the possibility of the code being revealed to the enemy has a tragic consequence. Many hard decisions were made here.<br/><br/>Although I wasn't really prepared for battle and didn't like the violence that went with it, combat scenes were effectively done. Nicolas Cage, of course, is a Rambo or Schwarznegger which is good for movie audiences if not necessarily realistic. <br/><br/>The relationships that develop between fighting men made the movie interesting.<br/><br/>Adam Beach did a fine job and was quite likable. Whether he looked like an Indian or not, and whether he really looked Japanese (which became important in one scene), didn't matter to me. I went with my neighbors to the Cherokee reservation in North Carolina a few years ago and the campaign billboards, during a race for chief, showed a man who could have passed for white. Actually, Beach looked more like the other type of Indian. But the important thing was his character's pride in his heritage, and the scenes that showed his culture, particularly with his friend Charlie Whitehorse. <br/><br/>The scenery in the American West is great. And the areas where combat took place also are nice to look at.<br/><br/>I was impressed that one of the military bases somehow got a 50-star flag more than 15 years before there were actually 50 states. I wonder when that flag was developed? Still, a regular 48-star flag would have been better for consistency.<br/><br/>If the objective was to tell people this film was about Code Talkers and to focus on a flawed but heroic white marine and show the Code Talkers' battlefield actions as a supplement to the main plot, then I believe the goal was achieved."

This takes away from the experience. To begin with, all the actors look like they've just taken a shower, and their uniforms just delivered from the cleaners. Nicholas Cage doesn't look like a war worn soldier that he's supposed to be.<br/><br/>This is one of the early John Woo film that's made by Hollywood. It was made around the same time as another Asian movie director Ang Lee's ""Hulk"". They share similarity in that they both look too clean to be real.<br/><br/>The concept of the movie was pretty good, but the human drama, was weak.

","If you love action, regardless of the realism sacrificed, then yes you will love this. And I'm talking for beginners of the war genre as a whole. Allow me to elaborate. A lot of the cinematography and scenery is beautiful and the location shots are for the most part well done. The costumes and weapons look great and accurate. However, there are many parts I find laughable about this movie. For one, the character development is weak despite an attempt to tell a tale not known by many; that of the Navajo Code Talkers. Speaking of which, the non-Caucasian characters are barely gone into at all and very clichÃ©. The movie spends the majority of its focus on the mere gore of war, which definitely is a necessary factor in any movie about war. It maintains the sad realism of war, but this film relies on that alone and nothing else. To add to this Nicholas Cage makes sport out of the bloodiest conflicts of World War II by single-handedly wiping gout whole regiments of Japanese soldiers. When I watched it, I felt as if I was watching a Rambo film from the 80s. And I'm not talking the original ""First Blood""; I'm talking the popular but incredibly unrealistic sequel which is probably the most popular."

","The movie advertises itself to be about Native American Navahos using their Navaho language as an unbreakable code in WWII.  However, I didn't find the movie to be about that at all.  There were a couple of ""Windtalker"" characters in the movie.  But, they were just there as a plot point to give give Cage the excuse to have a mission of protecting the code... not the person, but the code.  That means he can't let the ""Windtalkers"" fall into enemy hands at any cost.  So, naturally, they immediately run the ""Windtalkers"" to the front lines where they run randomly around in circles while Cage follows along with a machine gun mowing down dozens of enemy soldiers at a time.  And since they really want to protect the code, they do things like putting one of them in a Japanese uniform so he can walk right into the enemy camp... Of course cage goes along.  Machine guns blaze, and Rambo, er rather Cage, racks up huge body counts mostly in slow motion. There is a tremendous amount of close up fighting.  Lots of hand to hand combat, lots of hand gernades... and none of it seemed realistic to me. Apparently both the Japanese and US armies believed in having a few soldiers constantly yelling and running out into the open where they could be shot easily.<br/><br/>Did the US army really use the windtalkers on the front lines to give coordinates for artillery?  Once they sent in the coordinates the shelling started almost immediately, what difference would it have made if they gave the coordinates in English?  Maybe this is historically accurate, but I have a feeling the ""windtalkers"" were probably used more to coordinate the date of attacks, help coordinate meeting points, and probably not on the front lines fighting hand to hand.  <br/><br/>I found the movie unrealistic, unentertaining, and unwatchable."

There are many explosions with fireballs but that is something we come to expect in Mission Impossible 2 but not in the post-Saving Private Ryan war genre. The character which has the most depth is Sgt Enders, played by Nic Cage. He is a grizzled warrior who has to look after Adam Beach's Ben Yahzee.

","The underlying theme of the military use of the Navajo language should have presented the film-makers with an opportunity to explore an interesting fragment of WW2 history. Sadly the theme is used simply as a hook on which to hang yet another visceral war film. The result is a cliche-ridden piece which adds little to our knowledge of the war in the Pacific that hadn't already been provided by John Wayne and others. The film's makers may well have set out with the intention of creating a mix of entertainment and education but quickly succumbed to the temptation of presenting little more than pyrotechnics and the consequent blood and gore."
"jackjack-2","3","1","1","23 December 2002"," So-so war flick
","The only thing that this war flick has to offer is that it makes viewers aware of the Navajo Codetalkers. Other wise, it has no redeeming value. It fails completely as a story of the battle of Saipan and the use of the Codetalkers in that battle. It is amazing how the producers went to great lengths to use authentic equipment and uniforms but that is about all that was authentic about this movie. Like in one scene in Hawaii where the Marines were having a party and were singing the Marine's Hymn. Every one was dressed in authentic Khaki but one individual was wearing a barracks hat rather than a garrison cap as all the others wore. When Marines left the states, they did not take barracks hats with them.<br/><br/>Any resemblance to the actual battle for Saipan and the movie is purely coincidental. One example was the foliage in the movie. Saipan is a tropical island yet in several scenes it looked like it was shot in an autumn with trees that are not on Saipan and with yellow leaves.<br/><br/>The Japanese never charged in daylight. All their charges were at night and they did not charge the first days of the battle. Unlike in the movie Japanese defensive positions were well dug in, mostly heavily reinforced bunkers and caves, so that they would not be vulnerable to air strikes. In the movie Japanese positions were wide trenches and some lightly covered gun positions, something one would never see in war.<br/><br/>And Nicholas Cage was supposed to protect his Navajo Codetalker. Instead he constantly exposed him to imminent danger. Codetalkers were rarely exposed to close in fighting. They were communicators usually working in headquarters. Early on Nicholas Cage, a sergeant, uses his Codetalker to direct Naval gunfire from the battleship U.S.S. California (which actually was there) onto enemy positions. Sergeants do not call in naval gunfire. That is done by specially trained officers. The same was true of directing artillery.<br/><br/>A battalion commander walks up to Cage and gives him a medal. Never happened that way. Medals were never awarded during a battle. They were always awarded after the battle was over in ceremonies where all men in the unit were present so all could see their comrades rewarded.<br/><br/>The civilians on Saipan were Japanese and they were so frightened of the Americans most committed suicide. It is highly unlikely that Marines ever had an opportunity to have contact with Japanese civilians because they all would have fled their villages.<br/><br/>In one scene Cage and his unit advance in a convoy on a recon mission. Never happened. Saipan had to be taken inch by inch and any vehicle that even got near the front lines (except for a tank) would have been destroyed by enemy fire.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the inaccuracies in the movie. It wasn't worth the price of admission. Being a former Marine I thought it would be interesting but it was just another John Wayne war flick."

Watch Nicholas Cage mow down dozens of Japs with his authentic Colt 45 and Thompson submachine gun; see Adam Beech deflect ignorant racism with mystical grace and aplomb; and Holy Toledo look at all them explosions!  I kept waiting for Richard Widmark to come bursting over the hill guns ablazing.  And how come the Japs didn't yell Banzai?<br/><br/>The movie does tell the interesting and important story of the Navajo code talkers.  There's no sappy love story.  And when it doesn't go way over the top into the realm of Sergeant Savage comic books, it also captures the confusion and mania of battle truly making this a movie that should be seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>But other recent films have surely treated the terror, sense of helplessness, and random selection of combat a lot better. Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and We Were Soldiers all struck a more somber, realistic chord without getting too caught up in cliches of religion in the foxhole.<br/><br/>What's really disappointing is how the underlying story and brutality often get sublimated in the stylish choreography so that you're left thinking, ""That's cool"" or ""How did they get that thing to blow up like that?"" Unlike other recent combat films, it doesn't make you glad you weren't there and awestruck and respectful of those who were."

","If you want to see an action film with some fine combat scenes, Windtalkers may be for you. If you are looking for an in-depth inspection of soldiers at war and relationships amongst soldiers like in Saving Private Ryan, rent SPR or Thin Red line instead. In Windtalkers, John Woo incorporates his usual style of intense shootouts meshed with slow motion moments of calm, and it seems to follow through on a battlefield just as well as it did in a chineese kitchen (hard boiled.) The only problem I found with Woo's style is that many of the action sequences did not capture the whole battlefield but only zoomed-in portions of it. This is unfortunate- It would have been better if techniques in ""Patton"" and ""A Bridge Too Far"" were used.      Nicolas Cage does a good job and once again an only slight variation of himself as a character is enough. Adam Beach and Roger Willie do a splendid job as the code-talkers. It was good to see Native Americans honored for their services in WWII.      Windtalkers may not be the movie of the summer but war movie buffs should take a look. Although it does not have a deep plot about war and the men that partake in it, it does bestow native american WWII vets some of the credit they deserve."

I was reminded of Pearl Harbor in that the action seems repetitive, the script becomes a vehicle for the actor, (could anybody leave Pearl Harbor without knowing Ben Affleck?!) and historical details get sacrificed for Hollywood polish and formula plot. When the soldiers arrive in the village I was expecting a Bat 21 kind of reluctant murder given Enders' hesitance to kill, or a Peckinpah slaughter of civilians.

","The land war against the Japanese in World War II essentially was a series of island campaigns.  Most were waged on small pieces of coral real estate where numbingly brutal carnage took place. No quarter was asked for or given and tactics for both sides essentially meant repetitive and costly frontal assaults.  Maneuver was irrelevant.<br/><br/>Three major campaigns involving relatively significant land areas - Saipan, Okinawa and the re-taking of the Philippines - provided the opportunity for maneuver based upon exploiting battlefield intelligence. While victory was never in doubt in these campaigns, minimizing casualties and ending operations as quickly as possible was only possible through well-coordinated all-services operations.<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" brings to the screen what the Department of Defense maintained as classified information until 1968 - the role of Navahos serving in the Marine Corps who relayed front line information to artillery batteries, warships and tactical air assets by radio in their native language. Lacking most of the words that described the panoply of death-dealing ordnance, the Native American Marines came up with neologisms that permitted accurate information to be swiftly and succinctly transmitted.<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" is the celluloid monument to these brave Marines who voluntarily joined the Corps, most coming from reservations and life experiences that hardly supported the intense patriotism these men showed. Their role was important although arguably less so than as depicted in the movie.<br/><br/>Fearful that a captured ""windtalker"" would give away the unique code if captured, each was assigned a Marine bodyguard instructed to, if necessary, kill his charge rather than allow him to be captured.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage, in his second World War II movie since his foolish role as the Puccini-loving Captain Corelli (""Captain Corelli's Mandolin""), gives a vivid and intense performance as Sergeant Joe Enders, a man who found a home in the Corps before the war.  Already blooded and wounded - physically and emotionally - by earlier fighting he is ordered to be the minder for Private Ben Yahzee, well played by Adam Beach.<br/><br/>A great deal of fighting follows, actually too much.  A bit of judicious editing would have removed some of the battle scenes that by their repetitiveness numbs rather than impresses.  While the theme of the film - the belated recognition of Navahos in a unique role - is new to the screen, ""Windtalkers"" follows closely in the wake of many World War II movies and especially those honoring the Marine Corps.  Enders is much more sensitive than John Wayne in ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" but he's a noncom any filmgoer has seen many, many times.<br/><br/>Enders's squad also reflects the usual cinematic re-creation of a combat unit.  Italian, Greek, Irish - from the East and the West Coast - everyone is here (except, curiously the almost ubiquitous war movie token Jew).  As to personalities, yep, there's that big time bigot, the guy who loves kids, the fellow who misses his wife so much, the would-be post-war local tycoon.<br/><br/>But the movie works.  And it works because it matters that a film shows THIS generation the power, decency and most of all raw courage and determination of World War II fighters.  The Marines may be the almost exclusive combatants here but service members of all the forces are reflected in the heroism and humanity shown here.  Director John Woo has given a gift of love to his adopted country and I say ""thanks.""<br/><br/>Before the end titles rolled I would have liked to see a screen telling viewers that many Indians served in the Pacific and not only as windtalkers (this is mentioned in one passing sentence in the film).  It would also have been nice to tell (not remind, in all likelihood) folks that Native American combat veterans returned, in the main, to reservations in worse shape than much of the conquered Axis territory, to an indifferent and even hostile public and government, to little hope and too much alcohol.  But I guess I may want too much.<br/><br/>I don't understand why this film's release was held up because of 11 September.  The uncomplicated but powerful patriotism of ""Windtalkers"" would have been as accepted - and more importantly, needed - then as it is now.<br/><br/>James Horner scored the film and the music is ridiculously intrusive. Can't Hollywood trust viewers to be gripped by scenes of desperate combat without a boring score accompanying banzai charges?<br/><br/>See this film on its own terms and be grateful for all who have served in wartime."

Instead of telling the story of the invasion of Saipan, the movie was entirely about Nicholas Cage. Cage. Cage. Cage. Watching the movie was a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire movie, I was angry at how John Woo decided to portray Saipan. First of all, there are absolutely no large hills on this island. I understood that shooting a WWII movie on Saipan is pretty much impossible because of the major development the island has gone through, but PLEASE do some research on the island before you shoot the movie. Hawaii is not the same as every single island in the Pacific.<br/><br/>Second, Garapan (one of the villages portrayed in the film) wasn't a village full of grass huts. It was a pretty well developed village. It was the largest, and still is the largest, village on Saipan.<br/><br/>Third, Saipan was occupied by the Japanese before the start of WWII. Thus, the fortifications on the island would've been a lot stronger than those shown in the movie. The successful invasion of Saipan was an extreme blow to Japanese morale because it was the first successful invasion of Japanese territory that was occupied before the war.<br/><br/>Every single time I see a clip of this movie, I get angry.

","After a disastrous military command where he lost all his men and part of his hearing, Sergeant Joe Enders wants back into the action. Faking his way through his medical he is soon back in action, charged to protect a ""windtalker"" one of the Navajo Marines who are used as code talkers to keep radio signals secret from the enemy; protect him that is, unless capture is imminent in which case Joe is to kill his charge. Put together with Private Ben Yahzee, Joe struggles to keep it together in battles where his rage drives him on, but his growing friendship with Joe threatens his entire mission.<br/><br/>Despite the names involved with this project, nothing else about it really grabbed me when it came out at the cinema; the action just looked noisy and the story looked like it would be lost in all that. Never let it be said that you can tell nothing from the trailers because it turns out that this is exactly what the film is like. The story is interesting in terms of a very basic piece of history but, beyond the one-sentence summary, there isn't really anything to learn. Being mostly fictionalised, the script still needed to create its own story to hook me and mostly it failed to do this. I never got involved with the characters and the few scenes where they share some corny dialogue or fire guns with a haunted ""terrible-regret-and-hurt-in-my-past-that-I-can't-let-go-of"" look in their eyes were not enough to create interest. Unsurprisingly the massive, noisy battle scenes dominate the film (easily without much to compete with them) and for many viewers these will do the job  for me they at least provided energy in the film.<br/><br/>However what surprised me was just how unexciting they were. So much is going on, so many things are blowing up that it is difficult to really get into it. Yes, in Face/Off and the likes, we had everything blowing up but that was fun and done all in the name of pure silly entertainment. With this I think Woo felt he couldn't make was ""fun"" so he seems to have lost his style, his unique flair for action and his ability to produce some very big, overblown, outrageous action. It is all visually impressive but partly down to the lack of style and partly down to the lack of substance I just didn't think it was anything special to make it stand out. In fact, this last criticism could go for the cast too  which was a surprise when you consider the names involved.<br/><br/>Cage has clearly been told by Woo to do that ""crazy, slightly haunted look"" and to do it over and over again, so that is what he spends most of the film doing. The rest of it he spends looking soft and wounded as he stops worrying and learns to love his Indian. Beach is pretty and he does make for an attractive character but the lack of depth leaves him pulling faces and jumping around just like everyone else. Considering his high-billing, Slater appeared to just walk in and out of the film as if he was required somewhere else. Stomare does nothing much but then nor do Emmerich, Ruffalo, Issacs and others who you would expect of at least being interesting.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a poor film, it is just a very average and unmemorable one. The lack of a good character-based story (or story full stop) means that the noisy action dominates and, without any unique style, flair or real excitement to that, it does become rather tiresome after a while. Of course if this is all you are after then it is probably noisy and violent enough but you should bare in mind three things: 1) there are more exciting action movies out there, 2) there are more meaningful war movies out there and, 3) there are much better John Woo films out there. With so many options, it is no wonder that I'll not be watching Windtalkers again anytime soon."
"shanfloyd","8","3","6","23 January 2005"," Quite original... not a typical war film.
","There's no point in comparing this movie with any of the great war movies that come in mind easily. This is never like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Black Hawk Down"" that focus mainly on action. This is not also quite like ""We were soldiers"" that displays the soldiers' minds and lives as the only theme. And it is again not like ""No man's land"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" that speak against violence of war and question national leaders etc. Although John Woo has put all these ingredients in little amounts into ""Windtalkers"", still perhaps this movie has a theme of its own. And what's that? Racial harmony and blah blah? One can't be sure of that too easily.<br/><br/>Now-a-days war movies are based on very interesting story lines that appears small and petty at first but that's where the director's mastery lies. This whole Navajo-Indians-protecting-the-code is such an original idea. I think this is the most gifted feature of the film, its basic idea. It opens the door for showing so many old things in new ways -- racial debate, cultural fusion, brotherhood among soldiers and sacrifice... all of them. A few very good scenes could adorn the movie for that reason (like that harmonica/flute collaboration?)<br/><br/>Yet 'Windtalkers' is never a classic. It's hard to believe why. The acting was very good. Adam Beach and Christian Slater are at their bests with a usual Nicholas Cage. The cinematography and effects were also top-class. Still it is not one of the all-time-great war films. Probably the reason behind it is that the sequences are a little bit incoherent. It does not have the pace to make the viewer glued to the seat. Cage is given unnecessary long screen time while the primary character should have been Beach. The story also got very predictable in the end. But these are not necessary criticisms. It is still Woo's one of the best works. Lovers of war movies... typical or atypical... should not miss it. 8/10"
"Angry_Arguer","Null","3","6","3 September 2003"," The Woo Method En-Masse
","Ever sine Face/Off, Hollywood has wanted to exploit the one talent John Woo has...cinematography.  I admit that most of the time his scripts and plots are absolute garbage (Broken Arrow, Hard-Boiled) and sometimes he is stuck with terrible acting (Hard Target), but, let's face it, Woo needs Chow Yun-fat as much as CYF needs Woo.  The two are a film 'item', one of the few great combinations of an actor and a director to make repeated visions of the same thing.<br/><br/>Enter Windtalkers: many ""great"" directors have tried their hands at war (Ridley Scott, Stanley Kubrick, Terrence Malick, Oliver Stone, etc.), but this has to be the worst rendition I have seen yet!  There are so many unnecessary subplots and scenes that the Windtalkers falls into a level of stereotype and idiocy not seen since the days of John Wayne.<br/><br/>As in the case of Blackhawk Down, the whole 'plot' is merely a leapfrog from one explosion-laden, cornball heroics-filled, slow-motion infested shoot-'em up.  Perhaps since Spielberg had more time to work on Private Ryan without having to worry so hard about imitation, he made a better film because of it.  Woo is too worried about using his same style over and over that the movie becomes as bad as Mission: Impossible 2.<br/><br/>The Woo Method, as I call it, is a 'script doctoring' process wherein any holes in the plot or shallowness in characters can be solved by throwing another gunfight to the audience like milkbones.  Many other directors have this problem, even the Wachowski brothers.  Woo's cinematography is almost total parody and I am sorry for James Horner for getting taken into this project.  No composer I can think of right now should have been involved.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage isn't as effective this time around.  I am sorely disappointed that he was stuck with a cliche role ripped straight from The Big Red One. Actually, the whole movie is nothing more than John Woo's version of The Thin Red Line--all the same nuances and attempts at being creative are here, but none of Malick's spirit is present.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a bad movie.  Don't see it.  1.5 out of 5 stars."

","Windtalkers is a disgrace to American Film. An entirely unconvincing Nicolas Cage headlined this gore orgy. Cage's performance as Joe Enders was as inspired as a can of Campbells soup, not the chunky kind either. The supporting cast followed suit.<br/><br/>This movie was over before it started, in my mind. Writers Rice and Batteer chose to focus not on the Navajo code-talkers, but their guards. Though the guards were interesting, they don't belong in the spotlight. This movie is proof that Hollywood is no longer interested stories, only dollars. Windtalkers should have been about Adam Beach and Roger Willie as Yahzee and Whitehorse, not Cage and his sidearm.<br/><br/>Anyone who says this movie promoted cross-cultural understanding and discouraged bigotry is completely wrong. What Windtalkers says, and what it does are two entirely different things. The production team obviously didn't believe in its brief `look at us! We're from different cultures but we're best buddies' segments. Inherent racism dominates Windtalkers. Of all the movies out there, this one cried the loudest for a Native American star. In the end this movie proves that Hollywood is unwilling to let Native Americans tell their own stories.<br/><br/>Windtalkers was as predictable as a metronome, and every bit as engaging. When the viewer is introduced to a person equipped with a flamethrower it is obvious the tank of gas will explode into flames. I liked it the first time I saw it, when it was called Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>And last, but certainly least, were the dreadfully repetitive battle sequences. Following the final battle sequence, Chick, played by Noah Emmerich, approaches Enders and Yahzee proclaiming `I think that's the last of em' after killing upwards of two million Japanese soldiers in downwards of two hours. I was expecting him to follow up with something like `I guess we'll have to send back to Japan for some more.' This movie trivializes death by killing so many people in a method completely devoid of any emotion. By the end of the movie I was just hoping Enders would die, or morph into Thomas Builds-the-Fire from Smoke Signals (The movie Adam Beach should be remembered for). At the end of the movie I didn't know whether I wanted to laugh at Cage's laughable performance, or cry because Windtalkers wasted an opportunity to tell the rare story worth telling."

","I went to watch this because it looked interesting and I lived in New Mexico on the border of the Navajo Reservation for 15 years. <br/><br/>This movie was incredible.  Nicholas Cage was outstanding as Sgt. Joe Enders, who was resistant to become friendly with Ben Yazzie(Adam Beach), the young Navajo Code Talker who became his charge.  They did become friends and Yazzie helped him work through his guilt at losing his men on the Solomon Islands.  And eventually, Enders has to reveal his orders which challenge his basic beliefs.  Adam Beach was excellant as the youthful young Navajo who became Ender's charge.  There was a fantastic chemistry between these two men, but that wasn't the only superb pairing.  Christian Slater and Roger Willie were excellant as Henderson and Whitehorse.  These two actors meshed their performances as Henderson and Whitehorse meshed their music and became friends.<br/><br/>The visuals were magnificent and brought out the beauty of Northeast Arizona and Northwest New Mexico.  The sweeping camera angels showed such wonderful monuments as the Shiprock, a sacred place to the Navajo.  The war scenes were graphic and harsh just as the carnage of war is.  The stunts were exceptional and the CGI graphics meshed the ground action with air action.<br/><br/>The directing was outstanding, which is too be expected of Mr. Woo.  He had the Native American actors portray the Navajo Code Talkers with dignity. The story by Rice and Batteer was a simple story which had been done before, but not in such an eloquent way.  There were the obligatory roles that the audience has come to expect from a war film: the tough sargaent, the young recruit, the bigot and those who accepted the young Navajo, but weren't sure what to make of him. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie highly, but caution the audience about the graphic battle scenes.  But if the audience can get past the graphic battle scenes this movie is more than worth the cost of admission and the audience will enjoy a very human story."

","W i n d t a l k e r s<br/><br/>Directed by John Woo<br/><br/>The heroism of certain illustrious representatives of the species Homo Sapiens has never ceased to amaze me. Growing up as a boy in Umhlali I had heard people speak with pride of the incredible courage of people like Mahatma Gandhi and Fatima Meer and Alan Paton. I did not know then of the astounding bravery of people like Ismail Meer and Nelson Mandela or H. A. Naidoo or Dr Goonam or the Rev Beyers Naude. Why all this?<br/><br/>I have just seen Windtalkers with Nicholas Cage directed by John Woo, possibly the best war movie I have seen this year. It is certainly up there with GLORY! and Saving Private Ryan. It is a superlative effort and has all the true grit of reality. Woo pays meticulous attention to detail and his camera pays loving homage to the American South West with its stunning landscape and its unearthly vista.<br/><br/>This movie had been panned by certain critics. Since it is a movie about the indigenous American Indian contribution to the war effort against Nippon and since, like most South Africans, I had grown up on a diet of John Wayne and Alan Ladd, I decided that I needed some balance.<br/><br/>I had also seen how some of the critics had panned brilliant epics like Michael Collins, The Patriot, The Legend of Bhagat Singh etc. and I suspected that they had another establishment agenda. So I decided to ignore the critics' comments; and seldom have I been happier with following my own Spirit!<br/><br/>The film depicts both Japanese and American heroism - and American racism. The Navajo volunteered for this War - and there is honour and glory in the movie even though Ben, the one code warrior actually names his son, George for George Washington - it reminded me of a South African Indian who named his son, 'Clive'. He, of course, didn't know the significance of Robert Clive in India's history - and didn't care to know.<br/><br/>One of the American soldiers talks of how his father remembered how the Indians were hunted like gophers and $3 was paid for each Comanche ear that was brought in. The devastation wreaked on flesh and blood by steel and explosive is demonstrated here in all its heart- wrenching reality as human beings behave worse than any force of nature, whether volcano, tornado or earthquake. These soldiers are not supermen, just very human men, trying to survive, trying to win, trying, in the end, to be human beings despite all the terror unleashed upon them by forces outside their control, forces which manipulate them like toys. This is a movie well worth seeing if one is interested in history and the kind of experiences our forebears went through. Victors always write history, but at last something of our own history is being written and shown. In a sense, that means we are winning too. And those uncomfortable with our history will always condemn what we know and what we write.<br/><br/>Review By Deena Padayachee"

Short range Tommy Guns given the range of rifles and hitting people at long range. Long range Browning Automatic Rifles being saved for close range. Grenades that seemed to be filled with napalm throwing huge petrol explosions 30 feet into the air. This was a WW2 Kung Fu film. Everyone was running around at double speed just like in those Hong Kong comedies. But this was supposed to bea serious film ? A career nadir for Cage. He has made a lot of rubbish but here he seemed to be stoned. A one man army without any emotion. Even John Wayne wasn't his bad in the 1960's. This was made in 2002.

","All though Windtalkers may be listed as a war film, it's more primarily one of those epic action film as the vast scenes of quick editing, gun fire and over the top death scenes from the soldiers make it so but that is what you'd come to expect from John Woo, this is very much a John Woo war film and we can tell. <br/><br/>The plot, revolving around native Americans and their secret language that the axis power of Japan cannot decipher is a breath of fresh air and a good basis for the story. It is refreshingly unique as it's something that I hadn't seen before in a war film; again, it seems more suited to an action film's plot ie; protecting certain people from an 'enemy' as seen in perhaps the three 'Terminator' films which are obviously high budget action films only with a war 'THEME', rather than basis. <br/><br/>The setting is as glorious as you'd expect but it doesn't matter as much as it is a simple 'go in and take the island' mission which is bizarre as the mission in this film really doesn't qualify at all in terms of importance, it's all about the radio operators and their job. This brings me onto the other characters. It's difficult to recognise each character individually as the main focus is around the two characters that of Joe Enders (Played by Cage) and his Windtalker: 'Yahzee'. We don't really get much of a chance to focus too much on anyone else apart from Charlie, Yahzee's friend from his village. Cage's character also adopts too much of a 'Rambo' figure in the film. It seems that Japanese soldiers drop just as quickly in this film as a 50 odd handicapped golfer drops shots in a standard round. It is very reminiscent to that of Vietnamese soldiers in Rambo's second outing.<br/><br/>This doesn't distract from the films battle scene quality. This is by far the best Woo can do when in comparison to that of 'Mission Impossible 2' or 'Hard Target', albeit that they were over the top in their own sense but this does have a slight hint of realism flavour. Be it the brutal opening exchanges on the Solomon Islands or the scenario best described by saying 'the Allies in this trench versus the Axis in the other trench. Let the mayhem begin', there is definitely something there for everyone and the action is realistic and accurate."

The scene that bothered me the most was the training scene where the Navahos meet Slater and Cage's characters for the first time. The scene, on the beach with the Marines training, running and living in a tent city looked as if was a left over set from Baa-Baa Black Sheep, a terrible TV series about Marine Aviators in the South Pacific. The direction was pedestrian, the effects ridiculous and the acting, well, what can I say? The drilling was laughable, and everything else looked like they had a casting call and filled replica Marine uniforms and had them walk around.<br/><br/>My son's 4th grade class put more emotion into their class play than this bunch.

The whole angle with the Navajo Indians is interesting, but it isn't explored enough. I think it was Roger Ebert who pointed out that it's more or less a gimmick for a standard war movie. Most of the characters are two-dimensional, and the only female supporting player is entirely forgotten by the last third (leaving me to suspect most of her scenes were excised altogether). These are my gripes, so what's good? If you're looking for pyrotechnics, there's plenty of that. The combat scenes are well done, with plenty of gunplay and explosions. It doesn't quite have the artistry of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but it's still an impressive spectacle--undoubtedly even more so on a big screen. I did appreciate some of the more subtle touches, such as the Navajo soldier playing the flute. The acting is decent enough, overall.

Michael Beach as one of the Navajo code talkers was passable, but the big surprise for me was roger Willie who was great as another code talker, and friend to Michael Beach's character.<br/><br/>For me, the worst part of this film, was the insultingly stupid combat/action scenes.  CGI aircraft making strafing runs while flying level or climbing, dropping never-miss bombs from ground level +3 inches, artillery (including naval bombardment) that hits first time, every time, good guys taking out entire sections of enemy at a single burst, the list goes on.<br/><br/>The following could be interpreted as a SPOILER, so you've been warned:<br/><br/>It's a pity they turned this into an action movie, because the story would have supported the film, had it been allowed to be told. At the end of a movie that runs for over two hours, I still had no idea where the code talkers fitted into the organisation, other than USMC infantry. The film covered almost nothing of the code transmission, nor its effectiveness at delivering information, but worst, at a crucial moment in the film, one of the Navajo code talkers sends an important message in clear, uncoded ENGLISH!<br/><br/>This movie could have been so much better, it's just a pity they went for loud bangs and big explosions instead of telling a story."

","Windtalkers isn't a bad film, but even though I love war movies and explosions, John Woo's latest action movie perhaps crosses the line from cool explosions and amazing death sequences to having a fetish for explosions and death. I know it's intregal to the story to show the brutality of war, but with sequences lasting upwards of 30 minutes apiece it's a bit tiring. In Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg spaced out the encounters so that the story would be given ample time to develop and so that viewers wouldn't be overwhelmed. Mr. Woo does no such thing, and when the killing starts, it doesn't stop until the credits. Not that there was much of a story to begin with, but I do admire the director's choice to at least base this film in historical events.

He takes the fascinating concept of Navajo Marines using their native language as an unbreakable-to-the-Japanese code during WWII, and then barely uses that code during the 2+ hours of the film. He takes a movie ostensibly about those Navajos, and turns it into a movie about Nicolas Cage. Perhaps most unfortunate, this great Asian filmmaker turns every Japanese character into a faceless, killing nonentity.

Without a white dove flapping overhead that embodies what John has been insisting, it seems that he's been totally hollywood-ised and really enjoys his life in ""Hollywood's Cage"".<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" complies with all the Hollywood Rules: - Survive to be a protagonist, at least until the movie approaches its end; - Politically correct (In front of the Japanese mother and her daughter, Nicholas Cage didn't shoot them, showing great humanitarianism.) - Multi-orgasm, and if you don't feel it, just fake it..... but with reasonable intervals. - The ""no-surprise"" surprise. The ""surprise"" always comes when surprise is expected to come. - The exaggerated sound effect and the professional but pretending acting.<br/><br/>Watching ""Windtalkers"" is a process of decoding these Hollywood languages, which is what most audience are good at.

All the actors, every one, are way too old. WW2 Marines were 18, 19, maybe 20 tops. Not one ""Marine"" has a regulation haircut.

","First, let me say that I really like John Woo movies, John Woo style and John Woo type action. Hard Boiled was brilliant. Broken Arrow is my favourite no-brainer action movie. Face/Off is a brilliant thriller with amazing action sequences. And M:I-2 is visually stunning even if Tom Cruise is annoying.<br/><br/>Which is why this movie comes as a big disappointment to me. Seeing John Woo direct Nicolas Cage (Face/Off) and Christian Slater (Broken Arrow) again seemed like a brilliant opportunity to see a good movie. And after recent war movies like Saving Private Ryan (great movie), Thin Red Line (weird, poetic), Black Hawk Down (unbearably stupid propaganda sh*t with great visuals) I was eager to see what John Woo would do to war movies, what he would add.<br/><br/>The end result is boring. Visually, it isn't anywhere near John Woo's usual standards, some of the action (especially at the beginning) seems fake and poorly acted, and the story is predictable and boring. The concept: During the war, Navajo Indians were used for communication, as their language could not be cracked by the Japanese. As they were so valuable, they needed to be protected, but even more importantly: The code needed to be protected, if necessary at the cost of their lives. So they were assigned marines to protect them. <br/><br/>The concept may sound interesting, but the script takes it and just goes through with the most predictable solution. There are few moments to take breath between the battle sequences, and in those we get sentimental scenes that seem forced. <br/><br/>So, what is the action like? Isn't that the question it boils down to now? For me, it is disappointing. An action movie is usually set in a city, or in otherwise peaceful surroundings, which makes the explosions and gunshots stand out, creates tension and supplies the interesting visuals that we watch these movies for (the Face/Off shootout in a pigeon-filled chapel is a landmark example). In a war movie, guns and explosions are the rule, not the exception, so they cannot take our breaths away unless special care is taken (eg Private-Ryan-esque cinematography). Which is why this movie fails: Everything is too average. Even the Woo trademarks (birds, stand-offs, two handed gunplay) are barely noticeable (pelicans instead of pigeons, a really stupid stand-off involving a Navajo and a Japanese, each with a rifle, and two handed gunplay? Erm, didn't notice it). <br/><br/>To me, the saddest point in the movie was when I suddenly found myself concentrating on the score, trying to anticipate the next tune of the music. The story did not manage to involve me, the action did not take my beath away, and all I was left with was annoyance at the music. A very bitter feeling, given the expectations I'd had.<br/><br/>3/10"

Perhaps Saving Private Ryan should take the flack for starting this. If we didn't the message that war is futile in Ryan, then we'll get it rammed down our throats in every other war film.<br/><br/>John Woo films are incredibly poetic and perhaps brilliant. And this has all of Woo's mannerisims and direction style. I think he's showed critics that he isn't just a one trick pony churning out the same old action film but with a different plot.<br/><br/>Sure the film is well shot and very poetic. Sure it has the Woo-isms of friendship, loyalty and the human spirit woven into the story. But, I dunno perhaps Woo's style doesn't fit the war movie.<br/><br/>Sure the constant ambushes and the contininous explosions became repetitive, tedious and even boring. But that was the point. Its a war, not an action film. It distracts you long enough from Cage's character still disappointed at losing his platoon.<br/><br/>Whilst we've seen this tired cliche done over and over and over again I think Cage handled it very well, until his *SPOILER* end scene where he goes into silly speak slowly whilst dying mode *END SPOILER*<br/><br/>War does things to many people. Some run and cry. Some just run. Some like Sassoon and Owen realise the pointlessness and just how tedious and brutal war is. This film doesn't show the pointlessness of war. Rather its brutality.<br/><br/>And whilst its commendable that Woo tackled a hard task such as the use of Native Americans in World War 2 I feel the film doesn't show both sides of the story. The Japanese or Japs come from all sides as if they are an invisible enemy or unknown enemy. They are human too.<br/><br/>There are problems to the film, things which aren't wrapped up. For example the nurse who writes letters to Cage suddenly disappears. The ending should have been with her. How does she cope with Cage's war?<br/><br/>This is an above-average war film with strong themes of friendship and loyalty. And perhaps you can see behind the explosions and the shrapnel to see the bad writing, the over the top acting of Cage and perhaps roll your eyes at how Cage doesn't seem to get hit whilst he takes out a platoon of Japanese soldiers.<br/><br/>Its not a forgettable movie, but perhaps the sequence with Slater's character being killed could be the one sequence that is probably remembered the most.<br/><br/>Overall: 6/10."

I had hoped that John Woo would be able to transmit his particular style of action film making would transmit not entirely but in it's own way to Windtalkers. But unfortunately he has made this into an action movie set in a war scenario. An interesting premise gone wrong, with a ridiculously predictable ending. Thankfully there was an absense of vomit inducing American flag waving patriotism that is seen in typical no brains war flicks. Now don't get me wrong, I love John Woo's work, especially the 1998 classic ""Face Off"", and some of his earlier Hong Kong work but this sort of film should be left to directors of a different style. It was well shot (apart from that horrendous archival footage of the battleship, what the hell were they thinking) but once again Woo's action background has carried into this film, especially with the awful scene of Cage being able to take out a Jap a shot from his pistol, no wounded, killed from one shot, at ranges of about 50 or 60 metres. The acting was well done but acting can only carry a film so far when the writing is at such a sub par level. The battle scenes I must admit are visually pleasing to look at but at the height of the action are ruined by the CG bombers, standing out like the cartoons in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". The bombers have neither the believability nor the effect of the CG fighter planes in ""Enemy at the Gates"". The premise of this film was very good but vital mistakes in the cinematography, action style, fast paced editing that serve only to glorify war, not portray it as it is, writing that belongs in a Steven Segal movie, and trying to balance unrealistic gunplay with realistic explosions gives an uneven feel. 5 out of 10."

But unfortunately, Windtalkers is not as good as I expected, and is on the same low level as Mi2. Visually, the movie is inferior than all other Woo movies. The fighting sequences are only standard, nothing that thrills you. The story is full of cliches and even Nicolas Cage is not convincing in his role.

","Being a massive John Woo fan, I was very eager to see the long delayed Windtalkers in Australia. With the fairly negative feedback from the US, my expectations were lowered yet after it's screening, I was very impressed.<br/><br/>
After the endless war films released these days, it is hard to distinguish one war film from the other and these days, it all boils down to filmmakers trying to conquer new ground in the genre and John Woo certainly exceeds. Apart from the high level of male bonding that Woo excels at in Windtalkers and his other films, the story of the Najavo windtalkers would have to be one of the most intriguing concepts; assuming it's reasonable accurate, I've seen in a war film. Not since Saving Private Ryan has a war film actually created characters that emit some sympathy to the audience. After the average We Were Soldiers and hollow Black Hawk Down, the latter, a film that although was praised, i thought had no character development or generation of feeling for characters and felt more as a 140 minute documentary of brilliantly executed gunfire. Through Various scenes, Windtalkers creates a unique experience of Indian and caucasian American people to embalm a powerful story.<br/><br/>As for direction, John Woo certainly knows his craft and although i missed the awesome over the top direction of Face/Off, Woo certainly inserts flourishes of style with long steadicam sequences and various visual dream sequences that capture well, the inner emotions of characters. With good editing, cinematography for once that didnt copy  Janusz Kaminski's forever copied dull washed look in SPR, technically, it is a well made film. John Woo creates an enticing complementary film to his more captivating Bullet in the Head that adds something fresh to the increasingly over-produced genre."
"sibleyfactor","Null","0","0","11 August 2002"," Great would be an overstatement
","""Windtalkers"" is the latest action film that contains a lot of unnecessary action sequences and war epic that is an embarrassment to a genre that has brought excellence and honor to those who served and a world, which have been witness to films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""We Were Soldiers."" Overblown action sequences, phony sentimentality and zero character development should give everyone enough reason to pass by ""Windtalkers"" and choose another film to watch. Nicolas Cage, Adam Beach, Roger Willie and Christian Slater unsuccessfully attempt to salvage a film that has lost so much with its writing and senseless action sequences.<br/><br/>Following my exit of the theater, I had to ask myself one question: Have there been too many war films made in Hollywood? This question is very difficult to answer, but fans will avoid them if films like ""Windtalkers"" are made because they will cringe at the senseless action and violence.<br/><br/>It sickens me to watch a film that has such great potential but buckles under the poor execution of a script that was dead from the start. Fault must lie with the writers as they took a concept and failed to take advantage of the great potential it contained. Instead, they turned it into a collage of excessive action sequences with no attempt to develop the characters and create valid empathy toward those involved. For example, the writers failed to capitalize on the plethora of opportunities to delve in the background of the code talkers portrayed by Beach and Willie. Another missed opportunity was the failure to capture a true sense of bonding among the soldiers. The ideal opportunity to capitalize on this occurred between the battle scenes, but there was one major problem; there was little time was spent between battle scenes.<br/><br/>Cage is one of the most versatile actors starring in many different roles and becoming a success with each part, for this reason I jumped at the chance to watch ""Windtalkers."" Portraying everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and ""Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess"" as well as action star in ""Con Air"" and ""The Rock,"" Cage has solidified himself a spot as one of the top stars in Hollywood. However, his performance as Sgt Joe Enders was lackluster at best showing zero charisma and containing no sense of taking the leadership role. As I was watching the screen, I was shaking my head in disbelief at the number of times I asked myself where his dominating presence went. For all the talent Cage has and success he has received, I have no doubt that Cage will bounce back and climb out of the valley he is currently in after ""Windtalkers.""<br/><br/>While it wasn't his best role, it was a delight to watch Slater because he has a spark that comes out of each performance he gives. He has always been an actor that viewers can relate to as he has a youthful look of innocence and can be depended upon to deliver time after time. I knew it would be extra special watching Slater in this movie since it is a departure for him from the roles he has been taking. ""Windtalkers"" didn't fail due to his lack of effort because it was clear that he took his role seriously and wanted to do well. There is one guarantee I can make; Slater will not disappoint the audience with the performance he gives as Sgt. Ryan 'Ox' Anderson, a soldier enlisted to protect a code talker.<br/><br/>For all of the faults it contained, ""Windtalkers"" can boast of one bright spot; the name of this bright spot is Adam Beach. A virtual unknown, Beach comes out of obscurity to grab the spotlight from veterans such as Cage and Slater. Beach's performance was so good it nearly made forget how bad the movie really was. Beach is one of the brightest young stars I have seen in a long time. With his presence and charisma, Beach has won my respect and proven that he is an actor who can give performances utilizing little effort.<br/><br/>Aside from the premise ""Windtalkers"" is supposed to based upon and Beach's great performance, this film falls flat on its face. Director John Woo missed the mark, Cage and Slater made the wrong choice to star in ""Windtalkers"" and Beach was in the wrong movie at the wrong time. In conclusion, ""Windtalkers"" is a film for those who don't mind watching an overblown action film with zero story development and no character development."

","To me after MI:2 this is another flawed and inconsistent picture by John Woo. The story isn´t very interesting and centers on the wrong character, while it should have centered around Ben Yahzee instead of Cage`s Enders. And it shows again, that Nicolas Cage is the worst actor of the current $ 20 million club. His range consists of 2 1/2 facial expressions and in this movie he shows only 1 1/2 of them. He´s unbelievably boring to watch. Every moviegoer knows that everything he sees is acted, but when you think ""Boah, is that badly acted"" while watching the movie, you definitely have a serious problem. So to me Cage is the main problem of the movie. The other big problem is the uninvolving and annoying story. There is not a single surprise in the whole movie. Everything that happens is obvious long before it happens. The only merits of this movie are on the technical side. The camerawork is good, sometimes excellent. The visual FX are fine and Kevin Yagher´s special make up technicians must have worked overtime, but all that isn´t enough for a movie, where every minute of it´s running time can be counted. This is definitely no ""Private Ryan"", which was a lot longer, but felt a lot shorter than this semi-failure. Back to the roots, John Woo, and please do it without Nicolas Cage."

","First of all, most of the armchair historians who criticize this movie based on historical inaccuracies don't know what they are talking about.<br/><br/>Yes, some Japanese did carry katanas and used them on the battlefield. Yes, the US troops did use flamethrowers as depicted in the movie. Yes, there were racists back in the 40's. Yes, contrary to what the military would like to portray, the code-talkers who were guarded thought it was understood that they were to be killed rather than captured (And this is perfectly understandable considering what the Japanese did to POW's, so I don't know why they are protesting it). Yes, the Japanese did insane  charges that left them with enormous casualties. Yes, in the real battle the number of Japanese to American casualties was heavily lopsided in favor of the Americans because of said tactics. And yes, contrary to what some have said, there are plenty of American casualties depicted in the movie. How some reviewers missed them, I don't know. <br/><br/>Is the movie 100% accurate? No. Neither is any war movie ever made. The explosions were a bit too much, Joe has a few too many bullets in each clip, and there should have been more air support, but so what? If that sort of thing bothers you enough to take you out of a movie, find a hobby. This movie had good acting and characters I actually cared about, and actually did have character development and a plot. Obviously it didn't work for some people, but it hit the right chords with me.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? Not really. It's pretty damn good, though, and so far it has been the best movie I've seen this year. I thought it was so good that I keep checking in to see how people are responding to it two months after seeing it. It's just unfortunate that people have been burned out on too many recent and well-done war movies to give this one a chance. Hopefully, people will discover how good this movie is on video."

","I checked out this flick last night and thought it was one of the best war films I've seen this year. While Black Hawk Down was very much a documentary rather than a movie and was very well done, it didn't match anything Woo did with this, his best film since Face/Off. This got a rather bad rap in the States but contrary to what people said over there, it seems to be doing very well over here, and it's not hard to see why. When you've got Nicolas Cage putting in his best performance for ages (ala Leaving Las Vegas, and none of that Gone in 60 Seconds and Captain Correli's Mandolin crap!) and Christian Slater giving a great performance. Also Adam Beach as the nervous but determined young Private is very good. Frances O'Connor (who I'm proud to say is an Aussie. As if you didnt already know that but hey!!) is just wasted here with a role far too small for her awesome talents!<br/><br/>Woo can certainly direct a battle sequence! With more explosions to make any other action director blush with jealousy and and squibs galore, action fans won't be disappointed. His talents at directing this kind of thing were evident in his Vietnam war movie Bullet in the Head, but with a budget twice the size of that one, he did incredibly well and made the POW camp scene in Bullet to shame! Only criticisms are the use of stock footage from old Navy battle cruisers and very poor CG planes dropping bombs on the Japanese.<br/><br/>
Certainly Mr Woo has made a mark on Hollywood since directing Hard Target coming from making great action flicks like, Bullet, Hard Boiled and of course, The Killer. After the very disappointing MI:2 it's great to see him back in form. I didn't see We Were Soldiers but this and Scott's BHD had great cinematography but as much as everything else in this flick is better, I'd go BHD's over this!

"Nigel St. Buggering","4","0","0","23 June 2002"," How many war movie cliches can dance on the head of a bullet?
","Some of the following will contain what could be considered spoilers only if you've never before seen a war movie.  If you have seen a few war movies, then you've seen this one as well.<br/><br/>Let me say up front that I am a serious John Woo fan.  I consider ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"" to be two of the finest action films ever made. There is much more to him than, as many seem to think, doves, slow motion, and double-fisted gunfire.  Themes of friendship, love, loyalty and duality are found throughout his work, and those are the elements that make his films so compelling.  This one, sadly, is not.<br/><br/>Why?  Because there is not a single plot thread or character development moment here that you have not seen a hundred times before.  Will the racist soldier's life be saved by a Navajo soldier, forcing him to rethink his assumptions?  Despite his initial reluctance, will Enders become too friendly with the code talker to be able to do his duty when the time comes? Will the guy who only wants to go home to his wife make it?  If you can answer any of these questions, then you could have written this screenplay.<br/><br/>Another problem is that Woo's approach to action, which can work brilliantly within the confines of a shoot-em-up cop thriller, comes across as silly in the setting of a World War II battle.  Grenades burst into gasoline flames, bazookas can take off the top of a hill, and a single soldier can gun down half a dozen enemies with a handgun.<br/><br/>The final problem is with the central concept of the plot, namely that it's barely there.  The Navajo code talker program, we are told, was instrumental in the pacific theater, and was never broken.  If you already know that, don't expect to learn any more.  This aspect of the story could have been jettisoned, and we'd be left with more or less the same plot.  We know no more about the program coming out of the film than we did going in.  The screenplay is less concerned with the origins and implementation of the code talkers than with what Nicolas Cage's character thinks of the idea.  And that's a shame, because there's a fascinating story to be told on this subject.  Sadly, it isn't this one."
"backseat-2","Null","0","0","23 June 2002"," Windbreakers
","First, the lead actors all did a decent job. However, the director, screenwriter, technical people of all walks just did the lamest job they could get away with. And it shows. <br/><br/>I also need to note that the Code Talkers had only three opportunities to do their bit, and it is only for things like sending coordinates to ships so they can shell the Jap fortifications. Nothing too interesting. Actually, the best place they had to shine might have been when using an enemy radio to call off friendly fire; no code talk was used it this case as far as I could tell. <br/><br/>The movie had lots of excitement, but the technical level is similar to the big ensemble scenes at the end of Bond films. <br/><br/>Woo does not seem to know how to frame a scene. One example: he has a fighter/bomber swoop low over the enemy and drop a large bomb on them, then fly away. The obviously computer-animated plane comes in too slowly (slower than it could have stayed in the air), then suddenly slows way down and drops the bomb while maybe 30 feet or less above the ground, then suddenly speeds up again. The bomb falls only about its own length before hitting the ground, but in this time they had it jog sideways a bit, the better to line up with the previously filmed pyrotechnic 'explosion' I suppose. The blast is smaller than the bomb, and looks like someone set of a small packet of 4th of July sparklers. I imagine that the plane is so low because when Woo framed the landscape shot, he forget to leave enough room at the top of the picture for the area the plane would later occupy. There is scene after incompetent scene like this. ALL explosions look like standard movie pyrotechnics. Didn't they learn anything from Saving Pvt. Ryan? Aren't clods of dirt (at LEAST) supposed to fly out of explosions on the ground?<br/><br/>
The movie itself is just poorly thought out, uninvolving cliche's. There are much better films out there this summer."

","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and I was disappointed. The movie is not really bad, but it's not that good either.  It was supposed to be about the code and how it helped us win the war in the pacific. It's really about Nick Cage's battle scars and how Private Yanzee, one of the code talkers, tries to win his approval.  John Woo it seems, is more concerned with pyrotechnics than substance which after a while gets very repetitive.  The code talkers during WWII were extremely valuable because the Marines could use them to plan strategy, troop movements, and ambushes before, during, and after the battle with out giving this important information to the Japanese. The movie basically depicts the code talkers giving coordinates to mostly fixed gun placements for Navy bombardments. You do not need a code for this.  So the Japanese know 1 minute ahead of time their fixed place guns will be destroyed.  So what.  The movie never really shows why they were so important, so valuable.  The movie spent too much time on Nick Cage and his battlefield ghosts.  The movie should have focused more indepth on Yahzee and Whitehorse.  Why they were fighting (they were volunteers) and what great contributions the Navaho gave. I thought the movie would have excellent combat, especially with this director, but it is not as good as Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. Nick Cage's character belongs in a Chuck Norris movie where he never misses, turns at the last minute to shoot the man hidden in the bushes and is basically indestructable.  You never really got the sense these people are really ""going through hell"".  Just a bunch of actors pretending to go through hell.  Even some of the combat staging is silly.  Especially when Yahzee and Enders appear magically behind enemy lines to capture a radio and call in gun fire.  Way to much like Rambo and not believeable.  The ending has similar cheese. If you can wait, rent the DVD when it comes out, which should not take to long.  It is worth at least that."

There's the attempt at a love story in the background that fails (no character development).  There's the initial conflict from the racist soldier when the unwelcome indians join the white man's army--which dissipates only after the indians prove themselves by saving said white man. There's the heroic ending--meaning the hero dies (a-la Saving Private Ryan).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the formula only gets you too far.  There's the need to fill two hours with something.  So ya do what ya can...Ya throw in some stock footage which appears to be video midway through the movie.  Ya throw in a load of explosions--which unfortunately are not consistent with the size of projectile causing the explosion (a hand grenade has a larger explosion than a 20"" round that appears to weigh 75 pounds).  Ya try to make the movie mean something--unfortunately, you forget what that is 15 minutes into the film. Ya try to throw in some buddy moments between Christian Slater and his indian.  Ooh ooh, and don't forget the importance of trying to prove that Nic Cage's character is insane.

","I saw the movie Sunday. It is exciting (how could a John Woo film not be exciting?) However, a few nitpicks from a former Marine. First, to cinematography, flaming explosions may be important, but grenades are NOT nuclear bombs. There is a blast and a reasonably impressive puff of smoke, but the damage is done by essentially invisible fragments. A grenade does NOT produce a huge cloud of orange flame that can demolish a building and set everyone within 20 yards on fire. (That goes for Japanese knee mortars as well) Bullets don't set flamethrowers on fire (unless the person with the flamethrower has activated the igniter on the nozzle first, which the character had not done) I do take exception to the obligatory antiNavaho prejudice thread...as a rule the native Americans Marines were rather admired during WWII...some 101st Airborne troopers even cut thier hair into what they thought were Mohawk haircuts. I do agree that Mr. Cage's marksmanship was, while not impossible, at least very, very unlikely. At any rate, the bloodshed was not overly graphic from a ""real life"" point of view. Combat was actually pretty grim, as anyone who has seen color movies taken during WWII in the Pacific can affirm. At least we didn't have to deal with an overly graphic beheading scene..."

","Windtalkers was an entertaining movie, but did not rise above the level of a standard Hollywood war film.<br/><br/>The movie claims to be about the ""codetalkers,"" Navajo officers in the Army who were enlisted to communicate in a code made from their native language during World War II, but that premise seems to be merely an excuse for generating a chain of overblown action set pieces. Anyone hoping that Windtalkers will give proper attention to this unique and largely forgotten part of World War II will be disappointed. In the end, it's just a series of ultraviolent war sequences depicted in a similar vein to most war movies since Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>I think John Woo was a poor choice to direct this movie. His melodramatic slow motion, stylistic gun shootouts and fascination with blood capsules have served him well in his hardcore action films like The Killer and Face/Off, but it doesn't work in a war film. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some World War II veterans might be somewhat offended by the glorification of violence in the movie. Unlike Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, or Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, both of which gave a distinct impression of the hell of war, Windtalkers seems to fall back on a John Wayne formula of sorts, giving us cliched characters and situations, overblown heroics and not enough emotional investment to truly pull the audience in.<br/><br/>Having said that, I enjoyed the film. I like Nicholas Cage and he gives a good performance here with the script he was given. It was entertaining enough to keep my attention, but it will not be going in my DVD collection. Perhaps a good movie for fans of war films, but it will not appeal to mass audiences who have seen much better war films in recent years."

","I went to see this movie, hoping that with John Woo directing, we might get a movie that would transcend the cliches of the second World War in giving us the story of the Navaho code talkers, who were real heroes of the war who are often overlooked when we speak of that era.  However, what we got was the story of Nicholas Cage's character.  We only saw Ben Yahzee and Charlie Whitehorse through the eyes of men who seemingly didn't really understand them . . . often characters took a mocking ""let's hate the injuns"" attitude to their compatriots.<br/><br/>I think this movie would have been a lot better and more interesting to viewers, had it taken the perspective of Yahzee, which could have given Woo the chance to give the Navajos the kind of tribute they really deserved. In the end, this turned into a cliche ridden gore festival, which in the end left me feeling cold.  Where ""Saving Private Ryan"" featured a chilling portrayal of wartime violence that was artistic and haunting, ""Windtalkers"" was almost glorification of violence . . . in some scenes, Cage almost seems to relish his ability to slaughter the Japanese, while in other scenes, we are given brutally unnecessary views of violence that seemed almost simply for violence's sake.  (Watch that scene with the decapitation, or the scene where Cage slits the throat of the man about to kill Yahzee and tell me those were necessary).<br/><br/>My final verdict:  5/10.  The movie kept my attention despite its flaws, but I kept thinking afterward of what this movie could have been, rather than what it was.  This is really a sad thing, considering how long I waited in anticipation of what I expected to be a quality film."

","I just got back from a pre-screening of this movie on my college campus.  I must say that I have not laughed so hard at a war movie in my life.  I kind of feel bad because this is historically important material, but the way in which it is presented makes it difficult to take it seriously.  I am going to give you a list of things to be on the look out for if you see this movie, however, you won't need to remember this since you will be laughing when they happen anyways. 1. The first battle scene is terribly acted out it is almost comical. 2. The mentioning of Lifesavers candy and Bacardi Rum seems to be straight out of Wayne's World (Doritos, PizzaHut, Pepsi, Nuprin, Reebok, etc.)  Talk about obvious. 3. On some of the explosions, the soldiers that got hit would jump before the bomb even went off to the point where it was obvious. 4. The amazing accuracy of Nicolas Cage and his uncanny ability to not get hit by bullets when standing still in front of tons of enemies.  He just mows them all down with no problem. 5. The complete randomness of the script.  Pay special attention to Cage's first letter from his woman.  ""I miss you.  Yadda yadda.  I got a dog.  he is soft, and keeps me warm at night.  The end""  Also, the randomness of the conversation between all of the troops at night when they are sitting around. 6. Christian Slater and his harmonica.  Also, listen to the tunes Charlie the Navajo plays.  It sounds like that soung they play in westerns. 7. The amazing accuracy of Nicolas Cage and his pistol (3 shots take down about 6 Japanese).  You will know what scene I am talking about when you see it:)  The whole theater was in histerics. 8.  THE BEST AND MOST FUNNY REASON TO SEE WINDTALKERS: The AMAZING special effects of the battle ships.  You won't believe your eyes.  The ships look so real it is unbelievable......Wait a second, those are real battle ships. Yes, John Woo used real battleships to make it look EXTRA REAL.  There is one slight problem with it: the film footage of the ships appears to be 50 years old or so.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  Here we have these nice crisp shots taken by a modern camera, then when we see the cannons firing on the ship, it looks like I am watching streaming video from the internet.  Then another shot of the devastation with a nice camera, then back to the terrible quality film of the battle ships.  You would think they could make a decent battle ship on the computer and just use that (the planes they made looked great).  I am still laughing about it.<br/><br/>What makes the last two items extra funny: they were during rather serious parts in the movie, and it totally detracted from it.<br/><br/>The movie itself was entertaining, but not good.  I am still trying to figure out the point of it.  Oh wait, there was none.  Protecting the code is the only point.  But that doesn't yield a plot since it is so general. There was no plot at all.  The only thing was an internal struggle between Cage's character and the Navajo he has to protect.  Not very interesting. The characters fight a few battles, lose a few men, and that is it.  The movie did have it's serious moments, but overall the lack of a story made it terrible.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this just to see the battle ships and cage take down the 6 or so Japanese guys with his pistol.  Seriously.  The laughs you get from those scenes will make it worth it."

","Windtalkers was indeed a good movie.  Personally, it hits the middle of the road on my path to greatness.  One of the biggest problems with Windtalkers is that John Woo tried to combine a real, life-like war movie, with his standard brand of extravagant explosions and amazing gun fights.  Those two combinations don't mix.  While you are watching, you get the feeling that Woo wanted to put in choreographed gunfights that make your jaw drop, but cut short of amazing you in order to capture the realism of war (despite the large amount of shots coming from rifles with only 5 or 6 shots in the bandolier).  The worst part of the movie is that it never grabbed my attention.  I couldn't keep my eyes glued to the screen like i did with The Bourne Identity.<br/><br/>Other than those facts, the movie was good.  The story was a bit stagnant and didn't flow too well but the acting more than made up for it.  Nic Cage played the part of the reluctant hero who doesn't care about anything but making up for his screw up perfectly.  You believe that he is really ready to die.  Adam Beach did very well as the Navaho code-talker who has a sort of naivety about his situation until Cage kills his fellow code-talker as part of his orders (Beach goes war-nuts at this point and becomes a psycho soldier hell bent on revenge...muy believable).<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good night at the movie but i doubt it will go down as one of the best war movies ever.  Unfortunately, John Woo has never made a movie better than the classic Hard-Boiled but he is getting close."

I like the fact that they would throw you right into the battle scenes unlike in ""Saving Private Ryan"" where they weined you into them.

","Bang! Kapow! Kaboom! Wind Talkers is the sort of ground-beef-ballet-meets-comic-book that you expect from war films post Private Ryan, and it delivers a stunning Dolby Digital onslaught of amputations, immolations and the odd decapitation with an in-yer-face style that sometimes splatters the camera lens with fake blood, and certainly makes it a mistake to sit too close to the screen. But in this war, the first casualty was the script.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film is the story a group of Navajo radio operators who communicated in a code that the Japanese couldn't break. The Wind Talkers' are a fascinating addition to the category of forgotten war heroes'. At least we think so, because John Woo seems far more excited by making chunks of tank, mud and US Marine fly through the air. Our Navajo heroes (Adam Beach as Private Ben Yahzee and Roger Willie and Private Charles Whitehorse) have a home life that's filled in by casual conversations during route marches. The perfunctory training' scenes seem more like a game show. Navajo customs are sketched in by other marines being given lines like: What's he doing now?' while watching Yahzee or Whitehorse pray. What did their families think about the Navajo fighting to protect the people who had slaughtered them only two generations ago? What were living conditions like for the Navajo before the war? Did the war help to integrate them in American society? Who cares, the film says, watch what we can do with a flame thrower and a couple of stunt men.<br/><br/>Between battles, Woo concentrates his camera on Nicolas Cage as Sergeant Joe Enders, the archetypal Marine Who Has Seen Too Much. Often, Enders stares vacantly into space while hearing gunfire and explosions in a clear homage to that classic study of a man facing his demons, Airplane. Enders gets a special mission to guard Navajo radio operator Yahzee  but actually, his secret mission is to guard The Code. So no Navajo can fall into enemy hands alive, which means a terrible secret duty if Yahzee looks like being captured before he is killed. But Cage's responsibility doesn't end there. He also has to interact with the film's token female, Frances O'Connor playing a nurse who doggedly keeps writing letters to Cage. He refuses to open them until he has killed every Japanese soldier he can see, which, this being a battlefield created by Woo, is very many indeed. By the end of the film, his pack must have been mostly full of envelopes, because each time the gunfire calms down for a few seconds, someone else pops a letter into his hand. Occasionally he looks at it and grimaces, signalling mental torture. No way! He resolves, I'm not reading it! What do you think this is, a chick flick?<br/><br/>The film doesn't waste too much time developing the supporting cast, because that would leave less time for blowing them up in slow motion later on. (If you find yourself in a Woo film, and Cage turns round and says to you, No one else is going to die', you know it's probably not the percentage bet). Other marines are distinguished mostly by regional accents or unusual facial hair, and take turns in explaining the plot to each other and complain about The Brass', giving Cage plenty of room to stare into the middle distance. Occasionally, given the hokiness of the dialog, it looks more like he's trying not to laugh.<br/><br/>This means it's a long two and a half hours. The battle scenes are beautiful, chilling and visceral, but the bits in between are really just devices to move the slaughter to a new location. There's even a little map with American flags moving forward and Japanese flags in retreat. The story of the Wind Talkers is fascinating, but this film isn't it."

","Saw an advance screening of this movie a few days ago. I love war movies and I was looking forward to this one, but unfortunately it is simply lousy in all regards. This is basically a ""Rambo"" movie set in WWII, complete with glorified combat sequences (so glorified that they are almost offensive). There are spectacular fireballs and endless, absurd images of Nick Cage machine gunning dozens of soldiers without getting a scratch. The windtalking (codebreaking) should have been the central focus of the story and this could have been fascinating; as it turns out, we barely understand the significance of the work the Navajos did, and the Navajo characters are for the most part banal, dumbly grinning shells of characters. You will learn a lot more about the windtalkers from reading articles about this film than you will from the film itself. That is pathetic. This movie does nothing to honor the Navajo codebreakers. A good script, good acting, and involving storytelling might have been a decent honor, but they are nowhere to be found here."
"paul_supercala","Null","0","0","13 June 2002"," Disappointing in comparison to other recent war moviesor any other John Woo flick for that matter.
","Another in what seems to be a long line of WWII flicks these days (and a second one with Nicolas Cage within a year); this is war movie without the intensity of not only its contemporaries, but also every other John Woo flick. While the Native American code talkers are a new (and relatively unknown) twist, the film falls short in several ways. First of all, Cage's character is completely unlikable.  There are several points in the film where you wouldn't mind seeing him killed off to focus on Adam Beach, or any of the other code talkers for that matter. This was called `Windtalkers', right? `Navajos' Beach and Roger Willie were almost the only two worth caring about. Cage is his usual deadpan self and while he does a good job, it's hard to look past him as `Nicolas Cage' and see the character he's trying to portray. Second, for a war movie, this one kind of drags. It takes a very long time for any action to happen and when it does, it's not all that spectacular. We know that under Woo's direction, there should be much more going on here. Not that this needs to be a straight action film, but if the characters are fairly dull, then maybe it's better to move things along a little quicker.<br/><br/>Thirdly, recent films like `Black Hawk Down', `We Were Soldiers', `Saving Private Ryan', and `Enigma' have all contributed to removing the luster that this movie might have had a couple of years ago. The story now seems cliché-ridden and really pretty unoriginal. While the Navajo side of the story needed to be told, this was unfortunate timing. Finally, the music was distracting enough to mention. The score didn't seem to fit the film and instead of complimenting the picture, it takes you out of it. Also on the subject of music, there's an incredibly silly wood flute/harmonica duet between Willie and Christian Slater. This was enough to entice the audience into audible (and out of key) groans. Another funny thing to watch for is the stock footage of battle ships used and passed off as a regular footage. There's no flashback sequence, just a sudden bit of film that appears to be 50 years older than the rest! In between that and Cage's Rambo-like ability to stand still in the middle of open fire and not get hit while others go down around him provided a few chuckles here and there throughout the theater for an otherwise unresponsive audience. Things like those are not supposed to be funny and you (and at least half of the viewing public) might actually get a little humor out of an otherwise flat film that should render you expressionless throughout its entirety. It's a shame. For something historically significant, it seems that once again the Native Americans have had another lousy retelling of what should have been a proud chapter in their history."

"bjones","Null","0","0","15 June 2002"," Little Nickie Cage vs the whole Japanese Army
","I had waited quite a long time to see this film since it's postponement from last fall. During my 31 years in the military I had learned of the story of the code talkers long ago and wanted to see some honest portrayal of their brave history. Instead, we get a run-of-the-mill action picture with little to redeem it. Let's comment on the small good I found, first:<br/><br/>The best part of the film, hands down, was the very likable, dignified and honest performance of Adam Beach as . I could have done without everything containing Cage and filled the time instead with his great interpretation of his character. The second best part of the film was Roger Willie's performance as Pvt. Whitehorse. I loved this guy. He reminded me of real friends I had in the military. He very honestly portrayed a real man. He was far more entertaining to watch than most of the rest of the film. Mindy Marin should be thanked for finding him and Beach. The earnestly real portrayal of Sgt. Ox Henderson by Christian Slater was also more rewarding to watch than much of the rest of the film. This is not his usual type of role and I have to say I enjoyed the change. I hope we see more such versatility from him in the future. The man can apparently do more than pretend to act. Still, the standout was clearly Beach and I sincerely hope it at least gets him an Oscar nod. I would have enjoyed Frances O'Connor's role as the WAVE Navy Corpsman who befriended Cage if she had a more reasonable reason to be in the film other than a gratuitous attempt at romance - which miserably failed at that. She looked and felt real in her crisp whites and was certainly lovely to behold. Considering the gratuitousness of her character it's a wonder there wasn't a nude love scene or two between her and Cage. Her role wasn't broad enough to enjoy her much or harshly judge her but I've seen her talent before so I wasn't disappointed at least. I hope to see more of her in the future where she has more of a role.<br/><br/>The costuming was solidly done and authentic for the most part as were props (with the sole exception of the world's most powerful bazooka). I liked the locations chosen and the feel of the weather was a nice touch. I even liked the choice, though probably accidental, of the Navy M1928A1 Thompson for Cage rather than a later Army model M1 Thompson. Nice Marine authenticity.<br/><br/>There's the cue for my general criticisms. The director, like many of his colleagues in Hollywood, has a freakish fetish for fake gasoline fueled explosions (like with the bazooka). Real explosions rarely generate a bright orange fireball and there were scores of them in this film. Hollywood seems to feel that reality is boring. Too bad that attitude robs the public of a more realistic experience. Also lacking in acceptable realism were the sound effects. One would assume that with 20+ people working on sound, one of them would trouble themselves with what the authentic weapons actually sounded like.<br/><br/>One should mention Nicolas Cage's performance. Perhaps it's not his fault for being asked to carry a film with no plot and no depth. If one considers that, he did his part in providing an action hero quite well. Some critics have called his performance overwrought"". I disagree. I have known real warriors with just as much intensity and introspection as the character he portrayed. Good for him. It's just that it was so unnecessary.<br/><br/>Perhaps some other, more reality based director may have found the incredible story that is buried here. Perhaps its not his fault and he was just doing the best he could with what he was handed. I doubt it, but one can dream. At least he didn't do anything to spoil the good parts and, let's face it, he may have even had a hand in Beach's and Willie's performances. That would be laudable and worthy of praise. However, other than my negative comments above, the vast majority of the film seemed to be Woo's portfolio of explosions and flying bodies, compliment's of Cage for the most part, and completely devoid of any plot save the gratuitousness of the carnage. Never mind the gratingly obvious errors such as Cage firing 8 rounds from a 7 round pistol, it's just had to swallow one Marine that's so gung-ho he could kill most of the enemy army single-handedly. Furthermore, 10% of what was put on screen would have been sufficient to demonstrate for the 100th time that war is hell. Their money would have been better spent hiring a writer who could actually find the plot and buy less gasoline. These two who call themselves writers have actually written damn little save, I'm not surprised, ""Blown Away"" and the silly but cute ""Chasers"". John Rice and Joe Batteer seem to be names to avoid if one is searching for quality. They are certainly not Steven Ambrose (recent controversies notwithstanding).<br/><br/>What very tiny bits of the film that were actually devoted to the code talkers was interesting and left me wanting a great deal more. I really did buy the ticket hoping to learn more of them and their historic role contributing to the American victory in the Pacific. I was sadly disappointed. I give it a C+, mostly thanks to Beach and Willie."

","A number of films dealing with WW2 have hit the screens recently, e.g., Pearl Harbor, Thin Red Line, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, etc., but this is the most violent.  In fact, the violence just doesn't let up.  The main focus of the story, i.e., Sgt. Enders (Cage) being charged ""to protect the code"" at all costs gets somehow chewed up in the on-going onslaught.  This is not a film for someone looking for a good love story (ala Pearl Harbor). As I'm somewhat of a serious history buff, I'll resist being tempted to pick the tale apart from its many, many glaring inaccuracies.  We did indeed use Navajo phone talkers on the front lines during the Pacific Theater campaign of WW2 but the premise of the tale is pure Hollywood.  Also, I failed to count the number of Japanese soldiers Cage killed but it likely accounted for half the Japanese casualties of the Saipan invasion.  If we can't realize these aspects, we've no business going to the movies and should stay home reading our history books.  I was less put off by the historical slips than by the unrelenting blowing people up. On the positive side, I enjoyed seeing villains Jason Isaacs and Peter Stormare as good guys, Mark Ruffalo was a convincing Pappas and Christian Slater was enjoyable playing the harmonica with Roger Willie's flute.  I hope to be seeing more of them. As for the film, I got a bit tired of watching Gage wring himself out only to be soaked again in more violence.  The interplay of cultural elements and the racist confrontation between Adam Beach and Noah Emmerich added texture to a somewhat bemuddled story with more inter- and intra-conflicts than is found in a Pleistocene rain forest."

","One of the benefits I have with working in media is getting to see advance screenings of films. I saw this movie about two weeks before it officially opened. My wife and I went to go watch it.After the film, I told my wife that I felt the film focused way too much on combat scenes (and the totally unecessary plot twist of Cage's character's budding love life) and nowhere near as much on the windtalkers.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think someone like Steven Spielberg or James Cameron, both of whom seem very adept at balancing action/special effects with solid story lines, would've done a much better job directing this film. Woo's films, to me, seem way too top heavy on the action sequences.<br/><br/>Frankly, I was disappointed in this film. You'd think that a 2.5 hour film would spend more than around 15 minutes in the scenes revolving around the Windtalkers and their code. There's one brief scene where they get recruited, another brief scene where they are taught the code in school and scribe the code being used, another scene where they use the code to have the Navy give them fire support, and one brief scene where a Japanese voice interceptor listens to the code and says ""It sounds like they're talking underwater! Are they speaking in English?""<br/><br/>Frankly, I think the movie should've had more scenes with the code being used, a ton of more scenes with the Japanese trying to figure out what to do (they broke every code we'd previously used and never broke this one).<br/><br/>In short, John Woo failed to properly tell the story of the Windtalkers. Frankly, I'd give it 1.5 stars out of four, but see it anyway for the sake of the Navajo. Considering our track record as a country for treating the American Indians, they deserve recognition for their efforts in World War II."

","John Woo of `Mission Impossible II' can't get enough pirouetting, blasted bodies in flight-I felt in `Windtalkers' I was at a showing of `Black Hawk Down' crossed with `Enigma'-in this case the special Navajo Code is as peripheral as the Enigma Code was to its own movie. This film also rivals `Saving Private Ryan' for blood and guts realism but comes nowhere near `We Were Soldiers' for caring about its characters.<br/><br/>In `Black Hawk' realistic warfare was the only concern; in `Windtalkers' Nicholas Cage's struggle with his guilt demons dominates the promising topics of a code that was never broken, the integration of minorities into the culture of the army, and a sergeant, Cage, who must kill his Navajo charge if there is danger of him being captured. Unlike the recent `Enigma,' which ruins the code theme by focusing on the romance, even the romance between Cage and  Frances O'Connor is marginalized to the `going-nowhere' point. Cage is so depressed (remember him in `Leaving Las Vegas'), he can't get excited about O'Connor-that's true depression and not fun to watch for over 2 hours.<br/><br/>The cliched-war-story setups are rife-on the eve of a battle, a soldier asks that his wedding ring be delivered to is wife (Do you think he survives?); the redneck bigot, who beats up on the Indian, finds his life in the Indian's hands during battle; helping a child of the enemy brings respect; if you carry a wounded buddy out of harm's way, you will be shot too; Americans are ace shots, rarely missing an enemy, who often comes out of the brush waiting to be shot; and on and on-the cliches are legion.<br/><br/>But those opening aerial shots of Monument Valley made me cry with nostalgia-I rode all around the valley on my motorcycle a few years ago. Woo has gone John Ford one better by smoothly gliding through the monoliths to create the mythic connection between the Indians and preservation of the homeland. The lens is artist here-even words can't do it."

","OK, you people who read internet movie reviews to decide whether they should see a movie...This film was like taking a big juicy bite out of a tasty Navajo taco and chewing the chile, beans and fry bread with relish then washing it all down with a cold beer...and for those of you not from the four corners area that means it was great.A lot of new age goofballs and bubbleheads like to think that Indians/Native Americans are all feathers and drums, and this movie is here to set them straight. ""How is your white man?"" Great line, really cracked me up, and made my Navajo blood simmer with joy. Great treatment of the theme of Native American/Japanese similarity, which is explored with genius (among other themes having to do with Native Americans returning from fighting in the Greatest Generation's War)in the NOVEL entitled CEREMONY by the MacArthur-grant, famous, prize-winning writer Leslie Marmon Silko. But you don't have to take my word for it! Check it out for yourselves. Face it America, your redneck hordes campaigned to kill all the Indians and push them into the desert. But the Navajos and the Pueblos and the others hung on like the tough MF's they are. So if you will permit me another LeVar Burton reference, Like Kunta Kinte their stories will be told from their point of view and awaken you to their absolute bravery and integrity fighting for an America that had attempted to poison and destroy them. But the movie is not angry. It simply is. There will always be wars and rumors of wars, so follow the Navajo example and choose peace and alliance when the time is right, my fellow internet browsers. (I just know some of you will go over to E-bay and buy some Navajo jewelry if you feel PC guilt.) Some say the violence is gratuitous. But, as usual, they are speaking gratuitously. John Woo is a student of Peckinpah...how the blood and guts fly! How black and white hats are mown down without editorial bias! No one is safe from death, and one can be eating off a plate in the morning and off the ground in the evening. I always say that portrayal of war must be visceral rather than antiseptically ideological--the evisceration scenes are the best of all in this regard! Admit it, reader, you like looking at people turned inside out by bombs and tenderized by bullets white munching popcorn in your movie seats...n'est-ce pas? Anyway such events were long ago and far away, and nothing like that happens nowadays, as my learned master, Duns Scotus, once said while pondering his navel. Camera work, acting, script, everything A+, and if you don't agree with me you are an insignificant nosepicker. And I hate nosepickers as much as I LOVE THIS MOVIE.

","""Windtalkers"" is one of those war films that loses its focus far too easily and this impedes the greatness it should have displayed. The titled characters (Adam Beach and Roger Willie) are two Navajo Indians from the Southwest who are trained to dispatch and receive messages in their native language to communicate to soldiers in the U.S. military during World War II and keep the Japanese from knowing what is being transmitted. Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater are the two Marines assigned to protect the two code breakers. The film goes way too much for actual war and battle sequences and this makes the movie just another combat picture that fails to tell the story that it should have told. Cage is given way too much air time. He is of course the star, but the movie focuses way too much on his past experiences in combat. The Indians lack the material needed to really make a lasting impression. Christian Slater is solid as he gives perhaps his greatest performance to date, but once again he is not given near enough screen-time or background. John Woo's expertise in the action genre makes the film feel very realistic, but this is a war film that should have been more like ""The Thin Red Line"" instead of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Black Hawk Down"". This is a good film overall, but it should have been a masterpiece. 4 stars out of 5."
"WNH3","Null","0","0","25 June 2002"," Disappointing ""war"" movie (contains Spoilers)
","First off, I was surprised not to see a ""goofs"" section for this film, given the number of comments in the reviews I read here, that noted discrepancies among different caliber weaponry & their respective yields. Be that as it may, surely the biggest goof I noticed was the 50-star flag near the beginning of the film (when they arrived at basic training, IIRC)--perhaps Woo was being artsy, noting their heroism was timeless or something, but I doubt it. *SPOILER ALERT* I think a fellow reviewer hit the nail on the head as to the first use of the code, calling in Naval fire: so WHAT if that were intercepted? Would the Japs have died more happily, knowing what had been said even as 16"" shells came down on their heads? So, the only reason I can see for the use of the code in that instance, is for authentication: if forward observer corrections were only to be accepted through the codetalking Navajos, fine--the Japs would not have been able to pull something of their own, redirecting USN gunfire. HOWEVER, when Yahzee dons enemy garb to get to their radio, in order to call off misdirected USMC gunfire, he does so in English: had they decided at that point not to bother authenticating fire control? What would have prevented the enemy from cutting in & doing that himself? Or, HAD they already done that, which is why it was hitting friendly troops? The World wonders.<br/><br/>I realize the Japs liked to do ""the bayonet thing"" when they had the chance, but there were lots of scenes where all they had to do was sit still & wait for the Americans to run at their entrenchments. That would have been a lot safer than leaving prepared positions so as to give the protagonists better targets. Someone better versed on the fighting in the Marianas can better comment--maybe they DID do this, which goes a long way to explaining why they lost the war.<br/><br/>The film mentioned that there were 30,000 Japanese soldiers on Saipan. By the time this movie was over, I felt like I had seen each and every one of them die. Don't get me wrong--I enjoy seeing Tojo's boys get killed as much as anyone, but there was so much that was NOT dealt with adequately in a movie that was SUPPOSED to be about the Navajos & their importance to our war effort. They were shortchanged by this movie, and ultimately, so was the audience."

The special effects were excellent, but the motion picture missed the point of the role of the Navaho codetalkers. For the most part, the motion picture ignored the title characters, preferring to engage in how fast they could gross out the audience with flying body parts. After a while, I felt the motion picture was going to run as long as the original battle for Saipan.

","Some may dictate that the contents of today's war movies are either too harsh or predictable these days.  But are such movies still worth seeing? Of course! If war history is taken at its face value, surely the contents will be predictable and harsh. For me, watching Windtalkers is like re-living history, and Director John Woo has done a marvelous job without robbing me of the horrific woe of wars and the important facts that wrap around the unsung story of the Navaho code-talkers. No doubt I was petrified by the visuals, but I can't pretend that terror is glamorous and that war is glorious.<br/><br/>Director Woo has done a superb job in showing that there's no romance when it comes to war, especially with the battle at Saipan! Yep, downright nothing in this film to indicate the pretentious sweet smell of success, as far as the inhumanity of war is concerned! This film definitely grabs me cold, and it's my wake-up call to how vital and relevant the Navaho code had been to us during W.W. II.  It sucks me into every scene and makes me feel for every character (and I stress the word `EVERY'!) in it.<br/><br/>The visually graphic scenes of men injured or killed are amazingly real and shocking.  Yep, every bit of the cinematographic effects is beyond words of description and the actors' performances are sheer awesome!  Great explosive music scores that are overwhelmingly in sync with the events and moods! Woo has created a masterpiece with everything flowing and meshing together like a powerful composition of jazz music. I was captivated by the strong emotions that are spattered throughout this spectacular movie. This film has not failed to allow the characters to develop phenomenally, despite the over-powering dramatically chaotic action sequences and special effects. Yep, men-at-war don't necessary loose their human aspects and this film does indeed recognize both their flaws and their virtues. Observing how the men interact is very emotional. This film has a wonderful ensemble of actors who fit well into their roles. Some of the dialogue may appear rather banal at times, but I guess I shouldn't always assume that all men in battle are graduates from some prestigious colleges. And watching Roger Willie and Christian Slater performing their wood flute-harmonica duets is itself worth the regular price of a movie tix!<br/><br/>What is unique about this film is that neither the bombastic special effects nor the performances of the characters overshadow a strong and crucial message that has to be delivered!  Watching this movie is like seeing frame after frame of documented historical characters and events as witnessed by a competent war journalist! I was totally stressed out with keeping myself in balance as I tried to keep count of the survivors. A MUST-SEE movie for anyone with a strong stomach to watch credible war-terror combats, or for those with faith that good war films and national patriotism are not synonymously related!  And this war film does capture the truth on screen as how a code was key to our winning the war.  Boy, I came out of the theater, choked with tears and in desperate need for a cup of piping hot cha.<br/><br/>

Then I read an article in the Arizona Republic newspaper in Phoenix of interviews done with former ""code talkers"" on the Indian reservation. Here is pretty much what they said. The movie was amusing. It could have happened that way, but it didn't. We were trained to not only converse in Navajo but to memorize code words for things like tanks, artillery, etc. The brass would not let a code talker get within the longest range of a Japanese rifle. We talked inside bunkers from about a mile from any combat. We were too valuable to risk. Once trained we were all they had. Not replaceable. So, there you have it. The same Hollywood trumped-up, childish crap you see in every movie ever made about Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, Eliot Ness and now the code talkers. They didn't shoot any Japs. No hand to hand combat. No wounds. Just talk on the phone. Why doesn't my wife have a Medal of Honor and a grave site at Arlington? Hollywood is re-writing history, fellow Americans.

","Without feeling the need to summarize the plot line, I will simply state the major downfalls of this movie. Nicolas Cage was one the all time best comedic actors, why the hell anyone thinks that means he's an action hero is way beyond me.  His character was so lacking any depth or believability it was actually painful to watch.  Overdone cliche after overdone cliche plagues this film from start to finish and the importance of the codetalkers - what I thought was the entire purpose of the film - is left in the dust. Whenever they get in trouble they would invariably come to the realization ""IF WE ONLY HAD A RADIO!!!"" - okay so what did this codetalker do that a regular radio man couldn't have done?  I have no idea - he called in artillery and planes. OOOOhhhh.... I still don't get it.  The action is so overdone that it isn't even fun to watch.  Impressive explosions a plenty, but in an age where realistic war films have become the order of the day, Woo snubs his nose at Spielberg and takes us back to the days when Rocky Balboa could take out a helicopter with a bow and arrow.  Shallow and unredeeming seem to sum up the whole feel of the film for me and the only reason it gets a 2 is because the sound effects were awesome on a surround sound system.  Save yourself the time and disappointment - watch Rambo instead, at least you'll feel patriotic. PS- I just checked the DVD box to see if I spelled Nicolas right and noticed that it says ""From the director of MI-2"" which makes the fact that I watched this my own fault.  MI-2 was possibly one of the only 'ultra-Hollywood' action movies actually worse than this one.  Shame on ME!"

","During World War II, Navajos were recruited by the U.S. military to send and transmit messages in a code based on their complex language; the Japanese were never able to crack the code, and the tale of these Navajos and their contribution to winning the war in the Pacific would have made an engrossing film. John Woo's ""Windtalkers"" starts promisingly with a young Navajo, Ben Yahzee, played by Adam Beach, bidding his family goodbye and boarding a bus to join the army. While the early days of Yahzee's indoctrination and training in the Navajo-based code are touched upon, the film soon veers away and follows Sergeant Joe Enders, played by Nicolas Cage, whose sometimes contrived story is more conventional and less interesting than that of the Navajo recruits. Cage is assigned to protect Beach and his knowledge of the code from capture by the Japanese; Beach is unaware that Cage has been instructed to kill him rather than let him fall into Japanese hands.<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" does detail the prejudice and persecution endured by the Navajos from both other enlisted men and their superiors, although to say the Navajos resemble the Japanese is an implausible stretch. Beach and Roger Willie as Charlie Whitehorse are the only two Navajo characters with any screen time. While Beach is a Canadian Saulteaux and studied Navajo for the film, Willie is a Navajo of the Wateredge Clan. Although Cage gives a solid performance as Enders and is ably supported by Christian Slater, Mark Ruffalo, Noah Emmerich, and Peter Stornare, the excellently conceived and filmed battle scenes upstage the actors. Often gruesomely graphic, John Woo stages sweeping battlefield scenes that are exhilarating and spectacular. Planes swoop overhead, bombs detonate and send streamers of shrapnel into the air, flame throwers ignite tanks and soldiers alike, and the camera moves in to capture a human torch or a savage bayoneting in closeup. The action and lush green Hawaiian shooting locations are beautifully captured by Jeffrey L. Kimball's excellent cinematography, and a fine James Horner score further enhances the film.<br/><br/>A solid cast, good production values, stunningly realistic battle scenes, ""Windtalkers"" has a lot going for it, but ultimately the film missed an opportunity to recount a fascinating footnote to World War II history. The movie begins and ends amidst the majestic splendor of Monument Valley and does pay passing homage to the contribution of the Navajos to the war effort and final victory. However, the focus has been misplaced on a white solder rather than on the Navajos, which lessens the film's import. Instead of a classic retelling of a near-forgotten story, ""Windtalkers"" is a well acted, but routine war movie with some spectacular battle scenes that come perilously close to overwhelming the personal stories."

","Any war movie that conveniently stops all extraneous sound—that is, battle—so that characters can give other characters thoughtful speeches or looks is going to wear the patience of the viewer to the breaking point very quickly. John Woo's Windtalkers (2002) is just such a movie, a sloppy, messy, and incompetent story of the Navajo contribution to America's victory against Imperial Japan. Whatever drama that can be found with the ground-breaking use of the totally alien (at least to the Japanese) Navajo language as the basis for a combat code is lost with the five cent psychology and movie-of-the-week histrionic heroics.<br/><br/>The story itself is fascinating—Navajo men with a good grasp of their language were trained as radio operators and deployed with U.S. Marine units in the island-hopping operations of the Pacific War. Adam Beach, the Canadian actor who was so great in Smoke Signals, and played another marine, Ira Hayes, in Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers, is the principal character here, alongside his hardened and hard-hearted ""handler,"" Nicolas Cage, an emotionally wrecked ""China Marine"" who takes the job of watching over—and killing Beach if he is about to be captured—as a way to get back into the war, after recuperating from injuries on Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>The contrast between Cage and Beach is adequate. You don't expect much from Cage because he's vitiated much of his acting ""street cred"" with one Jerry Bruckheimer role after another (he seems more at ease in the National Treasure franchise than in something serious) and Beach is so charismatic that it's obvious Woo was having to rein him in, in order to keep him from stealing every scene from Cage. There are obligatory secondary characters—the tough gunnery sergeant, the more religious Navajo friend of Beach (if you look closely, you can see a small, neon ""Dead"" sign over this character, along with several others), and, because this is Hollywood and all combat units are microcosm melting-pots (and large, blonde white guys are naturally obnoxious Hitler Youth), there's a large, blonde bigot who questions the Navajos' presence in the war because ""they look just like the 'Nips'.""<br/><br/>Everything about Windtalkers reeks of cheap and thrown-together. It's painful to watch such a wonderful, multi-layered story of American natives casting aside old angers to protect what Beach refers to as ""my land, my country"" rendered into a junior high school-level shoot-em-up. The script seems cobbled together from a dozen 40s and 50s war movies (at any moment, you expect John Wayne—who played a character similar to Cage's in The Sands of Iwo Jima, and a whole lot better—to tell everyone to ""Saddle up; let's get back in the war!"" <br/><br/>Even the special effects are all over the battlefield. We get Saving Private Ryan savagery, along with some nice CGI carrier-based aircraft, but those damn-silly artillery explosions. Howitzer rounds go bang (dirt and things go flying) but Woo figured he had to dazzle the viewer with lots of color, so we get these ridiculous gasoline flashpots going up when a mortar round hits a group of soldiers (how many times were the troops told not to put fifty gallons of lighter fluid in their Zippos, dammit?).<br/><br/>The non-verbal messages are, if anything, less important and more overbearing than the spoken words. The flashback is a classic film device for filling in the holes in a story (or telling it in a non-linear way), and so is the ""reaction"" shot. When something profound happens in Windtalkers, the viewer gets some of that five cent psychology by viewing deep, meaningful stares. The non-verbal meaningfulisms are so heavy-handed that when, in a moment for Cage that shows he saw The Sands of Iwo Jima over and over before filming started here, where he draws a cathedral in flour on a table, then grunts in disgust at himself for showing weakness and destroys the drawing, you're hoping a war correspondent runs in to take a photo of the cathedral before Cage wipes it out.<br/><br/>Aw, shucks, Sgt. Rock has a heart of gold! <br/><br/>Cage's equal in the platoon, played by Christian Slater (neon ""Dead"" sign) is assigned to another Navajo. Repeatedly warned not to warm to his charge, Slater violates his orders by striking up a musical relationship with him. The message of equality and friendship between a Navajo and the son of a Swedish immigrant is mostly unspoken (the music is produced by native flute and harmonica). Unfortunately, the friendship results in disaster. When confronted with following his orders, Slater can't bring himself to kill his friend, and it's left up to Cage to do Slater's dirty work.<br/><br/>The truth of the engagement—and the underlying orders to ""protect the code"" is revealed to Beach by Cage. Beach isn't skilled enough—or isn't given enough directorial guidance—to avoid falling into an acting trap. His unspoken rage at and mistrust of Cage is displayed in an almost comical . . . dirty look. Wayne could do it, so could Kirk Douglas. Eastwood had that murderous glare that accompanied ""Well, do ya punk?!"" Beach didn't have it here. I kept expecting him to point at Cage and let loose with a Marvin the Martian impression, ""Oooh, you make me sooo angree!"" <br/><br/>The trouble with Windtalkers is that, because it's hackneyed to begin with, there's a ripple effect of silliness throughout the movie. A good premise with a bad script is going to result in a stilted mess of a movie. Besides spouting cringe-inducing dialogue, the emotional points of the movie are hammered home (right through my forehead sometimes) with glowering reactions shots. ""Hey, he's a rednecked moron"" is what we already know about the platoon bigot from his words and behavior. Having him come to this conclusion, stopping in the middle of a marching column, looking as if he has worked mightily and has given birth to a thought, is just overkill.<br/><br/>The spoken and unspoken words of Windtalkers devalue the whole noble story."

","During World War two, dozens of minorities in the US fought on the side of the American Armed Forces. Spanish Americans received their baptism of fire during the 'Battan Death March.' Japanese Americans, despite having their Constitional rights trampled, did their share mostly on the Italian mainland. But it is this film, ""The Wind Talkers"" that Native Americans, specifically Navajos, from the Southwest, had their proudest moments immortalized on film. It is true Native Navajos became famous for their unique language or Unbreakable Code which became indispensable for Military communications during the Battle for Siapan and other islands. Unfortunately it took 60 years for them to be recognized. John Woo's movie is incredibly prolific in its vicious rendering of the savage island battle. History records the Japanese lost 30,000 soldiers defending, while American losses were approximately 3,000. The brutal drama selects Nicolas Cage as Sergeant Joe Enders, an experienced Marine who wants to avenge his dead comrades, by feigning full recovery from his wounds and volunteering for combat. His secret orders are, 'to protect and if necessary, Prevent his Code-talker from ever falling into enemy hands. Adam Beach plays Private Ben Yahzee, who believes he is only doing his military duty by being a Code-Talker. Roger Willie plays Private Charlie Whitehorse a second Navajo who proves his courage under the most extreme battle conditions. Peter Stormare is convincing as Gunnery Sergeant Hjelmstad and Christian Slater plays Sgt. Pete Anderson, a Marine with second thoughts on caring out his secret duty. Jason Isaacs has a bit part as Major Mellitz, who emphasizes to his men the importance of following orders. The direction of the film is complementary to the story and is worthwhile for any action movie fan to sit riveted to his chair as the war-time slaughter explodes across the fiery screen. For we who are reminded of the sacrifices of our Veterans and wartime servicemen, this movie is a fitting tribute indeed. The finished product? A military Classic in the making. ****"

","By no means the worst War film I have ever seen (bearing in mind that the first one I ever saw was 'The Battle of Midway'). Nicolas Cage, in what was one of two war films for him within the space of 12 months - the other one being 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin', acquitted himself well. It was a surprisingly restrained performance, allowing us to see the other end of the continuum of his acting range for once. Christian Slater also puts in his usual solid performance. The real surprise in all of this is Woo's direction, in that he shows an eye for scenery. Definitely worth watching, although it won't endear the Japanese to you... Good pace, nice music, delicate use of research into the Navajo indians. Is this a credit to Nic Cage's resume? I would say 'yes'. Of course, the real acid test for this film would be to sit the real soldiers from those events down to review it."

","Usually when someone says ""The trouble with this is..."" you'll hear a lie, because they want to hush you up. But it hard to talk about this movie without saying ""The trouble with this is..."". The movie should have been good. It's about the use of a little known Navajo language to used as radio codes in World War Two to prevent the enemy from cracking the code. Navajo soldiers are used to communicate with Allied forces, and each is assigned a mercenary soldier to protect them, or to kill them in case of capture. As stated before, this movie is really about Nicholas Cage and his heroics. The entire plot is very contrived, and in true Hollywood style, anyone you could care a thing about is killed very early, so a viewer has to trudge through this film. Unless you're doing a critique, you won't sit through it. A film like this should have been much better. The fault is horrendous writing, and writing is the most important aspect to many of us."

","The aerial photography of Monument Valley was fabulous. The rest of the movie, probably, disappointed me more than any film I have ever seen. How could they botch such a great story? Why did they make the protagonist a white guy? Why did they stick to the regular formula for war stories? What a mess! The writers should be shot. And John Woo has amends to make to Native Americans.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Woo can purge himself of this sin by telling the natural sequel to this story. Leslie Marmon Silko wrote a wonderful book called CEREMONY which tells the story of a Laguna tribesman - a veteran of the War in the Pacific - whose PTSD disabilities are not healed until he immerses himself back into his culture. A screenplay based on the book, told with conviction would make a great movie!<br/><br/>I hope someone can get this suggestion to John Woo.

He could have been in less dangerous places but who wants to see that? And if you want to learn about the Windtalkers and World War Two than you probably shouldn't have rented a movie starring Nicholas Cage and Adam Beach. I'm glad that it wasn't a story about Windtalkers and World War Two. I got to school to learn about those things. I rented this movie to see some action and be entertained, not learn a lesson on history. I don't see why everyone hates this movie so much.

"TxMike","Null","1","2","8 August 2006"," Good viewing for those who seek lots of war action.
","I like the characters Nic Cage creates and here he is Sergeant Joe Enders. As the movie begins we see him and his group fighting in WW II, seemingly with no chance to survive. As the next scene begins, we see him in a military hospital, recovering, the only man to survive that incident. He desperately wants to go back into action, even though he is still not physically well and can't hear out of a damaged left ear.<br/><br/>This movie depicts the use of Navaho Americans to transmit coded messages that the enemy cannot crack. Joe's assignment is with one of these new recruits, Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach, a real Native American, but not Navaho). The drama is because Joe's assignment is to protect ""the code"", not to protect Ben. Meaning, if it appears that Ben is to be captured and questioned, Joe's assignment becomes to kill Ben. Knowing that, he tries very hard to avoid beaconing friends with Ben, but it is unavoidable.<br/><br/>For my tastes there is too much raw action, shooting, explosions, etc and not enough of the human side of the story. Still, I found it a worthwhile 2 hours.<br/><br/>To me Peter Stormare was miscast as Gunnery Sergeant Hjelmstad. He is from Sweden and, while I generally like him as an actor ('Fargo'!) he never was believable as a tough American because he didn't sound American. Noah Emmerich, Mark Ruffalo, and Christian Slater were all good as soldiers, as well as Frances O'Connor, the nurse who wrote to Joe and hoped he would come home some day."

","If you want an idea of how predictable Windtalkers is, think about this. From about 45 minutes in, the only way my friends and I could be entertained by it was by placing bets on which standard war film plot point would come up next - and among the three of us, we each managed to successfully predict four of them. This movie may have the most arch-conventional plot I've ever bothered to see, and this from a director who not only made one of the most ridiculous plots ever written hold together (Face/Off) but gave that story actual emotional impact. Windtalkers, by virtue of being sort of a greatest hits collection for war movies, has no such power, no matter how hard it tries.<br/><br/>Woo doesn't direct war, he directs action - two very different things. Even at its most sweeping, Windtalkers never manages to reach anything like the grandeur of the great battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan, The Longest Day, Patton, etc. The best bits of action are the small-scale fights in close quarters, which there may be two of but no more. The calmer scenes are even worse, as the clichés really pop out. For a better handling of racism in war, see Glory. For a better handling of personal relationships in battle, see Platoon. For a better handling of noble sacrifices, see Saving Private Ryan. Instead of getting the greatest hits package, go rent the movies that this one ripped off. Two extra stars for production values and Woo's willingness to take this risk, but really, the Navajo code talkers deserve a far better movie. Not recommended."

","This film might have been considered something good if it had come out in the early 80s along side chuck norris movies like invasion USA and the Iron Eagle series, because that is about where this thing ranks.<br/><br/>All modern war movies such as the thin red line, saving private ryan and Band of Brothers all very accurately portray the true horror that is war, and deliver not only in the graphic sense but also in the physical sense by adhering strictly to reality, everything about the battle sequences is fake, the blood looks fake, the opening sequence is laughable, each grenade and artillery shell explodes like a molotov cocktail (real ones don't), the artillery guns are firing black powder to make clouds of pretty smoke for the cameras (real ones don't) and the guns are noticeably hydraulically powered for their recoil after firing. Instead of a war movie it looks more like something out of robocop. the trivia line showing on the main page says that for this movie that they brought in genuine WWII radios to make it more real... well I wish they had put that much effort into making the battle scenes look better. Oh yeah... and the airplanes dropping bombs from that altitude would probably have blown themselves to pieces along with the japs. All reality is sacrificed to make great big balls of fire.<br/><br/>All technical mistakes aside, the story isn't very strong and strangely enough the best parts of it are when the soldiers aren't fighting. I felt a little caught up in the drama near the end when they're fighting in the town, but that was about it.<br/><br/>The acting is OK by those involved, nick cage is less annoying than he has been in other recent efforts (and he seems to have this magnetic bullet repellent suit) and everyone else falls either on or under par. I actually did connect with the main navajo character. The script could have been better.<br/><br/>All in all not a really bad movie, but it did have the potential to be a 7.5 out of 10 instead of a 5.9 out of 10 had they made a concerted effort to bring quality and reality to life. A good movie to watch on a boring Sunday afternoon or a rainy day, but it sure as hell ain't no classic."

","""Windtalkers"" is the latest action film that contains a lot of unnecessary action sequences and war epic that is an embarrassment to a genre that has brought excellence and honor to those who served and a world, which have been witness to films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""We Were Soldiers."" Overblown action sequences, phony sentimentality and zero character development should give everyone enough reason to pass by ""Windtalkers"" and choose another film to watch. Nicolas Cage, Adam Beach, Roger Willie and Christian Slater unsuccessfully attempt to salvage a film that has lost so much with its writing and senseless action sequences.<br/><br/>Following my exit of the theater, I had to ask myself one question: Have there been too many war films made in Hollywood? This question is very difficult to answer, but fans will avoid them if films like ""Windtalkers"" are made because they will cringe at the senseless action and violence.<br/><br/>It disappoints me to watch a film that has such great potential but buckles under the poor execution of a script that was dead from the start. Fault must lie with the writers as they took a concept and failed to take advantage of the great potential it contained. <br/><br/>Instead, they turned it into a collage of excessive action sequences with no attempt to develop the characters and create valid empathy toward those involved. For example, the writers failed to capitalize on the plethora of opportunities to delve in the background of the code talkers portrayed by Beach and Willie.<br/><br/>Another missed opportunity was the failure to capture a true sense of bonding among the soldiers. The ideal opportunity to capitalize on this occurred between the battle scenes, but there was one major problem; there was little time was spent between battle scenes.<br/><br/>Cage is one of the most versatile actors starring in many different roles and becoming a success with each part, for this reason I jumped at the chance to watch ""Windtalkers."" Portraying everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and ""Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess"" as well as action star in ""Con Air"" and ""The Rock,""<br/><br/>
Cage has solidified himself a spot as one of the top stars in Hollywood. However, his performance as Sgt Joe Enders was lackluster at best showing zero charisma and containing no sense of taking the leadership role. As I was watching the screen, I was shaking my head in disbelief at the number of times I asked myself where his dominating presence went.<br/><br/>
For all the talent Cage has and success he has received, I have no doubt that Cage will bounce back and climb out of the valley he is currently in after ""Windtalkers.""<br/><br/>While it wasn't his best role, it was a delight to watch Slater because he has a spark that comes out of each performance he gives. He has always been an actor that viewers can relate to as he has a youthful look of innocence and can be depended upon to deliver time after time. I knew it would be extra special watching Slater in this movie since it is a departure for him from the roles he has been taking. <br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" didn't fail due to his lack of effort because it was clear that he took his role seriously and wanted to do well. There is one guarantee I can make; Slater will not disappoint the audience with the performance he gives as Sgt. Ryan 'Ox' Anderson, a soldier enlisted to protect a code talker.<br/><br/>For all of the faults it contained, ""Windtalkers"" can boast of one bright spot; the name of this bright spot is Adam Beach. A virtual unknown, Beach comes out of obscurity to grab the spotlight from veterans such as Cage and Slater. <br/><br/>Beach's performance was so good it nearly made forget how bad the movie really was. Beach is one of the brightest young stars I have seen in a long time. Beach has won my respect and has proven that he is an actor who can give performances utilizing little effort.<br/><br/>Aside from the premise ""Windtalkers"" is supposed to based upon and Beach's great performance, this film falls flat on its face. Director John Woo missed the mark, Cage and Slater made the wrong choice to star in ""Windtalkers"" and Beach starred in the wrong movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Windtalkers"" is a film for those who don't mind watching an overblown action film with zero story development and no character development."

Woo had picked an excellent and very worthy topic to film. However the code talkers story deserved so much more than it received in this film. While some parts were well done, The movie suffered from far too much Hollywood movie ""action"" that was artificially inserted to ""jazz"" it up. Woo likes action films and usually does them well ""Face Off"" for example. Reality was not a big issue in that movie, but if you are telling a story from real life which appeared to be the intent of this film, then overdoing the action hurts it. There was a constant litany of contrived scene after contrived scene designed to allow more and bigger special effects (mostly big explosions) rather than build and enhance the story. The tactics and manuevers used in the movie reflect a flawed Hollywood mentality trying to set up a scene for big special effects, and NOT what the Marines (who were fairly wise to Japanese tactics by the time they landed on Saipan) really used.    The movie did fairly well in potraying the brutal, savage, no quarter type of close hand to hand combat that the Marines faced with the Japanese. The fighting in the town and brush were OK in that respect.<br/><br/>   But ONLY in a Hollywood movie do artillery rounds land right on target on the first shot. It was absolutely RIDICULOUS to see nearly EVERY shot be precise enough to hit a tank, truck, or individual man!! I spent 2 years in an artillery battalion, it does NOT work that way. There are too many flaws to even begin to list them. These flaws and the numerous contrived situations in the movie caused the real story (which should have been most important) to be lost. Woo should stick to action films with story lines that allow a person to suspend their disbelief (like Face Off). Windtalkers was just a bunch of hot air. Too bad, the guys in real life deserved better representation. My vote is a 3 out of 10."

"Buddy-51","Null","1","2","2 August 2003"," great battle scenes, weak script
","There's been such a surfeit of war pictures coming out of Hollywood in the past few years that it's small wonder `Windtalkers' failed to ignite many box office sparks when it was released in the summer of 2002.  Famed action director John Woo has served himself well by mounting spectacularly effective and brilliantly orchestrated battle scenes, but the writers, John Rice and Joe Bateer, have let him down big time in the story department. Woo has flooded the screen with moments of uncompromising graphic realism, only to have them mitigated by trite dialogue, predictable ironies and corny melodramatics.  Both the director and the men who actually lived through the events of this true-life story deserve better.<br/><br/>`Windtalkers' does have history going for it.  In World War II, the Allied Forces in the Pacific needed to come up with a brand new code that would be `uncrackable' by the Japanese.  The military decided that it would base that code on the Navajo language, thus precipitating the need to recruit young Navajo men to come to the battlefields as `code-talkers.'  The film focuses on one such man, Ben Yahzee, and the officer, Joe Enders, whose sole duty it becomes to protect Ben in battle and keep him out of the hands of the Japanese.  Joe, naturally, balks at the idea of having to perform `babysitting' duty on the front line, and he is not afraid to show Ben just how he feels about the situation in the early stages of their relationship. Joe has other problems as well.  Recently injured in battle himself, he also struggles with the guilt accrued from having led all the men of his previous platoon to their deaths while `following orders like a good Marine.'<br/><br/>There is certainly plenty in terms of character and conflict for the screenwriters to work with here, yet somehow they never find a way to bring those characters or conflicts to convincing life.  Joe's initial reluctance to accept Ben is as predictable as his inevitable change of heart at the end.  And `predictable' is really the key word here in describing much of this film.  Are we really surprised when the most vocal racist in the group  who says `Injuns' aren't much different from the Japanese they're all fighting  has his life saved by the very man who's been the target of all his ridicule?  And don't we just know that a soldier will be gunned down the moment he offers a piece of chocolate to a distraught little Japanese girl? Or how about the fact that the two men, one white, one Navajo, who have been literally making beautiful music together  one on the flute and the other on the harmonica  demonstrating colorblind brotherhood in action, are cut down right next to one another in the same battle?  Thus, the unsettling, cluttered `messiness' of the battle scenes is undercut by the too carefully contrived nature of so much of the actual narrative.  By trying so hard to move and uplift us, the film feels manipulative and calculated when it needs to feel most sincere.<br/><br/>`Windtalkers' might have been a more compelling film were it not for the lackluster, wooden performance Nicholas Cage delivers in the lead role. Cage has never been very adept at conveying complex emotions and his inability to provide any depth or shading to the psychologically tormented Enders goes a long way towards minimalizing the film's impact.  Adam Beach, on the other hand, brings a fresh-faced likability to the part of Ben, the Navajo, who, in many ways, takes on the Private Ryan role in the story. <br/><br/>
For all the amazing battle scenes in the film, `Windtalkers' may just be one war film too many for us to cope with."

","Spoilers in text!<br/><br/>Think of this movie as a great piece of war! The environment is lovely with big battles, set on a Japanese islands. I didn't think this film was made of John Woo, because he usually do this films with a lot of cinematic visual effects for ex. Mission Impossible 2. So how will this look in a world war 2 movie? Was one of my thoughts...The thing is that Woo doesn't over use these spectacular events now, thank god. He uses them with a nice finger tip feeling, that is absolutely perfect!<br/><br/>The actors performance was very good too in my opinion. Nicholas Cage acting is most of the time quite ""the same"" no matter what movie he does, but he does his part well in WT, nothing more.. Christian Slater has only a minor role as Cages team member, which is sad because he is a good actor. And of course Peter Stormare one of Swedens ""pride in acting"", has a role as an officer in command. Stormare does his minor role with strength and he really is a good leader. The sound is very good with a lot of big explosions. Any of you that has a good Home Cinema sound: rent this movie! Only the sound by it self has enough strength to give you a strong feeling of real war.<br/><br/>

","The story of the Navaho code talkers of World War II is intrinsically dramatic and exciting.  The Windtalkers screen-play attempts to infuse additional drama and excitement, but instead only injects clichéd, predictable plot elements.  For example, the mawkish dialog repeated signals which soldier will die in the next scene.  The uniforms and equipment are historically inaccurate -- U.S. Marines seem to be outfitted from a military surplus store, and their weapons have an inexhaustible supply of bullets. On the other hand, Japanese soldiers are unable to hit anything at point blank range with their weapons.  The pyrotechnics are spectacular but quickly become repetitive.  Adam Beach (Ben Yahzee) and Roger Willie (Charlie Whitehorse) turn in respectable performances as the code talkers. Nicholas Cage does well in spite of the screen play.  For the true story of the code talkers, read any of the available good books.  See Saving Private Ryan for an authentic war story -- even better see Band of Brothers."

I thought it would be cool to show the landings of the United States soldiers on Japenese conquered islands, and then Windtalkers was made and I was like ""cool"". I liked the battle scars Nicolas Cage had after the brutual engagement between the Japenese soldiers on the Solomon islands. I also liked the battle sequences which come close to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and was well done by John Woo (the producer or something of Mission Impossible). I also liked the seemingly randimozed deaths of soldiers which made the movie seem more realistic, hence ""the captain, and Nicolas Cage die at the end"" and people you didn't think would live, live. A good movie, but like Braveheart or Private Ryan you have to be prepared to let your hero go."

This is a great war movie, great John Woo movie, and certainly a great action movie. This is John Woo's expertise! I should admit that the plot is a bit weak, and the film should have exposed more about the Navajo code system communication, but the dramatic moments and moral of the story do exist! Windtalkers is only for war and action movie's buffs, otherwise don't write any comment about this movie because it would spoil the view of other people who haven't seen Windtalkers!

","This film was a disappointment for a number of reasons.  Wrong story line and wrong director for a story about the Windtalkers.  It was not about the Navajos, but about the psychological effects of war on Nicolas Cage, who walks through the scenes giving us less than his usual fine performances. Adam Beach, who plays Sam Yahzee, on the other hand is very good.  Woo is a great action director, but every scene of 25-30 Japanese soldiers being killed was just like the previous one.  The practically ""bloodless"" Sands of Iwo Jima is a better film.  The credits at the end of the film listed 104 stuntment; and surpisingly the official assistance of the U.S. Marine Corps. With a better story, Ridley Scott, Blackhawk Down director, could have presented a film worthy of the Navajo marines who played such an important role in the South Pacific during World War II."

","5 out of 10<br/><br/>Windtalkers has a lot of action.  For much of its 134 minute running time, it's simply one bloody battle scene after another.  On a visceral basis alone, I suppose you'll get some satisfaction.  Those looking for anything resembling good drama, characters, or a well-written script will be sorely disappointed.  The movie, after all, has an intriguing premise, but sours the potential with one-dimensional characters, cheesy dialogue, weary war cliches, and occasionally unrealistic battle scenes (complete with grenades causing fireballs and American soldiers who never miss). <br/><br/>
I'm certain action fans will enjoy the carnage (I know the action fan in me found the combat scenes engaging), but those looking for genuine drama will be left cold.  Interesting, ambiguous questions are barely scratched on the surface (whether killing a Navajo codetalker in cold blood is worth it to save the lives of countless marines) and the movie's preference to focus on the white male over the Navajo codetalker is a bit insulting. Decent performances from Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach give the cheesier moments a lift, but they can't lift the film from mediocrity."

","I've seen all of the notable military movies of the 1990s and 2000s -- BLACK HAWK DOWN, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, WE WERE SOLDIERS, BAND OF BROTHERS, PEARL HARBOR ... this one takes the cake as being one of the worst.<br/><br/>
Nicholas Cage is a Marine Sergeant, who barely survived a botched mission on Guadalcanal. He's assigned to look after Pvt. Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) -- a Navajo Code Talker -- during the invasion of Saipan. <br/><br/>Here's why this movie was so bad. For one thing, not many of the characters have much personality. They're all two-dimensional cliches that we've seen hundreds of times before. <br/><br/>Secondly, the movie is titled WINDTALKERS but really has little to do with the Navajo Code. It's mostly about Nicolas Cage's mixed emotions after coming out of his harrowing Guadalcanal experience. <br/><br/>Third, Nicolas Cage can't act. When the General asks him, ""Do you understand what I'm saying?"" Cage responds, ""Yes sir, I do."" and it sounds more yes ""Yes, sir, I DOO??"" as if he's asking a question. The man has little talent I fail to understand how he's gotten so far in Hollywood.<br/><br/>
Fourth -- John Woo may have a talent for action sequences, but the ones in this movie are WAAAYYYY too Hollywood for my taste. I'd expect an American to run around with a Tommy gun blasting dozens of enemy soldiers a second without getting a scratch in a John Wayne movie or an Italian adventure flick -- but not an American movie from 2002!!! It made war look like a whole lot of fun and through in a lot of blood and violence that was very out of place. <br/><br/>Finally, the ending was very predictable and over-exaggerated. Too many subplots were left unresolved. For example, Cage continually receives letters from his fiancee, which he refuses to answer; but about 2/3 of the way through the subplot just disappears and we never hear a word about the girl again.<br/><br/>On a good note -- the cinematography was very good; just as good as in THE THIN RED LINE and the classic BEACH RED. It really looked like Saipan and was very believable in that aspect.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was far too Hollywood and pro-war for my taste. I don't mind it in an Italian war movie, where that's to be expected -- but, COME ON, an American movie from 2002? For a good modern war film, see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or BLACK HAWK DOWN. Rating: 4/10."

I was really pumped for Windtalkers as I like Nicolas Cage and had read about the Navajo code talkers over the years.  Unfortunately, the film failed to deliver on the people, the history and the importance of these brave and patriotic Native Americans.  After having their culture destroyed by ""whites"" they still volunteered..for America.  (""The Tuskegee Airmen"" also pointed out quite well the conflicts raging inside during WWII).  Hopefully, sometime in the next 30-40-50 years they will do a remake of this film and get it right.<br/><br/>Speaking of remakes, how about doing one on ""Hell to Eternity"".  This Jeffrey Hunter vehicle about a Japanese raised Hispanic kid in LA and his Marine action in WWII is still strong.  He too had multiple conflicts tearing him apart and we need to see these, know these.  ""The Thin Red Line"" was built in this mode but was too heavy handed for many viewers.

","Yet another terrible film for the Nicholas Cage library.  Seriously, this guy has a problem.  Something happened to him in since winning the Oscar.  He has consistantly made bad films.  What happened to the Nick Cage I liked in ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Honeymoon in Vegas?""  After the Oscar win his focus has been on dramas.  It's called a good script.  Rodney Dagerfield could have won the Oscar in that role.  Comedy, Nick, comedy. As for John Woo.  I don't get it.  His Hong Kong movies are great. His American movies are not.  He almost killed a potentially great franchise (Mission Impossible), Broken Arrow was just Travolta mugging for the camera, and Hard Target was just a typical Van Damn movie (although the shot of Wilford Brimly riding a horse with a compound bow makes me burst out laughing).  Then there is the dreaded Face/Off.  Travolta and Cage In a movie together!  Oh joy!  Both these guys got lucky with a fluke and everything since is crap.  That movie is garbage wrapped in explosions and special effects.  And what the hell is up with Travolta's family and the hand over the face thing.  Are they training to be hypnotists?  ""And- SLEEP."" Knowing all this I decided to check out Windtalkers.  This movie tries to be ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" combined.  Instead it becomes something that World War II vets would give the finger to. Apparently there were a few costumes left over from ""Pearl Harbor"" so Woo thought he'd make a movie.  In addition to the bad, over dramatized plot, the South Pacific island becomes the California desert halfway through the film.  I'm sure I'd find other problems with this film, but I'm not going to subject myself to it again to find them. But hey, what do I know?  I may be wrong.  Find out for yourself.

"LavaHound_76","2","1","2","21 October 2002"," Big Glossy Waste
","Windtalkers thrusts the viewer into the thick of battle from the very beginning. Bullets, bombs, and bodies fly in all directions. Japanese soldiers pop out of the bushes from every angle like in a video game. Men scream like Rambo, they die, they kill, and I am laughing. Why am I laughing? Allow me to explain. This entire battle is choreographed to such precise movements that it loses its fluidity and becomes robotic. It feels like we are watching toy soldiers battling it out. The battle is understandably confined to a small space, but with the brightness of the day, and the glossiness of the picture it feels like you are on the set of a big budget Hollywood film. Fake! Fake! Fake! The only thing that could have saved this scene is a director yelling ""cut"" at the end, but that never happened. If I saw this in a theater I would have walked out right away and demanded a refund.<br/><br/>Windtalkers is simply about two sergeants whose duty is to protect two Native Americans who use their language as a code for radio communications. Nice ideal for a film, but not even Nicholas Cage's acting and John Woo's direction could pull it out of the gutter. The characters seem like they have been put through some sort of Hollywood checklist. Do we have the tortured experienced soldier? Check. Do we have the racist soldier who will mock the Native Americans every chance he gets? Check. Do we have the kind soldier who will sympathize with the Natives? Check. The checklist goes on and on.<br/><br/>The acting isn't stellar, and you will notice this right away. However, here is a scene that stuck out for me. For various reasons Nicholas Cage and windtalker Adam Beach are alone together. Cage just had one of his nightmarish war flashbacks, and Beach attempts to talk to him, but Cage just brushes him away. While Beach is walking away he turns around and says, ""What is wrong with you?"". This would have been a nice scene if only Beach didn't have an ear to ear smile on his face as he said that last line. There are also some ridiculous reactions to some extreme situations. This film is a good example of actors relying on the camera to save them from their half-ass performance. We come for the pay check! Unfortunately, nobody told the actors that the editors came to quickly collect and leave as well.<br/><br/>

Perhaps they needed someone like Hal Moore to put his foot down about how to make a movie about the military.

","I normally like war movies, and I also normally like John Woo's films, so I was understandably excited about this movie. This film, however, left me severely disappointed. Woo seems to excel more with the mano a mano, one on one confrontations (witness the climax of Face/Off) than with mass direction of dozens of actors.<br/><br/>Here are a few of the problems I had with this movie:<br/><br/>1.) Nick Cage-- Now, usually, I have no problem with Cage. He is a solid actor, occasionally great. I just simply did not care for his performance and especially for his character (Joe Enders). Has there ever been a more unlikable protagonist in a movie? We're supposed to sympathize with Cage's character, he's had a rough go of it lately, lots of inner torment and all that. But I found myself saying ""Wow, Enders is just a flat-out jerk. I hate him.""<br/><br/>2.) The battle scenes-- I'm no expert on World War II, so correct me if I'm wrong, but were the Japanese as stupid in real life as they seem in this movie? Charging straight into a hail of machine gun fire? Weren't they defending Saipan? Just dig in and make the Americans come to you, no need to fix bayonets and stampede to your own doom. Of course, I'm no general either. Also, it didn't help that no Japanese characters were fleshed out. It was just ""Yup, there's another nameless guy dead, and another, and another. Good shot, Nick."" At least give us one evil Japanese colonel demanding his men fight to their last breath.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that Adam Beach and Roger Willie shined in their portrayal of the two featured code talkers. And while the Japanese defense made between little and no sense, the action scenes were for the most part very entertaining (which is what you expect from Woo). So, overall, Windtalkers rates slightly below Saving Private Ryan, and well below Patton as far as World War II movies go. If you're itching for a war movie though, just wait for We Were Soldiers to come out on video. Windtalkers gets a 5 out of 10."

In this film, director John Woo manages to find beauty amid the ugliness and brutality of war, and it is that vision of the beauty of a greater good, inherent in the indomitable spirit of mankind, that he seeks to offer for the consideration and contemplation of his audience with `Windtalkers,' a film that transcends the violence it depicts to discern that omnipresent aspect of the human condition that is defined by the gentleness and compassion of which it's very core has been forged.  More than a film, this is a journey, the intent of which is to open the eyes and the mind; and to those with the courage to assent to it, the heart, as well. It's a brutal film.  And it's a beautiful film.  And in the end, it will be whichever you deem it to be; it all depends on how deep you want to look. Or how deeply you want to feel.<br/><br/>Saipan, 1944; the U.S. military has implemented a code based on the Navaho language that is virtually unbreakable, and it is imperative that it remain so during their drive to secure this island, which is an important stepping stone on the way to the final objective:  Japan.  The Japanese, meanwhile, would like nothing better than to capture one of the `codetalkers,' from whom they could extract the information vital to their efforts against the American forces.  It is therefore vitally important that none of the codetalkers, all of whom are Navaho-- and all Marines-- falls into enemy hands.  Toward that end, a personal `bodyguard' has been assigned to each individual codetalker; the charge given to Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) is Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a personable young Navaho with a wife and young son back home.  Yahzee has volunteered because he wants to help his country.  But that information, as well as anything about Yahzee, Enders does not want to hear about or know.  And the reason is very simple: his mission is to protect the code, not the man; and under no circumstances is Enders to allow Yahzee to be taken alive by the enemy.  So if the moment of truth ever arrives, the less Enders knows about his charge, the easier his job will be.  He's a good Marine, and he has demonstrated in an earlier conflict that he will do his duty, no matter what.  It's the reason he was chosen for this assignment.  So as they venture forth into the fray, the objective is clear in Enders' mind:  At any cost, protect the code.<br/><br/>John Woo is the absolute Master of the action genre, and with this film he once again demonstrates what sets him apart from others who may aspire to that which Woo has achieved in film after film.  Quite simply, he refuses to sacrifice story for pure action.  Instead, Woo goes to great lengths, as he has here, to deliver a solid, emotionally involving story, presented through some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed.  The battle scenes he stages are, without question, the predominate force in this film, and they are graphic, but not gory; and just as Spielberg did with `Saving Private Ryan,' Woo very straightforwardly addresses the very real brutality of war without resorting to sensationalism or manipulation to engender shock value. Even in the heat of battle, Woo's focus is not on blood and guts, but on the drama being played out in the lives of Enders and Yahzee, as well as the others we have come to know and care about, like `Ox' Henderson (Christian Slater), and his charge, Private Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie). <br/><br/>
Wonderfully staged and beautifully filmed by cinematographer Jeffrey L. Kimball, Woo's film is visually stunning and emotionally engrossing, and succeeds where others of the genre have failed:  `The Thin Red Line' had the visual poetry, but lacked the human element; `Black Hawk Down' was brutally honest but did not engage emotionally.  Woo succeeds on both fronts with this film, which is not so much an historical depiction of the `code' and how it was used, as it is an examination of the moral challenges posed by war and the courage it takes to confront them, presented by Woo primarily through the characters of Enders and Yahzee, and with a sensitivity and some insights into the human condition that is generally lacking in most `action' films.<br/><br/>As Enders, Nicolas Cage turns in a solid, honest performance in a role which, some years ago, would have seemed custom-made for Steve McQueen.  In Enders, in fact, there is more than a touch of McQueen's Jake Holman from `The Sand Pebbles.'  With an introspective approach, Cage very quickly and convincingly conveys so much about who Enders is and what makes him tick. And allowing Cage those `moments' in which he so capably develops his character, and putting the drama of the story on an even keel with the action, is a big part of Woo's formula for success.  Cage, as well, refuses to allow the action to take precedent over his character and the story, and he deserves to be commended for it, as the film is better because of it. Cage and Woo are a good team, in fact; they complement one another artistically, and their collaborative efforts here definitely take this film to a higher level (which was also the case with Woo and Tom Cruise with `Mission Impossible 2').  <br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Mark Ruffalo (Pappas), Peter Stormare (Gunny), Noah Emmerich (Chick) and Frances O'Connor (Rita).  From the ethereal opening frames to the end, supported throughout by a hauntingly wistful score by James Horner, `Windtalkers' is another triumph for John Woo, and his best `American' film yet.  9/10."

As they begin to develop a mutual respect for one another, Enders is burdened by his orders to protect the code...at all costs.

","First of all whether you like this movie or not you have to give action jack of all trades John Woo credit for first, attempting his first war movie and second telling a story that hasn't been heard all that much in the past. Woo has always been known for his endless shoot outs and bigger than life action scenes and this is no exception. The battle sequesnce are huge and the gun fights never stop, at least half of the 2 hours are beautifully filmed battle scenes that capture the true horrors of war, trust me Woo doesn't let us off easy he deptices the dismemberment of heads, the loss of limbs and even an intense scene in witch a soilder gets trapped in barbed wire. But there is more to this than just the endless amounts of violence, Woo regular Nicolas Cage gives a great performance as always as a sargent ordered to protect an indian soilder who can speak a very special code. Christian Slater, another man who is no stranger to Woo territory also gives a small but none the less effective performance. The only probably with the film is that due to the fact that it is a war movie and it is expected to have a lot of violence Woo's trademark action style seems to lose some of its poetic justice. The thing that amazes me most about this film is that Woo has made here a war movie that can be enjoyed by not only war buffs but conventional action fans as well."
"dhallen","4","1","2","12 July 2002"," A very disappointing film...watch Sands of Iwo Jima instead.
","Why do Hollywood moviemakers bother to bring together respectable casts, viable storylines, and terrific costumes, and then proceed to make a ridiculous movie?<br/><br/>The story of the Navajo codetalkers deserves a better telling than this movie.<br/><br/>Like many war movies, the portrayal of combat is very poorly done. Anyone who has been in combat, or at least studied it, would find the combat scenes in this movie laughable. From the beginning scene, in which a Marine shoots a Japanese soldier who is hiding in the brush from a distance of about four feet, this movie does not portray a realistic impression of actual fighting (why didn't the Japanese soldier shoot first? he was HIDING in wait, for crying out loud). <br/><br/>There were way too many scenes of groups of both US Marines and Japanese soldiers running fully upright in groups of dozens or  more in broad daylight, and of course being gunned down. In actuality, combat is a slow, meticulous, terrifying experience, wherein men reluctantly inch forward cautiously toward (or preferable around) the enemy, shooting at anything and everything. On Iwo Jima is sometimes took days to move forward a fraction of a mile. <br/><br/>Almost everyone that was shot flopped around waving his arms before he fell. Most people when they are shot simply fall down or, if they are already down, stop moving.  <br/><br/>About 8,000 Japanese civilians took their lives on Saipan because they had been told by the Japanese authorities that the Americans would torture and brutalize them. It is highly unlikely that, as occurred in the scene with Cage, that a Japanese mother would allow her child to take medication from a US Marine. <br/><br/>How did Kahzee, dressed in a Japanese uniform and holding Enders ""prisoner"", make it from between the US and Japanese lines without being shot by the Americans? And when he gets there, and eventually gets to the Japanese radio, all he does is dial in the US frequency and speaks in plain, uncoded English to tell the artillery to stop firing on the Marines. If it were that easy, wouldn't the Japanese simply call up the Marines and tell them to stop firing? Wasn't the whole point of sending Kahzee that he spoke the Navajo code?<br/><br/>Why was the one Marine, who fed chocolate to the little girl, wearing the flamethrower in the village? A flamethrower weighs 75 pounds or more, and would only be worn when approaching or attacking enemy positions, not on a casual basis in a ""secured"" area. <br/><br/>Why did it take radio calls to order in naval gunfire and air strikes on obvious enemy positions? Most of the Japanese were in full view atop hills, and would have been bombarded for days prior to any assault by ground troops. <br/><br/>The special effect explosions in this movie for the most part were absurd. Hollywood special effects people need to put away the naptha -- grenades, bazookas, and even heavy artillery rounds do not produce rolling clouds of flame when they explode. The explosions are sharp and deadly, but visually often not very impressive.<br/><br/>I could go on and on. This movie was a poor war movie and only a fair movie otherwise. Rent the Sands of Iwo Jima or A Walk in the Sun instead."
"Hylo Bates","2","1","2","5 July 2002"," An absolutely horrible movie about a potentially great story.
","I was worried when I saw that John Woo was doing the film about Navajo code talkers in WWII.  It's a fascinating piece of war history that would make a great movie.  But Woo's passion for ridiculously over-the-top action sequences make all his movies sadly humorous, but I tried to keep an open mind about this movie.  Perhaps with a different subject matter, the much-acclaimed Woo could show he has real skill behind the camera.  But, alas, within the first few minutes of this movie, it showed me just what it was going to be:  two hours of pitifully-sappy and horribly-inaccurate stunts and effects.<br/><br/>This movie made Pearl Harbor--a maudlin, predictable, cookie-cutter piece of fluff--look like a masterpiece by comparison.  During many of the battle scenes, as well as in a few of the cheesy dialogues, I felt as if I was watching some straight-to-cable sub-B-grade movie.  What a horrible disservice to the men who fought and died in WWII.<br/><br/>Just so my comment isn't all negative, I do have to say I thought Christian Slater did a good job with a very formulaic and bland role (which they ALL were).  And White Horse, the Navajo paired with Slater's character, was interesting as well.  While hoaky, I actually bought their exchanges and found their musical ""jam-sessions"" almost moving.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was very poorly done.  I'm glad I didn't spend money to see it.  For me now, John Woo and Nicholas Cage (just like John Woo and John Travolta) are a combination that can turn even the most interesting subject matter into a joke of a film.  I laughed out loud in numerous parts of this movie, none of which were supposed to be funny.  A few examples: ridiculously ""hollywoodized"" battle scenes, like a bazooka shell exploding with the force of a 500-pound bomb; poorly choreographed battle scenes; and lines like ""That Navajo saved my bacon!""  Really, several times I found myself wondering if someone had written the script as a spoof of action movies and then Woo mistakenly took it as a real script, it was so preposterous in some ways and childishly-predictable and simple in others."

"Jimmy Lo Santo","10","3","12","17 June 2002"," Windtalkers: The Real Review!
","Well ladies and gentlemen I saw Windtalkers last night and have only one thing to say about its critics ""They must have been abducted by aliens and shown a completely different movie then I saw!!"" I thought it was terrific, bordering on absolutely fantastic! Yes - alot of the explosions were too pyrotechnic with more flame than would be released by real artillery and grenades, and I could have done without a few of the slo-mo sequences - but all in all I feel its the best war movie I've seen since ""Saving Private Ryan""!!! The characters were very well developed, you really felt like you got to know who these guys were, and you felt you had a personal stake in their well being. The emotional stresses and fight scenes were savage and realistic, correctly representing the type of war it was in the Pacific. And the historical accuracy was down to a tee.<br/><br/>Stylistically the movie differs from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" in a few important ways. The first two were filmed in a way to put you right there - on the battlefield with a combat camera - to make you feel like you were in the middle of it, and they did it brilliantly. Windtalkers is a little different.......and this is not a fault. Yes, many times you feel like you are participating in the battle. The camera angles are wide enough to encompass that viewpoint, but you also get the sense of witnessing a historic story. Its not that you don't get engrossed in it as much, its more like you are at times observing omnipotently and rooting terribly hard for your team. The editing was nothing like the cliche' ridden ""Black Hawk Down"", the pretentious ""Thin Red Line"", or the absolutely absurd and overblown ""We Were Soldiers""!! Neither did it have too ambitious of a soundtrack like the cheesy ""Pearl Harbor"". No - the angles were from behind the soldiers and their sides (wide). If a marine shot a Japanese soldier, you saw him go down. It wasn't like you saw the soldier shoot and then the camera cut away to see the bullet hit its mark and some ridiculous death dance. That kind of editing disconnects the viewer I feel. Furthermore, the movie also provides an excellent model of Japanese fighting styles. Much of the fighting was close, bloody, and hand to hand in the Pacific. The Japanese armed with their bolt action Arisaka rifles were outgunned by the plethora of BAR's, Tommy Guns, M1 Carbines, and M1 Garands carried by the better armed Americans. Thus their fighting style was more often than not Banzai and infiltration bayonet!!! That is why on Iwo Jima in 1945, out of 22,000 Japanese soldiers, only 11 surrendered. 21,989 died!!!!!!!!!!! The Marines had 3700+ men KIA in 1 month's fighting on Saipan (where this story is set) and the Army almost a comparable number. Until now this battle has never gotten its due attention, being that it was launched on June 16th, 1944. 10 Days after D-Day. I guess my point is that the Japanese charging and attacks should not be mistaken for a Rambo-like directorial style.........<br/><br/>Some critics have stated that the movie is more about Joe Enders (Cage's character) than the Navajo codetalkers......... Again, I don't know which movie they were watching. As I stated earlier, the film bears the mark of its director John Woo. Not in any stupid ""Broken Arrow"" or ""Face-Off"" fashion but you do realize there is a deliberate attempt at choreography at times. This film will be installed in my Top 25 of All Time. Its no ""Saving Private Ryan"", but then how many films are........... Just 1.............. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and was touched by it. My wife was almost inconsolable at certain points she was crying so hard. I would eagerly recommend this film to anyone.....and I am pleasantly surprised, to say the least, to see John Woo make a good film again."

","I just recently re-watched this after forgetting why I had shunned it on late night cable all these years. There is a lot of great stuff in this movie, it has a good director, a great cast- Nick Cage , Mark Ruffalo and Peter Stormare three of my faves, and the acting isn't that bad. The movie has good historically interesting subject material and the screenplay is not terrible. Yet this flick, while still fun to watch at 3AM, is a horrendous train wreck. 
 First and foremost of its flaws is the sound. The musical score is just flat out awful. It's misplaced and overbearing. Imagine trying to watch Saving Private Ryan with The A-Team theme playing incessantly and you get the idea. Also the whole sound editing of the battles is hugely off, WWII was a battle of big guns and here it sounds like a Sunday Civil War re-enactment.
 Adding insult to injury, while the battle scene choreography is visually excellent, it looks as realistic as a M.A.S.H. episode because of the location. Like M.A.S.H. it's just obviously filmed in America. Sorry but my suspension of disbelief just can't be stretched into believing the well manicured landscapes of Hawaii and Southern California were the battlegrounds of WWII.
 The final nail in the coffin is that all the naval battle scenes are obvious stock footage. Stock Footage! Need I say more?"
"JWGTheMovieCritic","4","1","3","14 December 2016"," The Poster Boy of War Clichés.
","Windtalkers is by far the most inaccurate and unrealistic war movie I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. I was a fan of the film growing up, as explosions generally attract young boys. Now that I've matured it's painfully obvious how generic it is. The acting is sub par for a war movie, the genuine emotions of war are vacant in this film. The amount of explosions almost make me think Michael Bay was really behind this film, using John Woo as an alias. Nic Cage is a one man army, which is truly the most irritating part of it all. His character is equipped with an M1A1 Thompson SMG. The Thompson holds 20 rounds a magazine, yet I don't believe I saw Cage reload a single time. Besides his infinite magazine and ammunition, he single handedly kills dozens upon dozens of the enemy, which makes the rest of his squad appear utterly useless. Adam Beach gives a rather a dry performance, which further proves my theory that he's nothing but a mediocre Michael Pena. How he landed a role in Flags of Our Fathers, a war film light years ahead of Windtalkers, is beyond me. In one of the final scenes, where Nic Cages character (Enders) dies, I couldn't decide which actor was less believable. For your closest companion on the battlefield sacrificing his life for yours, you'd think he'd have a little more emotion as he says goodbye. Two dull leading actors severely hurt the more dramatic scenes. This film is a textbook example of clichés, predictable outcomes, crucial scenes ruined by mediocre acting, and so much more. The only reason I rated it a generous 4/10 was for the entertainment factor. If you discard historical content and the near insulting portrayal of war, the impressive (although sometimes overdone) amount of explosions and the abundance of extras can result in some very attractive shots. The bottom line is this movie is a very poorly done film in regards to the war genre, but as far as action goes its enough to keep you entertained. If you're a history buff like I am, you'll want to rip your hair out in the first fifteen minutes. If you're just looking for a solid action movie, this might just be enough."

","OK, I'll try to be fair here - this movie had a decent plot (or at least original idea) and could've been a very solid movie... It clearly had a good budget to match, 2 boxes ticked very early on. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the rest kind of went to pot. Apart from the performances of Adam Beach and Mark Ruffalo, the acting was awful - from Nicholas Cage to the extras, from the delivery of lines to the deaths. The acting was very robotic and the cast might as well have had the script on screen with them.<br/><br/>This leads me on to the inevitable shooting, killing, explosions, gun fire and blood... Now we've all seen Saving Private Ryan (if you haven't that is the War movie you must watch), so we've seen how special effects can, and are meant, to be done. Windtalkers gets that completely wrong. The blood looks more paint like than in Get Carter (a movie 30 years older), the unfortunate loss of limbs look plastic and the aimless shooting/ spraying of bullets (but still hitting targets) becomes evident right from the off. To top it off, Windtalkers uses the same explosion throughout the movie - whether it's for mortar fire, artillery guns, grenades or even landlines... Same explosion! <br/><br/>It feels like they try to put in a lot of, relatively unnecessary, action to take the focus away from the diabolical acting...

","It's big, splashy, flamboyant, and predictable, full of zooming and banging CGIs, laden with sentiment. John Woo, master of the guns-in-both-hands shoot out goes to war.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is a Marine in World War II. He's assigned to keep an eye on Adam Beach, a Navaho Indian, who radios information to the rear using the language of the Dine to baffle the Japanese. The code he uses is worth more than Beach's life, so Cage's mission to to protect him as much as possible and to kill him if he is in danger of falling into Japanese hands.<br/><br/>I don't want to go on too long about the plot because much of it is already familiar to anyone who's seen more than two or three recent movies about the war. Cage is up to his usual professional standards. Beach is likable, has a dazzling smile, and seems shy in front of the camera.<br/><br/>Woo is a commercial hack, though. There is no artistry in him, only journeyman-level craftsmanship. The movie is filled with violence of every sort except sexual. Well, I'll give an example of what I mean.<br/><br/>The Marines are advancing along the front lines when they start being hit by our own artillery shells. Cage and Beach manage to get hold of a radio set, call back, and have the shelling stopped. Then they ask that the target be shifted to a Japanese position. No sooner is the request made than Woo shows Marine howitzers banging out their shells. Quick cut to Japanese positions. They immediately blow up in showers of debris and gore.<br/><br/>Compare this, if you will, with a similar scene in Terence Malick's failed but sensitive ""The Thin Red Line."" A Japanese bunker on a hilltop half a mile away. The men call for some artillery. Long, silent pause. The men wait tensely. Then there is the slow, hushed whine of shells passing overhead, followed by several explosions of dirt on the still-distant crest. That's it. No close ups. No huge fireballs. No ear-shattering howitzers. And the passage of real time. Malick's movie didn't make the basket but at least the director was TRYING to do something with a little poetry.<br/><br/>Woo is not. Every other scene involves some sort of cliché. Most of the deaths are in slow motion. (Ho hum, since 1968.) A grenade doesn't just pop off stunningly. It releases still another outsized fireball. It's the kind of grenade that, all by itself, can blow apart a building, destroy a tank, demolish New York City. The weapons rarely need reloading. (Reloading takes time and slows down the action.) Cage fires a Thompson submachine gun one handed, holding it like a pistol. If Cage had had TWO Thompsons, Woo would surely have had him firing one in each hand at hip level, just like John Travolta. There is the Texas redneck who beats up Indians cause they look like Japs to him. He changes his mind in the obbligato.<br/><br/>Is a sympathetic Marine ever forced to kill one of his Navaho buddies in order to keep the code from the enemy? Are you kidding?<br/><br/>Ya-ta-hay, natani. There's undoubtedly a compelling story of you Navaho Windtalkers out there somewhere, though I doubt that you were ever forced to hang your naked behinds out on the line as members of a rifle squad. That movie about your efforts has yet to be made."

The only battle these soldiers have been in is who can get to the shower first.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are also lame. Lots of explosions and casualties, not not realistic at all.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage tries to channel every one-man, bad-ass action hero of the past 25 years but with artistic talent and an ability to speak Japanese.<br/><br/>There is also the requisite swipes at unPC, insensitive behavior (making fun of native Americans), the Catholic church, the Marine Corps and who knows what other institutions I missed. Standard themes of self-sacrifice, redemption, humanity above duty, yada, yada, yada.<br/><br/>Total BS."
"spookycopter","3","1","3","2 March 2009"," A masterpiece of criminally bad film-making
","Not being a fan of Nicolas Cage or John Woo I went in with low expectations of this movie. What I got was something completely awful in terms of historical accuracy, entertainment value and artistic merit.<br/><br/>Nicolas cage must have taken out hundreds of Japanese soldiers throughout the movie and the movie goes to great length to show his passion for killing the Japanese yet strangely at the midpoint of the movie we discover he can speak Japanese fluently and acts with kindness toward the Japanese without any kind of explanation. It was obviously contrived to show that he is a man with depth, yet he is not a man with depth He is a man that is badly written. Somehow there is a romantic interest introduced into the movie that is suddenly dropped at the half way mark. He shows no interest in the affections of a nurse that showed an interest in him and the whole thing makes me feel like it was introduced for the purpose of showing clips of romance in a trailer.<br/><br/>The friendship with Navaho Indians is contrived. It was obvious from the outset that Nick Cage would be tested with his orders to protect the code. Except there is no drama in this. Nick lets the most valuable code of the war willingly cross into enemy lines during the friendly fire incident. He should have been court marshalled for this yet he received a medal of honour. Probably because he single handedly eliminated a whole enemy platoon.<br/><br/>Japanese soldiers never appear on the horizon, they appear from left, right, behind front, always popping up and screaming so that they can be easily dispatched by one man army Nick cage and his slo-mo director buddy. In war, you have soldiers to protect your flanks.<br/><br/>The scene where the marine threw his chocolate to encourage a Japanese child to run to safety had me laughing out loud and crying with despair as to how it was possible that this movie received any kind of budget at all with such a laughable script.<br/><br/>WindTalkers is the worst war film I have ever seen. The action scenes were pure A-Team and if there were any justice int he world, then Nick Cage and John Woo would be permanently banned from making any further movies."
"mr_popcorn","6","1","3","11 July 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""Windtalkers""
","This has got to be the most retarded war film I have ever seen. John Woo desperately tries to make this a cinematic achievement he didn't notice that the more big unnecessary explosions he makes the more retarded and boring this film gets. From the awkward action scenes to the hilarious and stupid dialogs, this film is every shade of wrong.<br/><br/>I had to actually painstakingly tread almost over two hours of this crappy heap of junk sht. This film single-handedly destroyed one of my favorite film genres ever. They tried to blend in a back story that concerns Sgt Enders' (Nicolas Cage) past and the wrong decisions he's made and it still haunts him after all this time yadda yadda. They tried to give Enders some sympathy votes from the audience because he was just following orders and all that stuff. I don't know about you but I really think this sympathy ploy failed miserably. Not that I'm a man with a heart made out of icicles , its just that the way the director did it is just too plain, dull, very UN-involving and boring.<br/><br/>The war scenes wasn't a sight to behold. The camera angles is way too awkward and from a a guy who've seen a lot of war films, maybe the actors needed more time in boot camp. Talk about awkward.<br/><br/>John Woo should learn a thing or two from 'Saving Private Ryan' before making another war flick. This one is a disgrace to war film lovers everywhere."
"dereklarma","2","1","3","15 August 2007"," Worst war movie that I have seen yet!!!
","This was a terrible film all around. Just total garbage! I will begin by saying that the idea of making a film about the Navaho code talkers was a good idea, but the movie was just poorly made.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film was how unrealistic the war scenes were. Every time a grenade went off, you would see huge balls of fire. In fact this happened when anything exploded in the movie. Also the scenarios were just plain ridiculous. For instance, the scene where they are being shelled by their own artillery and they can't escape because of the Japanese. So what do they do. The rest of the company stays put while Nickolas Cage, the hero, and Adam Beach, the Navaho code talker, some how sneak around the enemies' front line and reach the enemy command post and kill the guards without no one else noticing. They then use the enemy radio at the command post to tell their artillery support that they are firing on the wrong people. They then direct the fire on the Japanese front-line, and haul ass to get out in time. Woo Hoo!!! Nickolas Cage saved the day. I don't think I have ever done something as ridiculous as that in a World War Two video game.<br/><br/>And you are probably thinking, if the the battle scenes are over the top and unrealistic, then the acting must be too. If you are thinking that then you are right. Nickolas Cage? Christian Slater????? They do such a bad job of pretending to be a soldier that you wouldn't believe. Also the dialog is also very over the top and not delivered well by the actors.<br/><br/>Poor directing, poor cinematography, poor special-effects, poor writing, and poor acting. Very unrealistic!!! Probably the worst war movie I have ever seen."

The body dummies are obvious and the pyrotechnics are visible before they explode. The excellent cast, all of whom deliver good performances, can't save this one.

It was basically Nick Cage being a one man army, fighting the whole Jap army alone. At least that's how it felt. Seems every seen was Cage running through a battle area shooting Japs left and right.<br/><br/>If the movie had been released under a different title, it may not have been as bad.

I was really looking forward to this movie, and then as I saw it, I was on the verge of leaving the theater. But then I decided to at least get my money's worth and make fun of it the rest of the way. The really pathetic thing is that Tom Hanks joked about a ridiculous, stereotypical war/action movie scene of the ""hero"" leaping away from an explosion at the last second and he flies towards the camera with the flames behind him; Hanks was joking about this and several other things during the filming of Saving Private Ryan. The pathetic part is that Woo indeed included this exact scene....it was terrible.

"cleverusername","1","1","3","29 January 2005"," working title - Windtalkers, A Waste of Your Time
","This movie is the worst kind of movie - not good enough to be mediocre, not bad enough to enjoy ironically. If you want to see a well executed war movie, quickly overlook this one. The premise had potential, but it was very poorly executed by focusing on Cage's overdeveloped character. With no intriguing plot structure one naturally looks to the battle scenes for some saving grace, but yet again the viewer comes up short. The mind-numbingly long and rambling battle scenes retain the quality of a low budget cable movie, again not in that bad enough to enjoy ironically way. Stuntmen fling themselves to and fro after comically unrealistic explosions detonate in a setting that in no way resembles the Pacific front lines. The southern Californian shrubbery is a dead give away. Camera moves are staid and boring, which does nothing to enhance the disastrous fight sequences. I would rate this movie as ""unwatchable"" except that I continued to watch it out of some perverse human sensation one gets when slowing down to observe a traffic accident. Instead I will rate this movie UNFATHOMABLY AWFUL. Save your money and your time by not watching it."
"Captain_Couth","2","1","3","16 October 2004"," Sergent Enders and the Silver Star.
","Windtalkers (2002) was an expensive egg that John Woo laid at the box office. When it finally hatched, it was rotten. A lot of money was poured into this lame movie. Like I have said in the past, John Woo is a product of his environment. When he was in Hong Kong, he was put on a financial leash. Since he didn't have an obscene budget and a strict ratings system, he had to work with what he had. Now that he's in the U.S. and had a couple of box office success, he was given carte blanche. Now that he produced a couple of money pits, Hollywood is having second thoughts.<br/><br/>This poor excuse of an ""epic"" is a very bad film. Despite the aforementioned title, this movie has very little to do with the wind talkers. The film pays the subject lip service whilst it mainly focuses on Sgt. Enders (Nicholas Cage). Full of clichés and bad acting, the movie never gets past go. People expecting a flick like Cross of Iron need to look elsewhere. This film tries to be like it but fails miserably.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron is a masterpiece about the horrors of war. This film is just another bad Hollywood movie trying to be something that it's not. If you're going to pour almost two hundred million dollars into a film you better deliver an awesome picture. But since this is a mainstream film, you'll know what the end results are. I have to give this movie a very poor rating. I advise you to watch Cross of Iron. That film is a ballet of bullets, slow motion editing and blood soaked montages. Comparing the two is like eating a nice tender steak or a frozen Salisbury steak t.v. dinner.<br/><br/>Not recommended."

Each battle was just explosions.  They were good explosions, but big booms don't mean anything.  You can get that at any firework stand for 10 dollars.  The acting was poor.  The plot was ridiculous. That wasn't what bothered me though. I read that there was a $115 million dollar budget.  This is $45 million more than Saving Private Ryan.  This brought tears to my eyes. The sets looked like playgrounds. The dirt looked like it was just bought from home depot.  There were scenes with mulch.  The holes and ditches were perfectly dug like they were from bulldozers.

","I really didn't expect anything of this movie after seeing Mission Impossible II. So this movie was a lot better than MI:II but still not that John Woo movie that I wanted to see. The action scenes were quiet interesting as always. They hadn't that typical Woo style I expected so he kinda did sth new, what is always good. But in some scenes, I don't know if it was because of the really bad acting of Nicholas Cage, the action sequence seemed to be a bit ""slapsticky"", e.g. the first one where we see Cage screaming as he loses all of his comrades, kinda reminded me of Hot Shots, so quiet funny indeed. The music was used really suggestive. Always when the Amis kicked the Japs asses it went like *yeeha we finally killed them I'm feeling good* what creates a typical good/bad hollywood thing. Even that pseudo scenes with Cage giving the suffering child some analgesic didn't  erase that good/bad schema. I guess that film just wanted to reach the profundity of ""The thin red line"" but just failed, because of the actors(I real hated this young Navajo dude), the music and the writing."

","As is standard for John Woo, this movie is filled with blood, guts, guns, action, explosions, death, dismemberment, ad nauseum ad nauseum ad nauseum. It certainly has moments reminiscent of ""The A Team"" on steroids.  Still, the movie is not about code talkers or war, but about one man, a ""good"" soldier, dealing with the demons of his past and of his future.  Nicholas Cage, ever the angst ridden character, does his usual, exceptional job, though often understated when one considers some of his many other rolls. Much like ""The Thin Red Line"", this movie is a different kind of war movie, though it relies often on action and war movie cliches to get it through the action moments.  What makes it work is the emotional moments.  Still, the story overuses flashbacks and Woo has yet to master the use of slo-mo to intensify a scene.  Still, overall, this is a good movie, if misunderstood. Definitely not for the squeamish.  On the Pywrit scale of 1-10, this scores a solid 7.5."

It's like a situation where a liquor store guy seriously goes 'hey buy this wine, it's really really good, like the best french wine of 1999!'. And if the wine tastes like shit, you feel hoaxed - just the case with this movie. All these people involved probably thought they were making a good product, but ended up with this crap.<br/><br/> It's just like a video game with absolutely no sense. Casting is terrible. Cage is awful, as is Peter Stormare as the commander. The plot is laughable and the battle scenes completely out of this world. A bazooka a la Woo is, if not a strategic, then at least a tactical nuke. Tanks go out with hand grenades and no one ever aims of changes clips unless it's necessary for the 'suspense' of the film.<br/><br/> And btw, why the hell would the Navajo be transmitting coordinates??? What's the strategic advantage of transmitting artillery coordinates by code? Oh yeah, the enemy will know that they're going to be shot, and take cover and pull their big guns to safety! The Navajo were used as HQ staff to code strategic transmissions, not operative.<br/><br/> IMDB scale 3/10, still topping flicks like Godzilla, but not much. 1 point because I like war movies in general, another for good cinematography and the third for being kind enough to give me a fast forward option.

Master action filmmaker John Woo plies his trade expertly with his cunning staging of the battle of Saipan with his trademark slo-mo, bird imagery and conflicted brothers in arms tools of the trade in full glory but the pedestrian script by John Rice & Joe Betteer is pure recycled B-movie junk including everything from doomed soldiers passing on wedding rings to their girls back home to the racist seeing the light."
"Kirasjeri","9","1","3","15 June 2002"," EXCELLENT - and GORY - Blood and Guts War Film!!
","Intense fighting, and blood and gore, highlight this excellent depiction of one man's personal crisis amidst the chaos of America's invasion of Japanese-held Saipan in 1944. The movie does indeed rock, and Cage is very effective without being over-dramatic.<br/><br/>True it is that the U.S. Marines used Navaho-speaking soldiers to keep secret their messages in the Pacific in World War Two. The Japanese could never decypher them. But it is not true that Marines, such as Nicolas Cage's character, were assigned to not only be bodyguards but to assassinate them in case of imminent capture during combat. That is the premise of the film.<br/><br/>Cage meanwhile is haunted with the horror, and guilt, of having had all his men killed in an earlier battle; besides that, he is plagued with hearing loss and lack of balance from his injuries. Entering the scene is the very upbeat Navaho code-talker played by Adam Beach. Due to his own demons, Cage is unfriendly and standoffish to the newcomer whom he has to guard - and maybe kill.<br/><br/>As the gruesome and gory combat progresses Cage becomes more and more psychologically and physically tortured, although he does show signs of humanity. The Beach character stands up for his Navaho heritage against one prejudiced Marine. It is only after the terrible death of his best friend, the other Navaho code-talker, that Beach finally gets the killer instinct he was so lacking. It might seem a little pat, but is entirely logical. This all results in a final crisis for him and Cage in the last battle of the film.<br/><br/>There are plenty of fights throughout the movie; you do not wait ninety minutes for something to happen like with that bomb ""Pearl Harbor"". Don't go out for popcorn.<br/><br/>Swedish actor Peter Stormare (Steve Buscemi's crazy partner from ""Fargo"") plays the Gunnery Sergeant in charge of the platoon; there seemed to be no officers around except to hand out medals. Stormare's accent is a little off, but he's good and intense, and lean and mean.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about the film is the absurd way Cage can fire a burst from his Thompson sub-machinegun, or several rounds from his .45 pistol, and half a dozen Japs instantly are hit and come tumbling down the nearest hill. Cage never misses; the Japs are terrible shots, and none too good at hand-to-hand combat either. Man, they get bayoneted easy!<br/><br/>But those are minor complaints. Overall, this is one good war film, and in many wats reminiscent of the 1967 Cornell Wilde/Rip Torn film ""Beach Red"", or the original ""Thin Red Line"" from 1964, both of which deserve to be rented. Same applies to Buddy Ebsen's ""between Heaven and Hell"" from 1956, and 1950's ""Halls of Montezuma"" with Richard Widmark. Fine films all, and all better than the introspective and moody ""Thin Red Line"" remake.<br/><br/>NINE OUT OF TEN!!"

Scooby Doo and Men in Black 2 are more to their liking.  The mediocre reviews were predictible too.  Any film that puts America in a positive light is bound to incur the wrath of the left-liberal critics.

The film offers state-of-the-art war action but buries the human drama in excesses during its protracted 2+ hour run.

"JackDevoe","10","1","4","18 June 2002"," Fantastic. Even with so many war films recently made, original in it's own way
","I've waited for this movie since before MI2 came out. I was hoping for the day it would get released. I've been a big fan of John Woo for years, and I was happy that Nicolas Cage became his American equivilant for Chow Yun-Fat. Of course, I was also happy to see that Cristian Slater was being given a chance back at the screen again. Sadly though, considering a unspectacular 14 million dollar opening and cynical views from the public, this movie may be a failure this summer. Many people are saying WINDTALKERS is a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN wanabe, has clich'ed acting and plot devices, and is predictable. This is all wrong. If one understands John Woo, it's obvious that he doesn't try to rip people off. Some people say one of the cliches is when a soldier gives his wife's ring to his friend saying ""give this to her if I don't make it."" It would have been cliche if his friend took the ring. But instead he told him to put it back on his finger and say something along the lines of. ""You're not gonna die. Don't even joke about it."" Nic Cage did much more than ""put in his usual method performance."" He was much different from his character from the other WW2 film of last year, CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN. In that movie he was a very passionate, loving man who had no real sense of violence. In WINDTALKERS, he is the oposite. He's cynical, cold, and unlikable. All because of watching his men die in front of him when he wanted to really pull them away from battle, but didn't because he was ""following orders."" This wasn't a ""typical"" Nic Cage performance. People also say Adam Beach was a total amature. He wasn't. Ben played a nice, naive man. He didn't want to fight, and we saw the pain in his face whenever he watched anyone die. We slowly watch him go from being a nice man to becoming hardened. He starts to become like Nic Cage, and when Cage sees this in Beach, he realizes how negative his additude is and how things would be if everyone had his additude. He doesn't realize it until a while into the film, but he realizes nevertheless. Also important, is how we are told about how important the Navajo Code Talkers were during WW2. We were never told this before, and it's time we knew now, and I'm happy that Woo showed us. The action is on it's own merrit. It doesn't copy, and Woo is able to show that he doesn't need dual pistols and fancy dodging and flying to showcase balletic action. HE took a totally different approach and still maintained his sense of original action direction. Such as when Beach and his Navajo friend run out of bullets and show their skills with the knife. Also, the famous ""John Woo standoff"" where Beach and a Japanese soldier point their guns at each other ready to fire is put to new use. It's not like in THE KILLER, FACE/OFF, or HARD-BOILED. It was shown differently, and not just for the sake of a standoff. It showed Beach's fear in killing a man, and the soldier's hesitation. It's not predictable who's gonna die either. Some of the more important people had unlikely fates. (Not a spoiler.) WINDTALKERS deserves success, and I only hope it gets more as time goes by.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","In 1943, Joe Enders is a traumatized and hurt soldier, who lost all the men under his command when following the instruction to defend a certain spot. After a period in a military hospital, he is promoted to sergeant with the ungrateful assignment of protecting the radio-operator Navajo private marine Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach). In accordance with this movie, in the Second World War, the Americans developed a secret and unbreakable code based on the Navajo language. Sgt. Enders together with the promotion, received also an undercover mission of killing Pvt. Yahzee, if necessary,  to avoid Japanese to get the cipher. This movie is very predictable. I had the sensation all the times of what would happen on the next scene and even the end of the story. I myself expected much more from Nicolas Cage (for me, one of the best actors in Hollywood), and John Woo (one of the greatest director of action movies). It is not a bad movie, but it is not in the same level of the recent Randall Wallace´s ` We Were Soldiers', for example. Anyway, it is recommended for viewers that like war and action movies, John Woo and Nicolas Cage. My vote is seven."
"lpk_old","10","1","5","23 March 2003"," under-appreciated anti-war movie
","The other users who commented seem to have missed the point of this movie, which is that violence kills the soul (a latent theme in most of Woo's work). This comes across most bluntly in Nic Cage's bizarrely over/under-acted character, a highly decorated and highly traumatized soldier who thinks that by waging a one-man war he can spare the rest of his company from dying. The rest of the acting is not much more nuanced; Adam Beach is better than he was in Smoke Signals, and Christian Slater plays the open-minded white guy in an effectively naive manner. The production quality of the movie is not exactly up to par either, with terrible music and a made-for-TV look.<br/><br/>But the movie is an absolute stunner. I don't know any other recent action movie that has affected me this deeply, besides ""Fellowship of the Ring."" This might be why other users rated it so low--this is a war movie that tricks you into watching an anti-war movie. Instead of feeling exhilarated by the violence, you are left drained and regretful. Still, the action scenes are damn good, and incorporate lots of clever moves.<br/><br/>Finally, this is one of the only big-budget movies to deal with Native American issues in a complex manner. If you are a white American and you don't mind facing up to your own history while watching a bad-ass movie, then by all means rent Windtalkers."

In 1997, he made what is consider to be the best action film of all time, ""Face/Off,"" starring John Travolta and Nicholas Cage.  In 2000, he made ""Mission: Impossible 2"" (a.k.a. ""M:I2""), starring Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton.  Now it's 2002, and what's next for Woo?   How about a WWII film about Navajo Codetalkers?   And he did with his new ""Windtalkers,"" reteaming Cage and Slater and co-starring Adam Beach, Frances O'Connor, Peter Stormare, Jason Issacs, Noah Emmerich, and Mark Ruffalo.  <br/><br/>The story is about 2 soldier: Sergeant Joe Enders (Cage) and Ryan 'Ox' Anderson (Slater).  Their mission: To protect 2 Navajo Codetalkers:  Private Charles Whitehorse (Roger Willie) and Private Ben Yahzee (Beach).  The problem: if any of the codetalkers get captures by the Japanese, they must destroy the codetalkers and the code.  <br/><br/>While Woo, uses alot of explosions, slow-mos, stunts, and gunfights, the story was very good.

That's why it's ultimately all that much more disappointing when Windtalkers turns out the way that it does. The action is flat, the story is riddled with tired war movie clichés, and Nicholas Cage is utterly un-engaging for the first two thirds of the movie, and only becomes slightly more likable in the last third. On top of that, the movie is looooonng.

","The premise behind this film is a worthy one. It purports to tell the story of the Navajo code talkers who served with the U.S. Marines in WW2. Unfortunately, what ended up on the screen does not do justice to those men on a number of levels.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays veteran sergeant, Joe Enders, who is recovering from serious wounds suffered in an earlier battle. He and Sgt. Ox Henderson, played by Christian Slater, are charged with providing protection during the battle of Saipan for two Navajo code talkers: Ben Yazhee (Adam Beach) and Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie).<br/><br/>Navajos were recruited by the marines to transmit messages in their language, which the Japanese could not translate. This movie maintains that bodyguards were assigned to protect the code at all costs, even if it meant killing the code talkers to stop them falling into Japanese hands.<br/><br/>This responsibility weighs heavily on Enders and he determines to keep emotional distance between Yazhee and himself. Nevertheless, the bond that grows between the two men provides the central story.<br/><br/>The movie does explain the background of the code talkers; the opening of the film features spectacular shots of Monument Valley in Utah, part of the Navajo's homeland.<br/><br/>However, the movie exhibits childish notions of combat and military life that one would have thought were well in Hollywood's past. It is as though the director, John Woo, purposely avoided viewing documentary footage of the Pacific War so as not to spoil his concept of the way it was.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the actual battle of Saipan, the Japanese launched a massive banzai against the American forces. Woo's whole movie is like that banzai charge. <br/><br/>U.S. Marines and Japanese soldiers charge up and down hill with the abandon of children on a vacant lot. Men are mowed down in swathes while real amputees are employed as gory casualties, however the whole thing remains unconvincing. That real-life last banzai by the Japanese isn't even featured in the film (it fell mainly on U.S. Army units), but in a movie such as this, it would hardly have stood out from the rest of the frenetic action.<br/><br/>Modern day audiences probably have little knowledge of the Saipan campaign, so quibbles of a historical nature do not indicate the root cause of the film's failure. This has more to do with scenes that utterly destroy its credibility. When Enders has Yazhee dress as a Japanese soldier so they can infiltrate the enemy position, it's about as believable as this sort of thing ever was in Saturday afternoon serials and B westerns.<br/><br/>Coinciding with the movie's release, President Bush paid homage to the surviving Navajo veterans in a ceremony at the White House. Cast members and crew from the film were in attendance. The sentiment was right – pity about the movie."

Disappointing on almost every level with ultra cheesy battle scenes containing enough fireworkie explosions that after a while your eyes glaze over.

","Sorry- this did not meet my expectations. First, i don't know much about war but i guess there is no armistice-button. Most of this is a massacre (if you watch the directors cut), and Nicholas Cage has a loss of memories (as he lies in the hospital with open eyes), is almost deaf, but suddenly his acoustic senses are intact, so he returns to war like all of what happened earlier was a bad dream, and also later he is mostly spared by the bullets. The twist of fate, what you find in history books, is, that the guy shooting with the flamethrower becomes a target himself and seriously burned, so one of the comrades has to give him the coup de grace. However, the shootouts look realistic but the airplanes seem to be slower than the bullets, like a simulation. But-what did i expect? i was watching movies like ""enigma"" and ""a beautiful mind"" which were sophisticated, but this was mostly like ""saving private Ryan"" with a few navajoes. In this genre i recommend rather ""the killing fields"", ""full metal jacket"", ""the dirty dozen"", ""where eagles dare"", ""casualties of war"", ""black hawk down"" or ""apocalypse now"". The final issue is, did the character of ""joe enders"" played by Nicholas Cage who tried to act coldblooded and taciturn like charles bronson, really exist? in fact i heard about ""Carlos James Lozada"", ""Randall Shughart"", ""Gary Gordon"" and ""Chester Nimitz"" on afn radio europe(you will find them on wikipedia) who did, because this should be a criteria. for evaluating a movie."

He fakes his medical with the help of nurse Rita (Frances O'Connor).

","I was hoping for a good war movie with a storyline on the Navajo coders from WWII. What I got was an 80's style action flick where Nic Cage channeled Rambo against the Japanese. There is some subplot on how the soldiers interacted with their code breakers, but any time things got overly emotional or gave a character depth, there'd be an explosion. While this works for an action film, it cuts the war drama short by not allowing the characters some depth. <br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure where the $100 million budget went to, but it obviously wasn't cinematography. There were times when stock footage of battleships were used, which immediately took me out of the movie. Perhaps this was to give the movie a more ""documentary"" style, but it didn't mesh well with the rest. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want an action film with a smidgen of characterization, try the film. If you want a war drama with a good storyline, you should probably look elsewhere."
"LeonLouisRicci","9","0","1","20 July 2013"," ""You think too much.""
","The Film has one major flaw and that is the Title and the Pretense of being the Story of the Navajo Code Talkers that played a vital part in helping to win WWII. It is true that is the underlying Story here and it is given adequate Screen Time and is fleshed out enough to make its point. It could have been more accurately called Saipan or Saipan and the Windtalkers.<br/><br/>It is an arguable point of view and it is argued to no end by Critics and disappointed Movie Audiences that feel they've been cheated. Maybe. But the Movie cannot be faulted because it is the first to put the Native American contribution and their Code into the American Consciousness. Until this Movie it was little known or glossed over in History Classes.<br/><br/>There is also much dissent about all the bloodshed (Huh) in this Island conflict that was one of the most bloody of the War. Even a 10 second search can find that at least 30,000 Japanese (almost all who fought) and 3,000 Americans died and over 10,000 Americans were wounded. So the endless fighting, dying and bloodletting in the Film is Historically accurate.<br/><br/>But the Movie is much more than John Woo flexing his abilities as an Action Director (one of the best) it has Pathos, humor, and some thoughtful renditions of Wartime Characters and situations. This is a much better Movie than its reputation. There was probably a lot of Knee-Jerk reaction to this sensitive subject (WWII) and the Movie was true, albeit most likely mislabeled, to its subject and deserves a good deal of credit. Its also quite an exciting War Movie, maybe not the best, but certainly in the upper echelons. Severely Underrated."

Enders is ordered to protect one of the American Indian ""code talkers""--a young, cheerfully-smiling father/husband, Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), while Sergeant Ox Henderson (Christian Slater) is paired with Navajo Private Charles Whitehorse (Roger Willie). Though the film as taken a lot of flak for its use of racism, it portrays an era of human-nature when this was more normally accepted--even promoted by propaganda efforts. By the end of the film, Enders gives his life for Yahzee in order to perform his duty to the fullest--going above and beyond the call of duty to its fullest degree. This is a near excellent film and a must-have for any war-movie buff."

","This is an interesting case. Every single other movie I've watched or heard of that was directed by Woo has one definite quality to it, regardless of what exactly it deals with... and that is that they're action-packed and stylish like a whole bunch of other flicks only *wish* they could be. So how was he going to fare when doing a serious war film? He tones down that famous aspect of his works, so much so that it almost completely disappears, which is, of course, exactly what he ought to. And the battle scenes here are chaotic and, to an extent, unpredictable, so he captures that well. Only, it doesn't last. It seems like, at some point, he just said ""heck, this isn't me"", and from then on, we're in Hollywood-ville. I'm not claiming that it's not cool and entertaining(if not entirely as much as it tries to be), but that it really shouldn't be, not in this type of feature. This, I'm very sorry to say, has some of the worst unrealistic, biased combat sequence stuff I've ever seen. It does tend to be exciting. The message is obvious, one of accepting other cultures, and it does get a genuinely sharp and poignant line or two in there, though most of the impact of any of this gets kind of lost. Acting, cast and dialog are good. The script is fine, if not terribly original. I can't determine where exactly focus was lost, before or during production of this. A lot of this comes off as authentic. Pacing is decent. The effects are reasonable. In the end, this simply doesn't hook you in, make you care, or deliver a sufficiently(in spite of several instances that hit the mark perfectly) credible an account of armed conflict.

","The premise of the movie is what caught my eye. It seemed to be an interesting piece of history presented to the public. Perhaps, I thought, the ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"" of the Pacific Theater.<br/><br/>I was wrong. It turned out to be just another shoot 'em up war movie. Not that the action isn't bad, but it clearly was not what one would have expected from the blurbs and title.<br/><br/>At times it just became silly, for example, one man with 50 holes in his body and after being hit with a grenade can fend off x amount of the enemy, while firing from the hip, hitting his mark with every shot. The enemy on the other hand can only hit the ground in front of him.<br/><br/>This movie had potential. But, big booms and hackneyed Hollywood heroics destroyed the story it was suppose to tell.<br/><br/>I gave the movie a 5 out of 10, just because it is just a good ""guy action flick."" That is all it is, which is sad. Truly sad."

","Anyone, and I do mean ANYONE, who watches a dramatic movie made in Hollywood or anywhere else, with the expectation of getting a history lesson is simply ignorant of the purpose of movies. Movies are meant to entertain and in the case of advocacy cinema enlighten; documentaries are meant to educate. Movies do not educate; they can in fact be highly misleading. Anyone wishing to know about the Battle for Saipan may I suggest A Special Valor: the U.S. Marines and the Pacific War (ISBN: 0452007372 / 0-452-00737-2) by Richard Wheeler (this book also covers the first battle sequence, which was somewhere in the Solomons, possibly Guadalcanal given the 1942 year within which it occurred. For those too stupid to comprehend a serious history, try Guy Gabadon's Hell to Eternity; it's highly entertaining and full of the kind of boyhood heroics most of the people here seem to think never occurred (it even includes a neat decapitation of Gabadon's best friend during a Banzai Attack. Gabadon's gun jammed and he watched his friend get cut apart). If Gabadon is too heavy for folks, check out a semi-coffee table style book ""Marines in World War II Commemorative Series-Breaching the Marianas-The Battle for Saipan"", which is also available in a CD ROM format. For those interested in the naval battle for the Marianas, the definitive work is by Samuel Elliot Morrison (""Naval History of World War II"", check for the appropriate volume for Saipan or find the abridged version of this study) or look for the Victory at Sea volume dealing with the Marianas. For those interested in the air battle, try ""Operation Forager; Air Power in the Campaign for Saipan"" by Army Command and General Staff College. If the tone of my comments seem a tad caustic that can simply be explained by the disgust with many of the comments herein presented. Most people offering sharp criticisms have no real clue about the Battle for Saipan or the Marianas operation more generally, Code Talkers or Navajo people more generally, and/or US Marine and Japanese infantry tactics/fighting during the Second World War. Most folks are rather fixed on criticising Nicholas Cage. Personally, I have no problem with anyone being critical of Cage; from my perspective, he's neither much better or much worse than most of the overpaid actors inhabiting Hollywood these days. I do have a problem with people making statements about this film's historicity or lack thereof without first educating themselves to the subject with which they are offering comments. My father was stationed on Saipan and Tinian in 1944 and 1945 (Army Air Corps). He arrived before the islands were secured and he had friends shot by snipers and saw Japanese snipers killed (he was not involved in the reduction of Japanese defenses but passed down hundreds of photographs of the process...to suggest this was an ugly fight is to do an injustice to what occurred). May I suggest that arm chair directors educate themselves before becoming critical of film content least they make themselves look foolish. I read perhaps 15 reviews and not a single one addressed this fundamental question. I don't give a care what anyone thinks about Nicholas Cage or whether Adam Beach looks like a Navajo; it would be nice if anyone offering comment about this or any film address what is perhaps the most fundamental issue of any review. and the only question of any relevance: Was this movie entertaining? One would hardly know from reading a couple of dozen comments."

The supporting cast are also great in their roles. Cage's character is difficult to enjoy at first but he becomes more human as the picture moves.

Which they talked about their experiences working with the director, the other actors in it, talking about other movies and both actors often joke a lot during the commentary but it does have some moments of dead air. Third track is from Willie and real-life Navajo talker code talker consultant Albert Smith. I haven't gotten from the third track yet. DVD also includes trailers as well.<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" was one of the biggest flops of 2002. Film critics and audiences were very mixed with the results. Most critics and viewers were expecting an Masterpiece. The biggest problem with the movie is the script by Joe Rice and Joe Batleer.

But their written characters are human enough and there's an few touching moments in the movie. This was John Woo's first director's cut. It was probably a good thing to add scenes in this new version. Which he explains why in the commentary track was it was necessary to be added in the Director's Cut. I liked this new version better than the original theatrical cut. It seems more completed as well. It's still not the masterpiece, we were hoping for but overall ""Windtalkers"" is a movie i liked very much.

","Clichés fly like shrapnel in the violent, often explosive World War II combat epic ""Windtalkers,"" co-starring big-screen action icons Nicolas Cage & Christian Slater. As staged by veteran Hong Kong action maestro John Woo, this exciting but unexceptional patriotic tribute to the Navajo Indian radio operators whose native tongue provided a code that the Japanese couldn't crack gives the short shrift not only to the tribe but also history. The uninspired John ""Blown Away"" Rice & Joe ""Chasers"" Batteer screenplay suffers from a bad case of battle fatigue and furnishes little insight into why the military chose the Navajo language. Of course, Hollywood doesn't spend millions to make historically accurate tales because distorting the facts drums up greater dramatic impact. Nevertheless, despite its graphic depiction of war, ""Windtalkers"" treats the Navajo code as a disposable plot device to enliven its mediocre melodramatics.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage's empathic performance as a conscientious Marine non-com, however, manages to bolster this odd-fashioned, formulaic fodder. Cage plays twice decorated Marine Corps. Sergeant Joe Enders who survived the sanguinary campaign in the Solomon Islands in 1942 with a perforated eardrum and winds up in a comfortable Hawaiian hospital. Sympathetic U.S. Navy nurse Rita Swelton (Francis O'Conner of ""Bedazzled') helps Enders fool his physicians into clearing him for combat when he really cannot hear as well with his damaged left ear as he pretends. After he resumes active duty, Enders finds himself ordered to act as a bodyguard for Navajo radio code talker Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach of ""Flags of Our Fathers""), but there is a catch. Ender's superiors warn him that he must take his Navajo buddy's life if it ever appears that Yahzee might fall into the hands of the enemy. Meanwhile, Sergeant Pete ""Ox"" Anderson (Christian Slater of ""True Romance') teams up with Ben's Navajo buddy Charlie Whitehorse (real-life Navajo Roger Willie of ""Adaptation"") as the Leathernecks land on the Jap-infested island of Saipan in the last days of the Pacific war.<br/><br/>Incredibly, ""Windtalkers"" concentrates more on Cage's traumatized Italian-American Marine sergeant than on either of the Navajos or the code itself. Of course, neither Adam Beach nor Charlie Whitehorse has an adequate marquee value compared to Cage. Nevertheless, why couldn't Cage have played a code talker? Furthermore, the filmmakers chronicle nothing of singular significance about the bloody Saipan campaign in their two-hour plus guts, gore, and glory saga. Aside from the Cage character, neither scripters John Rice nor John Batteer make any of the character more than one-dimensional ciphers. About the only thing that Rice and Batteer avoid is giving their cookie-cutter character the obligatory speeches that sabotaged Steven Spielberg's hopelessly sentimental ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) and Terence Malick's pompous art house pabulum ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998).<br/><br/>Audiences that crave gory, blood-splattered heroics will get this fill. Woo blows up trucks, jeeps, tanks, and artillery galore with his usual exuberant fireball abandon when he isn't blasting soldiers to bits. These violent scenes have been orchestrated with typical Woo panache and serve as textbook examples of how to handle violence. Perhaps the only thing that distinguishes ""Windtalkers"" is its politically incorrect treatment of the Japanese enemy. Ironically, director John Woo portrays them the way that Hollywood westerns once exploited Native Americans as anonymous savages."

","...and underwhelming, ""Windtalkers"" will never be more than one of John Woo's lesser films, and certainly not one of Nicholas Cage's memorable ones. The script by John Rice and Joe Batteer bites off far more than it can chew, and seems to have thrown their screen writing careers into the dumper. Perhaps we should be thankful. We're given too many characters to care about, which makes it difficult to care about any of them, even the leads; a side plot involving a Navy nurse (Frances ""A.I."" O'Connor) goes absolutely nowhere. Set during the Battle of Saipan in WWII, ""Windtalkers"" is ostensibly about the critical value of Navajo radiomen (their language was incomprehensible to the Japanese), but really turns out to be a mundane war buddy story centered on Cage's character, who has been detailed to protect one particular Navajo soldier (played with great sympathy by Adam ""Flags of Our Fathers"" Beach). Despite some excellent lensmanship from Jeffrey ""Jacob's Ladder"" Kimball, and lavish production values, it just doesn't work, at least not to the extent one expects from John ""Hard-Boiled"" Woo. Even his trademark slo-mo bullets'n'blood choreography seems perfunctory. Various character actors, including Peter ""Fargo"" Stormare, Noah ""Cop Land"" Emmerich, Mark ""Zodiac"" Ruffalo, and a resume-padding Christian ""Run For the Money"" Slater, do what they can with their mostly forgettable dialogue and ridiculous battle set pieces, but their efforts, along with more squibs and explosions than I've seen in a long time, are for nought. ""Windtalkers"" leaves its audience with only the vaguest idea of what the Navajo experience in WWII was like, and the odd impression that Cage's Sgt. Enders won the Saipan campaign almost singlehandedly. This one is for war movie geeks and John Woo fans only."

","John Woo made this action movie (cos that's what it is) the way he knows best: putting in a thin story line that contains his proved themes: brotherhood, betrayal, sacrifice.. and mixing it with over the top, styelized, slow motion action: gunheroes shooting of hundreds of bullets, and only get hit in the end, where (as in all his movies) always one of the two main heroes dies! This is a Bulletballet, this is a JOHN WOO movie people! Please don't judge this movie because of it's poor portrayal of reality! The whole WOII Pacific background is almost irrelevant. Furthermore, John Woo is not a character director. The acting in his movies is usually average, sometimes bad. It's the action that he knows how to show.

"DashTheGreat","6","0","1","5 August 2007"," Educational and exciting, but fails
","This movie reminded me of the usual video game that involves spraying the enemy base with bullets on the run, getting shot, and then restarting to do the same. It was pretty enjoyable and rewatchable. Minus the fact that it was completely predictable, this is nothing more than a popcorn flick to hammer your boredom. I'm completely fine with that, because it was very entertaining. Woo never lets us down in that aspect. It just fails, and very badly I might add, to get its point across. Nobody really cares about the characters in this movie. It's impossible to. Joe Enders was a stock character, more or less, or at least morphed into one when he went back to war. The entire squadron was very stereotypical: the bigot, the target of the hate who saves the bigot's bacon, the guy who thinks about his family too much, the oddball (Greek guy), and the main character's companion who is the only one he really bonds well with (Slater). Other than that, I would like to point out a few comical parts in this movie that completely ruin its dramatic effect. First and foremost, every explosion in the movie looks like a napalm bomb went off, even the grenades. The Japanese characters were bumbling morons who had no IQ or weapons capability. The marines used no tactics, and just charged or sprayed. In an alternate ending, Walker, Texas Ranger could have walked out and massacred all of the enemies on the island. Would it have really mattered with this movie?"

","It's okay for American soldiers to run over open fields and not get wiped out by artillery and heavy gunfire. It's possible that one man can take out an entire Japanese army with a Thompson submachine gun. It's definitely accurate for Japanese soldiers to only shoot at U.S. troops when they're only fifteen feet away. And it is realistic, when shot twenty times to keep screaming and bleed a quarter of bright orange or pink blood. Uhm? This sounds more like a M-rated video game rather than a war picture.<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"", directed by one of my favorite action directors John Woo, delivers this versus something along the lines of ""Enemy at the Gates"" or ""Private Ryan."" He definitely holds to his stylish action of slow-motion images, CGI, and fireworks-like explosions, with a slight feeling of the mayhem of war, which leaves me, satisfied enough to sit through the two hour and fourteen minute ""popcorn loving"" film.<br/><br/>Despite this cartoonish feeling, the film has some decent performances, particularly by Adam Beach and Roger Willie as the two Navajo Indians and the hot-headed Christian Slater. Nicholas Cage is his typical self as the impenetrable hero (as exaggerated in the first paragraph). And the historical look of the Navajos and their unbreakable code was mildly interesting.<br/><br/>I was entertained through the film, but I got nothing out of it.

","Windtalkers: Navajo Honor and Hollywood Hype<br/><br/>Windtalkers Director and Producer was John Woo. Cast of this WWII film included Nicolas Cage as Sgt. Joe Enders; Christian Slater as Sgt Pete Anderson; Peter Styormare as Gunnery Sgt. Hjelmstand; Noah Emmerich as Pvt. Chick; Mark Ruffalo as Pvt. Pappas; Brian Van Holt as Pvt. Harrigan; and Martin Henderson as Pvt. Nellie. Two actors played two of the first twenty-nine Navaho code talkers, among the total of 375 to 420 Navajo code talkers.. The first, Adam Beach, played Pvt. Ben Yahzee. The second, Roger Willie, is a Navajo who played Pvt. Charlie Whitehorse. Willie served in the US Army during the Persian Gulf War and spoke the Navajo language better than he spoke English (1). Windtalkers was nominated for several awards (2). It was nominated for but did not receive a Harry award in 2003. The Harry award honored films which conveyed history authentically. The film was nominated for a Taurus Award for Best Fire Stunt and Best High Work. Windtalkers was nominated and won a Taurus Award for Best Fire Stunt in a scene in which a soldier with a flame thrower backpack is set afire, crawls, and is shot by Sgt. Enders. <br/><br/>During WWII the United States' forces in the Pacific needed a code that the Japanese could not break. The Department of the Navy - Naval Historical Center (3) noted Philip Johnston, the son of a missionary to the Navajos and one of the few non-Navajo persons who could speak the language, met with Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, commander Vogel who adopted the idea The code that was developed was never broken. In Windtalkers Marine non-commissioned officers were told to watch over the Navajo code talkers and shoot them if they are taken captive. <br/><br/>The two Navaho are met with prejudice by the other Marines but they gradually win their respect. For example, character Chick, who insults the Navajo throughout the movie, finally states that Charlie White Horse saved his life after Charlie White Horse's death caused by Sgt. Enders tossing a grenade to keep him from being captured by the Japanese. . . Chick appeared to be amazed that White Horse would save his life. When Ben Yahzee, Navajo code talker, was in danger of being captured, Sgt. Enders couldn't kill him and rescued him instead.<br/><br/>I thought the main characters should have been the two Navajo code talkers. Whites exploited natives again by using them and then considering them expendable if they work in danger of being captured. The whites were tricksters because they didn't tell the Navaho their complete orders.<br/><br/>Windwalkers is not a native American film because the Navajo were only supporting characters. The main focus was on Sgt. Joe Enders and his inner turmoil as he kept pushing Ben Yahzee, code talker, away from him. Yahzee kept trying to be a friend to Enders and seemed puzzled when Enders did not respond to his offers of friendship.<br/><br/>Although the idea of using the Navaho code is historically correct and was very useful to the US Marines in the Pacific, other facts were not included. In the Saipan invasion the US troops outnumbered the Japanese 127,000 to 31,000. (4) The film seemed to reverse the proportions. The movie was filmed in Hawaii rather than Saipan. Hollywood stereotypes substituted for a genuine depiction of the honor and dedication of the Navajo. The inner thoughts of the Navajo aren't explored anymore here than in the typical Hollywood story about whites and Indians. I do not recommend the film, another white man's version of WWII which uses characterizations of native Americans to boost the status of the box office star. The real Windtalkers deserved better from Ne-He-Mah, the code for America, ""our mother.""<br/><br/>Footnotes (1) Biography for Roger Willie,IMDb http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932194/bio (2)Awards for Windtalkers, IMDb,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245562/awards (3) Molnar, A.

"marcin_kukuczka","6","0","1","25 March 2007"," His task was to protect the code; yet, he protected much more...
","I have read many comments about this movie and I am pretty shocked that so many people severely criticize it saying that it is one of the worst movies they have ever seen. I am aware that every film may rise some controversial feelings due to its shortcomings or misinterpretations, but so strong ones are rather rare?... When WINDTALKERS was released in theaters a few years ago, I did not feel a special need to see this movie because of its upsetting war theme. Although I have nothing against these films, they despair me in a way. Most of the history is still quite fresh and its drama is so intense that I simply don't feel good after watching the movies of this genre (with a few exceptions). However, recently I have hired a DVD and saw the entire film having been recommended by my friend. Although its action takes place in the ""heyday of WWII"", it is a slightly different movie than most of the rest. <br/><br/>There are historical facts about Americans on the Japanese island of Saipan during WWII but, foremost, our attention is drawn to characters of MARINES among whom there are two Navajo Indians. What are their psyches, their thoughts, their behavior in the hell that war supplied them with? Two characters are ever present: Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicholas Cage) and a Navajo Indian Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach). Although they meet in very strange circumstances, they become friends in time. Joe has the task to protect the code in Navajo language; yet, he himself wonders how much else, in time, appears to be under his protection... Joe is a hero, a real soldier, a particularly noble character. I feel a need to say that people who criticize his part are wrong. His part is an advantage of the movie. If there is a problem, it lies somewhere else. Ben Yahzee is a warrior but also a family man. Yet, we do not get much insight into Indian culture except for some minor moments about beliefs and ghosts. Pete Henderson (Christian Slater) is an interesting character, firstly unwilling to cooperate with code talkers, then, however, finding a true friendship with the Indian, Whitehorse (Roger Willie). When concerning the male characters, there is a brilliant moment of their talk about longing for families and peace of mind. The problem with characters, however, lies in Rita (Frances O'Connor) the woman Joe loves, someone who appears to be the representation of all precious values that Joe heads for in his life. Her part is well introduced but very badly executed later...<br/><br/>I also found the action of the movie quite thrilling. It did keep my attention, sometimes the fighting scenes are deadly too long and unrealistic, but they are not that weak in general. I liked the first half of the movie when you watch and wait what will happen next. But the second half is also not tedious whatsoever. All the moments are pretty balanced and events well executed. Touching scenes, for instance, supply the movie with a feeling so that we can stop for a while and think. ""You think too much"": that is what war forbids, however, that is what this movie does allow and even does promote, particularly in the final 10 minutes - that was the climax for me which really shocked me and moved me and that is the aspect I consider a strong side of WINDTALKERS.<br/><br/>The performances are not the best for sure. However, I cannot say I didn't like most of the cast. Cage does a pretty good job as Enders. There isn't, perhaps, a charisma in his performance but it's at least to say: GOOD. I would agree that too much emphasis is put on his part but I wouldn't say that his plot is useless. Adam Beach, although sometimes pale, gives pretty fine performance as Yahzee. When you watch the movie carefully, you will find some pearls in his part where he really fits to the role. I loved Frances O""Connor as Rita, she is brilliant and it is a pity she was given so little time on screen. As I have already said, her character should have been developed more! Christian Slater is strange as in most of his roles (I am not his particular fan), but not bad. All in all, there are some shortcomings in the performances - that aspect really lowers the value of WINDTALKERS as a movie in general.<br/><br/>But if there is a talk of any problem, it lies in the lack of Navajo culture development - wind talkers, code protectors...and what at the end. I cannot spoil your curiosity because you would not see the film with enthusiasm but the title and the gist seems to be lost somewhere. The film is anti-war, it shows its lack of humanity and logic, but it could have been more powerful if executed as a real masterpiece. There had been an idea for sure which was lost somewhere in the middle. A few scenes more would help this and solve the problem partly, more focus on Navajo. <br/><br/>To be absolutely honest about this movie, it is in no way a dull film, an upsetting picture that too viewers can stand. It has some really powerful moments, has nice shots and foremost the two factors I have mentioned: action and good insight into young men's psyches whose only duty was to shoot to kill until being killed. Indeed, WINDTALKERS is another anti-war film filled with nice thoughts and reflections. Therefore, accusing this as one of the worst films ever is a misunderstanding and baseless criticism. It lacks something here or there, that's all. Worth seeing as a picture which once again shouts out ""NO MORE WAR!"" A movie to be seen objectively, which will make you realize it's quite worth a search."

","The action sequences in this movie are corny, unrealistic, and just downright stupid. Others have already made the point that this movie had little or nothing to do with the factual/historical ""windtalkers"" so I won't elaborate on that subject. Instead, i'd rather warn all veterans to stay away from this garbage because you'll be terribly disappointed.<br/><br/>Just a few of the long list of stupid stuff: 1. Cage, whose primary job is to make certain his Navajo radio operator doesn't fall into enemy hands, stands up, leaves his RTO, and assaults a few hundred Japanese with only a Thompson and a couple grenades.<br/><br/>2. When grenades in this film explode, huge orange balls of burning gasoline shoot into the air. Heck, when anything explodes huge gasoline fires erupt into the air. Grenades also have some magical ability to completely destroy any armored vehicle instantly. (No I don't mean AFTER the 55gal drum of petrol incinerates the target, I mean the instant the gas ignites) The gas doesn't actually have to burn the tank, just explode next to it and suddenly the tank lurches to a halt.<br/><br/>3. The only 'japs' in this movie that can hit the broad side of a barn are the ones shooting at someone OTHER than Nicholas Cage.<br/><br/>4. Since all movies have to have a romance angle, they came up with one that has to be the most improbable of all time -- After meeting some nurse while in an Army hospital, she shows up to meet Cage at a Tiki bar on the Island where the Marines are fighting. Yep, one minute they're fighting Japs in the jungles and the next they're wearing Hawaiian shirts and ordering drinks w/ little umbrellas in a bar. Next morning, they're back to fighting again. The entire romance angle was contrived and stupidly presented.<br/><br/>This is a 'War Movie' for people who have never spent one day in uniform. The entire plot, scheme, whatever you call it is absurd. The special effects are worse than anything I've ever seen anywhere. Too bad too, because the real story of the WWII contributions of native Americans is truly incredible and needs to be told."

","From director John Woo (The Killer, Broken Arrow, Face/Off, Mission: Impossible II), I did see this film once before and give it a high rating, but the critics give it two out of five stars, so I had to see it again to confirm my opinion. Based on a true story, set in World War II, the U.S. Army Intelligence services are trying to create a new fool-proof encryption and communication code, that the Japanese code breakers will not be able to break. They find this in a Native Indian language called Navajo, and the people who use this way of talking are known as ""Windtakers"", and the latest mission for the army, besides defending their country, is to ensure this language code stays unbroken. The two men that must not come to harm are Private Ben Yahzee (Flags of Our Fathers' Adam Beach) and Private Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie), as they are the code talkers, and leading the mission to do this and do brutal battle to take Saipan is Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage). As time goes by, Joe and Ben become good friends, but then again they do have their disagreements which turn into big squabbles, but they try to carry on for the sake of the mission, but in the end Joe is the one that dies.

Cage is alright being cynical and often distraught and angered, Beach is adequate as the young code talker, and the supporting cast of well known stars I suppose get their time, the secret code concept is fine, and the relationship between Cage and Beach is I guess important for the true element, but for me the only really interesting stuff to watch was the many explosions, quite gripping battles and many bloody moments, all in all it isn't really a film I'd see again, but it's not a bad Second World War action drama.

","The war scenes were pretty good. I was moved to tears by the end of the movie. Windtalkers truly honors the sacrifices and memory of the Navajo WWII code talkers, as well as the soldiers who protected them. It brought me back deeply into the sadness of war.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage, as usual, did a great job of portraying his character. Despite a relatively similar acting style in most of his movies, I really enjoyed watching him and think he did pretty well.<br/><br/>Adam Beach and Roger Willie carried their ethnic characters rather well. Whitehorse was really cute during the scene where he performed better than all his younger counterparts in a class test, despite being seemingly less adaptive to the new military environment due to his age. He was a truly reassuring presence and wonderful mentor to Yahzee.<br/><br/>I also liked the way Yahzee's character was acted out - easy going, trusting and relatively untainted by war in the beginning, despite being right in the middle of it. Beach morphed nicely into the angry, reckless and desolate character that circumstances made him to be. His acting in this aspect was praise-worthy!<br/><br/>Watching Windtalkers was like a cleansing for the soul."

","There have been many pictures produced and directed during the World War II years in black and white dealing with Japan and Germany; however, this film clearly showed the hand to hand combat soldiers fighting the Japanese. The United States Marines lost many men fighting to capture the Japanese Islands in the Pacific. This is a great film which portrays how the Native American Indian played a strong role as Radiomen who were able to speak a different language that the Japanese were unable to understand. Nicolas Cage,(Sergeant Joe Enders) gave a outstanding performance as a Veteran Marine who was badly injured in other war missions and decided to go back and finish the job he started out to accomplish.

","When I discovered I could own VHS or DVD for almost the same price I'd be paying to go to a theater, theater-going stopped right then. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE theaters, but I'm gonna pay more to enter only to see it once? What's eBay for ?? The last time I was in a theater, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was released. I arrived two minutes after the previews began, and I wasn't allowed to be seated. HUH? So, I had to wait till the next feature, making it almost the midnight-show on Saturday. After the frustration of waiting such a long time and really wanting to see that movie, I paid almost $15.00 to see it. I didn't regret paying the entrance-fee - but, decided it would be some while before I'd be plunking-down that much money for a film. Now I watch at home, anytime I want......not having to bother with unruly people, and being as unruly as I want to be.<br/><br/>Hey! I wanted to see ""Windtalkers"" - I didn't even notice that Nicholas Cage was in it; maybe not his kind of movie, but I enjoyed and could relate to his punch-drunk character. I had seen rushes of the movie on the front of other home-movies, and thought it would be interesting. I wasn't familiar with Mr. Woo's directing nor any of the other actors. I'd never heard of Navajos being used in WAR 2 as ""coders"", but think that was a good idea. I agree with those people who think it's rather late for their efforts to be recognized, and YES - they should have expanded that theme much stronger. The two ""coders"" looked like Native Americans to me - isn't it possible there's a fraction of mixed-blood in there? I thought both their roles were well-played, but was kinda skeptical they weren't trained to fight. Yahzee was a sympathetic character, and Cage made-up for all that killing, anyway.....and Yahzee turned into a good Marine, don't-cha think?<br/><br/>I got exactly what I expected to see - a war-picture. I thought the explosions were just a bit bright, but loved the color. For that time-period, ""Japs"" was a plausible term. After all, they started the whole war, huh? But, I certainly don't think it's appropriate, in view of the many American-Japanese troops who fought on our side in that war, to lay-it-on too heavily. I've seen all the other movies about war some of the commentaries mention - to prevent being disappointed is not to expect too much.<br/><br/>So, yeah - I DID enjoy ""Windtalkers"", all three times I've watched it. What really irked me about reading what other people wrote about it is, WHY are some of the same commentaries posted three times? Lighten-up, folk: it ain't that bad of a movie......."

It's extremely violent and bloody, and I thought Cage worked extremely well with Adam Beach and had awesome chemistry with him, plus the opening is memorable and quite sad. This film is really underrated in my opinion, and there are so many explosions to enjoy as well, plus you will feel for Cage's character and root for him. It also has some good humorous moments, and I thought the ending was the best part in the film as it was so sad and very emotional, plus it's pretty well made and written. While it did have a long running time, there was so much action that it didn't bother me, and while it's not the best War film it's certainly a really good one, plus Cage had a really cool training scene in this one with him running on the beach!. This is an awesome John Woo film, that's also a really good War film as well, with a great story and top notch performances, and I say it's a must see!. The Direction is awesome!. John Woo does an awesome! job here with excellent camera work, cool angles great shots during the battle scenes and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace.<br/><br/>There is tons and tons of violence. We get tons and tons of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,tons of bloody impaling's ,plenty of stabbing's ,countless people are blown up in graphic detail, lots of blown off legs ,bloody slit throat ,extremely gory decapitation and lots more.<br/><br/>The Acting is top notch!. Nicolas Cage is amazing as always and is amazing here,he is extremely likable but a man with a haunted past, and we feel for him, and start to root for him, as you know he's been through a lot, I also loved the way he took command in the battle scenes, he was so intense, he also had fantastic chemistry with Adam Beach, he was amazing! (Cage Rules!!!!!!!!). Adam Beach is fantastic here, he worked really well with Cage, was vulnerable, very likable, had a good charm, and also had a very good scene at the end I really liked him!. Mark Ruffalo is really good here with what he had to do in his role, surprising to see him in this type of film though, still he was great! (Ruffalo Rules!!). Peter Stormare ,Noah Emmerich and Brian Van Holt are all excellent in there roles. Brian Van Holt did good with what he had to do. Christian Slater didn't have much to do but shined when he was on screen I just wished had more of it, he did a very honorable thing in this film! (Slater Rules!!!!!!!). Roger Willie is excellent in his role, I liked the music he played and he had some great scenes with Slater, I really liked him. Frances O'Connor did well with what she had to do which was not much. Rest of the cast do fine.<br/><br/>Overall a must see!. **** out of 5"

I found this rather similar to Saving Private Ryan, not a rip-off at all, just similar.<br/><br/>-------Review I found this movie to be action packed, awesome special effects, it was so good, and then I watched The Great Raid and it just plain, well, blew compared to Windtalkers, but this is'nt a review about The Great Raid now is it? Honestly, I never heard of the battle of Saipan, maybe I like this movie so much because I don't know anything about the battle, for someone who done their research or even vetrans, they could say it was horribly in-accurate. Nicholas Cage comes out on-top again, whether its gripping war movies and con-artist comedy movies, he's one of the best at what he does, I really don't know much else to say but, go ahead and buy it."

The plot and the inter-personal relationships were also believable (with the possible exception of cage's character who seems to achieve far too many things, single handed, leading every charge and killing every Jap, though to an extent this just the driven personality of his character but to me it was still OTT). What actually ended up being the most noticeably unrealistic thing for me was john woo's habit of using overly powerful explosions. All in all though a good film for the genre."
"wintertwister","6","0","2","21 June 2005"," Too much Gas
","The Navajo men who helped America defeat Japan get some much needed credit by this movie, but they deserved better than this. The problems with this movie include bad special effects, an in-cohesive story, clichéd ideas and lack of strong climax. I've seen some explosions from artillery and it doesn't look like what is presented in this movie--unless of course the Japanese soldiers where all hauling cans of gas with them in the jungle. Most large explosions were very gaseous in nature. Big flames and lack of explosive intensity mark the typical boom in this movie. The story was all over the place. Was it about the sarge (Cage) or was it about the code-talkers? It should have been about the code-talkers, but Enders was a huge distraction to the story line. It wasn't Cage's fault. They could have played him as that type of character without digressing from the code-talkers. Also, there were some good battle scenes but the Marines had many heroes and not just one guy doing everything in each battle. Since they were showing the battle of Saipan, why not at least show what the Japanese civilians did? Many of them,taught that the Marines were savages, tossed themselves off of cliffs in effort to avoid Americans. Already, others have discussed the clichéd lines and scenes. There are many. Enough said. The climax was predictable.In case you want to see the movie, I will just say it was weak because of the problems in the story development.This is not the worst war movie there is. It was OK if you ignore Cage's character as much as possible and give attention to the code-talkers. That is a challenge, but at least you would learn something about them."

A marine will regularly shoot six Japanese in a second without even having to aim, while half a dozen Japanese shooting at a marine only make the dust raise around his feet. Uncanny, or were they just being polite? There were some very powerful lungs around too.Whenever people are destroyed in the midst of a gigantic explosion, you can always hear their screams over the boom. I wouldn't like to be next to one of these guys in a football match, there'd be shattered ear-drums all around at a touch down. As the battles have all the traumatic effect of watching grown up kids playing at soldiers, it was delightful watching so many people being shot, a Peckinpah after-taste."

","I liked this film since Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater were the perfect choices to star in such war/action films like this one. However I strongly believe that the Navajo people weren't given enough credit for all their efforts in both the film and in real life. Of course if it hadn't have been for the Navajos coming up with that code in the first place, the Americans would have been more exposed to the Allies' enemies and thus allowing them to be defeated more easily. This is only how the way I see it. But what the real problem is that the Allies never saw the Navajos as the real true heroes that they were since it was them who practically won the war for them anyway! Unfortunately you'll never hear about the contributions the Navajo made during the war because just like back in those days, the white American mentality of Natives being ""savages"" are still too deeply embedded in their minds.<br/><br/>But.......

","This comment is if anything, uninformed as to the film itself and to the ways that the film tells a story.I was not impressed by the Enders character and even thought his self sacrificing was almost a conceit.The denial and the rude story about,first being awarded the Silver Star and which followed the story about his first commendation in which he received injuries probably should of taken him out of the war entirely.Its difficult to place because we are not saints, yet our efforts in the South Pacific were commented on by Admiral Halsey in a letter he wrote to the marines stationed on Guadalcanal in the latter period of 1942-my point is that theater of combat was real.It was then that our intelligence people did something that I wish even today that had been able to do at Pearl and that was break the Japanese Code.It is a terrible truth that we were close to making the right move, but to slow to beat history with our inability to act in light of the developments regarding the Empire of Japan at Pearl Harbor.The Japanese found out the hard way when we nailed there top guy as he was en-route through the air to one of the forward island positions.This was all due to our intelligence and the fact that we knew before hand what was to have occurred.The films storyline is of an intelligence ability that would allow open communication without the enemy knowing what was being communicated, because we had a secret weapon of sorts in the Navajo code talkers.The instances in the film,where the code talkers did what they trained to do were justifiably critical and paid dividends without much of a second thought.Both men who portrayed Navajo code talkers were assigned to the invasion of the Island of Saipan were understated and like the privilege of serving our country, intelligent and brave.This was done as a conservative note as to the films treatment of some of the unfriendly ways Native Americans have had to cope with being considered outsiders on there native soil.It is in fact a red face that seemingly causes all the problems, however the day is not lost on these resourceful Navajo code talkers.The difficult position had here is that both the Christian slater character and the Nicolas cage character present there ultimatum of never let these code talkers into the hands of the enemy while alive,Protect the code at all costs become a perceived edge of the relationship.This has the ability to limit as well as alienate these men and as well provides a difficult position from which to act.It is a very real struggle when the film allows one of the code talkers to die at the hands of a grenade thrown very wilfully by enders which was suppose to protect the code at all costs thus taking the life of one of the films heroes.He was by the way in the clutches of 4 Japanese soldiers as they were attempting a counterattack on what was suppose to be a secured position.Though the invasion was provided for on a big scale,there was very little that I would define as strategic.I would of not rested nights as well,however the film went about attempting to show a conflict in the life we know and the purpose had through this entertainment medium.The film provided a error in dividing our attention and as well made it hard to distinguish a particular course of action.That, in so far as history was concerned was not a problem-there was a very real focus,desire,commitment on our part to defeat the Empire of Japan.The attempt to showcase lifestyle was out of place,and as well the seemingly lack of character that pervaded the film was almost anti-war.It was anti-war because there was no purpose outside of names and such.It was as stated somewhat hard to figure as the film possessed a inability to convince this viewer that it was real.There was some shocking violence however, enders possessed a heroic position himself and went about conducting himself in such a way as to go beyond the call of duty and so exemplary were his actions in the field that he may of qualified for the Purple Heart awarded PostHumously.The captain of the campaign,Gunny(?) made a mention to Enders that was not understood entirely and I believe it is one of the failings of this film.This at all cost has all the earmarks of a mob-hit and not the need to know requirement that should of been present,this subject and the men whose lives it affected deserved better treatment.The film actually and its too bad is mediocre, because it fails to convince that we are in fact participating in an event that occurred in 1943.One review cited a formula recipe was what made this fail not the subject matter."

The terrible conflict this caused in the mind of the character played by Cage was brought constantly to the fore.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were tense and realistic. In one series of scenes, a radio carried by a codetalker is lost and kicked around like a loose football. Possession of the radio is essential to stopping an attack by Japanese artillery on an American troupe column. As each person attempting to get possession of the radio is shot up, the outcome is always in doubt.<br/><br/>The actual battle for Saipan, a minor island in the Marianas, eventuated in more American casualties than the D Day landing.

The latter's contribution to the film is to smile, say wise spiritual stuff, and occasionally turn in some coordinates over the radio.<br/><br/>Windtalkers feels endlessly overlong and blends massive battle scenes (i.e. guys flying through the air in front of explosions in slow motion) with sequences where absolutely nothing happens.

Incredibly, the filmmakers didn't even bother to detail how the Code Talkers came to have such an important role in the war. I have rarely been so disappointed in a movie.

","Unfortunately this has to be one of the most disappointing WWII films of all times, and I say unfortunately because it had potential.  The story of the windtalkers or code talkers in WWII is one that explains the legacy of Native Americans to the United States.  The movie itself does an adequate job of illustrating the individual story of two specific code talkers. This individualistic approach to a war film is common in the genera.  The downfall of the film is the terrible film making during the battle sequences.  The opening battle represents the worst acting of Nicolas Cage's career.  The music in the background during these sequences is pure camp, and kills these scenes all together!  Woo pushes this film in cycles of artistic beauty and strong character development to scenes that are unrealistic.  In all the battle sequences are so embellished that it has patriotic overtones reminiscent of Green Berets- A sad sign for a war film. In all the entire movie was best left to the base story of the code talkers, the fight scenes and special effects detract from the story.  It asks for the audience to suspend their notions of reality, something most are unwilling to do giving the realism modern war films have to offer.

","This is a fine movie about heroism on the battlefield.  Directed by John Woo, the master of Hong Kong action films, it takes place during World War II, mostly involving the battle to take the island of Saipan.<br/><br/>
The director takes an interesting angle, basing the story around the Navajo radio operators who used their native language and code to help the Marines coordinate their attacks without the Japanese being able to listen in. Windtalkers, that's what they were called.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage turns in a surprisingly good performance as a gung-ho Marine sergeant assigned to protect one of the Navajos.  Because of the danger of the code being broken were one of the radiomen to be caught alive, it's his job to kill his man rather than let him be captured.<br/><br/>I found some similarities to another recent war film, ""Saving Private Ryan,"" however, with some important differences.  John Woo embraces the culture of the warrior, while Steven Spielberg is obviously repulsed by violence.  John Woo's films always have a strong sense of honor among men in conflict - the heroes live and die by a code.  ""Private Ryan"" had a cynical edge to it - the men acted bravely but they questioned why they were there.<br/><br/>The director treats the Navajo culture reverently in this film.  It is obvious that he has deep respect for his subject matter.  The opening shot of a bus full of recruits leaving the reservation and the ending where Ben Yahzee, the radioman, honors his sergeant in a religious ceremony with his son present are both touching.<br/><br/>There's a lot of violence in this film, as you would expect from John Woo, and that might turn some people off.  But it's necessary to chronicle the battles, and the director isn't the type to turn his eye  from it.  He doesn't glorify war, but he makes sure the depiction is realistic enough to highlight the heroism of the men.<br/><br/>A tad too long - they could have cut about fifteen minutes out without hurting the flow - but still a pretty good movie."

After reading others' reviews about saying how horrible the story-line was, then i HAD to watch it myself...and personally i disbeleive all those other viewers who said things like that about this film, because afterwards that i saw it--i {in my strong, own opinion} felt that ""Windtalkers""'s story line was overly brilliant, history-correct, and entertaining.<br/><br/>FIVE stars!"
"illeatyourdog","Null","0","1","29 May 2003"," GREAT!!! . . . when viewed as an action movie
","Windtalkers is almost a paradox.  When viewed as an action movie, it is spectacular but as a war movie, it leans towards the mediocre side of things.  The reason why this is is because well, other then introducing the small but signifigant part that the navajo indians played in the war, Windtalkers really offers nothing new in terms of how to view war or how the soldiers viewed the war.  Also, when there is an attempt at a message of any kind or some ironic conversations among the characters, it seems forced and only in the film becuase it is trying to be a war movie and all war movies must have them.  Another thing that war movies have is confusion and an uneasy flow of the battle scenes which works for a war movie. Windtalkers has a more comfortable and natural flow with the battle scenes which are great in terms of action scenes but not really in terms of a war movie. Saving Private Ryan, and We Were Soldiers are great examples of how a war movie battle scene should be because the actions of the characters and such are disjointed and has an uneven pace. However, the battle scenes in Windtalkers are by far the best, amd most brutal, that I have ever seen.  In fact I would go as far to say that they are more brutal then Saving Private Ryans (We Were Soldiers is a toss up). The reason being is that tyhe characters, mainly Nicolas Cage's and the Ben Yahzee, get down and dirty with the enemy.  Nicolas Cage takes out 6 guys at ppoint blank range with a pistol and Ben Yahzee swings a knife wildly at enemy soldiers slashing throats, legs, arms, or whatever is in the way of the knife. Basically, it is a great action movie masqurading as a war movie.  If you watch it for the battle scenes, you wont be dissappointed.  If you wacth it and expecting something like We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan, you will be dissappointed.<br/><br/>sidenote:  What also seperates Windtalkers from SPR ans WWS, is the use of slow motion.  SPR and WWS had very little slow motion withyin their battle scenes and when they did it was the clunky, unpolished kind that fits them well.  Windtalkers has the smooth slow motion from high speed camaras which looks very impressive but makes the battle scenes very stylistic which is great for a action movie but seems out of place in a war movie."

","********SPOILERS THROUGHOUT********* A quick plot summary:  Sergeant Joe Enders feels responsible for the deaths of his entire unit and so, despite being deafened by an inner ear injury, manages to be sent to the front line again.  His purpose?  Could be a way of committing suicide, or maybe a determination to make amends.  Anyhow, when push comes to shove he lays his own life down to save his fellow soldier.<br/><br/>
Hang on, you say.  What about the Navajo code talkers?  Yep, I thought the movie was about them too, but it wasn't.  It was a pretty standard war movie plot from the 1950's, recycled here and given the added ""attractions"" of John Woo's action-oriented direction, and what was basically a subplot about the Navajo code talkers.<br/><br/>Was there anything good about it?  Well, Christian Slater didn't completely suck.  The Navajo story was interesting but not a big enough part of the movie.<br/><br/>The bad points?  Many and various.  Nic Cage's deafness seemed to come and go as and when it suited the plot.  A half hearted romance storyline went nowhere at all.  The battle scenes were ridiculous - just how many bullets fit in a magazine for an American gun?  Were the Japanese totally untrained? Plus I can't help thinking the front line was a pretty dumb place for not one, but two code talkers.  The sub plot about the racist soldier who sees the light when his life is saved by a Navajo made me laugh hysterically.<br/><br/>It's a big shame because I just know there's an interesting story waiting to be told about the code talkers and their contribution to the war effort. It should have been the story of Yahzee (the Navajo Cage is assigned to caretake) rather than Cage/Enders.  That might have given a new perspective on the war.  As it is, there is nothing original or interesting here, just a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>1 out of 5."

However, the story focuses too much on action-related scenes and sorry to say that, but I do not believe any word Mr. Cage says in this film, everything just feels very unrealistic.

"robred69","Null","0","1","17 February 2003"," Great action, but a missed opportunity
","Ive just this moment, saw Windtalkers. I was really excited about seeing this movie about Navaho Indian codes and the Battle for Saipan. The budget for this movie was immense and I was not dissapointed in the special effects department either.<br/><br/>However, as some commentators have noted, I did find the shooting of Japanese soldiers a bit over done. Scene after scene involving conflict, the US soldiers were shooting the Japanese with a bit of impunity whilst the US soldiers suffered more from artillery than the bullets fired from Imperial Japanese forces. The military adviser in this film really fell down on his job. Thank god I've never been to war, but I do feel the Director made the conflict just a bit one-sided in terms of fighting capability as the Japs it seems couldn't shoot properly. Im sure the veterans either laughed or cried at the ease in which the film demonstrated the taking of Japanese trench positions.<br/><br/>The duty of a Director is to get a story across and a war movie, especially now, is to show how war really is, so that the audience can actually  get a closer understanding of conflict and its consequences. The film Windtalkers, did at key stages look at how war brutalizes people, and the characters involved explored that concept, but after suffering traumatic and terrible scenes of carnage that brutalization was replaced by deep friendship and the spirit and comradeship that only a combat soldier could experience.<br/><br/>
Windtalkers should be rated as a great action movie, but it was a missed opportunity in regard to the Navaho Indians and their unique story & contribution in World War 2. The next time the Director embarks on a war movie, a little more substance in plot in place of action and unessacary diversions is advisable."

","John Woo made a film out of a bad script made by two unexperienced writers: John Rice and Joe Batter.  Certainly they had no experience of war-movies. The Navajo language-code was never broken just as the last German Kriegsmarine-code of 1945 was never broken. Some coded dialect language, be it German or French or whatever could be difficult to break as well.  The ending of the film is a real disappointment: the action scenes are repetitive and boring. This is not the best WOO. The movie lacks a point of view that could give a direction to the story. Making an apology of the bravery of an American-Indian tribe is not enough to make a movie interesting.  There were brave soldiers on each side in the Second World War and the Japanese and the Germans were more fanatical soldiers than the Americans, but they lost the war."

What's left, aside from these numerous and bloody battle scenes, is worrying reminiscent of Pearl Harbor and other trash of its ilk. Clichéd characters (the racist, the dumb senior officer, the snow-white nurse), plot twists you can see coming a mile off, and some highly suspect reasoning that's confusing or just not properly explained.<br/><br/>Respect is due as always to one of the kings of the action movie genre, but there was a proper story that needed telling within all the carnage, and it needed a lighter touch to bring it out."

It is a good war movie that is filled with lots of action and explosions, although I would have expected nothing less from John Woo.

But, unfortunately, despite the movie's strong points, it fails on several aspects.<br/><br/>I felt Nicholas Cage's performance in this movie was a little dry. His character does not show enough emotion, and as such his dialogue often comes out flat. Also, the Japanese soldiers in the movie seemed to be nothing than cardboard cutouts in a shooting gallery. The American soldiers could hit the Japanese soldiers with an incredibly high degree of accuracy, but the Japanese soldiers could not seem to hit much of anything. Now, I know that this is an American made movie, but it is unrealistic.<br/><br/>Still, because of the acting of Adam Beach, and the fact that the fight scenes were done fairly well, I feel that the movie is worth watching.<br/><br/>I give this movie 7/10."

Here, he plays a lunatic army sergeant who is assigned to protect a native soldier who can speak the unbreakable Navajo code language.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS! SPOILERS!) John Woo's battle sequences are not the best I have ever seen. They are quite boring most of the time, as they usually consist of people just getting shot or stabbed and then falling down and then people screaming at each other. When there is fire (there is a lot of fire) things get very hot. The writers liked to write people running around on fire and then having their fellow comrades shoot them so they wouldn't have to suffer. Yeah, this is fine. But when you have it in your movie about three or four times, it gets a little obtuse.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS! SPOILERS!) About 45 minutes to the end of the movie, the battle scenes got better. Only they were predictable. Right from the start of the movie, hell, even before I started watching the movie, I said to myself ""I bet they're going to end up killing one of the codebreakers"". And yeah, I was right. There is also very little character development and also some very poor attempts at creating humor. I think I laughed once. And, not to mention the acting. Yeah, it's good. Its not the best acting ever, and it certainly won't get any Academy Award nominations, as it is just mediocre. The supporting cast includes Christian Slater, Frances O' Connor, Adam Beach, Brian Van Holt, Peter Stormare, and Noah Emmerich. All of whom are fine.

However, I do have to `bow' my head for Chief Cage for broadening his acting horizons by acting in his first war flick. Adam Beach, who plays the Navajo Indian, portrayed his character in a candy-coated tone that tried to hard to convince audiences that he was no `son of a beach'.

The racist soldier is closer to who they really are. The plot is not different from other war films and even the action sequences are boring.  What happened to John Woo?"

","When I first heard of this movie I anticipated its release to tell an important story of the US War in the Pacific in WW-II.  When its release was delayed, I believed they were editing the film to make it a nice tight piece.  When I learned John Woo was directing the movie, I anticipated the texture he typically adds to his movies.  What I saw was a tremendous disappointment.<br/><br/>The contribution of the Navajo Code Talkers in WW-II could not be measured, it provided a virtually unbreakable code that could be used on field and plain voice radios.  I thought the movie would tell us the why and how the Marine Corp and Navy decided upon this.  Why the Navajo language, and why not Sioux or Iriquois?  How did the Marine Corp and US Government talk the Navajo into doing this, because let's face it the Governments record dealing with Native Americans is not the best.<br/><br/>Now for the Movie itself, why is a babe like Frances O'Connor chasing a surly Nick Cage?  Why can Sgt. Enders (Cage) speak Japanese if he is a bad boy from South Philly?  How did Sgt.(s) Enders and Andersen (C. Slater) get Jungle Camouflage Uniforms in 1943 when the rest of the USMC got them in Viet Nam?  Why didn't John Woo do his homework, pyrotechnics is not a substitute for a good script and the battle of Saipan was far different than what was portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>I think I will take a drive along route 66 to the Codetalkers Museum in Arizona."
"EatingFish","Null","0","1","29 July 2002"," Negative, but a few good points.
","Did you know the Japanese bullets have absolutely no effect on Americans? Apparently John Woo does.<br/><br/>This movie, although it has its moments, is lousy. The plot is very interesting and quite promising, a dozen or so Navajo tribesmen are being taught how to use their native language as a code. It could then be used to communicate with allied artillery to take out enemy positions. Albeit interesting, John Woo seems more interested in blowing things up, and pretty much abandons the plot. Now I don't mind action movies, and I like John Woo's previous action movies (excluding Mission Impossible 2, total disaster.) However the action in Windtalkers is very disappointing. During a head on charge over open ground, thousands of American troops are subject to intense fire from an entrenched enemy. Thousands of Japanese soldiers have a clear view of their targets, and are firing like madmen, yet somehow, very few Americans go down. It seemed the only way they could be killed was by a nearby artillery piece. Other problems with the action include shaky cameras, reloading problems, (see goofs) and seemingly endless action scenes.<br/><br/>Now to add on to lousy action and non-existent plot, is the acting. Canadian actor Adam Beach acts Nicholas Cage off the screen, who appears to have one facial expression the entire length of the film. Roger Willie also does a good job has Ben Yahzee's (Beach) friend. Other then those two, most of the actors look like they are just reading cue cards.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I did enjoy some portions of this film. Being a bit of a history buff, the few minutes of historical explanation were nice. The Navajo traditions that were told in detail were also quite interesting. I was also impressed that the Navajo weren't made out to be savages or ""in gins"" as one racist soldier refers to them as, but real people. A nice change from John Wayne westerns.<br/><br/>So all in all, unless you like poorly done, constant action, dismal acting, (with a few exceptions) and nonexistent plot, this is one to skip."

","John Woo does a fantastic job conveying the horrors of World War II, especially in the graphic scenes of people being killed or wounded. However, he also does a great job in relating the story of the Navajo Codetalkers who helped to save many lives during the war.  Little was known about these brave men who had the unique gift of being able to speak a language totally unknown to the Japanese forces.  We learn that the codetalkers not only spoke in Navajo, but also used code words within the language so that even if the Japanese could translate the Navajo language, they still would not know what was being talked about.  As I said before, once you get past the gore, you are presented with a story of bravery, honor and courage that finally does justice to a group of Americans who offered a ""special gift"" to their country.

","The one shining light in this movie was Adam Beach. His performance was moving and honest. I could not have asked for more from a lead character (ahem, Mr. Cage).<br/><br/>There are many, many things wrong with this movie. My favourite is the astoundingly awful cinematography. At one point in time it appears that footage of a navy destroyer has been cut directly from a 1950s war movie. The colour is awful, the footage is grainy. It entirely does not match the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting, besides the aforementioned performance of Beach, was atrocious. Nicholas Cage does some sort of Rambo with emotional issues thing that totally does not work here.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Just saw this last night, and my God, was this awful! I went into this one with extremely high hopes, being a die-hard John Woo fan, not to mention a casual Nicolas Cage fan as well. I walked out of this movie seething with disappointment and rage. How could it have gone so horribly wrong? It had everything it needed to be good - an interesting story, a great director, a good cast, a killer trailer, and a fair amount of good buzz. How then, could it have gone so wrong?<br/><br/>Where to begin about this film's faults? Perhaps it's the length. Perhaps it's the needless, pointless, illogical romance between Nicolas Cage and the Hawaiian nurse (who's name I'm not even sure we were told). Perhaps it's the weak battle scenes.<br/><br/>That last sentence is perhaps what bothered me the most about this film. Like I've already said - I'm a die-hard John Woo fan. As most film fans know, John Woo is the penultimate action director - if you don't believe me, check out Face/Off, Mission Impossible 2, The Killer, Hard Boiled or A Better Tomorrow. Those films all had memorable action sequences that blew the viewer away. The action in Windtalkers was a step below the kind of trash that Michael Bay makes. Take any of the so-called ""epic"" battle scenes in Windtalkers, after leaving the theater, could you even remember any of them? The only thing I remember was stock footage used during what could have been a balls-to-the-wall naval to land battle. Another problem I had with the battle scenes was that they were too fast and too muddled. I couldn't tell who was killed and who wasn't. In every scene it seemed as though every Marine was being blown away, yet when the smoke cleared, there was still a tremendous amount left.<br/><br/>Another problem was the amount of cliches used in this movie. Now I know that cliches are in every movie, regardless of what we wish to believe, but this film in particular was loaded with the most I've seen in a long time. You could see what was going to happen ninety minutes before it happened. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Also, after watching the trailers and reading up on this film, who didn't know that Nicolas Cage was going to die protecting his Navajo Codetalker? ***SPOILER ALERT*** The only surprise -- albeit a mild one at that -- was the death of Christian Slater and his Codetalker. But by the time this happened, I was too bored and inattentive to even care.<br/><br/>The characters in this film were so cardboard and uninteresting that it's not even funny. Take the moronic racist who has a change of heart halfway through the film. Take the cowardly Greek who gets some sort of courage towards the end. Take Nicolas Cage who starts out a bitter, world-weary veteran who's been through hell and lived to tell about it (yawn), who gets a second outlook on life after spending time with and getting to like his Codetalker. Take Christian Slater who kept popping in and out of the movie so much, that I almost forgot he was even in the film. I am aware that war movies are all cliched and slightly cheesy, but c'mon, didn't Saving Private Ryan teach Hollywood something? At least in that film we had characters whom he cared about, and were generally distraught when they died. Who didn't almost tear up as Tom Hanks lay dying?<br/><br/>Finally, my last complaints about this film was the moronic training montage. Everybody knows that montages should show gradual progression throughout a few minutes of quick cuts and dissolves. Hell, even South Park did a frickin' song about it! How then, are we supposed to buy the bull-[expletive deleted] training sequence that's supposed to show us how the two Codetalkers are so smart? They only show them getting two questions correct! That's right -- TWO QUESTIONS!!! Sweet mama pajama, is that not insane? Christ, the movie was long anyways, what would another five minutes of clarity hurt?<br/><br/>All in all this was a bad movie that I would not recommend to anyone. This stinker is right up there with Pearl Harbor as one of the most moronic and pathetic war movies ever made. I'm giving this one a higher score since it's not as long as the bladder busting Pearl Harbor, but story and content wise, they're both equally bad. Also, I pray that the reason this film was so bad was because of studio interference. I hope that John Woo has not lost it and become yet another hack. I guess only time will truly tell.<br/><br/>Out of a possible * * * *, I'm going to have to give this one a *."

"maccaveili","4","0","1","15 June 2002"," Nicholas Cage??? Why him??? Very under achieving....
","Ok first of all, I am not going to sugar coat any of this. I went with my girlfriend and spent over $20 expecting a good 2+ hours of entertainment, and what I got was ripped off!!!  If I had been at home watching this on dvd, I'd have turned it off and finished it sometime other than a Friday night, like say a Tuesday afternoon when there is nothing else to do. We had deliberated for a bit about whether to see Insomnia, Enough or The Bourne Identity, and about half way through the movie, I couldn't help but wonder how much more entertained I'd have been at any one of those than I currently was.  Not that I think there are many movies worth spending $14 on (not counting snacks) to see in a theater, but at least I wouldn't have been sitting there comparing Windtalkers to Saving Private Ryan and wondering why nobody else can make a war movie as compelling as Spielberg and Tom Hanks combined to do.<br/><br/>When the movie first started, the camera spanned across the beautiful desert landscape in Arizona where the Navajo Indians lived, while the background music was reminiscent of that in the beginning of Saving Private Ryan in the cemetery scene. It was at this point that I took in the moment believing that what I was about to watch would be one of those rare movies that you never forget about as long as you live.  It opened by zooming in on Adam Beach, soon to be Private Ben Yahzee, holding his baby son just before joining a bus load of Navajo Indians who were all heading off to the Marines to learn the ""code"" based on the Navajo language.  On the bus, Roger Willie, soon to be Private Charles Whitehorse, was introduced as a friend of Yahzee's who you could tell right off the bat was only in the movie to play that proverbial good natured, wiser, older fellow who has a good sense of humor to give us some comedy relief. You know what I mean, that character that the audience is suppose to relate to and like, who almost always dies in the end in some weak attempt to make us shed a tear.  Not that he does die or not, but at this point in the movie that is what I was thinking....I wont give away any individual's destination here in case you still want to waste your money on this Hollywood piece of crap for some reason.<br/><br/>In the next scene, we are introduced to Nicholas Cage's character, Joe Enders. It really catches the audience off guard the way the semi automatic rattles off a series of shots unexpectedly, startling everyone in the theater and getting some follow up chuckles afterwards from those who jumped out of their seats the highest.  I believe that this was the high point in the movie unfortunately, as never again did anything get a rise out of me or get my heart pounding like that did.<br/><br/>Anyways, in this scene Cage plays a Marine (Enders) who fell into command for the first time ever after the former commander lost his life in the heat of the battle.  Enders refuses to retreat and continues to obey the order which is to hold a useless piece of swamp land at the end of nowhere with the Japanese closing in everywhere.  Even despite everyone begging him and pleading to retreat, seeing that they were all going to die if they stayed, he just orders them to hold their position thus everyone but Enders, somehow of course, ends up dead.  But not until a very cheesy one liner by a friend of his as he takes several bullets in the back while Enders was face to face with him trying to pull him up over a barrier to safety.  As Ender's friend is dying, he looks Enders in the eyes and calls him a son of a bitch.  Of course then, this ends up haunting Enders for the rest of the movie, as he later blames himself (original isn't it) for everyone dying, despite the fact he was just following orders.  At this point I think I knew that the movie was headed for mediocrity at best, and I was only 10 minutes into it. Sad.<br/><br/>I could go on in more detail but what's the point, I think you see where this is going.  If you've seen even one preview for this movie then you already know that it is Sgt Ender's (Cage) job to protect the code at any cost, even if it means executing the ""Windtalker"" (Private Yahzee) if it looks like he is going to fall into enemy hands.  Do I even have to spell out how this movie ends?  In the beginning of the movie he lets his men die while being the lone survivor, and it haunts him forever.  Then in the end he has a decision to make about the lives of his men once again.  It doesn't take a Harvard graduate to see how it ends. Very predictable and boring, let me tell you.<br/><br/>I didn't like at all how they made every piece of artillery be as accurate as you could possibly imagine.  Every time the camera zoomed in on some artillery as it was being fired, the target ALWAYS got hit, no matter what. And according to this movie, almost every Japanese soldier was too uncoordinated to shoot anyone before the Americans shot them first, even if the Japanese soldiers had a 5 second head start advantage.  If this is how it was in real life then I don't know what took so long to end the war. There is nothing like having a dozen Japanese soldiers with machine guns jumping out of everywhere on all sides of Nicholas Cage and every other co-star in the movie, only to have Cage or someone else pull out a pistol or a knife and kill all of the Japanese first.  Great job Hollywood.<br/><br/>Just for the record, Nicholas Cage did NOT, I say did NOT, sell me on being a Marine in any way, shape or form. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any actor that would have been worse for that lead role.  He should stick to roles like he had in the Family Man.<br/><br/>Actually, I don't care what actor you get to play Sgt Enders, the movie shouldn't have revolved around him and his haunting flashbacks where he got everyone killed in the beginning of the movie.  It was called Windtalkers, thus you'd think that the movie would have been centered around the Navajo Indians that served the United States as Marines.  Nicholas Cage's character was about as uncompelling as you could get, and I was shocked that the movie was centered so much around him.  It didn't help either that Cage acted like the guy he played in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" in between battles.  Even though it was called Windtalkers, it seemed as though the Navajo's who were the ""windtalkers"" were almost a sidenote to Sgt. Enders' plight to redeem himself in the war.  The movie should have been called ""Sgt. Enders"", seriously.  They had a great concept with the Navajo language being used as a code that the Japanese couldn't crack, but they mucked it up with a predictable story line that didn't even really delve into the Navajo's importance in the war.<br/><br/>One other thing, I was very bored with how outlandish Hollywood made every explosion seem.  They'd zoom in on the artillery that was firing on something, then cut away to the target, then we'd see the target explode in slow motion way too often as they were really trying to overdo every explosion.  Hey Hollywood, when are you going to stop trying to make up for a lack of a compelling story line and actors that can pull it off, with fiery, loud explosions and slow motion takes of people flailing through the air?  And they could have done away with all the symphonic background music behind every battle.  Did they not learn anything from Saving Private Ryan? It is better to just leave that background music out of the picture, cause I want to feel like I am a part of the picture like I did with Saving Private Ryan.  I don't think the soldiers who were there in real life were listening to an orchestra playing in the background, picking up momentum as they gained leverage on the enemy.  I hate that crap so bad.  Too much Hollywood for me.<br/><br/>One final note - The acting in this movie was some of the worst I've ever seen, aside from Adam Beach who played Private Ben Yahzee, the main windtalker, and  Roger Willie who played the other windtalker.  They were the only actors who looked natural as everyone else just looked like they were just standing there waiting for the camera to scroll over to them so they could say their one liner when it was their turn.<br/><br/>
Very under achieving, very disappointing.  The idea of doing a movie about how the Navajo's contributed to winning the war by using their native language to encrypt the Americans' code was great.  Too bad the movie didn't actually revolve around that."

","Terrible Movie. You think you're going to see some great work from John Woo, but the movie lays an egg. The problem is the script. It goes absolutely nowhere, and this leaves Woo scrambling for ideas to entertain, and all he comes up with is long overdrawn battle scenes that really don't particularly go anywhere. The basic idea is America during WWII has developed a new code which is based upon navajo speech. Great Idea! This sounds like a great movie! The only problem is the movie could do without the idea of a 'code' entirely; or plot for that matter. This is further proof that large sums of money and bad production create movies that make you snore with far greater efficacy."

","A typical John Woo movie with action in place of story, scenes that go on forever, and dialogue that tells you what you should be thinking.  The only thing missing was John Woo's signature white dove -- or did I miss it?<br/><br/>This was not a movie about Windtalkers, but was instead about a very messed up character who drags a nice Navajo soldier down into his own private purgatory.  Other characters are cardboard cut outs created to speak a line or make a point.<br/><br/>But since we didn't have any more than an hour of story, John fills the remaining 1:20 with painfully long battle scenes.  By the end of each scene your nerves are so raw from the close scenes, quick cuts and loud gun fire and explosions that you need a break.  Don't count on the break being long, though, because another long battle is just over the next hill.<br/><br/>How many times can you see Nicholas Cage spraying machine gun fire at a group of jumping, rolling, tripping, dying Japanese before it becomes old? The answer is undoubtedly a few numbers short of the times that John Woo repeats that scene is Windtalkers.<br/><br/>Please, God, send a white dove to save this movie from its purgatory and put it our of our misery."

I thought that a movie starring Cage directed by John Woo would be great, especially since I thought they went great together in Face/Off, but I was mistaken.

","The land war against the Japanese in World War II essentially was a series of island campaigns. Most were waged on small pieces of coral real estate where numbingly brutal carnage took place. No quarter was asked for or given and tactics for both sides essentially meant repetitive and costly frontal assaults. Maneuver was irrelevant.<br/><br/>                              Three major campaigns involving relatively significant land areas - Saipan, Okinawa and the re-taking of the Philippines - provided the opportunity for maneuver based upon exploiting battlefield intelligence. While victory was never in doubt in these campaigns, minimizing casualties and ending operations as quickly as possible was only possible through well-coordinated all-services operations.<br/><br/>                              ""Windtalkers"" brings to the screen what the Department of Defense maintained as classified information until 1968 - the role of Navajos serving in the Marine Corps who relayed front line information to artillery batteries, warships and tactical air assets by radio in their native language. Lacking most of the words that described the panoply of death-dealing ordnance, the Native American Marines came up with neologisms that permitted accurate information to be swiftly and succinctly transmitted.<br/><br/>                              ""Windtalkers"" is the celluloid monument to these brave Marines who voluntarily joined the Corps, most coming from reservations and life experiences that hardly supported the intense patriotism these men showed. Their role was important although arguably less so than as depicted in the movie.<br/><br/>                              Fearful that a captured ""windtalker"" would give away the unique code if captured, each was assigned a Marine bodyguard.  In the film the bodyguard is charged with killing his Navajo windtalker, something that survivors claim was never part of the operation.<br/><br/>                              Nicholas Cage, in his second World War II movie since his foolish role as the Puccini-loving Captain Corelli (""Captain Corelli's Mandolin""), gives a vivid and intense performance as Sergeant Joe Enders, a man who found a home in the Corps before the war. Already blooded and wounded - physically and emotionally - by earlier fighting he is ordered to be the minder for Private Ben Yahzee, well played by Adam Beach.<br/><br/>                              A great deal of fighting follows, actually too much. A bit of judicious editing would have removed some of the battle scenes that by their repetitiveness numbs rather than impresses. While the theme of the film - the belated recognition of Navajos in a unique role - is new to the screen, ""Windtalkers"" follows closely in the wake of many World War II movies and especially those honoring the Marine Corps. Enders is much more sensitive than John Wayne in ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" but he's a noncom any filmgoer has seen many, many times.<br/><br/>                              Enders's squad also reflects the usual cinematic re-creation of a combat unit. Italian, Greek, Irish - from the East and the West Coast - everyone is here (except, curiously the almost ubiquitous war movie token Jew). As to personalities, yep, there's that big time bigot, the guy who loves kids, the fellow who misses his wife so much, the would-be post-war local tycoon.<br/><br/>                              But the movie works. And it works because it matters that a film shows THIS generation the power, decency and most of all raw courage and determination of World War II fighters. The Marines may be the almost exclusive combatants here but service members of all the forces are reflected in the heroism and humanity shown here. Director John Woo has given a gift of love to his adopted country and I say ""thanks.""<br/><br/>                              Before the end titles rolled I would have liked to see a screen telling viewers that many Indians served in the Pacific and not only as windtalkers (this is mentioned in one passing sentence in the film). It would also have been nice to tell (not remind, in all likelihood) folks that Native American combat veterans returned, in the main, to reservations in worse shape than much of the conquered Axis territory, to an indifferent and even hostile public and government, to little hope and too much alcohol. But I guess I may want too much.<br/><br/>                              I don't understand why this film's release was held up because of 11 September. The uncomplicated but powerful patriotism of ""Windtalkers"" would have been as accepted - and more importantly, needed - then as it is now.<br/><br/>                              James Horner scored the film and the music is ridiculously intrusive. Can't Hollywood trust viewers to be gripped by scenes of desperate combat without a boring score accompanying banzai charges?<br/><br/>                              See this film on its own terms and be grateful for all who have served in wartime."
"The Grizzle","1","0","2","18 May 2002"," Bad Beyond Words
","The war movie genre typically centers around an attempt to enlighten the general public about the horrors of war, which no one could ever possibly imagine without having physically fought in one himself. While no movie can fully capture the depth and depravity faced by those engaged in combat, some do a better job of it than others.  Windtalkers, while attempting to do justice to a true story, simply presents vain images and poorly-directed scenes that any avid movie watcher should see as a disgrace to the men on whom the story is based.  Although I doubt that I would be giving anything away that isn't completely obvious from the movie's start, I will still warn that there are very mild spoilers present in the following review.<br/><br/>After the main characters are presented and the conflicts have begun, it is entirely obvious how the movie will end;  you know who dies and who doesn't, and the plot follows that of the typical entry into this genre.  War movies are hardly ever about the final result, however, but instead about the journey the characters embark on and the emotional transitions they exhibit along the way.  In Windtalkers, unfortunately the journey is unremarkable, and the characters don't change.  The `emotional drama' is played out like that of a weak soap opera, and many of the characters serve no purpose in the story except to detract from the movie's true focus.  It almost seems like the writers were so preoccupied with adding unnecessary characters that they forgot to give any character to the movie itself.<br/><br/>Adding to my disappointment with the characters in the movie were the all-around weak performances given by the actors.  Christian Slater, while not speaking in a monotone voice typical of Keanu Reeves, still manages to achieve monotony by uttering throughout the entire movie an annoying, contrived Southern accent and (as usual) gives the worst performance.  Even Nicolas Cage demonstrates his ineptitude for highly emotional roles, and Adam Beach manages to embody little of the glory and honor he should.  The result of these lackluster characters is a series of unintentionally humorous scenes, the worst being a `getting to know you' moment where Slater sits down to play a harmonica along with the elderly Navajo man playing a whistle.  In addition, everyone apparently is compelled to share a boring memory of his grandpa or reminisce about the good times he had with his wife, and these touchy-feely scenes become too predictably spaced after the first eight or nine the viewer is forced to sit through.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in Windtalkers are no better.  Each tries to capture the power and feeling accomplished in good war movies like Saving Private Ryan, yet all pale in comparison.  Due to blatantly obvious special effects, the images of warships that look like black and white documentaries from the 1960s, and screams so fake they make low-budget horror movies seem like Oscar material, I can't think of a war movie in which combat was so poorly directed.<br/><br/>Amid all the fallibilities of this movie, one would still expect some sort of moral theme to transcend.  Nothing, however, could be further from the truth.  The closest the moviemakers come to providing a reason for this film's production is the banal idea of friendship against all odds.  Such a `theme' has been used countless times in movies, and thus it comes across as redundant and cheesy.  In fact, cheesy is how I'd describe the entire movie, as I've seen episodes of the Ninety and Nine Club that were more realistic and touching.  To be fair, under competent hands, the movie might have provided an adequate entry into a genre that has long been flooded, but as it stands, Windtalkers is a journey you'll soon want to forget."

","Windtalkers was a good war movie.  I didn't glorify the war but it did show how the US did turn to a people that we had in the past ignored.  I also don't belive the that movie depicted exactly what had happened but I do belive it showed how much of a valued contribution the Navajo Indians did provide the US military during World War II.  I belive it was a film that should have been made a long time ago.  <br/><br/>The effects were good and the acting strong, although it could have been improved some.  Plot line was also strong and I did not see anything in the film that was not possible.  This one is not for kids though as it does have some graphic war scenes in it.  <br/><br/>Over all, worth your while (8 out of 10)."
"jmh2350","5","0","1","19 July 2002"," Too low profile on native Americans, too high a body count
","This is a very uneven movie, because it seems John Woo can't make up his mind about telling a truly compelling tale about the critical role that some native American soldiers played in WWII, or bombarding the hell out of the audience with repetitious and, ultimately tedious action, or telling us a tale about a dysfunctional human being (Cage) who becomes a highly functional Marine who becomes conflicted.  Woo also borrows too many old WWII movie cliches, shows us the same type of explosion scenes over and over and over and over, and even makes a critical casting mistake with Peter Stormare as a Marine Corps gunnery sergeant (Peter can't overcome his thick Swedish accent).  Thank goodness for the gentle, understated acting abilities of the real native American actors cast in this movie, and a little welcome gung-ho swagger from Christian Slater, which are the only things that got me through this one."
"Wiseguy32","Null","0","1","6 July 2002"," Windtalkers (2002) - **1/2 (out of ****)
","PLOT:  Set during World War II (and mostly taking place in the Japanese island of Saipan), Marine Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) is a man haunted by his past war experiences.  Now recovering from his injuries, he is given a new mission:  he is to be partnered up with Navajo codetalker Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), and he is to protect the code at all costs, even if it means killing Yahzee if he is to fall into enemy hands. Another man ordered to protect a codetalker is Sergeant Ox Anderson (Christian Slater), who is paired up with Private Charles Whitehorse (Roger Willie). Other characters include the racist Chick (Noah Emmerich) and nurse Rita (Frances O'Connor), who writes to Joe constantly.<br/><br/>MY TAKE:  Windtalkers is another in a long line of realistic, graphic war films (mostly inspired by 1998's Saving Private Ryan).  A great movie can still be made that can live up to Saving Private Ryan - We Were Soldiers was released earlier this year, and that was a terrific film.  Windtalkers, unfortunately, doesn't live up.  The battle scenes are all very good, but on a deeper emotional level, Windtalkers fails.  The movie tries to deal with racism a little bit, but none of it is truly effective.  We never get to know how useful the Navajo code was to our victory during the second World War;  it's only a sidestory that we barely see.  Another sidestory is the romantic interest for Enders (nurse Rita), but that should've been scrapped altogether.  After Enders goes to Saipan, we never see her again, and we only have letters to remind us that she's evidently still in the movie. However, you can't fault the performances - there are a lot of good ones. Nicolas Cage does an excellent job of showing Enders's emotional and psychological scars, and it's easily his best performance as of late. Adam Beach is also effective, and Enders and Yahzee do show some chemistry together.  Christian Slater and Roger Willie, while not getting as much screentime, are also good.  Overall, Windtalkers is a good film, but it didn't leave much of an impact for me."
"modamag","8","0","1","4 July 2002"," Portrays the horrors of the Pacific battles vividly...
","There are two things that a person can do in the face of evil; overcome it, or join it. John Woo's latest epic, Windtalkers brings to the screen a story that's inspired by true events where humanity faces such a challenge. The movie captures the horrors of humanity in the face of war. Make no mistake, war wears a human face. It's just not humane.<br/><br/>During World War II, encrypted communication was a strategic key in the U.S. struggle to beat the Japanese. The United States used the Navajo Code Talkers, or ""windtalkers"" and their language since it provided the most secure method of communication in their operations in the Pacific. Two U.S. Marines (Nicolas Cage, Christian Slater) are assigned to protect  the Navajo Marines. More so, they are assigned to ""protect the code at all costs."" This means that if they are to face possible capture on Japanese soil, the two U.S. Marines must kill their windtalkers.<br/><br/>Straight away limbs, feet, hands and heads are chopped off and blown apart mercilessly right in front of your very eyes. You also see Nicolas Cage shouting in agony due to the death of his friend, while bullets mysterious ly stop. The atmosphere of the fighting sequences in the film is established greatly through sound. If this film deserves an Oscar in one department, that's sound. The sound creates a sensation of tremendous realism. The bullets seem to whizz past you at rapid speeds and at times you can't help but wonder if they hit the person sitting behind you. Then you realize that you're the one who's been hit. Or so the sound suggests.<br/><br/>""Windtalkers"" portrays the horrors of the Pacific battles vividly and no side seems right as long as they have a gun in their hand. The movie is filled of disturbing scenes of mankind at its worst. T.S. Elliot's ""The Hollow Man"" is about men who believe in nothing. The Marines appear at a position of reasonable comparison with such hollow men. Often they do not know what they believe in, so they believe in nothing. At many times, not even life.<br/><br/>Such men are represented by fairly talented cast members. Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater do a very decent job. This is not the best performance of their career, but nevertheless a solid one. They both capture the essence of the two characters, although the later one lacks character development in the script, thus not allowing for Slater's expansion. Frances O'Connor is a very minor supporting character, but even with the little screen time that she has, it's evident that she is in possession of amazing range. Canadian born Adam Beach breaks through in what most likely accounts for his largest leading role. He breaths of freshness, comfort and chrisma.<br/><br/>
The real problems with the film start with plausibility. Nicolas Cage kills seemingly hundreds of Japanese at times with his gun, bullets fly above for 2 hours and 15 minutes without hitting the main actors and soldiers reflect in the middle of a fire fight. It's also difficult to see why Cage's character has a sudden shift in outlook. The emotional journey of most of the other characters is fairly untold as well. The problems continue with predictable and cheesy moments, ideas that have been borrowed from previous resources, and a few pretentious moments.<br/><br/>As it stands, Windtalkers consists of great visuals and sound effects, good direction, a heart and an interesting story told by a cast of equal velour. The action, choreography, creativity and story truly allow you to feel the brutality of the war. It's unfortunate that all the fallibilities along the way detract from what could have been a great movie in a genre that's not so wonderful.<br/><br/>Grade: B [7/10]"

OK, I found a nitpick. The story showed not only battle but emotion and only had one bad line by Chick, right out of Tucker. ""Someday fifty years from now we might be friends with these people.""
