","There's another version of ""The Witch"" that could've existed. A Puritan family in New England gets terrified by a witch living in the woods, who torments them with supernatural Satanism. If you're saying to yourself, ""wait, isn't that exactly what this movie is?"" then you've come to the right review.<br/><br/>I'm not what you'd call a fan of horror movies. I don't gravitate toward the genre and I almost never seek horror movies out in theaters. That said, any movie that garners critical acclaim or positive buzz piques my interest as a fan of cinema on the whole. ""The Witch"" lives in that territory as a horror movie for cinephiles, not for audiences who love the thrill of a good scare.<br/><br/>That's not to say ""The Witch"" isn't scary; it is. It's just not scary in the modern trend-driven, formulaic, ""movie trailer that ends with a jump-scare"" kind of way. Writer and director Robert Eggers, who makes his feature film debut, builds his terror with tension drama and mystery, not by creating the pervasive sense that some creepy thing will pop into the frame at any moment.<br/><br/>Eggers, a production designer first and foremost, builds his ""Puritan nightmare"" from the ground up, starting with all the tiniest era-appropriate details in the set, costumes and even dialogue. It doesn't take a historian to notice the immaculate craftsmanship and consideration of time and place. Eggers' devotion to this realism pays off in that the ""The Witch"" never loses its footing in reality even as more supernatural elements creep into the story. Well, until the end, but let's not go there except to say that by then, the realism matters much less.<br/><br/>The story follows a Puritan family that leaves its plantation and village over religious differences and goes off to build a home near the edge of the woods. Suddenly, the family infant, Sam, disappears under the watch of the eldest child, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). The incident devastates the mother (Kate Dickie) and father (Ralph Ineson), who convince everyone it was a wolf that took Sam, but the tragedy trickles down to the four children, Thomasin, pre-teen Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) and young twins Jonas and Mercy. Of course, the audience is privy to what actually happened to Sam, and we know things will only get worse for the family.<br/><br/>Considering the legitimate Puritan fear of Satan and witches, the subsequent events begin to tear into the family dynamics, which adds to the tension that already exists over what unnerving thing might happen next. The story could definitely have gone deeper into distrust and paranoia, but then it might have become too much of a ""witch trial"" movie.<br/><br/>The way the movie ends will draw no shortage of opinions, but without a doubt, Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke have made an and utterly engrossing film that would be just as effective had it just been a period drama instead of a horror film – from a visual standpoint. Blaschke works almost exclusively with available natural light, which in addition to bolstering Eggers' emphasis on realism, keeps the specter of darkness and evil hanging over the family. In fact, had the film not marketed itself so overtly as a horror film, it might have been given more awards consideration. <br/><br/>Regardless, Eggers delivers a remarkable feature debut that's a definite breakthrough candidate; he will certainly have a lot of eyes on his future projects. His focus on detail and strong cinematic instincts could work wonders on a more mainstream project, but if he opts for more small-budget genre films, no complaints here.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Period pieces don't often serve as the backdrops for horror, which is actually a real shame. Consider The Witch, a story about a banished Puritan family trying to sustain itself on the edge of an ominous forest inhabited by a gruesome witch. The faithful representation of one of the most creepy time periods in American history makes all the difference here. The family's dealings with the supernatural terror in the woods push their spiritual and physical endurance to the breaking point. Robert Eggers pulls no punches and makes no apologies in this film. The Witch's scenes are steeped in primal dread, and each actor makes the audience feel the seams come apart as paranoia and mistrust begin to take their toll. While Game of Thrones alumni Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie offer brilliantly raw performances as the family's mother and father, it's the film's younger actors—Harvey Scrimshaw and Anya Taylor-Joy—who really shine. Scrimshaw captures the nuanced turmoil of being an adolescent male in a strictly religious family. As the oldest daughter who is blamed for the witch's malevolent deeds against the family, Anya Taylor-Joy shows a surprising amount of risk and range in her performance. The film swings for the fences on all fronts. The performances are explosive, the tension is gut-wrenching, and the settings are nightmarish. To the horror films of 2015, the gauntlet has officially been thrown down. –Alex Springer"
"punishable-by-death","Null","365","547","21 October 2015"," As good as psychological horror gets
","I feel like I can't come up with the right words to describe this incredible movie, but I'll try. The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The acting is bang-on and you don't know when or how it is going to end. The movie doesn't have 'twists' exactly, but the way it is written keeps you guessing constantly. And I personally loved the ending. Though the potential is there to use a more standard approach, The Witch however opts to go down a more subtle avenue, leading to the true nature of religious persecution that is on full display here. Additionally, elements of the story have been taken from historical documents, adding another layer of grimness. The supernatural elements are obviously up for discussion, but that these tales were written centuries ago somehow adds more to this disturbing film.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1630, in New England, America. A Puritan family is banished from town for their beliefs (or it at least seems this way, perhaps based on real events). They are forced to move to a farm that feels like it is on the edge of the world, as from the opening the woods that line the farm are presented in ominous fashion, almost creating a character that could serve as the scariest element of the film. What exactly goes on in there? Why can't the children venture inside? Suddenly, without warning, tragedy strikes. The family clings to their faith to prevent them from starving as their crops die; with nothing they can do to prevent it.<br/><br/>The period is an appropriate choice given how humans treated each other centuries ago, and an ideal setting for a horror tale. Some conversations require a little more attention, as the characters speak in 'ye olde English' which takes a little getting used to, but it adds another layer of mystery as the family is struck by more inexplicable hardships, causing them to become wary of each other, which in turn leaves them in a increasingly vulnerable state. I can't say I is scared, but I do know that I is gripping the armrests pretty hard for most of the film. Hell, they manage to make a scene where a man is hunting a rabbit seem tense and creepy! Additionally, this is not for inattentive viewers; I could see clock-watching all around me. The incredible camera-work almost reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson in There Will Be Blood, with many long takes, often slowly panning or zooming in. There is also a focus on facial close-ups reminiscent of Bergman, all of which is a feast to watch on an IMAX screen. The score matches this camera-work almost to perfection, while there is often a lengthy silence between dialogue to contrast the tense music. It also must be mentioned that the child actors really shine, out-doing their older counterparts.<br/><br/>This really is my sort of horror film. No jump-scares, convincing acting and a focus on a dark, foreboding atmosphere rather than the grotesque and bloody. This is another of those films I would label as a psychological thriller, as the supernatural horrors are kept almost completely out of view as we witness the downfall of a family who are all affected, turning on each other as their faith is truly tested.<br/><br/>This film couldn't have catered to my interests more; I can't recommend it to everybody, but if you go in with no preconceived notions you'll be in for a tasty, if not nasty surprise. The suspense is almost unparalleled among recent films, and the 'horror' genre conventions are cleverly subverted to deliver a film that is better than 'It Follows' while being a completely different film. In addition to all this, there is much to take in thematically if you are so inclined Hell, I'd love to see this again to do just that.<br/><br/>www.epilepticmoondancer.net"

","If people from the 17th Century could make a film about their deepest darkest horrors - it would look a lot like this movie! The Witch engrosses you in the time and place of its setting, it's a family drama, a horror and a folk tale. All interwoven together into a macabre ode of the times when people were frightened of the primeval darkness of the forests and the inexplicable twists of their wretched fates. Intense and gripping from the very beginning. With some of the most amazing acting I've seen by the youngest cast members. Fantastic movie for horror fans and a masterful period piece. I would recommend it highly to horror fans and fans of history and good cinema in general."
"avdropm-944-921852","8","208","321","2 March 2016"," Summary:
","This is a story set in the early colonial period of New England. It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time.<br/><br/>The characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial town. They also have period Calvinist attitudes, and the storytelling doesn't present an outsider's view of this or offer a modern commentary, but instead it just displays these attitudes and tells a story from the characters' standpoint.<br/><br/>Their reliance on period folklore means that it doesn't strictly follow modern horror movie tropes, either. It has the slow build of a modern psychological horror/thriller as well as the standard formula where tragedies start from tragic flaws, but the traditions it's drawing on depend on a Calvinist's conception of flaws, and treat witchcraft as a horrible, well-understood occurrence rather than a shocking supernatural surprise. This story applies these perspectives.<br/><br/>It's very well done in terms of writing, acting, and other aspects of execution, so it might have cross-over appeal to fans of horror, folklore, or straight period drama from colonial America."

","This is what I call a good movie. But it is not for everyone. After seeing the trailer, lots of people thought they get a horror spectacle. I'll never understand why, because the trailer itself is very slow, just like the whole movie.<br/><br/>The movies has a slow pace but its still intense. And it will only feel intense if you give in and not wait for action and speed. This movie is no Hollywood spectacle.<br/><br/>The movie feels like a depiction of real life. No stupid jokes and exaggerated action scenes. Slow and calm dialogues. I liked the way the witch was enacted too. I am happy to see that she is not shown as a crazy woman jumping around eating toads.<br/><br/>On the other side, I wished there would have been a deeper insight into the witches thoughts.<br/><br/>So... go and see if you want more than silly Hollywood witches."
"my_anywhere","8","207","338","18 February 2016"," Great Atmosphere, Great Sound, Different Kind of Movie
","I found ""The Witch"" to be a generally unnerving film, and one which--though I would not place it in the pantheon of scariest flicks I've ever seen--had some moments that I'll not easily forget.<br/><br/>The atmosphere Eggers creates alone is enough to wrench serious dread from scenes other directors would be otherwise unable to make even remarkable. The score, too, helps cull this dark tone and adds life to a film that can be borderline tedious.<br/><br/>That being said, ""The Witch"" is not for everyone. It is strange, slow but steady, gruesome at points, and almost un-watchable at others. There are two sides to this film; one which I had hoped the director would stick to concerning the family and their struggle with religion and isolation; and another which plays as an undercurrent to most of the film and then takes charge in the end. Sadly, it is this second side which keeps me from giving the film a better score, and that ultimately hurts the film in the very final scene.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""The Witch"" and its originality. Eggers has achieved a film that, for all its low-budget and independent film background, feels richer and better made than many horror entries of late. Should you decide to see it, a word of caution: do not expect a fast-paced movie full of jump scares and creepy crawlies emerging left and right. As the opening credits remind the audience, this is a folktale. One that does not shy away from exploring the real dark places."
"drownnnsoda","9","194","325","19 February 2016"," Calvinist terrors abound in this fraught ""folk tale""
","""The Witch"" charts a family of Calvinist dissenters in colonial America who are exiled from their community and homestead at the edge of an ominous forest. When the infant child of the family disappears inexplicably, a chain of increasingly bizarre events lead to claims of witchcraft and sorcery that implode the family.<br/><br/>Based on the plot summary, much about ""The Witch"" seems fairly predictable, and that's because it is. Robert Eggers makes no bones about reality or superstition here; this is, as it is branded, a ""New England folktale"" through and through. It's also allegorical on some levels, and is about an English family's failure to conquer the vast American frontier. Regardless of how it is read, the film's surface plays out like classic accounts of witchcraft and superstition that pervaded Puritan Calvinism in the seventeenth century.<br/><br/>What director Eggers does here is weave a taut and unsettling narrative through a series of meditative visuals and haunting encounters with evil--some have said not much happens in the film, and they're right--but is that the point of such a tale? The story is mediated through phenomenal performances that are the real emotional center of the film, while rare but fantastical occurrences with the supernatural jar the audience as much they do the family.<br/><br/>Eggers' direction is remarkable, and the cinematography consistently captures the gloom of a New England winter; close-ups show the younger children engaging with their ominous farm goat, while pans of characters venturing into the woods create a legitimate sense of danger--and that is another of the film's prevailing themes. In the film, the threat of danger lurks in all matter, be it in the natural environment, in doctrine, or the horrifying corporeal locus where the two meet.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Witch"" is a surprising and moody entry in the horror genre for 2016; it is not only recalling classicism in its period setting and narrative, but also in its cinematic approach to storytelling. It is old-fashioned in just about every way, but is no less masterful at creeping into the skin as insidiously as evil does within the family. We feel their terror, their desperation, and their yearning for absolution; and that is what makes the film such an effective mood piece. 9/10."
"Ufology","10","114","188","27 January 2017"," A Masterpiece
","I saw this movie a couple of times already and it still lingers in my head everyday. The tone and imagery of this film crawled inside me and nestled itself in my mind like no other had in a long time.<br/><br/>The aspects of the film (lighting, sound, dialog, pacing, composition) created an atmosphere so real I was no longer sitting on my couch watching, but rather living this inherited puritan nightmare. This was the result of a director who not only painstakingly researched every aspect of colonial life in the 1630s, but who also executed his ideas with striking confidence.<br/><br/>Calling this movie scary doesn't due justice to how truly powerful and intense the horror scenes feel. He doesn't hold back, shy away with the camera or use bullshit jump-scares to frighten you. Rather he composes scenes like an artist would a painting. In fact, I would almost say this film could be seen as a Fransisco Goya painting brought to life. He focuses in on the evil at hand, while still maintaining a sense of unknown and wonder. He is brilliant at what he shows you, but more in what he doesn't show.<br/><br/>Films like these don't come around very often. There is true passion seen here by a very hungry, driven and intelligent director. I am truly impressed and hope he has a long and successful career."
"bogdanvalentinneacsa","7","216","372","18 February 2016"," Know what you're getting into!
","To start, just so you know who's actually writing the review. Young fellow here, didn't watch any 'classics' horror movies but I do enjoy horror movies in general as long as they are not just gore type of movies. I'd say my favorite horror movies are The Ring and The Conjuring.<br/><br/>So, past that to The Witch. <br/><br/>I'd start by saying the movie was not what the trailer lead me to believe. This is not as much about scary moments or jump scare and more about a family coping with a lost child, and the movie trying to build suspense and just make the viewer feel uncomfortable. Because of this, I can see why some people will see it as really really slow with not much happening.<br/><br/>Some PLUSES for me: - Anya Taylor-Joy (the older daughter) is amazing in this movie and I also think Ralph Ineson (the father) did a good job. - the score is really really good, there are periods of intense silence and periods of creepy music at just the right times to build tension - the cinematography with nice wide shots combined with the score works really well in most moments<br/><br/>For the MINUSES: - I felt like the other child's acting was pretty bad and over the top and just took me out of the movie in most scenes where they are the focus (thankfully there were not THAT many) - a bit too slow of a pacing during the first half even for my taste<br/><br/>So, just like I said in the title, KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. If you go and expect your typical horror movie with jump scares and a hidden 'baddie' slowly revealing itself along the movie in scary scenes, THIS IS NOT IT. This is mostly a family drama that tries to build suspense and make the viewer feel uneasy.<br/><br/>On a side note, I caught this on a premiere showing with a theatre half full and the occasional comments, coughs and even laughter from some 'individuals' took me out of some moments. If you do want to watch this in the cinemas, I would recommend waiting and going way past premieres and on a awkward day / time so you have the cinema close to empty. Or, if you have a sweet setup at home with a good sound system, I would just watch it at home."
"brchthethird","10","131","231","14 May 2016"," An unnerving, surreal descent into religious paranoia
","THE WITCH is, in a word, unsettling. Horror films don't normally have an effect on me, much less scare me, but this one was unnerving in a very palpable way. It's about a Puritan family who are banished from their village for an unspecified religious offense, and subsequently move to a location bordering a forest. While there, repeated misfortune and isolation create the perfect storm of religious paranoia over whether one or more of them are possessed by the devil. What THE WITCH masterfully does is to create this tense atmosphere and maintain it over nearly the entire length of the film. Whether it be odd/surreal imagery, slow and deliberate camera-work, or an eerie score reminiscent of Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (used in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), all of it is used to brilliant effect and should be capable of rattling even the most seasoned viewer, especially if they have a religious background/upbringing (as I did). In fact, I sensed a lot of Kubrick here; not just 2001, but also THE SHINING. Not surprisingly, they share some thematic elements. The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years."
"tomsuthblack","10","90","163","16 May 2016"," How to drive people insane with guilt and fear? (A detailed manual)
","((Disclaimer: Contains all sorts of spoilers))<br/><br/>Ever wondered where all those wretched creatures who lived solitary lives centuries ago at the edge of towns or deep in the woods came from? All the lonely (and dangerously insane) people known as witches and wizards, were nothing but the stray teenagers, or the stray housewives, driven totally insane by the accumulating sensations of guilt and fear encouraged by the morbid interpretations of the ""Gospel of Love"" which were common only a few centuries ago. Or so claims this wonderful marvel of psychoanalysis. social criticism, and cinematic excellence.<br/><br/>Witch is neither your average boogieman flick, nor the latest trick in survival horror, where the beast (in this case dear Ol'Georgie himself) hunts the hapless victims one by one. It is a much bigger offering than that; an art movie that mastered all the commercial tricks of survival horror, and hid within them a potent social message. <br/><br/>The movie's controlling idea is simple: The prevailing human desire to seek reassurance from a higher power can easily be twisted by ignorance, superstition, psychological insecurities and a horrendous misinterpretation of religion into a culture of self-flogging that nurtures guilt and fear until they become invincible beasts, then lets them lose on the mind to devour it whole. The result of this scary process is a flock of pariahs, known by the fancy, superstitious name of ""witches"" who live on the peripheries of society, devoid of any means of compassion, stripped of all sanity and civility, living in a world of morbid fantasies and diseased hallucinations in which they are left defenseless to their auto-cannibalistic minds that devour their sanity. <br/><br/>The movie camera never assumes, for a second, that the supernatural aspect of the story (AKA the devil and his incarnations) doesn't exist except in the disintegrating minds of the story characters. The devil does show up on the screen, and so does the ""familiars"" (animal incarnation of witches). A witch does transform herself into a pretty maiden for our horrified entertainment purposes, and all that is candy for the eyes of the cinema goers. Yet, it is all clear that what you see is but the truth as seen from the diseased minds of the characters, and not the truth as it is. <br/><br/>We are given a glimpse of what goes inside those guilty and ignorant superstitious minds, how the truth is perceived from their eyes. Through the hungry eyes of a depraved teenager who craves any female form(not excluding his sister's), we see how an ugly old hag could seem like a beauty, and her promise of a kiss (his very first kiss!) could be both irresistibly sweet, and revoltingly disgusting. And how the whole sexual experience afterwards (his very first) can be enough to drive him insane with joys he couldn't understand (and she kissed me, and went down, and then my bowels..oh, sweet Jesus take me in your lap, HAHAHA!) can drive him insane, feverish and howling until his little heart bursts.<br/><br/>We see the old and dry wife on the verge of menopause, unable to contain the effects of her grief for her lost son, her alienation from her homeland, her suffering in a new unforgiving world, and her fear of competition from her blossoming daughter who had just seen the first signs of puberty. How she ends up a victim of self-mutilating thoughts and actions (the suckling craw scene is a masterpiece)<br/><br/>We see the pious father, scared like hell from life (aka sin) and avoiding it whenever he can, escaping society whenever possible, flogging himself all the time and feeding his torturous, well-hidden feelings of unworthiness, xenophobia, and fear of a world much more powerful than he is, a world waiting for him, with its horrible evils, at every corner. No matter how hard he tries to vent off his anger on the farm animals or the logs of wood, no matter how far he tries to escape, no matter how he prays and cries and stuffs sand into his mouth to atone for his real and imaginary sins, his guilt and fear won't let him be, until he drives himself, and everyone around him(including the family goat), totally insane.<br/><br/>And above all, we have the most rational of all, the young girl who is trying , patiently , to keep her rationality, and save her innocence in a family that had gone completely bonkers. They are always accusing her and themselves of being worthless products of sin, frightening incarnates of evil, and fuel-to-be for everlasting hell. She watches them descend to madness, one by one, losing a little part of her mind every time; until she gradually and very believably, reaches the inevitable moment where she sheds off the last shred of civility and rationality, and runs amok into the woods, welcoming her ascent into the dizzy heights of absolute insanity. We all know what she would look like in a few decades. We have seen one just like her who had spend her life in the woods, nurturing her insane thoughts, becoming diseased, disfigured, ill fed, turning into a frightening form of serial-killer and baby snatcher. The movie has shown us her life, and her face. We have seen, and fully known, the witch. We have also , through the movie , seen and known evil, which is a form of insanity whose seeds are sown by ignorance and watered by guilt and fear.<br/><br/>A great movie. It had done exactly what another movie, ""The Village"" has failed to do more than 10 years ago. It had delivered a very touching message about ignorance, about how guilt, fear and xenophobia have the power to corrupt and destroy the mind and the heart,especially under the effect of misinterpreted religion. How the Christian ""Gospel of Love"" (or the Muslim ""message of peace"", if you wish) can turn into the voice of the Devil himself.<br/><br/>-- tomsuthblack@gmail.com --"
"cb2369","9","196","383","16 February 2016"," A Top Ten Horror Movie
","The best part about The Witch, besides the acting, is the dichotomy between drama and what is actually a surprisingly fast paced and accessible horror movie (with few genre clichés.) The film could be looked at as two separate stories heavily intertwined: the supernatural horror of the woods vs the very real terror of violence erupting within the family, and amazingly this is all done seamlessly, missing no beats and never seeming to give up one for the other. In that way, The Witch has the elegance of a clever children's story (A New England Folk Tale to be precise) with the intensity of a melodrama. This would never have worked if the cast didn't kill every role, but luckily for us they did; they murdered those roles.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever actually seen a movie during which people, in the middle of a crowd, screamed. The Witch did that. The Witch made people scream and gasp so loud the whole room heard and it did other things too: it told an engrossing, intelligent story. There are minor ""complaints"" I may have that keep it from being 10/10 (the shots don't carry the film as much as the writing,) but really this is a horror film that could easily make a top ten list. It's just good fun (and the ending is great... don't bash the ending... people are bashing the ending but I don't know why... it's really a perfect ending...)"

","When you leave the theater in stunned silence, I think the film did its job. The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters this year, and it's easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film's brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score. <br/><br/>It's hard for an audience of this day and age to get into a period piece set in the 17th century without any big name actors or action elements. And I have to admit that I wasn't sure I wanted to see a film like this, especially with its horror elements. But my eyes were pealed from beginning to end. I wouldn't say anything about the story shocked me or had me confused, but the imagery, score, and uncompromising nature to Robert Egger's direction left me breathless. Within 10 minutes I was looking at the screen and whispering to myself ""why would you go there?"", ""Don't do that!"", or ""come on, really?"". Not because I thought it was poor story- telling, but because I was so invested as to what these characters were doing.<br/><br/>With that said, I don't think this film is for everyone. It's brutal, harshly relentless, and utterly disturbing. The characters use all 17th century dialogue and the cinematography sets this grey and ominous tone. The imagery from beginning to end will stick in your head as it has done with me. But that's the way horror films should be. I wouldn't say it's more a psychological thriller because there are plenty of terrifying moments, but it is more for the 'Under the Skin' crowd than it is for people who love 'The Conjuring'. Even in its harsh moments, I was always invested and I can't deny the quality of the writing, directing, and acting all around.

"purrlgurrl","7","50","94","10 February 2017"," Not at all what was expected.
","This is more of a historical psychological thriller than a Hollywood blood and guts horror film.<br/><br/>The film is a loving and accurate recreation of Puritan New England in the 1600s with everything from the language to the sets being authentic to the period. That in and of itself makes it fascinating to watch. Having lived in Virginia, where the Jamestown Settlement and the 1600s sometimes can seem like they happened the day before yesterday, I especially enjoyed the film. The location, in Ontario, reminded me of rural Virginia in winter, which made me quite homesick. So the film might have affected me more than some other audience members.<br/><br/>The Witch is a fascinating glimpse into Christianity as practiced by 17th century Puritans. Satan and Evil are almost tangible presences in the woods and wilderness of the New World, while God is a distant, cold, and demanding being who must be constantly begged for forgiveness and mercy, since all human thoughts, words, and deeds seem to be gravely sinful and offensive to his eyes. <br/><br/>A family of seven (parents, four children, and an infant) are exiled from their plantation community for not adhering to the accepted interpretation of scripture. They build a farm at a distance from the plantation near a frightening wood. The farm is failing (the family won't have food to last the winter). Meanwhile, the infant has been snatched from the oldest daughter while in her care at the edge of the wood. From this point on the family either descends into madness or is destroyed by Satan in the form of a witch who lives nearby in the woods. How the family's disintegration is interpreted will depend on which century's point of view you choose to use."

","After reading the reviews here and hearing about the surprising success of this film, I was eager to watch it. I love plots involving history pieces as well as the possible paranormal. But as I started watching this movie, I found myself praying that there was just a slow build. Unfortunately, I found myself hoping for that up until the very end. The characters were annoying at best. The various elements and ideas introduced to move the plot along seemed to be only minimally explored. The two worst characters in my opinion, were the twins who, from the beginning, gave off an air that they could be evil. Yet when it is confirmed that they had been talking to the devil via a farm animal, the directors/writers still somehow maintained their characters as innocent children. The sporadic intense sequences seemed more tragic than spooky. And the ending was completely insane. A girl watches her whole family get murdered and is scared half to death then instantly decides that she wants to join a coven of naked floating women? Really? I was extremely disappointed in this film and even more in the misleading reviews on this site. I even double checked to make sure that I had watched the same film as those reviewing.

There are only three scenes total that has a 'witch' in it.<br/><br/>Acting is up to par, but you spend the movie waiting for the 'witch' thing to happen, thinking there will be a big finale. It does not happen. Had this movie advertised itself as a drama of a family trying to make it alone in the wilderness....I probably would have given it a higher rating(not much, but higher). Instead it is pointless dialogue and the reciting of scriptures and prayers(not exaggerating, that is almost 40% of the movie, with another 30% silently looking into or away from camera).<br/><br/>The people who are giving this movie high ratings are the same ones that said Terence Malick's Tree of Life is a masterpiece. People who are concerned with plot, middle story, finale or explanation of what is going on will want to to get back two hours of their life."

","The Witch is just a great horror film. I loved so much about it. It has a great creepy feel to it, a dark evil vibe mixed in, and a touch of urban legend sprinkled on top.<br/><br/>The film takes place in such a secluded location that it instantly gives you a feeling of loneliness and dread before it even unfolds its beautifully constructed storyline. I loved the plot, the timing, the acting... basically everything about the film. It's also a brilliant display of female empowerment, which is common among horror films, but in a whole new way that's different from the standard last surviving girl motif.<br/><br/>Whether you're a fan of horror, or just great films in general... I highly suggest The Witch to everyone.<br/><br/>A very strong and deserving 8 out of 10!"
"baileycrawly","2","12","19","18 May 2020"," The Positive Reviews Are an Enigma
","This film has already been branded ""a horror film for cinephiles,"" which is a way for the so-called cinephiles to elevate themselves - in their own minds - to a status of mental superiority and diminishing those of us who, despite having an avid love for film, also have an aversion to the term.<br/><br/>The Witch is nothing special. It's nothing enjoyable, nothing memorable, and nothing that's worth revisiting at any point in the future. What began as a promising movie missed the mark entirely. It's in the same vein as the 2020 film The Turning: it set up a concept that had potential, and completely blew it with the execution.<br/><br/>This movie was so painfully boring that every passing minute felt like torture. This story could've been engaging and truly suspenseful but, by the time the movie decides to actually do something with itself, it's too late. An audience will lose investment in a film's plot and characters if nothing happens for an extended period of time, and this movie excelled at that, offering a story that, even in its non-horror-centric plot points, couldn't be even mildly entertaining enough to hold interest. This movie is best served as background noise, because ultimately it's not worth much else.<br/><br/>To pick positives to point out about this film would be the beautiful cinematography, the decent acting and the costuming. It truly does look like a period piece, which would be extremely interesting were it not for the fact that the film is so bland and so unconcerned with keeping the attention of the audience that it's a chore to sit through. Catch this one if it's on TV, but it's not worth the price of admission to purchase or even rent.<br/><br/>I can already feel the cinephiles preparing to descend upon this review and mark it ""not helpful"" for a conflicting opinion, which will only further showcase my point. This isn't some film for people of higher intelligence; it's a cure for insomnia and a lesson in the history of filmmaking failure."

","SPOILER!<br/><br/>I was optimistic before watching this, its been rated quite highly on most sites, but after watching it i was disappointed. <br/><br/>Firstly, i must say the filming of this was really good, everything was set up great, but it lacked the follow up from the suspense the camera angles and sounds created. The language used in this was sometimes difficult to understand what was being said, as one point, the mother was in the house after mourning her child who had just died, and i literally could not understand a word she said for about 20 seconds. <br/><br/>There's a goat 'Black Philip' and the twin children 'speak' to him. I found this a little creepy, but didn't really make much sense - i mean as to why the family had him, why they were talking to him, and why they didn't tell anyone exactly what he was saying. Fast forward, and it turns out the goat is the devil.... i thought this was really strange, it made no real sense, along with the rest of the film!<br/><br/>Overall this film is quite boring, and the story line doesn't make sense at all. Things don't add up, or lead on properly, so when you think of an outcome for a certain event, you can almost guarantee it will not be that. There were some good elements to this film as i mentioned, the filming of it; and there were a few jumpy bits, but nothing that really scared me or questioned anything further. The only question i had after i finished this film was 'What on earth was that all about?' I had to look online to see what the story line even was, and what key events meant within the film. It was a mega anti-climax. I wouldn't waste my time watching this again!"

","The trailer for this film is intense,scary,and thrilling. I was more than excited to see this on the big screen. Thinking back now I'm pretty sure there was a misrepresentation of dialogue in the trailer. No big deal,right? Wrong! I do not understand their English tongue. I had to focus all the will power I have in my body to catch enough of it to make a comprehensible sentence. Even with all that concentration I may have caught about 50% out what was said. Meanwhile, my friend in the movie theater must of thought I was really into it because he kept looking over and asking what was going on. With a title of Witch I kind of expected to see a movie with a witch in it. Wait for it..... there's a bunny, there's a goat, there's even a hot chick in a cabin in the woods, but sadly there no Witch.<br/><br/>Let's talk a little bit about the family bickering. Have you ever seen Area 407? At some point in the near future you kind of just want everyone to die and the movie would just end. That would have been a good story... At least a better story than whatever the heck that was. Prayers, yelling, prayers, bickering, prayers, screaming. By the end I was praying that God would just end the movie. Multiple points in the movie the screen would go black in-between scenes and every time I was hoping to see the end credits. I would gather up all my stuff just to have to see more. Unfortunately the end couldn't have come soon enough."

I am boycotting all future Robert Eggers movies as he was complicit in this scam. But what do he and the studio care? By the time bad word of mouth sinks this movie and it leaves the theaters after week 2, they will be depositing their 20mil in the bank. Spoiler Alert: As to the plot, it is as follows. A sexy witch in the woods scares this family in a cabin and they go mad and mostly kill each other (maybe because of Calvinism and misogyny and stuff). Then a bunch of witches float in the final scene. Shortly thereafter the movie ended, and someone yelled ""refund"". I went home mad."

"Wuchakk","5","13","23","13 November 2016"," Unsettling slow burn to hopeless perdition
","Released in 2015 and written/directed by Robert Eggers, ""The Witch"" (aka ""The VVitch: A New-England Folktale"") involves a devout family in the 17th century who leave a Puritan plantation due to theological differences and build a farm house in the New England wilderness. A string of tragedies offers evidence of a diabolical witch dwelling in the mysterious woods as the family descends into madness. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie play the parents, William and Katherine, while Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw play the oldest of the five kids, Thomasin and Caleb.<br/><br/>The film is based on Eggers' childhood fascination with witches. Much research was done, extensively working from records in English and American museums, as well as consulting 17th century agricultural experts. The labors of Eggers & his team can be observed in the film because it's thoroughly convincing, as far as sets, dialogue and acting go. Speaking of dialogue, I encourage you to utilize the subtitles because you'll only understand half of the Old English verbiage.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a mix of family drama, folktale and horror, coming across as a combo of four films: ""The Crucible"" (1996), ""The Village"" (2004), ""Blood on Satan's Claw"" (1971) and the satanic ritual sequence of ""The Devil Rides Out"" (ake ""The Devil's Bride) (1968). It's more supernatural and creepy than the first two, but if you like these four films you'll probably appreciate it. ""The Witch"" brilliantly captures the paranoia & superstition of Puritan communities in New England around the time of the Salem witch trials of 1692-1693 and melds it with supernatural horror. Everything is interwoven into a macabre ode of a time & place where people imagined witches and devils dwelling in the dark woods except here they're for real.<br/><br/>The family is a good loving family, but they're bound by the legalism of the strain of Calvinism they embrace. The father's proud, non-sectarian spirit cuts them off from the support of the only accessible community. By themselves in the black forest, they're open prey to the devil & his denizens. While the movie's admirable in so many ways, including the fact that it's ambiguous enough to be open to interpretation, it's also generally dull and too unpleasant for my tastes (yes, I realize it's SUPPOSED to be 'unpleasant' to a degree since it's a horror flick, but the third act just gets too ugly and leaves a bad taste). But Anya Taylor-Joy is magnificent and Ralph Ineson is excellent.<br/><br/>The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Kiosk, Ontario, Canada. Costing only $3.5 million, it made $40.5 million worldwide with $25 million from North America.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+ <br/><br/>ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (***SPOILER ALERT***) <br/><br/>Some commentators absurdly suggest that Thomasin is better off at the end than living within the religious confines of her family or the Puritan community. Really? She now gets to slaughter babies in the woods and eventually face eternal damnation; yeah, that's just so incredibly liberating. Would she really be happy joining a bunch of murderous beasts, a couple of which just slaughtered her family? Interestingly, grinding babies to death is presumably female emancipation in this ""folktale"" and that's not too far from reality in modern Western culture.<br/><br/>Other commentators suggest that we don't know if what's going on is real or the result of mental illness due to extreme religiosity or a perhaps even a nightmare. ANSWER: Yes, we do know. From almost the very beginning we KNOW there's an actual diabolical witch in the area, which we SEE stole the baby and bathes in his blood. Shortly later we observe that this satanic ritual brings back her youth (or, at least, the appearance of youth); and she seduces Caleb, showing that she's a friggin' pedophile. The only thing we don't know is if there is more than one witch or what the devil's place in the events is or isn't, both of which are revealed literally in the final act.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the witch is a delusion of one or more of the family members then that means that Thomasin or one of the others took the baby; of perhaps an animal. So where's the body or remains and why weren't William & Caleb able to find it during their thorough searches? If one of them or an animal, like a wolf, took and killed the infant where's the evidence, where's the blood? We see zero evidence to draw this conclusion.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that the movie is subtitled a 'folktale' and is based on actual documents from the 17th century. In other words, the movie doesn't depict reality, but is exactly what it says it is -- a folk TALE where ugly, evil witches who bathe in infants' blood and devils who masquerade as goats really lurk in the dark woods and are to be feared. <br/><br/>So the surmounting tragedies the family experiences aren't a product of hyper-religious paranoia or a nightmare, but rather the result of confrontation with sinister beings, both physical and spiritual, which exist in the 'world' of the movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, the message of the film is obvious: Don't leave the strength and protection of the community of believers due to arrogance or you'll be picked off one by one by the Enemy; or, at least, seduced into joining the dark side."

This is not a horror movie so if you are wanting to see something that makes you jump out of your seat the only you will do is fall a sleep in your seat. Really never understood out the whole story of why they left the other Puritans. Asked everybody that went with me and nobody really got it. There was not enough information about why they left. Also maybe their beliefs of something. And the oldest daughter tells the dad the younger siblings are possessed right after she told the siblings she was a witch but then says she is not. Never could fiqure that one out. And one more thing what was the deal with the rabbit showing up in a lot of scenes and camera man focusing on the rabbit for 20 seconds was he possessed too? Please do not go see this movie. You are going to be disappointed. When the movie was over my husband said "" I can't believe we sat through the whole thing."""

","Look I May be no expert on movies but I have been a film fan for years and this is on of the worst films that I have seen period and I gave this film every chance in the freaking world this is a movie that was made for Christians by Christians and it is very authentic to how people spoke in the 1600s and the acting is not that bad the actress who plays the oldest daughter turns in a fine performance here as a girl who does not wish to be as religious as her family. This film is boring from the beginning there is absolutely nothing scary about it all this film is about from what I can tell is that you can not give in to the devil no matter who you are god always has your back if you pray all of your problems will go away and if your family is evil lock them up in a horse stall and let them die because apparently there evil and you are not. All and all I say going to this movie is a waste of however much money you end up paying for it I swear I wanted to throw popcorn at the screen not to mention I wanted a big time refund as well look if you like these kind of films fine I am not telling not to go to the film if you like these kinds of films but I do not like these kinds of films and I would advise you not to go to this film it's a waste it really is."

","It's not often I get completely duped and screwed by IMDb ratings, but the 6.8 (especially for a horror film) led me to buy this movie before even first watching (save your judgment, I buy movies all the time before watching and due to a decent amount of research and a pretty good intuition with movies, I rarely get burned). But this movie is an exception. I see many people writing positive reviews applauding the movies ""psychological horror"", and I'm really at a loss as to what they're talking about. I look for only a few things in horror movies (I'm an avid fan), A: Logical and interesting story B: at least decent acting C: some feelings of being scared, unsettled, disturbed, something....this movie severely lacked in the most important one....C. Where was I supposed to be scared? Sure, there was some atmospheric tension with some decent score to accompany, but it lacked severely in anything visual...and after all, it IS a film. I like when a movie makes my mind wreak havoc, but my mind can't MAKE the movie. And if it's supposed to be ALL psychological, well, it just didn't do anything for me. Might I also add, visual does NOT mean gore. I cannot stand movies that lean on gross out gore. Some of my favorites include The Conjuring, The Babadook, The Exorcist, Cube, Sinister, and The Thing. Idk, overall pretty disappointed after reading generally positive reviews and seeing positive ratings. Not a HORRIBLE movie, but I wouldn't exactly recommend it. 4/10."

","I am someone who loves all things Salem and Puritan witch trials. Based upon good reviews and internet buzz, I had high hopes for this film. Things I did like were the costuming, the setting and the period-specific language. However, I was distinctly unimpressed overall. Many people rave about this as a horror film, but while there were certainly bloody, gory scenes, I would categorize that more as ""disgusting"" rather than ""scary."" As for the story itself, I guess it was meant to be a psychological thriller, but that only works if your audience can actually follow the story. I was appreciated the period-specific speech but due to the fact that the sound quality was bad, I found myself resorting to subtitles to attempt to follow what was going on. Unfortunately, it seemed like the entire film was just multiple vignettes of increasingly chaotic happenings on an isolated farm strung together, and what TRULY disappointed me was the end. The fact that there actually ARE witches and a devil/demon causing all the mayhem in the end is a much worse plot twist than if we discovered that the supernatural aspect was all imaginary and that the family slaughtered each other over something that only existed in their minds. Now THAT would've been a truly scary ending!!"

Strictly within the context of these people, in this script, religious insanity would be plausible to the point of obviousness.<br/><br/>The only thing more obvious would be--an actual witch.

"WilliamOTyler","10","53","120","29 February 2016"," Horrifically Enchanting
","The Witch, following a family upon their move into the wilderness of 1630s New England, is the debut feature film from director Robert Eggers who embeds the project with an essence of horror not often seen. While many audiences are busy looking for, or even lazily just waiting for, big jumps and stingers for their scares like most modern movies of the genre, they are missing the creepy details that truly push a slow burn like this film into horror. It's so realistically done that you worry that it shouldn't be happening, and are likewise worried of the consequences for the family.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is first and foremost in bringing this story to life. The acting is just incredible. You can see heavy breath leaving the body. You can see the confusion in their eyes. You can see evil determination and quiet despair. Each actor has a moment of triumph where their talent alone is on display, and these scenes hit like a goat to the gut. What makes it even more impressive is that more than half of the main cast is made up of child actors that pull these feats from who knows where. They are eerily effective in a way that, at one point, I questioned whether one of the children was actually an adult acting through motion capture. It was not the case. The acting is just that intense and believable.<br/><br/>Other points and aspects of the film also make you question everything you're seeing. Has any of this story been real? Is what is happening in this story being imagined? There's a sense of ambiguity that, instead of making things more comfortable because it's probably just an old-timey urban legend, actually makes you more hesitant to step further into darkness because it could very well be real. While those horrific voices help make up a vivid and powerful score by Mark Koven, could these chants actually be coming from nearby evil as well? The forest, already a naturally dangerous place, is left open to become a supernatural place of folklore where any animal you encounter could be something more and the tall trees creep in close to overcome you.<br/><br/>It's a masterful choice to shoot this film in more of a full frame aspect ration, which makes its presentation alone feel old and classic, purposefully dated to a time long since experienced. At the same time, it subconsciously makes the film about a tight-knit family go completely claustrophobic and uncomfortable, even when outdoors. It's isolating. The camera is used like a lullaby, going back and forth between sweeps across plains and utter stillness until it trances you into the unknown. There is depth and uneasiness in every frame, and bewilderment after every turn. Takes that last longer than expected leave you to breathe during these down times, but there really is no downtime when you're numbed into a sense of wonder.<br/><br/>All of this culminates into a film that floats into a state of euphoria, capturing an emotion that you may not have known was even there before. It's a witch film unlike any witch film you've seen, taken seriously and realistically, but with a climate of dread. It's a slice of life film, really, albeit a slice of an alternative life. As familiar in storybooks as it might be today, these were the absolute thoughts and stories passed around by those who lived during the time, the stories that many thought to be real. The Witch is the definition of the American witch mythology, portrayed in its purest state of horrific enchantment."
"rcreekmur","2","53","120","21 February 2016"," Deceptive Previews and an Aggravating Film
","I went to see The Witch based on the intriguing previews, plus the high user and critic ratings on IMDb. What did anyone find the least bit redeeming in this wretched film?<br/><br/>Based on the previews I was expecting a frightening, exciting, tense movie about, oh I don't know, a witch!?!? Instead I was subjected to 90 minutes of a family's extreme religious superstition tearing them apart. OK, that's not necessarily bad for subject matter, but since everyone speaks in different accents and variations of 17th century English (ye, thee, thou, whilst, etc.) at wildly varying volume levels, I probably missed a good 40-50% of what was said. <br/><br/>But what upset me the most was how the film existed in the world of plausibility for the majority of the time and then suddenly shifted into fantasy and the supernatural. Far too many WTF moments that I would have to spoil to enumerate. But just when you think you are dealing with the effects of religious extremism and how it can poison a person's mind, suddenly you get slammed with images of pure folklore fantasy and all you can do is scratch your head and wonder what the heck is going on. It's been a long time since a film has made me want to walk out in disgust.<br/><br/>I give The Witch two stars because of the acting performances. The cast had some horrible material to work with but they did a wonderful job of expressing their emotions, fears and doubts about each other's faith. Somehow they spoke the lines they were given effectively as well. In the end they couldn't rise above the material, though, including the fact that like so many movies today, the filmmakers had no idea how or when the story should come to an end."

","A failing farm family who has recently immigrated to New England, has hit particularly hard times and have become desperate. They have 6 mouths to feed, most of their crops are inedible, the father can't hunt worth sh*t, and they have recently lost a baby to either a wolf or a witch.<br/><br/>The aging mother holds a grudge against her youthful daughter, Thomasina- if only using her as someone to take her anger out on for being stuck desolate in this god forsaken new land. So, she seeks to have her sent away to become someone else's problem.<br/><br/>After overhearing this, the two older siblings set off to do something that is never specifically said. And, while they are out, their horse gets spooked, Thomasina falls off and is knocked unconscious.<br/><br/>She wakes up alone, and makes her way back to the farm. Caleb, it seems, has gone to a house in the woods...the house of a witch...and become bewitched through lust.<br/><br/>He returns naked, in the rain, pecked in the face.<br/><br/>The Twins (two younger siblings) blame Thomasina, because she had jokingly told them she was a witch to scare them when they were being brats. But they took it seriously...and blame her.<br/><br/>Even though it really seems like they (the twins) are the ones doing the bewitching, considering they are the ones talking to their creepy goat Black Phillip.<br/><br/>Either way, Caleb has a demon in him. And they attempt to perform a farmhouse exorcism on him as best they can...during which he coughs up an apple and dies.<br/><br/>To appease his terrified wife, the father locks the rest of the children away with the goats. Hoping that will contain the problem till morning. At which point he will take his daughter to the local plantation. <br/><br/>But sh*t hits the fan, before morning has a chance to roll around. The twins are stolen by some nasty naked witch, and Black Phillip gets loose...goring their father to death.<br/><br/>Now, only the mother is left, and she immediately attacks her daughter...ignoring her own godly premonition...turning against the only one who is left...the only one who is truthful, and good.<br/><br/>And there is only one thing you can do when you're getting choked to death...<br/><br/>This film is very atmospheric, and does a great job of putting you in a position of empathy with Thomasina- who we are, sort of, experiencing events through.<br/><br/>But what really stands out, are the performances. For a period piece, with lots of Olde English (I had to watch with subtitles), everyone does a spectacular job. Ralph Ineson probably does the best job, as the father- it's like he stepped right out of the 1700's. The twins are both creepy as all hell- their unison responses send chills down your spine. Harvey Scrimshaw's portrayal of a bewitched and possessed Caleb is simply mindblowing, coming from such a young dude. And Anya Taylor-Joy's portrayal of Thomasina is absolutely genuine, on a purely human level. <br/><br/>The ending, however, is very abrupt. And left me wanting more. I felt they could have stretched the film a bit longer, and used that to develop her initiation more.<br/><br/>But it's not my film, so who am I to complain.<br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyed this.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

"MaximumMadness","10","23","48","29 October 2016"," ""The Witch""- A haunting and complex fable.
","One of the most complex and haunting films to emerge within the past decade, writer/director Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" is a troubling fable of religion and fanaticism expertly combined with the trappings of a classic horror story of witchcraft and savagery. Though perhaps misrepresented by a marketing campaign billing it is a straight- forward creepshow for the masses, the truth is that this is a hard-hitting and expertly crafted art-film, and is a rewarding and startling experience that will leave the open minded breathless. It is without doubt not a film for everyone, and its appeal will be limited... but this cannot detract from the fact that it is a masterpiece from a brilliant new voice in film.<br/><br/>New England. The 17th Century. A family is excommunicated from their Puritanical plantation home due to their extreme and fanatical religious views that conflict with the establishment of their peers. Father William (Ralph Ineson) helps his flock to build and craft a new home on the edge of a vast forest, where he hopes to create a new life for his family- wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), twins Mercy and Jones (Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson) and infant son Samuel. However, not all is well. The disappearance of Samuel while playing with Thomasin causes an emotional rift within the family, tensions begin to run high due to the circumstances of their situation, mistrusts and deceits are slowly born and will push their limits of their devotion to one another and to god... and it soon becomes apparent that an otherworldly force may be at play... that a witch of the woods may be silently stalking the family.<br/><br/>The film is Kubrickian in nature, relying on the slow and methodical establishment of character and atmosphere combined with complex metaphors and symbols to create a masterwork of terror and drama. It is a finely tuned experience, relying on the subtle and the suggestive as opposed to the overt and blatant. Rewarding the analytical and open among audiences, Eggers excels in his craft, building the narrative slowly and with great deliberation while constantly developing and evolving his characters. And while it may seem counter-intuitive, the film is oddly enough at its strongest not when delivering the plethora of chilling sequences and scares that are abundant. But rather, the film is at its strongest when it places its focus on the collapsing nature of the family unit, torn apart by their own doubt and devotion to their obsessive beliefs... even at the expense of logic, reason and safety. Though don't be fooled... this is still very much a frightening film, with many terrifying moments thanks to the disturbing portrayal of witchcraft and savagery. It just also happens to be a very thoughtful, contemplative and complicated film that does great work with its themes, and can be interpreted in a number of ways.<br/><br/>The performances are just marvelous and are the other main contributing factor to the film's great success when combined with Eggers' masterful writing and direction. Anya Taylor-Joy stands tall in a breakout performance in the role of Thomasin, who becomes our main focus early on. Taylor-Joy is a revelation and despite her relatively young age, injects complexity, doubt and pathos into the role in a way that is beyond her years. Incredible work. Ralph Ineson is the other stand- out here, as the increasingly troubled William. Ineson plays the character as hopeful but increasingly haunted by his own faith, and it's a stirring and emotional performance. Dickie makes for another great character as Katherine, and she is the perfect compliment to Thomasin and William within the story. I also will give high markings to child-actor Harvey Scrimshaw as the young Caleb. Child actors are a tough sell much of the time, but Scrimshaw (similar to Taylor-Joy) seems to possess a talent that far exceeds expectation and does the role justice.<br/><br/>To be honest, I cannot say a single thing to the detriment of the film. But I do feel the need to stress something I touched upon in the beginning. This is not a standard horror flick, and many have felt let-down and deceived by the admittedly poor marketing created for the film's release. The film was touted as ""scary"" and ""creepy"" and ""something we should not be seeing"" in a trailer filled with loud music stingers and many of the film's scares, suggesting a more straight-forward experience. This is not a horror film for the masses. This is not the sort-of movie a group of 17-year-olds will go to on a Friday night and feel fulfilled by. This is very much an art- picture. A movie that encourages thought and personal interpretation. And I think that far too many have dismissed it unfairly for failing to adhere to its poor marketing, as opposed to embracing it for what it actually is. To an extent, I understand feeling duped. And I'm not even a pretentious art-type. I love the ""Saw"" movies more than most. I get kicks out of brainless schlock like Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" and screwball comedies like ""Brain Donors."" And I think ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" isn't nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But you know what? I also appreciate true art. I adore it and embrace it and celebrate it. And ""The Witch"" is art at its purest. And I firmly believe it is unfair to condemn the film because the trailer wasn't the best representation of it.<br/><br/>I give ""The Witch"" a perfect 10. It is not only amongst the best horror films of the decade. It is simply amongst the best films of the decade, regardless of genre."

Such a fantastic work of art that I am happy to own and watch again and again. It's too bad that a lot of people today do not have an appreciation for artsy films.

The cinematography is very well done and the acting is good for what it is but that doesn't make up for the lack of plot nor the plodding pace at which the movie drags. I sincerely don't understand how people are rating this as high as they are. Is it possible that my friends and I saw an entirely different version? If you want a truly scary movie, which I was mistakenly looking for, look somewhere else because this is not it."

","The Witch: A New-England Folktale (2015) is an entertaining, wonderfully atmospheric and historically accurate take on witch mythology in colonial New England. Plenty of films claim historic accuracy, but you rarely see it. Mel Gibson is notorious for his pseudo historical (but highly entertaining) historical fiction movies. The Witch, though a semi-low budget horror film, puts those to shame. Listen to what the director says about his attention to detail.<br/><br/>""I am positive it is the most accurate portrayal of this period in American history on screen. We went to such lengths to make it so,"" writer-director Robert Eggers told the LA Times earlier this year. ""Everything with the farmstead that we built, everything that you see on-screen is made from the correct building materials that would have been used at the time. Most often we used the traditional tools and techniques to create these objects. And the clothing is hand stitched based on extant clothing."" OK, except the nails, which are round and not square like they would have been in the seventeenth century.<br/><br/>Nitpickers have also gone after the filmmaker's stylized title. Cinema Sins' claim that the digraph ""VV"" fell out of use after the sixteenth century (The Witch is set in the seventeenth century), and therefore the stylized use of VV in the title is inaccurate, is only partly true.<br/><br/>The Wonders of the Invisible World by Cotton Mather, published in 1693, clearly shows witch spelled with a digraph. However, it is a ""double U,"" or UU. Several other pamphlets, shown here, from 1643 and 1645, both show witch spelled ""V Vitch,"" just like the film title. Printing at the time was more art than science, and printers chose when to use the modern W or the older VV or UU.<br/><br/>Even the witch lore is highly accurate to the seventeenth century, from using baby's blood as flying ointment, to enchanted animals cursing weapons in order to slip away unharmed. And, of course, writing one's name in blood in the Devil's book, creepily portrayed by a black goat. Witches were believed to cause their victims to vomit foreign objects, shown when the family's son, Caleb is being tormented and spits up an apple. There are no magic wands, pointy hats, or broomsticks here.<br/><br/>Witches represented a malevolent force in the natural and social order, destroying relationships between neighbors and family members. In The Witch, tragedies and minor transgressions gradually unravel the family and undermine the trust that held them together. The tension is palpable as they slowly turn on each other, all while apparently under supernatural assault. The terror comes from knowing this threat destroys from within as well as from without.<br/><br/>In many ways The Witch reminds me of Eyes of Fire (1983), in which a group of religious dissenters flee to the wilderness only to face assault by supernatural forces in colonial New England. There's something primordial about the hostility of nature, survival, and the union of wood and spirit. The idea that nature is foreign and hostile to man appeals to our basest instincts.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I'd agree with Jay from RedLetterMedia that The Witch is the best film to hit theaters in 2016, but it's definitely the best horror movie to come out for a while. It's an incredible first film for writer-director Robert Eggers. I just hope he isn't another M. Night Shyamalan, whose breakout film The Sixth Sense revolutionized the genre, but he went on to make complete garbage for the rest of his career."

","Spoilers: This movie is f***ing fantastic. Ten seconds in and we've got an awesome premise: Puritan family banished to the woods, and they're not alone. That's right. There's a f***ing witch. This movie is slow burn in tone only. I was sitting on the edge of my seat at every moment. Right off the bat this movie assures you it's not pulling any punches. In a unsettling, subtle, brutal scene, the baby is kidnapped, and this is just about five minutes in. But does this movie leave it to your imagination what happened? F*** no. The witch killed that baby and crushed it up into mush *see title for my reaction*. From there we watch in terrified awe as the family is ripped apart (literally and metaphorically) from inside and out as it tries to defend itself from the forces of the devil. It's pulse pounding, fantastically shot, perfectly paced, and exquisitely acted. I would have said more, but I ran out of adequate descriptors. Regarding the reviews that say this movie isn't scary: as a horror movie veteran, I can't f***ing sleep."

","I wasn't sure what to expect from such polarized reviews. However, I enjoyed this movie. You will need to watch it in closed caption unless you have the ears of a bat or are used to pilgrim-speak. <br/><br/>You instantly feel for this family as they are thrust out of their community and thrown into isolation (echoes of The Village). They pray thanks for their meager scraps of bread at dinner and do the best they can while slowly descending into madness (echoes of The Shining). Could be witchcraft, could be the poison corn, could be cabin fever - you will need to watch it to find out. <br/><br/>As the story builds, the family begins to fall apart and turn on one another, as they think the eldest daughter to be a witch. However, we learn it is not all in their minds, as Caleb has an ""encounter"" with a beautiful witch that the daughter is unaware even exists. This eventually leads to the boys dementia and demise as the evil destroys him from the inside out (echoes of The Exorcist).<br/><br/>The family descends further into madness. Not only are they struggling in the wilderness, they now no longer can trust one another. The scene where Thomasine's own mother spits hateful accusations at her is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>For those of you complaining about all of the religious talk - DUH - they were Puritans! This was a great movie, but left me feeling uneasy afterward, and quite somber. But if you are a horror movie aficionado, you should see this."

"alenthas","10","21","45","2 October 2016"," Truly a Masterpiece
","This film quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time, which compelled me to write a review for the first time. The low score on this movie and equally horrifying reviews is a great injustice for this exquisite piece of art.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1630's New England the family gets banished from the plantation and have to fend for themselves in the harsh conditions of this brave new world.<br/><br/>The story of this film is nothing new, it's mainly based off of folklore that is told during that era. Where the story intentionally lacks from, the characters more than make up for it. The character interactions, their desires and their perceived flaws are absolutely on point. And anyone who studied and learned about Puritans to some degree would enjoy its authenticity. They come alive with their mannerism and their way of thinking. Their relationship with god, religion, and family really help drive it home that these are real human beings.<br/><br/>People who would consider this movie to be bad, would say the same thing about Lovecraft stories. They would scoff at Twin Peaks for not being scary enough.<br/><br/>In a world with endless, low brow horror sequels, this movie exceeds every expectation and delivers the much needed fresh air that horror fans were suffocating for.<br/><br/>It is disturbing, uncomfortable, even grotesque at times with its subject matter and imagery. It manages to keep the tension up throughout the movie with its incredible score and cinematography. It's a rare thing to be impressed by a movie this much, and I'm so glad I had the privilege to experience this awe and respect I had for the movie, even hours after viewing it.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 10/10 because the current score is an insult to everyone who appreciates good cinema, and according to the masses an experience is either worth one star, or ten starts. There is no middle ground. Ignoring that, my real score would be 9,3."
"Genti22","10","21","45","14 September 2016"," Masterpiece of a film
","The Witch is a historical period horror movie written and directed by Robert Eggers in his directorial debut. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson. The movie's based on English folktales about a strictly religious family that encounters forces of evil in the woods near the place where they live. I personally believe that this film is a total masterpiece in every single aspect. From the great haunting visuals to the genius story told, this film is absolutely incredible. All the actors do a great job, especially Anya Taylor-Joy who is so talented and certainly has a bright future ahead of her. The tone of the film is brilliant and really scary to think about. The family was religious and had ""faith"" in God, but what they did not realize is that they did not have faith in one another and so that creates conflict and from conflict comes sin. Something which they are strongly against, and yet it consumes them entirely, sin is there deep down in their hearts and they could never escape it. The Witch is riddled with ideas that make you think and are chilling that will undeniably stick with you for quite a while after. It is such a well made film, from the smart lighting that reflects upon the characters to the suspenseful score composed by Mark Korven. My only issue is that it is a bit slow at times, but once you get into the characters and the story that is being told, it is a thrill ride from then on. The ending is also insane and frankly really scary too. I loved this film and I would recommend any horror and movie fan in general who just wants to see a masterpiece, to watch it now."
"aminre4","1","31","71","14 March 2016"," Over rated low budget so called HORRO film.
","I would be lying if I said this movie was great. I went to watch it yesterday in the cinema and was really looking forward to it with very very high expectations after seeing the trailer and the high ratings of IMDb and RottenTomatoes. The title simply misrepresents the movie. I was extremely disappointed at the end of the film simply because it didn't deliver what it was supposed to deliver, HORROR. I only saw the WITCH on two or three occasions throughout the film and didn't feel any witchcraft or dark magic whatsoever. <br/><br/>Over all, without going into much details, it felt that the film was all over the place and going in many different directions that did not lead to nowhere. The script in my opinion was not the right one for this movie, it just builds up the suspense and makes one feel hyper endlessly without any jump scares and it lacked the element of surprise which you would expect in a horror film. The storyline misleads the audience to something unfinished and the chain of events do not make sense at all. I did not understand what happened to the two children and why they were screaming and when they were bewitched and by who. Also, I did not quite get what the goat's or the rabbit's role in the film, they just appear and disappear and the goat stood once which I was expecting it at that moment to transform to the real witch so we get to hear what she has to say, but unfortunately, it didn't happen and it only attacked the man and killed him, very simple and straightforward. Any goat can attack and kill a man you don't need to go to the cinema to watch it lol. <br/><br/>Finally, I think the people who over rated this film should review their taste or at least be truthful what they saw. There was nothing to like about this film unfortunately and it is just a waste of time I must say. I know what a horror film should look and sound like, and if this film is rated 7.4/10 on IMDb, and Silent Hill is rated 6.6/10, then you must know that there is a clear issue in this regard and it makes you ask the question, who is really managing the ratings and how do they do it?<br/><br/>I hope I have been fair in my judgement regarding this movie as I feel I am only telling the truth about how disappointed I am.<br/><br/>Thank you"

It was one of those films where you really couldn't care less who lived and who died; as a matter of fact, in the end you find yourself rooting for evil to prevail.

","Like most other reviews here, I was lured to this movie by an intriguing trailer and high IMDb reviews. Well, there's goes IMDb review credibility. The movie had nothing to do with horror, and barely had anything to do with a witch, but was little more than an old world family religious drama. I'm not going to waste too much time getting into the thin story but it was basically dead boring. The mother of the family was way over the top and desperately needed a good smack. The other characters were uninteresting or downright irritating (the cartoonish twins come to mind). Within the first 20 minutes, I knew I was in trouble. It just got worse from there.<br/><br/>Several people gradually walked out of the theater, and I should have been one of those smart enough to know nothing would redeem this mess. When the movie ended, the entire remaining theater groaned and were very vocal in how much they hated the movie. What made it worse was that I decided to treat a couple of friends of mine on a Saturday night to what we were all excited to see, but unfortunately I lost $34 and a couple hours of life that could have been better spent doing something more entertaining or interesting, like lancing a boil. But we did get one unintended laugh from the film, and that had to do with a crow and the mother. But don't go see the movie to find out what I'm talking about, it's just not worth it."

"thelastblogontheleft","9","21","46","8 July 2017"," Absolutely Brilliant
","Oh my freaking god, this movie. I've seen it twice now and I'm sure there will be more views in the future. It's just so perfect — a masterpiece, really — and the fact that it is director Robert Eggers' feature film debut makes it even more impressive. The mood, the choice of actors, the historical accuracy, the sort of discordant and frantic music, the tension, the character development, the slow build of a more psychological horror, the setting they just nailed every aspect. <br/><br/>The film takes place in 17th century New England and begins with the family — patriarch William (Ralph Ineson), his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), their eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and fraternal twins Jonas (Lucas Dawson) and Mercy (Ellie Grainger) — being banished from their town due to a difference in interpretation of the New Testament. They build a farm by the edge of the woods, where Katherine gives birth to their fifth child, Samuel. When he goes missing, it is just the beginning of the family's descent into all kinds of despair and anguish.<br/><br/>** SPOILERS! **<br/><br/>The swiftness with which this movie delivers a feeling of all-encompassing hopelessness and isolation — starting just minutes in as we watch Thomasin numbly stare as their wagon heads off towards the woods, away from the town she calls home and from civilization as a whole — is intense. It almost doesn't matter what happens after that point — you feel the frustration contrasting with this stoic, stubborn determination immediately.<br/><br/>I was actually impressed that they didn't film on location in New England (due to tax incentives they opted for Canada), but the time Eggers put into finding a suitable location payed off because I easily believed it. The combination of the brilliant soundtrack (done by Mark Korven), the editing, and the cinematography made an otherwise benign forest truly appear ominous, evil even at a distance, which I thought was impressive. I think it can be easy to make woods feel creepy while you're surrounded by them, but to give the impression that there's something sinister hiding within them awesome.<br/><br/>They did a great job at keeping the witch herself very subtle — she's scary more for what we don't see than what we do. But the glimpses you DO get are terrifying.<br/><br/>After Samuel disappears, Katherine's grief is overwhelming. I feel like so often in movies when a child dies or goes missing, the grief is sort of glossed over — it's implied. But the grief you feel from Katherine absolutely smothers you. It's raw and unapologetic.<br/><br/>The film was shot entirely with natural light and damn, it shows. The outdoor shots manage to all be in this perfect, cloudy day light, and the indoor shots lit only by candles are just stunning. All of the indoor shots, really, are beautiful, and they did an amazing job at making the house feel extremely claustrophobic rather than cozy (which cinematographer Jarin Blaschke contributes to the particular aspect ratio used while filming).<br/><br/>It's an extremely religious movie but not in a way that offers any form of comfort or warmth. It's more about doing everything in your power to avoid God's punishment rather than to receive his mercy. There's a devoutness, a fierceness, a terrified tightrope walking of self-sacrifice. And as much as it's about religion, it's also about feminism — the quickness to cast evil onto something you don't understand (or something you deem more powerful than it should be). Of course, in the time that this movie took place, women were accused of being witches for the most mundane of offenses — challenging societal norms, having colored skin, or even just being poor — so it's no surprise that Thomasin was quick to be accused by even her own mother, a strong woman in her own right though that power may have been misplaced.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes, morbidly enough, is when Caleb dies after disappearing into the woods himself and reappearing inexplicably, naked and very ill. It's impressive enough when an adult can put on a convincing show of death in a movie, but when a 14-year-old does it you take notice. But just the sense of their world crashing in around them — first Samuel and now Caleb — and Katherine's hysteria paired with Caleb's intense visions is wild. You're just staring wide-eyed watching the entire scene. And then it follows up with what is probably the most heart-wrenching scene in the whole film — one of the most heart-wrenching I've ever seen — with first a wide shot of Katherine and William burying Caleb, and then Katherine climbing into the grave to hold him one last time. Ooof.<br/><br/>William, I think, is one of the most complex characters in the film. He is desperate and mad with conviction but I believe truly trying to help his family the best he's able to. He, too, is like the God they worship — a cold hand on your shoulder reminding you to stay the course, a fierce reminder hissed in your ear.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what I think is the best feat of all, is that this film makes no claim to whether it is reality or delusion. There's a brief mention of rot on the corn — so quick you'd likely miss it — and some types of rot can produce hallucinations if consumed. Are we simply seeing the fungus-induced visions of a struggling family, or something more visceral? We see Caleb being tempted to gaze at his sister's chest as her shift dips low is his temptation into the beautiful witch's cabin genuine, or simply a deeper metaphor for being drawn into evil? And Thomasin's final departure, her willingness to ""live deliciously"" does she actually float above the fire with the other witches, or is she simply choosing a life less rigid? We'll never know, and THAT is freaking brilliant."

","I went to see this today on the recommendation of some film critics. This film was so horrid I thought I was having a flashback to the bad old days of Ed Wood. In fact Plan 9 From Outer Space was much more enjoyable to watch. The first 15 minutes was quite good but after that it was all downhill. The lack of suspense and aimless direction had me bored out of my brain. I was hoping by the end of the film that there would be a good old witch burning at the stake to liven things up a bit. But not even that would have saved this drivel. This film was shown at one cinema in Melbourne. Now I can understand why. The major movie houses must have seen it and wouldn't have a bar of it"

"robsta23","8","18","39","1 March 2016"," More Disturbing than ""Scary""
","What a good directorial debut. The Witch is a solid film by Robert Eggers. Set in colonial times in America, the story is one of a family that is exiled from a village. The family chooses to settle near the woods in which many strange things occur, the first being the disappearance of the baby of the family.<br/><br/>The eldest daughter of the family is cautious when it comes to the woods, but that doesn't mean she can't get good fun out of teasing her little sister that she is the infamous witch of the woods. This little sister and her twin brother take this jest too seriously, and eventually inform their parents of this incident. That being said, supernatural forces are at play among the family at the core of the movie, and tensions are raised and the family members are against each other as possible demons.<br/><br/>Some may find trouble keeping up with the Old English used in the film, but it seems easy enough to understand when you compare it to Shakespeare's works (even with modern adaptations such as Whedon's ""Much Ado About Nothing""). The person who uses this type of the language the most is the father, William, played by Ralph Ineson. Ineson steals the show even when the audience cannot fully comprehend what he is saying (it is easy to get the general idea though). His performance is probably one of the best aspects of this film, other than the lack of great color variety that truly sets the mood for this film.<br/><br/>In terms of ""horror"" films, this movie does not produce many jump scares, and is instead just disturbing in content, making it comparable to films like The Shining or perhaps Rosemary's Baby. With the family accusing each other, elements of The Thing also come into play. A solid film when it comes to technicality and the horror genre in general, but it could have used a bit more story and more clarification about the demons at play in this film.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"

","In the Seventeenth Century, in New England, the farmer William (Ralph Ineson) and his family are banished from the Puritan plantation controlled by the church due to differences in religious principles. William leaves the spot with his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie); his teenage daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy); his son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) and the twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) and settles at the edge of a forest. They build a small house and a barn and meanwhile Katherine delivers the baby Samuel. One day, Thomasin is playing with Samuel near the forest and the baby mysteriously vanishes. The family unsuccessfully seeks Sam out and Katherine becomes insane, praying all the time and mistreating and blaming her daughter for everything wrong in their lives. However, Sam was abducted and slaughtered by a witch that lives in the woods that used his blood to paint her body. William goes to the forest to hunt since the crop has failed and he confides to his son that he sold Katherine's silver goblet to buy supplies. However he is a bad hunter and misses his target. In the farm, the twins tell Thomasin that they speak to the goat Black Phillip. While having dinner, Katherine accuses Thomasin of losing her cup and William does not tell the truth. During the night, Thomasin and the children overhear her mother telling William to deliver Thomasin to work for another family. Early in the morning, Caleb, Thomasin, their dog and the family horse go to hunt in the woods. However Thomasin falls from the horse and faints, Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon his dead dog first and upon a seductive woman later. William finds Thomasin and Katherine confronts her about Caleb's fate. When the boy returns naked and with fever, the twins accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and she discloses that they speak to the goat, in the beginning of the tragic end of their family.<br/><br/>""The Witch: A New-England Folktale"" is an American/British/Canadian/Brazilian production by Robert Eggers that shows a scary view of religious fanaticism, ignorance and madness in the Seventeenth Century, in New England. The horror is psychological and explores the primal fear of a family oriented by orthodox religious principles and their fear of God. There are creepy moments most of them without gore. The direction is tight and the unknown cast has great performance. The cinematography is also impressive and depressive. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Bruxa"" (""The Witch"")"

","Everything about this film was creepy, from the surroundings to certain animals within the film. A must watch for true horror fans. I loved how the tension builds, it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.<br/><br/>Some may say it's a slow burner but I did not find this to be the case at all. It was truly atmospheric and gave me genuine chills in some parts. The characters, even the small children, played their parts brilliantly and this certainly adds to the tension of the film. A few parts were a little hard to understand (accent wise) but this does not deter from the tension this film brings at all. Overall, anyone looking for a genuinely creepy film, who has an open mind and has the ability to think about things, then this film is for you"
"thatistheplan","6","6","10","6 October 2016"," The acting is great. The movie is a bit slow for me however. There are also a few jump scares, unlike what others have claimed by here.
","What went we out into this movie to find? We travailed a vast horror. For what? For what?<br/><br/>If you went in to this movie knowing nothing, within the first 4 minutes you could tell it was a horror movie by the soundtrack alone. I don't really like this approach, because the soundtrack spoils the mood. In fact, the soundtrack precedes the actual mood of the film. You could argue it is creating the mood, sure, but I would rather let the story organically form to create the mood.<br/><br/>From the start of the movie, the woods are the central horror of the unknown. After all, the family is being banished into the woods. There are several long shots of the woods with droning violin music.<br/><br/>(Usually when naked babies appear in a film, they are male for some reason. I'm too afraid to google ""naked babies in film"" but it's for sure a trend. Draw your own conclusions.) <br/><br/>The effects of isolation are immediately shown on the banished, isolated family. A young boy, Caleb, takes a peek of his sister's (Thomasin's) breasts as the camera zooms in because she is the most fertile female. He peeks at her many times. Thomasin exhibits motherly behavior toward Caleb. The mother brings up this fact. She is jealous that she is growing old. And she notices Caleb looking and blames the girl as tempting him. But can you blame Caleb really?<br/><br/>The dialect is quite good in this movie. But since it's authentic, it also might require subtitles for one to understand easier.<br/><br/>The setting of this movie is always overcast. Many horror movies just lower the contrast and hope that it will seem scarier. To me, this seems a bit overdone.<br/><br/>I suspect that that rabbit is possessed by the Witch of the forest. You can tell this because of the rabbit's eyes. The goat also has peculiar eyes at one point. <br/><br/>The ending to this is unsatisfying. Nothing really gets explained, the plot lines go nowhere. We don't even really know if 1 person is dead or alive except Caleb. 6.3/10"

","Let me start out by saying if you like modern horror films then step away now, you aren't going to like this as it is intelligent, finds its own pace and is dripping in originality and subtle fine performances, basically the exact opposite of most of the output passed off as horror these days. The subtle classic ""witch"" symbolism will probably pass the iphone brigade by, their loss. It is certainly a film that demands your attention but pays it back ten-fold and buy the end the tension is ratcheted so high you'll only notice you haven't taken a breath for the last 5 mins once the credits roll. Certainly a film that will be watched more than once, probably in Europe as I can't see the American market enjoying this, it will probably be received the same way as any film with subtitles. All in all a fantastic, original film with more originality than so many other films with 10 times the budget."
"Samiam3","5","9","17","14 June 2017"," initially interesting film that is hungry for cheese, and sticks of it
","Perhaps the idea of a witch in the woods preying on a humble Christian family living at its edge was just too strait for writer / director Robert Eggars.<br/><br/>I liked the set up and the first half. We are presented with a small handful of intelligent and sympathetic characters and there is a clear sense of where (but not what) the threat is. Then just past the half way mark, the scenes get progressively silly and derivative of better horror movies. You feel the irony of a witchcraft movie that has been possessed and lost its soul and direction.<br/><br/>The decision to use strong period dialect is simultaneously frustrating and intriguing. It commands the audience to be intelligent listeners but there are times when sentences get muddled underneath the heavy British accents. The theme of fearing abandonment by god (or possession by darkness,) is prevalent as the story gets underway. At first it feels like a historically accurate motive for character vulnerability, but instead it becomes a device for hokey paranoia as our characters start pointing fingers and accusing each other of witchcraft. <br/><br/>The dramatic momentum that slowly accumulates in the first hour comes undone in the last half hour. The Witch starts as a story about characters but regretfully caves in and conforms to the horror genre by summoning gimmicks like the possessed animal that turns on its master. Once the chaos starts to pick up you get the feeling that a lame ending is inevitable. The last scene of a movie is visually quite strong without being showy, but the punchline feels meaningless beyond saying that darkness prevails; again very generic for a horror film.<br/><br/>Strong acting and eerie scenery are the additional highlights, but the finished product is neither scary nor memorable."
"mars-wink","9","13","27","24 May 2017"," Slow and Atmospheric in the Best Way
","The Witch is a superb example of horror derived from atmosphere and characterization, rather than the jump scares typical of lower-quality horror movies. The unique setting of early colonial America lends itself perfectly to the slow, tense pace of the film. Although the plot is fairly straightforward, it reveals itself with a feeling of inescapable dread. Excellent acting abounds, particularly from the father (Ralph Eneson) and the eldest child (Anya Taylor-Joy).<br/><br/>Overall, The Witch represents one of the best horror films in recent memory. If you enjoy slow/atmospheric/psychological horror, this is a must-see. If you are looking for an action/thriller/jump-scare horror, look elsewhere."
"Deimos-remus","10","13","27","20 February 2016"," The horror movie the masses don't deserve
","The Witch, much like films like Kubrick's The Shining or Polanski's Rosemary's Baby just makes the viewer feel uneasy and nerved right from the start. A slow-burning, subtle and reserved experience that lets you resonate with the characters and really experience the unraveling of their family unit. What really makes this film special is that there's so many things that it could've very easily done wrong, but handled every aspect with class, tact and respect. The term 'Scary' means something different for everybody, so deeming this film as ""un-scary"" does not mean a thing, I will say though that this film goes beyond just 'being scary', it's not that kind of film. It's much more unsettling and unnerving, getting under your skin rather than being overtly frightening or gory. Frights last a moment, but the ability to not only get under you skin, but linger there is a mark of a truly great horror film. <br/><br/>It's a story about losing faith, it's a story about guilt and how those things can tear a family apart. For those wanting a 'fire and brimstone' monster feature, you'll be sorely disappointed. This film is much more in the vein of masters like Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman with even a touch of Andrei Tarkovsky. It's amazingly and intimately well crafted and shot, scored, acted and researched. It takes its time to tell the characters' stories, but does so with a strange, otherworldly and totally supernatural feel. It's just as effective as an intense drama as it is a horror film. This is the kind of horror film that will be discussed for years to come, and only comes around once in a blue moon. <br/><br/>I don't want to give away anything in this review, but I will say this: For those that really enjoy the art of film, storytelling, character building and the craft in general, believe the hype. It's excellent. <br/><br/>But for those expecting a gory and fun, cartoonishly-satanist and jump-scare littered monster flick, stay away and don't ruin it for the others trying to enjoy their theater-going experience. You'll end up not enjoying it or will find it to be a tedious and boring watch. Even though at a trim 90 minutes, if you find it boring, you have no attention span whatsoever, but that's besides the point. <br/><br/>To cap it off, this is the kind of Horror film I'm always waiting for, especially considering the droves of wanton garbage that flood the theaters week after week, and after looking forward to the film for nearly a year and a half, I'm glad to say that it delivered on all fronts. It's as flawless of a film as you can get, and for this to be Eggers' debut feature, he's in for a hell of a career."

","Honestly I went into this expecting a slow horror. However I must say the acting was really good and so was the camera work but as a movie it's not a a slow horror movie leading to an amazing pay off instead it's a very boring movie about a family getting upset and doing typical family things around that time. I know that sounds dumb but the moment I seen the first thing causing the family to start their drama I knew immediately where the film was going and since I knew it was boring the entire time. If you found this movie exciting at all I would wonder if you ever learned or studied the salem witch trials because this is a typical ""family reacts to witch activity"" Usually for slow movies you need something to keep you intrigued some mystery or just something compelling which this film does not have. No intrigue, no mystery, no horror, no suspense, typical characters. This is kind of how I would some it up if this were a history channel special film, it would be an amazing film it would get an 8 out of 10 from me, however it is a Hollywood title playing in theaters. I payed a lot of money for my siblings and I to watch a higher quality history channel salem witch trials movie. In my opinion there are much better slower horror movies, here are some examples<br/><br/>-Kill List -I Saw The Devil -Gone Girl -Seven I know those last two aren't exactly horror or really ""slow"" but they are not fast either and much, much more worth your time then The Witch."

The acting was very good. You could tell each actor was thoroughly into their roles. Also the cinematography was beautiful. Some of the shots of the characters walking in the forest stand out the most in my mind. Apart from that it was a horrid mess. The characters speak in this form of old English that is barely understandable. This film needs subtitles desperately. Get ready to be completely disoriented by this films plot. Lots of things happen and they will never be explained or addressed (like a certain scene involving a crow or the kissing scene). The biggest problem I found with this movie is that it is boring. The big 'payoffs' in the plot are dull and left me more confused. The film's ending could have been much stronger if the witches were more developed as characters. Instead you are left with an ending that feels duct taped to the rest of the film. It feels really out of place and is a little too sci fi channel ""B-movie"" in my opinion.

","While there was one scene, early on in the film, of incredible terror, the balance of the film was entirely predictable, difficult artistically, and thematically set us back nearly 500 years in vilifying women and witches/ wiccans. While true to the hysterics of the time over anything the recent English immigrants could not understand and therefore labeled as evil, (the dense woods, disobedient women, breasts, etc.) artistically this film is a mess. Let's start with the overuse of blank screens for long seconds (minutes?) of time. This may have been intended to build suspense, especially with the use of fraught vocal music in the soundtrack, but it is used far too often, and the screen is kept blank too long, followed by- nothing! Apparently in this film, it's the equivalent of dropping a screen on stage while the actors change places or costumes. It could have been employed once or twice to great effect if the blank screen didn't last as long, (the viewer on my left mumbled ""WTF?!"" at the second or third use of this) and if it was followed by a surprise or shock to the viewer. Then there's the dialogue: approximately 25% of it, especially early in the film, is indecipherable and at different volumes. The elder son, Caleb, has a different (Cockney) accent than the rest of the family. OK, the Puritans were creepy in their singular devotion to The Bible, and living in and adapting to the apparently always dreary New England was a bit much for their imaginations. But why must women be portrayed always as The Shrew, The Temptress, or the Agent of Satan? I give this film 2 stars for its novel attempt to depict the life of early Puritan settlers in their uneducated, superstitious and hysterical ways. Otherwise, in all, I was mightily disappointed."

","The future of horror is here. Thy name is Robert Eggers. The Witch is close to being a perfect modern horror film. Reminiscent of classics from the mid-20th century, The Witch pushes the boundaries of what a film can accomplish, psychologically and visually, in scaring you. This is eye's wide open terror. You can hear it, you can smell it, you can feel it. Matched with performances that are all around breathtaking. Anya Taylor-Joy shocks the senses in her feature debut. Ralph Ineson as William is absolutely earth shattering. His booming, shivering voice praying to God for mercy will haunt you for days. The deeper we get into the curse of witches, as they inflict on this poor family, the darker and deadlier of a fate it becomes. None of us are spared either. Thomasin gives into the curse by the film's end, and by proxy, so do we all. In that sense, it's not as scary as it is hypnotic. But once you reenter the real world after your screening of The Witch will the dread of what you just watched overcome you. Boom. That's how you do Horror."

","Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" now replaces my all-time favorite horror film (previously Robert Wise's 1963, ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris, now a little dated). What the two do have in common is a literary-mindedness, fine performances, superior cinematography, and that which is new and strange, that is, nothing is predictable.<br/><br/>In the case of ""The Haunting"" sexual repression, loneliness and maybe a psychotic heroine; for ""The Witch,"" sexual tension from single room living as well as a religious repression, a dark foreboding wood, and a landscape unfamiliar to the inhabitant, that is, a New World. In both cases, an ignorance that needs some kind of definition so fear/panic can be managed. Ignorance is usually at the heart of the supernatural, but both films manage to convince the audience there is some kind of actual unknown force threatening the characters.<br/><br/>Eggers researched cases from the 1600's prior to the infamous Salem witch trials. Using court documents and lore, he's put together a convincing logic for what happens during the course of ""The Witch,"" whether it be contaminated food, starvation or isolation born out of new surroundings or expulsion from society.<br/><br/>The spookiness creeps in slowly. The personality quirks of the family explain a lot. Never before have two ""twins"" been more cause for alarm than Mercy and Jonas and their ""pet"" goat Black Phillip.<br/><br/>The use of archaic language both Christian incantation (and other darker forms of religion) really raise the hackles. When Mercy and Jonas taunt an untethered Black William (a goat) with repetitious rhyme, I wanted to flee. But family members are stuck with them, and tensions build in their new surroundings as various significant and insignificant mysteries begin, and alarm and panic consume the family where no one is trusted and blame comes quickly to the lips, causing more and more tension. As pioneers, they are living on the margin of survival, in and of itself terrifying.<br/><br/>What happens in the wood is both beautiful and fraught. Jarin Blaschke's painterly cinematography draws us in to the drama, as does the careful costuming and production design. The film harkens back to the work of Carl Theodore Dreyer's 1920 ""Leaves from Satan's Book,"" and masterful exploration of occult throughout his long career.<br/><br/>But it's the music that pushes this over the edge. Mark Korven's dissonant chorale and seemingly period instruments are as unfamiliar to us as the surroundings are for the family, driving us as mad as the fear that inhabits the characters.<br/><br/>All of this is accomplished in an almost casual way. But slowly the injection of the unknown and fear of it, consumes us without the usual tricks that have become so familiar (and anything-but-scary) the many horror films that are cranked out by the industry. ""The Witch"" is different which is bold enough. But it's also accomplished in what it sets out to do and earns a very special place in the canon of horror films."
"Salva20","8","5","8","10 July 2019"," Slow Burning Horror
","So if you're looking for a stereotypical horror film that has plenty of jump scares and over the top blood this movie is not for you. Where The Witch pulls it's horror from is how little it presents. The unsettling location for 95% of the movie takes place makes the characters and the viewer feel isolated. It's beautifully shot and the natural lighting adds to the gloomy setting.

","The Witch also known as the vvitch is a horror film taking place in the 16th century about a family who move to a house outside a family and when there young baby vanishes without a trace,they find out the evil leaving in the woods that may lead to witchcraft. The film has a very very good storyline and it pretty much had no plot holes to me,there were not actually that many scary scenes which made you appreciate the plot and when there were scary scenes,they were utterly terrifying when the kids were locked in the shed and they saw the witch at the end of the room that was very scary and pretty disgusting. The ending is why I did not give the film a ten it was really weird and then after I had to find out what it was about on Wikipedia and I'm guessing that she became a witch in the woods because she signed some contract with the devil disguised a goat??

","Making it his debut, the film is written and directed by Robert Eggers as it tells the story of a highly religious family in the 17th century of New England. After being apparently banished from their village, they begin their lives on a farm, where as mysterious things start to acre. The film introduces us to Anya Taylor-Joy as she gives a fine performance as the eldest daughter, Thomasin. It also stars Ralph Ineson who is terrific as the father, William, and Kate Dickie (whom you may recall from Game of Thrones) as the mother, Katherine.<br/><br/>Except for maybe a couple things, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when viewing this. But right after doing just that, I will say that this is the scariest, most disturbing film I have ever seen; not in my life, but certainly this year. I will say, however, that there are in fact flaws. The first few minutes of the film are slow, yes, and the dialogue throughout his difficult to understand most of the time. But with that said, there are few to many disturbing and instance scenes; more specifically, a lot of WTF? Moments. As for my verdict, this may not be for everybody, but I highly recommend giving it a try."

","This film might not be for everyone, but if you can get past the weird accents (which I have to think the filmmakers put an awful lot of time into developing) the Witch works. My suggestion is not to watch this as a traditional horror film in the sense of scary spooks jumping out, but as a case study into societal norms of Puritan womanhood in an increasingly modern world. Yes, the Witch has a feminist resonance to it. I even think the use of two V's in the title instead of a W allude to this. If you're not sure to what I'm referring, I suggest reading up on the goddess Venus and her connotations.<br/><br/>In this light, the Witch makes a lot more sense and deserves all 4 out of 4 stars."

","All I can say is that this film does a brilliant job at giving you the creeps without going for cheap jump scares. And being someone who hates jump scares, that was refreshing. <br/><br/>The Witch is about a Puritan family in the 1600s that is banished from their village, and then moves far away to a secluded area near a forest. In the forest, of course, resides a witch that kidnaps the family's youngest infant, and continuously messes around with the family throughout the movie. <br/><br/>A lot of people say this film can be too slowly-paced at times, which I agree with. But I thought the slow-burn and subtlty worked really well. There were never any big moments with reveals, the way most horror/mysteries are. Little things would keep going wrong, and the suspense just kept building very slowly and painfully. <br/><br/>But the ending definitely could've been played out a better...there were a few plot holes. If the goat was supposed to be the antagonist all along, what was the point of having the witch terrorize the family too? Also, who's responsible for kidnapping the twins, the witch or the goat? It was all too much to swallow at once, especially since the rest of the film was so much more subtle. <br/><br/>And of course, Thomasin ends up killing her mother, and then joining the witch's side, which was a bit shocking but expected in a way. I guess she had no choice, since her whole family was dead. And the opening voice-over of her confessing her sins to God could've been an overshadowing of the ending--that she desired evil all along, as much as she tried to go against it. Another theory I have is that she (ironically) sacrificed herself to evil in order to pay for her family's death...since Thomasin told her mother ""I love you"" after killing her. These are just my ideas though; I have no idea what the director intended to say there. <br/><br/>The cinematography, acting, dialogue, and score were solid. I'm amazed at how the actors were able to speak in character using such old dialogue, and I think it really contributed to how real the whole movie felt. A lot of people seem bothered by the filter, but I liked it. Imagining the movie with any more color makes me cringe...the filter fits the setting and mood perfectly enough. The score was subtle, like the film itself. It popped out when necessary and wasn't over dramatic. Almost nothing in this film was over-the-top except for the young kids' acting in some scenes. <br/><br/>Overall I'd say this is a quality film that's definitely worth watching. It's a different kind of horror though, so know what to expect before you watch it."
"tangojazz","1","24","57","27 February 2016"," ""The Witch"" was stupid and it is not a horror movie.
","I was expecting to be frightened out of my mind, to have nightmares, to see homicidal witches around every corner....No. After seeing ""The Witch"" last week, as the packed crowd for the evening showing laughed at the ending credits, my conclusion is that ""The Witch"" is an unbelievably ridiculous and poorly done drama set in seventeenth century New England. The movie was about this overly religious Puritan family consisting of a father, a mother, a baby (which gets kidnapped at the beginning),some twins, a son, and a teen age daughter. They get kicked out of a conservative religious congregation for being too ""conservative."" The family get banished to a dark and creepy forest where they get their butts kicked by their own fear and stupidity, and then later on get knocked off one by one (except for the teen age daughter)by a group of homicidal ""killer"" witches. I hated the whole damn family and didn't feel sorry for them at all. At all. First of all, this is my blow by blow description of why I hated them. First of all, there were the twin children who screamed and ranted throughout the picture like a bunch of god damn idiots. They were a big annoyance and distraction throughout. Why? Because they took me right out of the movie whenever they showed up on the screen. I felt like getting up and telling them to shut-up several times. I hated the extremely pathetic, needy mother. I thought the hulking, clueless dopey father was a moron. I was stunned at the stupidity of the son who had no sense of the danger he was in. I felt sorry for the daughter who just let everybody run over her. A lot of things in ""The Witch"" didn't make any sense. Like when the family's baby was kidnapped at the beginning of the story, you would think they would run back to the town they had left and gotten the police to help them (which is what you normally would do in a situation like that). They didn't. I felt no sympathy for these people. And the ending was too idiotic to be believed. The teen age daughter gets turned into a naked crazy witch who flies in the air, laughing (with other, flying naked witches). Huh? What was that all about? The ending felt like it came from another movie. Well, like a Ken Russell movie from 60s and 70s (if you know who he is). See this movie at your own risk. Or not."
"greekniko","2","17","38","27 February 2016"," Not scary and not entertaining at all...
","This movie was very disappointing to say the least. I went into about a half full theater with decent expectations from all the good reviews I had read beforehand. Let me start by saying there is some good in this film. The attention to detail for the period it takes place in is very evident. Also, the acting was decent in my opinion. However, this should not be considered a horror film. There is nothing scary about it! There is some tension build up, but it never goes anywhere. This film is more about a family drama than anything else. When it ended, I had the same reaction as nearly everyone in the theater, which was ""Wait, that's it""? No one in the crowd looked pleased, and I heard multiple verbal outbursts from people saying ""What the eff did I just watch"" or ""Wow what a waste of my time"" etc. I mean people were very visually angry with the film. Even the guy at the popcorn stand asked me what movie I had seen, and when I said ""The Witch"", he asked if I thought it sucked too. I see some of the people that have reviewed this film on here who claim that it's for intellectuals and that it has a deeper message and such. Let me just say that that's a bunch of nonsense because I think you're reaching for something that isn't there. If you wanna watch a period piece with a ""deeper meaning"" then go watch a documentary or put on the history channel. If you actually want to be entertained, then by no means should you watch this film! It's a waste of time and money."
"nitzanhavoc","9","8","15","25 June 2018"," The real challange was finding a reason not to rate 10. Stop reading and go watch.
","Often when reviewing Horror films (my favorite genre) I discuss the acute necessity of lowered expectations if one hopes to enjoy, as sadly this undervalued genre lacks the investment (professional, financial and creative) it so rightfully deserves. More often than not a film of the genre graced with a great trailer, an intriguing poster or any form of positive publicity (mostly informal) is devoid of any remotely sufficient quality of story, acting or cinematics. However, in regards to The Witch - worry not. Bring on your highest expectations and be mentally prepared to trash this film as soon as it's finished, it would do you no good. In my opinion, The Witch is one of the best Horror films you'll watch.<br/><br/>Everything about The Witch feels classical and fancy, as something about the combination between Little House in the Prairie and Poltergeist hits the atmospheric spot perfectly. The setting, while simple almost to the point of being unimpressive (but just almost), is original and very seldom implemented in such a terrifying plot. The story revolves around William and his Family, a stereotypically devout (even fanatic) Christian family from 19th century New England. After leaving their community on account of its inhabitants not being sufficiently Christian by William's judgement, the family establishes their own little homeland in a nearby rural plain. A wooden shack, a farm, a stock of barnyard animals and the satisfaction of a hard day's work and doing well by one's cherrished deity. That is, until a mysterious and nefarious force begins to torment the family, weakening their faith as well as their family ties and letting their paranoia drive them apart to the point of hatered.<br/><br/>The acting is superb by all members of the cast, particularly the breathtaking Anya Taylor-Joy (daughter Thomasin). You know all these slasher films casting eye candies with mediocre and unconvincing acting? Forget them. Taylor-Joy is genuinely authentic and professional aside from being captivating like a renaissance model. Harvey Scrimshaw (her brother, Caleb) also with a superb performance, damaged somewhat solely by what is obviously a direction error. Ralph Ineson (William) is also a pleasure to watch and experience. Aside from the acting skills, the casting has been as accurate and clever as can be (probably along with some excellent writing, directing and art-dress-makeup). Each and every character feels real, authentic and compelling, making me personally feel like each and every cast member was made for their role. Enough to warrant a 6.5 even if this has been the film's sole quality. It isn't. Not remotely.<br/><br/>The story is an emotional roller-coaster, sharply and almost violently dragging the viewer from sadness to anticipation, from suspense to fear, from pity to anger. Indeed, the dark force tormenting the family seems to affect the viewers similarly, drawing them into the story and making the entire experience all the more horrific. It isn't a literary masterpiece, but a good screenplay needs not be to achieve its goal. It only needs to tell a compelling and clever story with the right dosage of fear. Add to that the 19th century setting, the old English texts and the farmhand costumes - and you feel like you're told an old terrifying folktale. An absolute pleasure!<br/><br/>The only aspect in which I felt the film didn't fulfill its potential was the ending. A worthy attempt to create a plot twist was indeed made, but unsuccessfully. The ending feels like the worst part of the film, the least exciting and not at all frightening. From certain perspectives one might even consider it a happy ending, which is completely out of touch with the mood the film worked so hard to create. In a word: anticlimactic, the all too familiar bane and curse of the genre. While The Witch is simply that good as to not suffer in quality on this fault's account - I can't help but feel disappointed, as it really was one good ending (not even great, just good and better than the actual one) from being a Horror masterpiece.<br/><br/>In summary? I can't remain objective, I loved this film too much. I simply feel obligated to encourage each and every cinema fan to turn off the lights and watch The Witch, preferably at night and home alone. Of course, many of you might disagree with me, it's a matter of subjective preferences after all, but I personally am grateful for the experience The Witch has put me through."

","THE WITCH is a haunting little opus in which film maker Robert Eggers reaches back into the folklore and living history of the United States to produce a story that's going to stick with you awhile. In this tale, a 17th century Puritan father breaks with his pilgrim forebears over Christian doctrine and leads his family out into an unforgiving section of wilderness which seemingly is also occupied by a blood cult of Wiccans. Things do not go well. That's all I'm going to tell you. 
But here there be mastery. No jump scares, no blood sloshed from here to creation, no zombies. Just good story telling, an outstanding cast, and some imagery that will have you up staring at the ceiling until two in the morning. That's what the good spook stories do.

","""The Witch"" is just a brilliant film, and plenty scary. Despite the divide between the critics and audiences on this film (as can be expected by any horror film A24 touches), I highly agree with the critics.<br/><br/>One thing that I will talk about is the film's score. I would compare it to ""The Shining"", in the sense that it added to the film's creepy atmosphere. Did it provide some jumpscare music? Yes. But did it do it very often? Thankfully, no.<br/><br/>Speaking of jump scares, I actually counted how many there were in this movie: 2. This movie managed to scare me silly with only 2 jump scares. Do you want to know why? Because the movie is very disturbing and creepy.<br/><br/>The acting and writing in the film are splendid. The entire cast did a fine job, especially with the meaty dialogue they were given. Their performances made some already scary moments even scarier. I also loved the the dialogue felt extremely contextualized. This wasn't like in ""The Village"", where the dialogue sounded relatively modern despite its supposed 18th century setting. This film's dialogue sounded so old (or should I say ""olde"") that I almost had trouble understand them some times. Eggers has proven himself with this fine debut.<br/><br/>My only problem I had with this film was that it should have taken the disturbing content slightly down a notch. That's it. That's my only complaint.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" (or ""The VVitch"", if you want to mock the marketing) is a splendidly scary film that should be watched by any horror movie aficionado."

","Saw The Witch on Blu Ray rather than cinema as felt that the cinema's public setting would ruin a film which relied heavily on the right atmosphere in order to effectively tell the story. I was right. For this film, you need silence. It is silence which lends this film its menace, rather than showy special effects. <br/><br/>The Witch is set in the New World of the Puritan fathers. The main family of this film are mother and father, eldest daughter, younger brother, twins and a baby, newly born. Having been cast out of their puritan community for going against the community's teachings, in some way, the father takes his family to leave on the edge of a dark wood. He builds enclosures for goats and sets about growing corn to feed his family. His family pray regularly and look to God for forgiveness of their sins regularly. They are in all senses of the phrase, God Fearing people. <br/><br/>Within this close and claustrophobic environment, tensions start to mount. The youngest member of the family disappears and is thought to be stolen by a creature in the woods who is seen as using the child for its nefarious ends. The baby is not seen again and with no idea of what happened to him. All this leads to the mother of the family (Katie Dickie, fresh from Game of Thrones) crying and accusing family members, mostly the eldest girl (Thomasina - played by Anya Taylor-Joy) of theft of a silver cup. Then there is the eldest boy, Caleb and his father going hunting in the woods looking for venison. They find a hare which is not killed and lose their dog in the process. More lies to the mother about the nature of their trip. <br/><br/>Thomasina is ordered to clean her brother's clothes at the river on the edge of the wood. She does this and notices her younger brother taking a interest in her body. The twins join them and start joking about there being a witch in the woods. Thomsina holds the little girl down stating that she is the witch and she has made a pact with the devil etc. More upset and shouting. <br/><br/>Naturally, things go from bad to worse. Caleb goes into the forest with his sister to find the family dog and she loses the only horse they have and Caleb finds the family dog dead with its entrails hanging out. He also discovers the woodland house of the 'witch', a seemingly young, beautiful woman who kisses him and 'bewitches' him. Thomasina discovers him after a terrible night and he is naked and feverish. He babbles deliriously, then dies. In that moment, Thomasina is accused of being a witch by the twins, however, she also tells them that the family's black billy-goat - called Black Philip has been talking to the twins. Their father locks all of them in the goat shed whilst he buries his son and considers going back to the plantation /community for help. <br/><br/>It is at this point, after much slow burn and build up that the film gains a greater pace. The mother 'sees' her precious dead children returned to her and 'breastfeeds' her lost baby. Unbeknown to her, a raven pecks at her breast, leaving it bloodied. The father then wakes up and goes to see how the children in the goat shed are. He finds the goat shed destroyed and the black goat running wild. The black goat then goads him repeatedly and painfully and he dies. Then the mother accuses Thomasina of sin and tries to kill her. Thomasina then kills her mother by stabbing. <br/><br/>There is nothing left in the farm for Thomasina. Her father is dead, her mother dead, her brother has died of fever (presumably) and its not known what has happened to the twins. It is at this point, that it is likely that Thomasina will die too of hunger, exposure or madness. <br/><br/>Thomasina withdraws to the goat shed following Black Philip. She asks Black Philip to speak to her as he did to the twins. Almost at the point of giving up, Black Philip answers and tells her how to get the things she wants - in this case the taste of butter (being properly fed) and a pretty dress (being a Puritan, wearing pretty dresses was considered vain and sinful). Black Philip tells her to remove her clothing (a bit of a cliché) and sign the book offered (presumably, offering her soul to the devil in exchange for a better life - again a cliché). He also helps her to sign it. <br/><br/>This is at the point where the film enters superstitious nonsense territory. I shall not disclose any more of that as it belongs to the realms of nonsense in the vein of Denis Wheatley Hammer House of Horror film. It is the only part of the film which let it down, unfortunately.<br/><br/>If you watch this film as an attempt to portray witchcraft in a realistic light, I wouldn't bother. You ain't going to find that here. <br/><br/>As a fictional account in which superstition, isolation and religious mania can play havoc with the mind, it excels in that nicely. Lots of symbolism abounds in this film, from ravens, goats, hares and the use of colour within the forest (the 'witch' has a red cloak). Much of the symbolism is about suppressed lust having no outlet within a religious household. The presence of the 'witch' as an older woman naked and milking one of the goats is loaded with metaphor and symbolism. <br/><br/>It is not a particularly horrific film. There are some shocks and surprises but nothing really jumpy, just a slow burn."

","""The Witch"" is one of the most bizarre and disturbing coming-of-age movies I've ever seen. It's definitely not ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Pretty in Pink."" The characters in those films may have their share of problems, but they're nothing in comparison to the ones the family members in ""The Witch"" are dealing with! <br/><br/>In 1630 New England, panic and despair envelops a farmer (Ralph Ineson), his wife (Kate Dickie) and four of their children when youngest son Samuel suddenly vanishes. The family blames Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the oldest daughter who was watching the boy at the time of his disappearance. With suspicion and paranoia mounting, twin siblings Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) suspect Thomasin of witchcraft, testing the clan's faith, loyalty and love to one another in ""The Witch.""<br/><br/>There are so many different viewpoints you can watch the movie from. Christians might see it as either blasphemous or cautionary. Satanists consider it be an encouragement for people to look outside the box of conventional religious beliefs. Others will see it as just a modern folk tale warning of unhealthy family dynamics and the dangers of isolationism and paranoia.<br/><br/>Is it a cautionary tale warning of the dangers of playing with the occult and Satanism? Does the movie encourage audiences to explore life outside the ""confines"" of Christian religions? Is it warning us to always question our beliefs and not just follow the herd? Honestly, it could be any of these. <br/><br/>As a Christian, I find the ambiguity in the message of ""The Witch"" to be slightly dangerous for those not grounded in their own faith. You're led to believe one thing through three-quarters of the film, even if the family members are extremely fanatic. Suddenly, the direction we're traveling in seems to switch gears.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is rated R for disturbing violent content and graphic nudity. Much of the nudity is shadowed, blurred, or an old lady. I'm not defending it, just further explaining. Some of it is of oldest daughter Anya Taylor-Joy. She is underage in the film, even though in real life she's now 20. None of it is meant to be sexual in any way. <br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a great psychological thriller that sets itself apart from the mainstream jump-scare horror films we're getting right now.

Great acting, authentic-looking sets and wardrobe, and real shooting locations make everything feel even more authentic."

Eggers maintains a regular pace throughout the flick to milk our fears without going into the shoddy territory. We feast on some high quality filmmaking.<br/><br/>The topic of witches has rarely ever touched such a tangible and lucid style of direction. You haven't experienced a disquiet quite like this before, and gore that throws you into fits of anxiety! Acts of witchcraft create a metaphor which is quite clamorous if you really pay heed. You cannot help but feel helpless, cannot stop feeling sorry for the characters entailed, by silently wishing them goodwill. But alas! this is one of the darkest movies ever made. So, if you have a feeble heart just be prepared mentally and you can bear the imminent.<br/><br/>The Witch isn't exactly your average horror flick that tries to scare you with disappearing-appearing acts, or by messing around with the cameras, or via zooming in or zooming out effects. Au contraire, it is one of those purest forms of horror that is allowed to gradually develop in you, as you scale its frames right from the very beginning. Very engaging stuff that will leave you traumatized with abominable witch acts! You cannot help but marvel at the way Eggers captures his gorgeous frames. The serenity of the woods that he arrests in his frames icing it with a harrowing music in the background is beyond comparison. Captivating landscapes and natural shots that he takes make the movie a visual entertainer. You can almost read the tranquility of the woods through his endearing screens.<br/><br/>The casting has been done brilliantly. Screenplay is smitten with Shakespearean English which some might find hard to understand. Music is very grim but just about perfect for a horror movie. The Witch is a well manufactured affair that Robert Eggers manages to conjoin with his rad direction and writing style."

The beauty of this film is, for me, the atmosphere, taking place in the XVII century, packed with many thee and thou, with a religious puritan family, and the psychological horror, you don't if what you see is something supernatural or not, until the last thirty minutes obviously. Some scenes are disturbing, yet subtle, I think, and this is why I loved this film. I liked all the characters, most of them were used in the best way possible, didn't like the twins. Anya-Taylor Joy and Ralph Ineson, his voice suited perfectly with the film concept, were great here. The disturbing aspect, the tension, the moments that were unsettling, the build-up, everything here is great. The costume design, the production design, the soundtrack, the cinematography here, it is perfect, and looks like the film was shot during the 17th century, it was so emmersive, at least for me, I am a history fanboy so the experience was amazing.<br/><br/>Oh, and Black Phillip. One more reason to love this film."

"dtrani","7","3","4","14 October 2019"," Exceptional Horror; unsatisfying ending
","The Witch never failed to keep my attention and always seemed to work hard to keep the flow going. Every aspect and scene seemed to have a purpose towards the ending (except Caleb's sexually curious/ developing moments) and felt overall great. The film is horrific and works so well, being that there is practically no jump scares in this film (like 1 or 2) and its better that way.
The only problem I have is with the ending. The final scenes bring a huge build up only to drop down with a simple ending. That kind of ""what?"" or ""huh?"" kind of ending. It leaves you wishing that the filmmakers would have wrote it a different way. A more satisfying way.
Other than the ending the film does everything it intends to do and is very unique to other horror films."
"dragonempress-16006","7","3","4","4 June 2019"," Horror for Historians (in a good way)
","This is not a horror movie by modern standards. There's no gore, jumpscares, or set formula of cast or events. It is, however, a work of art well-cared for by its creators. The setting, costumes, acting, writing, and directing make for a film firmly set in our very real history, with people's very real fears and anxieties manifest beautifully in a tense, dark atmosphere.
This film hit me a certain way that others may or may not experience. I'm an avid amature historian, with an upbringing with both devout Christianity and a mentally unstable (sometimes abusive) parent, so relating to the characters' plights, especially Thomasin's, came easily. The characters were well written and shaped, and all of them seemed to have an important place in the story. Except maybe Jonas. He didn't have much screentime or development, but whatever.
The writing is excellent, with perfect period dialogue and well-paced scenes, though the overall story did seem a little rushed, and the last scene was just a bit too out there to mesh well with the rest of the film. The costumes were perfect, and the monochrome motif of the film didn't feel forced or exaggerated. None of the film did, really. It just flowed it's own way, not worrying about being too action-heavy or scary. Certain scenes were disturbing, but didn't overstay their welcome, and things weren't spelled out for you at any point. It makes you think, it makes you wonder why, how, and what.
There's not a lot wrong with this film, except for it's misbranding as a horror movie. Yes, technically it is horror, but it's a calm type of horror that you often don't see anymore. I think that is what really threw people off and gave it a bad start with its audience. This kind of film isn't for everyone, but it certainly is a gem to the crowd that can appreciate the dedication that went into it."
"basedeggs","10","3","4","11 April 2019"," Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?
","Maybe not a movie for everyone if you don't like the classic horror or the classic jumpscare infested movie. However, this movie is to put it simple- A piece of art.<br/><br/>This movie takes place during Pre Salem time. Based on documented events and court trials, it's scarily accurate. The way they speak, dress, act- I absolutely love the historical accuracy of this film.
The movie is about a family representing all that is against the church at the time- they are all sins and none are completely innocent. It's about a family coping with loss and coping with the issues that a modern family might have- Such as sibling arguments and the idea of not having a means of living- or money for most of us. This movie puts up a very long build-up, suspense filled and to those who might not be very artsy- slow and possibly annoying.
But I simply loved it. The actors are perfect for there roles and uncomfortably chosen too. The cinematography is something else as well, with shots that are hard to explain or shots that are beautiful and light on the eyes, really quite enjoyable. Another note that some of the scenes may even require research to understand such as the beginning scene with the baby due to its historical accuracy, which to me is just more fun... But maybe not for others who just want the plot shoved down there throat.<br/><br/>Anyway if you're not into jumpscary stuff- Don't watch this. If you're feeling kinda artsy and into something thats accurate and kind of beautiful, I'd watch this. Really an awesome movie :)"

Nothing is explained, motives are unclear and there are many scenes that don't need to be in there. Rationalism is thrown out the window and replaced with religion. Many actions don't match their characters personality. And the ending left you wanting more. <br/><br/>On the positive side, if you like slow and creepy movies without the need for depth - this is a great option."
"Beginthebeguine","Null","3","4","25 May 2016"," What went we out in this wilderness to find
","At first viewing I really didn't know what to make of this movie. I thought perhaps that it was an attempt at an art house horror film. Some of the scenes made me think of the art of John Atkinson Grimshaw and others of Fuseli. Almost at times too disturbing to look at, and too disturbing to look away. The story is of some mad fairy tale, as if puritan America had be somehow correct in their witch-madness and crones haunted the woods in search of babies in which they might steal for their unholy rituals.<br/><br/>I had to watch it again.<br/><br/>The second time I realized that it was not really an attempt at an art house horror film, but rather beautiful in itself as a piece of art. It lacks compassion however and views the harshness of life as the horror itself as this family comes apart in the situation they find themselves. They really are good people, for their time at least, and they try to love each other as their fantasy of life-- where good conquers evil-- erodes over the course of a few weeks. <br/><br/>A Stylized fairy tale with no clear moral, though exceptional photography and acting. My biggest criticism would be the black-outs that the director uses to change certain scenes. They are quite long. That is a pretty petty complaint and really not worthy of this beautiful, yet disturbing film that has long lingered in my thoughts well after the final credits."
"wakaporter","8","12","25","2 October 2017"," Scared But Absolutely Satisfied
","WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br/><br/>We are told an age-old folk tale about a witch as it would have been understood by the Puritan psych in 1630's New England, as absolutely true. And it is told oh so horrifically through the chilling crescendos of musician Mark Korven, the beautiful cinematographic direction of Robert Eggers, the big acting performance of a small cast, and the unnerving hidden messages of the plot. Even hours after the credits stopped rolling, my mind was still trapped in the unwelcoming atmosphere of this 1630's world. For effectively rattling my peace of mind, I give The Witch an 8/10.<br/><br/>Let me first give a well-earned applause to the cast, especially to the two actors who play the older siblings. Harvey Scrimshaw, who is a new coming child actor, illustrates the curiosity of a growing boy and gives a possessed performance I will never forget. And Anna Taylor-Joy, who plays the center character, was given more room than the other actors because of the ambiguous role her character was supposed to portray, and own it completely. <br/><br/>As for the music, it does it's job right from the get go. In the first 5 minutes of the film there is a moment where the music crescendos during a slow-moving shot of the family praying on their new settlement. It successfully makes a boring backdrop of trees seem like a sinister hell-trap. This was one of the many moments where the soundtrack was successful in creating an atmosphere that screams (sometimes literally) there is something bad going on here. But this atmosphere would not have been so successful if it wasn't for the cinematographic choices of Eggers that makes the horrors ever palpable. My favorite was that of restricted narration, where we are held in suspense guessing what our main character's faces are witnessing, we become eager yet terrified to see the truth. <br/><br/>But what really made this movie deeply unsettling for me was that the monster to be feared was not just the witch, but also the urge of the main characters to resort to hasty generalization in regard to who the witch was. Thomasin does not fit into the idealized feminine of her time and place--one who is to never question ""thy"" father (or any patriarch), is to never dare even think about disobeying the religious doctrines of Puritan faith, is to be sent off to serve another family upon reaching physical maturity, and is to bear children and clean. It is consistently inferred that Thomasin urges to cross the borders placed on her by her world (family, societal, and religious world). Her opposition to her role combined with the fact that she is a young woman, made her a the likely witch in her family's Puritan eyes. As a result of the continued stifling of her freedom, suppression of her creativity, and the rejection of her by her own mother and father (and the stressors of having to live on a dying farm in the middle of nowhere) she was desperate for acceptance and comfort. She was a perfect target for Satan to lure into signing away her soul. I was deeply unnerved by this movie because our main protagonist eventually became the witch her family unlovingly and falsely blamed her of being."

","The less you know about this film before you watch it, the better. The themes could find no better setting than the 17th century New England recluse scenery where this mythos has the precise place to exist and expand on its own.<br/><br/>First time writer/director Robert Eggers is given (almost) full liberty to embrace and elaborate on the weird and the hypnotic, creating an ever-growing and unsettling atmosphere of fear and discomfort. The film hearkens back to those classical psychological frightening horror movies of old, such as Rosemary's Baby or The Haunting where more is made out of less: suggestion is key, actual display is minimal (but ever present and upcoming). When the time comes, the unsettlement is so severe that the Gothic-demented folkloric horror shown grabs hold of whatever composure is left. The Witch is a superior film, masterfully shot and executed, not designed for repeated viewings but intended for a lasting imprint of fear and homage to the mythology it is inspired by."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","7","12","25","15 January 2017"," Superbly executed, amazing production but not scary to me. But is to some.
","Production and costume designer Robert Eggers directs his first feature length debut about a family settling down in New England in the 1630s who experience something of the supernatural. <br/><br/>Eggers previous movie roles really shines through as the whole production is on point, especially the sets and the costumes. The film is often dark, even during the daylight hours giving an enormous sense of bleakness throughout. <br/><br/>Ralph Ineson leads his devout Christian family with his wife and five children, who struggle to keep the farmstead going and there's possibly something working against them other than the elements. <br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy plays the eldest of the children and is usually shackled with the responsibility of tending to her younger siblings while father and boy go off to hunt. But they soon fall prey to the Witch who lives in the nearby woods, but not how you might expect. <br/><br/>Ineson is amazing and truly deserves much larger roles than the ones he's played previously. Taylor-Joy already appears to getting noticed as quite the star with Morgan and soon to be released Split. But the whole cast here perform amazingly well, and the script is quite astonishing with impressive diction. <br/><br/>Mark Korven does quite the eerie score which probably makes up for a lot of the atmosphere, it resonates right through you immersing the viewer deeper in the film and I strongly suggest not listening to it in isolation alone. <br/><br/>Unfortunately with all these key elements, the story, the script, the haunting score and the production as a whole, it's not at all scary and is more of a drama than horror. It certainly has that feel of the classic horrors like the original Wicker Man, but it just didn't get to me like it maybe should have. <br/><br/>Having said that, this film is definitely split into two camps. While some, like myself didn't get the full affect, others would find this frightful; even Stephen King, the master of horror himself has stated the film to be terrifying, so don't take my word for it not being scary. It's superbly executed, well performed and brilliantly written, but it's a personal shame I didn't take to it. <br/><br/>Running Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 9 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 1 The Extra Bonus Points: 0<br/><br/>66% 7/10"

"a_chinn","9","4","6","13 November 2018"," Chilling slow burn horror chamber piece carefully balances psychological and supernatural horror
","Set in 1630s New England, a family that's been shunner by their community over a religious dispute is forced to move far into the forest on their own. The film is told from the perspective of the eldest daughter, Anya Taylor-Joy in a standout performance that's also her film debut, one day is watching her baby brother who mysteriously disappears before her very eyes. It's revealed that a witch has stolen the unbaptized child for a blood sacrifice. At that point, the family begins to suspect one another of consorting with the devil and practicing witchcraft, which is where things begin to unravel. First time writer/director Robert Eggers has made something of a minor masterpiece with this slow burn horror film that never quite comes out to explicitly state whether anything supernatural is happening or if it's all in the paranoia imaginations of it's characters. This isn't to say the film isn't scary, because it's scary as hell. Although not a standard jump-scare horror film in manner of ""The Conjuring"" or ""Paranormal Activity,"" Eggers delights in slowly building tension between characters and peppering it with some truly haunting and chilling imagery. When Taylor-Joy's younger twin siblings befriend a goat named Black Phillip, hold onto your horses! There are few films I would visually compare this too (Dante Tomaselli is possibly the only current horror filmmaker I might compare Eggers visual style of horror). It's shot primary using natural lighting and the camera is largely invisible in that it doesn't draw attention to itself with showy pans or zooms. It's primarily frightening and chilling static images that stick with you, whether it's Black Phillip striding through the forest, a red cloaked raven haired beauty becoming the viewer closer, or some of the more overt horror images I won't spoil here which may or may not be hallucinations or dreams. Eggers has stated the film is based on folktales, fairytales and written accounts of historical witchcraft, including journals, diaries, and court records, with much of the dialogue coming directly from these primary sources, which gives the film a sense of authenticity that's missing from many period films about witchcraft. Witches have long been a horror film staple, but they rarely come off well. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is likely the best film about witches and like this film, it rode a delicate balance between supernatural and psychological, but no film about witches has better captured the folktale/folklore elements of witchcraft than ""The Witch."" The silent film ""Häxan"" may be the only other film I can think of that possibly captures this period feel, but that silent film documentary style was quite different from a narrative form of storytelling. In ""The Witch,"" the imagery of a black goat with a broken horn, all the talk of ""signing the book,"" different animals which may or may not be familiars, talk of a witch's teat, or the plot point around an unbaptized child all feel straight out folklore and effectively tap into primal audience fears. The film also greatly benefits from a truly remarkable score by composer Mark Korven, who creates an unsettling dissonant soundtrack using a minimalist approach. Korven actually built his own original instruments to create some of the frightening and original sounds used for the film's score, which makes the soundtrack to ""The Witch"" one of my most favorite film scores in years. Overall, ""The Witch"" is not a standard horror film that will appeal to your average Fangoria gore-hound, but is more of an arthouse horror film for horror fans who appreciate a slow burn horror style of filmmaking that takes its time to build character and tension."
"raphaellecat","9","4","6","5 November 2018"," ""who be the witch of the wood?""
","A triumphant debut for director Robert Eggers who crafts a terrifying exercise in slow-building horror with The Witch, perhaps the year's most daunting watch.<br/><br/>The story centers around a family in 1630s New England as they are haunted by supernatural forces such as witchcraft, black magic and possession. The first thing Robert Eggers successfully establishes is the setting from which this takes place. An unbelievable achievement in what can only seem like the 17th century, the filmmaker captures not only the tone of such a life but incorporates a script that breathes a Shakespearean essence which further elevates the drama and heightens the horror. The Witch invitingly creates such a dreary and desolate mood that often times feels suffocatingly unbearable and yet remarkably compelling, it is as if the film itself uses supernatural forces to allure you, but that's just great filmmaking don't worry. The cast here are impeccable, consisting of only 6 actors, they immediately set an emotionality that will secure your investment for the rest of the running time. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are veterans who never miss a beat, even with terrific child actors lead by a superb newcomer, Anya Taylor-Joy, who perfectly seizes the accent and blend moments of drama with horror.<br/><br/>The Witch is immaculately constructed, with exquisite performances and a haunting tale about the decay of a family corrupted by the witches of the woods, no pointy noses or crooked hats in this one however."

","THE WITCH is a well-regarded slice of historical horror set in Puritan America in 1630. The plot follows a single farming family as they relocate to the woods to raise their children and livestock, only to find their lives blighted by hints of witchcraft. That this film works for the most part is because it takes a realistic approach to the material, focusing on the psychology of the characters involved rather than sticking to CGI ghosts or demons or jump scares. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are reliably good in support, but the main joy here is in the careful, subdued lead performance from Anya Taylor-Joy, who tackles a difficult role and makes it entirely sympathetic. The one thing I dislike about this film is the cheap, depressing digital look, full of greys and browns and blues and little life from beginning to end; this kind of visuality is already a modern horror cliche and it could do with being stamped out. The twist ending is also extremely stupid. Otherwise, check this out."

This is meant with a context to the movie being bleak and dark, whilst the dialogue and tempo matches the tone. This makes up for some high quality close-ups, long drawn out pans of the scenery, and slowly zooming in with tangering background-music. <br/><br/>When it comes to the story, it's so intense and mysterious that it holds the drawn out parts interesting.

"prabhatrayal","10","4","6","17 January 2018"," One of the Best Horrors of 21st Century
","Writer-Director Robert Eggers' debut film The Witch redefines horror filmmaking. It is not that scary and there is no gore but the atmosphere he creates for the film is so tense that you keep thinking something macabre is going to happen. That, in my opinion, is an achievement. The meaning of Horror has changed over time. Earlier, we had films like Rosemary's Baby, Suspiria and The Shinning which relied heavily on the atmosphere, music, and story rather than monsters behind the closets. But nowadays, almost every single horror film relies on cheap tricks to scare the audience which may or may not be good depending on who you ask it to. These movies are so frantic and desperate to scare the audience that they don't focus on the other elements of the film. Sometimes, it may be effective but most of the time, it isn't. It has become old, cliched and predictable. The most important aspect of a film is storytelling, and if you fail at that, if you sacrifice that, then there's no point in making a film. Fortunately, we have seen some brave attempts in the last few years from some passionate filmmakers. The Babadook, it Follows, and, The Cabin in the Woods were amazing films that were not completely hollow and bereft of emotions. The Witch is another such gem from A24.<br/><br/>Based on the Salem Witch trials which took place in the early 17th century, The Witch tells the story of a Puritan family. They (Husband, Wife and Five Children including an infant) are banished from their village over some disagreement with the community. They decide to live at the edge of the Woods thinking of it as a gift from the God, only to find themselves the target of an unnerving terror that lays in the woods. Soon, their infant disappears and things take an ugly turn. Once is starts terrorizing them, they can't make heads and tails of it. Weird things start happening in the midst of this paranoia, the family members turn on each other. Is it the work of a Witch? Are they being hunted by the Devil? Is the God punishing them?<br/><br/>Reviewing a film like this is very difficult. Most of the people won't like it because it sells itself as horror and people are going to be disappointed as there isn't much horror in the film, at least not in the way people expect. That is the reason it is rated 6.8 on IMDb whereas the RottenTomatoes ratings are at 91%. People don't like slow movies (most of them). They expect something to happen every second so that they can keep devouring their popcorn. The Witch is completely opposite of that. It will be loved by those who see filmmaking as an expression of art and not just mere entertainment. The Witch excels at technical things and it gets most of the things right. The atmosphere in this film is creepy. I have never seen anything like that in any other horror film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous. Every frame has been crafted with great precision to aid in building the atmosphere. Some shots are long and the camera keeps zooming in, which kind of makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy. The camera does not make any sudden movements, it moves slowly, zooming in, zooming out, immersing you in this whole madness. The greyish color grading makes everything look lifeless and bleak, which adds to the horror element. The shots in the woods often include the actors at the bottom half so the trees look enormous, symbolizing how insignificant and helpless the family really is. The walks in the woods make up for some really tense moments.<br/><br/>In one of the early shots, the camera shows the family sitting on the ground and praying. They think their prayers have been answered and they have found a perfect place to settle down. Then the camera keeps zooming in towards the woods before fading into black, almost soaking you in this inevitable dread and hysteria that follows. It's scenes like this that make The Witch an absolute joy to watch.<br/><br/>Some choices are very interesting and thoughtful. During one of the scenes, we see Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy) and her brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshow) sitting near a pond. This scene serves two purposes. It shows that there is a pond/creek nearby where they get their water from. It also tells you more about the story. I can't spoil what happens during this scene but it is there for a reason. Also, look at the color grading and how grey things look.<br/><br/>The night scenes are filmed with the minimal use of artificial lights. Most of the time, candles are used and the scenes are dimly lit. You can't help but think about something evil lurking in the dark. It is the fear of that unknown that scares you. It also results in some beautifully crafted shots such as the one attached below.
the witch haunting<br/><br/>But that being said, the most frightening character in The Witch is the atmosphere. Especially, The woods which is the resting place for the witches and other devilish things. That is what makes it relentlessly terrifying. Just take a look at the below pic for example. Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy) is stuck in the woods and it is starting to frighten her. The Cinematographer captures that feeling of dread by filming the huge trees in the background. He does not show the full view. Not knowing how high the trees go and how deep the woods are is what scares us. She looks helpless as everything seems much bigger than her.<br/><br/>This whole atmospheric treatment results in the feeling of paranoia, which will linger with you till the end. It also does not shy away from filming some vomit-inducing scenes.<br/><br/>The other important aspect of The Witch that helps build the atmosphere is the music. It perfectly complements the visuals and adds another layer of horror to it. We must thank Mark Korven for that. The music in the Witch is spooky and terrifying. I can't find the perfect words to describe it but it scared me more than the visuals. The music during the climax scene is so intense that I do not think I have a heart strong enough to download that soundtrack. The best way to describe it would be - Think of all the sounds from your scariest nightmares and put them all together in a single clip. It is dissonant and pretty unique. It will not give you jumpscares but is unsettling, nonetheless. You will keep thinking about it long after you've seen the film, that is if you are into music and know what good music means. It captures the whole essence of the film.<br/><br/>Talking about acting, everyone is pretty solid but the child actors steal the show. They make the film what it is. half of the time I wanted to kick them because they irritated me beyond my tolerance limit and that is what the director was trying to do. Anya Taylor Joy is great as Thomasin. The father and mother are equally good. Harvey Scrimshaw has delivered a brilliant performance as Caleb, the son who is guilty about commiting a sin. His acting in this film blows everything Adam Sandler has ever done, away. How could he be so good?<br/><br/>Eggers' direction is solid throughout the film. His storytelling abilities are amazing. He calls The Witch, A New England Folktale and that is what he turned it into. The tension and atmosphere in this film are what I expect from a horror film. It maintains the same atmosphere throughout the film and never lets go. It all builds up to an ending that hits you like a hammer to the face. I bet no one will be able to guess the ending. At first, I thought it was not that great. But the more I think about it, the more sense it makes.<br/><br/>The reason I hold The Witch in such a high regard is because after watching the film, I had a feeling that I had consumed something evil and it was disturbing my inner-peace. Despite sharing my thoughts about the film, I am still not sure why I liked it so much that it may be one of my favourite horror films of all time. I guess, that's what good movies do to you. You don't know why you love them. One more thing that baffles me is how well researched the whole thing is. They even used the old English which is a bit difficult to grasp even with subtitles, especially for non-native speakers. But it results in a realistic film.<br/><br/>The Witch is a film made with passion, by a passionate filmmaker, for passionate Cinephiles who don't mind an artistic horror film. It's not easy to watch and most of the people won't like it since they'll be expecting jump scares but if pulverizing babies is your thing then, do give it a try because it is a masterpiece of Horror filmmaking. I didn't like it as much in the first viewing but it kept making me think about it and now that I have seen it around 6 times, I can say that it is one of the best horror movies of the 21st century.I doubt anyone is going to make a horror film like that in the near future.<br/><br/>P.S - If jump scares are your thing and you hate artistic films then leave it. It isn't scary."

","It's 17th century New England. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) lives with her family on an isolated farm. The local village banishes them for religious disagreements. Her parents are strict and God fearing. Her younger brother Caleb has lustful thoughts about her. Her younger twin siblings Mercy and Jonas are obsessed with the family black goat Black Phillip. Thomasin is playing with baby Samuel when he suddenly disappears. A witch in the woods has kidnapped and killed him. The farm is failing and the father is forced to hunt. Thomasin jokes by scaring Mercy about being a witch which comes back to haunt her. Caleb goes into the woods to gather food. Thomasin insists on joining him but it goes badly. Thomasin falls off the horse and Caleb is found in a sickly state.<br/><br/>The movie gets really interesting around the midpoint. The first half feels slow and muddled. I had to watch the first half again to get a hold of the entire story. It's a matter of clarity and flow. After Samuel disappears, the family should be out of their minds searching the woods. Instead, the movie skips ahead a few day to them in a depressed state surrendered to the baby's fate. It's missing the emotional and plot connective tissues. The second half is much more intense paying off some story aspects. The lead girl Anya Taylor-Joy is terrific. The brother and the father are also great. This is an intriguing psychological horror."
"barbiegirlreal","10","10","20","11 September 2016"," Best Horror Film In Years
","Let me start by stating that I am a huge fan of horror for many years. I have been very disappointed in the majority of new horror releases for a while now. I had really high hopes for this film and it did not disappoint. Now, this film is not for everyone. Either you will love it or hate it. I feel there is no in between. The complaint most had with the film was the dialect. This is a little jarring at first but you will get used to it. It's a period piece set during 1630 in New England and I can appreciate the authenticity. A lot of research was done in making this film including reviewing documents of this period in time. It really shows and you will transported to this place and time. Also, you get a real sense of the consequences of religious fanaticism. You understand how difficult it must have been for someone who had been labeled as evil and how easily it could have happened. Every difficulty and hardship was instantly blamed on an evil presence which in itself is scary. At first, I was unsure if what was happening was real or imagined by the film's characters and this was very effective. The acting was spot on and some of the best I've seen in a horror film since I don't know when. You can feel each characters struggle and in the end their utter hopelessness. The whole atmosphere of the film was of desperation and despair. It does build slowly increasing the tension and suspense which a good horror film should do. The score was excellent and added to the suspense. The film overall had a disturbing and unsettling vibe to it that I found hard to shake even after leaving the theater. I immediately was reminded of The Shining in the overall feel and look of the movie. It also felt somewhat like a dark fairy tale. If your easily bored this is not the film for you. It will require your full attention. There were people actually leaving in the middle of the showing when I saw it. But I was transfixed and memorized in a way I haven't been in a long time. It was as if I was watching something I shouldn't be but could not make myself look away. There are no jump scares, tons of gore, or typical horror clichés. And if your're not a fan of period pieces this might not be your thing either. I think if a person is open and willing to tolerate the dialect, you will see it for the masterpiece it is. This was storytelling at it's absolute best. It's dark and disturbing, just what I like my horror to be.<br/><br/>BTW, if someone plans to write a negative review on this film or any other for that matter, please do not say ""I want this period of time in my life back"". That's not original nor clever and completely overused. It should be banned from anyone's review IMO. This is even put in the title at times so please just stop."
"karinafaolin","6","10","20","8 March 2016"," hire a linguist
","I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. You never really find out exactly what happened. You're sort of left wondering what the point of the last 92 minutes was.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie was that they tried (and failed) to write it in an older dialect of English and failed miserably, because, despite being filmed in Toronto which has at least 2 universities offering a linguistics program, they failed to ask a linguist how to speak the English properly.<br/><br/>They used the word ""thou/thee/thy/thine"" as opposed to ""you/your/yours"" throughout the movie. The first problem with this is that this movie is happening after the Brits invading North America. The term ""thou"" died before this. The second problem with this is that they used the term incorrectly. The word ""thou"" is the singular second person pronoun, whereas ""you"" was the plural second person pronoun, or the singular polite second person. If you speak French, the word ""thou"" is the equivalent of the word ""tu"" and the word ""you"" is the equivalent of the word ""vous"". At one point, William says to his children, ""All of thee stop that!"" and even a week later I am still cringing. Other wrong parts, is that for some reason, we assume the first settlers must have spoken present-day British English (even though there is no ""one"" British English), when in reality, North American English, specifically Canadian English is, is more like Old English than any dialect of British English. One major part of this was the the characters took part in the deletion of h's and coda r's. Do you know how we know the first Brits to come to North America pronounced all the r's and h's? Because we in North America still pronounce all our r's and h's. What, did these people think Brits had stopped pronouncing r's and h's long before they came to North America and that somehow the sounds reappeared in North American English? The other problem is they went all Shakespearean style in their talking. Shakespeare not only happened 200 years before the time of this movie, but it was written in poetic prose meant to be like candy to the ears and did not reflect how people actually spoke. How would you feel if people 500 years from now looked at our poetry and assumed we all talked in ridiculous rhymes like that? The whole movie was an ear sore. Next time either hire a linguist, or just talk normally."

","I walked into this film with an expectation that it would be scary as hell, the trailers showed a lot of cool scenes that left the viewer in anticipation of something that hasn't been done in a horror film since, perhaps the Blair Witch Project? Films about Witches are rare, in my opinion the greatest of all time is Suspiria, mainly because of its originality and the great soundtrack. But this film, I would say is befitting of its epic title. Not since It Follows was I this scared walking the dog in the park at Midnight. For the record, I walk the dog every night at midnight, and I have a tough dog. And I average about 30 horror films a month, my collection is quite extensive, so for a movie to scare me, it really says something. I'm a little worried going to sleep tonight, may have some bad night terrors or something, perhaps I should watch some Dora the Explorer cartoons to ease my tension. For a horror fan and fans of films alike, I think it is time to give credit to where credit is due and classify the horror genre as important as the Rom Com and nominate it for something, anything.

"tjgoalie13","8","13","28","24 February 2016"," Unnerving, Wacky, and Super Realistic
","The Witch is a good movie, but it also has a very narrow audience. For those that love slow, yet tense, horror films that are as bizarre as they are scary, this film is for you. The Witch is unnerving, super realistic, and wacky to a fault. I will say that the film's writer and director Robert Eggers did an amazing job for a directorial debut, and he is undoubtedly a force to watch in the future.<br/><br/>From the opening scene of the film to the very end the film is unnerving. The film is quite slow, but never really boring, because the filmmakers did a great job creating a very tense tone. The tone is essentially formed from three major elements of the movie, the bone-chilling music, the ominous cinematography (especially in the forest), and the always noticeable presence of darkness lurking. In this film the titular character isn't in the film often, but their presence is felt. Combine that with the excruciating attention to detail, and the film takes on a sense of reality.<br/><br/>The film is extremely realistic, and that is because Eggers took the time, and had the attention to detail to make the film as realistic as possible. While the dialogue may distract some, it is exactly how people used to talk in the colonial era. The lighting is usually dim, but is to is realistic as the film is literally made to look as if it's being lit by candlelight or moonlight. The actors were on point, most likely due to great direction, and the sets were almost exactly what one would expect things to look like back then. That kind of dedication, deserves respect, but it also helps the audience get lost in the filmic world.<br/><br/>However, the film is downright wacky, and in some ways that's great, and in others it hurt the film a little. The film is unlike anything I've ever seen before, in an interview Eggers said his original pitch was ""too weird, or too obscure"" considering the film he made, I want to see that film because this one was wonderfully obscure and weird. However, the film was a little hard to follow, at times it felt as though too many things would happen in a short period filled with moments of confusion, which did help reinforce the insanity the characters were growing into, but made it harder to follow.<br/><br/>It may not have helped the film, but as an observation, the film was devoid of humor. In the end, the film is original, unnerving, realistic, very well made, but does have an obscure feeling to it. The cinematography is beautiful, the filmmakers had an amazing attention to detail, and horror fans will most likely like the film. If you like the wacky, weird, obscure horror films that don't rely on clichés and jump scares, check this film out."

"antoniokowatsch","3","11","23","29 September 2016"," Misleading title and way too slow
","Despite the movie title this film had not that much to do with the actual witch. The witch only made three appearances throughout the entire movie (and all of them have been rather short in nature). For a movie titled ""The Witch"" this is not acceptable. Furthermore the movie doesn't really tell the story of the witch but rather focuses on a secluded/exiled family which also happens to be highly dysfunctional. And when I say dysfunctional I mean it. They are constantly bickering about the most trivial matters and accusing each other of witchcraft. It was quite honestly one of the most boring movies I've ever watched (considering that I've watched well over 600 movies so far that's supposed to mean something, I reckon). I definitely wouldn't recommend it. <br/><br/>From a storyteller's perspective the movie doesn't have much to offer either. The witch is ""evil"" for no apparent reason ergo is evil for the sake of being evil (which is a storytelling no-go of the highest order, in case you didn't know). I had really high hopes for the movie because of the trailer. Much to my dismay the trailer ended up being better than the actual movie itself."

It is not, more than seventy percent of the film has no dialogue, it is just the actors walking around for extended periods of time with a musical cacophony that is too loud and does not add any viable accent to the script. If a reasonable person were to make a puppet show compared to this travesty, it would win an Oscar."

The movie genuinely disturbed me and that's why I think it excelled as a horror movie. It's also about how the family drastically changes after being kicked out of their ""religious town?"" and their lives affected because of witch craft.

It seems like a fairly basic plot which it kind of is, but the way the movie presents itself makes every twist and plot point feel great. There are a few small things that really helped make the movie that much more immersive like the Shakespearean dialogue, the greyish filter, and the surprisingly good child actor performances.<br/><br/>There's nothing inherently wrong with The Witch, but I felt like it was a bit slow at certain points. There's about maybe half an hour of semi-filler that could be cut out without really hurting the movie too much."

"artmania90","10","7","13","1 February 2017"," Quintessential 21st Century Horror
","The Witch (VVitch) is one goddamned scary movie, and it's not because of cheap thrills and jump-cuts galore. This is a movie that buries itself deep into your psyche, slowly builds up as a monster movie as well as something along the lines of a psychological thriller. In an era when it seems like horror has little more to contribute, here comes a movie that packs a punch comparable to great modern films like The Babadook.<br/><br/>It's an undated time when America is barely colonized. A small family is banished from the city for religious betrayal or some such thing. It's hard to know for sure especially as the opening shot is of the magistrates of the town sentencing the family to leave at once. We see the reactions of the father's children. They are young, confused, willing to follow their parents and yet unsure of what the implications are. With little more than a wagon loaded, the family departs and sets up a small farm on the edge of a dark forest. Al is well.<br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer, you know the general feel of the film. What surprised me was how quickly the film jumped into the thick of the terror, as the infant baby is kidnapped before their oldest daughter's eyes. Perhaps it was a wolf, and through frantic searches, they give up hope as the baby is known to be dead by either animals or hunger. The next- youngest, a set of twins who playfully run throughout the farm, claim to know stories of 'the witch of the wood.' It's laughed off.<br/><br/>When I recall to mind great horror movies, I think of moments that catch you off guard, where you as an audience member are generally frightened for what is about to happen. These movies follow no clichéd plot lines nor are they predictable by any means. In The Witch, I was led on a journey that was so terrifying if only because the audience knows something that the family does not: there is a witch, indeed.<br/><br/>Our first introduction to her is a scene so disturbing and eerie that my mouth hung open the entire scene. It's not long after the baby goes missing. There are a few shots as we see the witch mostly in shadows, as she goes about business that takes fear to a new level. The imagery coupled with some extremely Kubrick-ian music (think 2001: A Space Odyssey), this becomes a film so drenched with tone and darkness that it draws your attention even in the quietest of scenes.<br/><br/>I really don't want to say too much more about the story, except that the family grows to suspect the eldest daughter for a variety of coincidental reasons. Though we know there is a satanic force lurking in the trees, the majority of the films turns inward as we watch a family devoted to God unravel with suspicion and fear. It's a believable family, with the father a kind and compassionate man, his wife God-fearing and unhinged, and children that are raised to know little more than good versus evil and His Holy Word.<br/><br/>Robert Eggers directed and wrote the film in an astonishing debut as a filmmaker. There is a confidence in his style that already feels like it comes from a master. The performances he draws out of his small cast (especially the children) are remarkable, and at times this feels like a movie that is already a classic in the horror genre. My sole concerns (and deductions in the rating) come from the film's ending, one that feels cheap and unneeded for a movie so layered with style. It's a film that uses no special effects until the very last moments, and even then, was it really necessary? The final moments also contain a reveal that shows the truth hidden throughout the entire film, and even then, perhaps a bit of ambiguity wouldn't have hurt.<br/><br/>The Babadook. It Follows. The Witch. Year after year we have seen a select group of films that simply redefine psychological horror, and they are few and far between. The trailers beforehand included two or three movies billed as being scary yet appear to be little more than slasher films with buckets of gore and fake blood. When will filmmakers learn that it isn't blood that frightens an audience, it is the unknown. Do not miss this movie."

It was a near-perfect incarnation of a specific horror theme that, unfortunately, no longer really resonates with most people.<br/><br/>The Witch is not for those who become easily distracted, or those who expect everything in a film to end as expected. The Witch is for those who enjoy horror as it was made when one would visit a theater to see a movie, before the advent of the VHS.

The Witch tries to do both and in doing this, the ending betrays everything that came before it. Casual audiences may be somewhat satisfied as the end credits begin to roll. However, those of us who love films that demand multiple viewings will feel cheated or, even worse, indifferent. The writer/director takes away any sense of lingering mystery, he takes away any want or need we may have had to watch the film again. It's like watching a painter dump a bucket of water all over a painting we just watched them meticulously paint for hours. It all seems like a complete waste.

","I had initially looked forward to getting to sit down and watch ""The VVitch"", though it is only 2 years after it was released that I actually got around to do it. I do remember watching the trailer back prior to the movie came out and was intrigued.<br/><br/>The story in ""The VVitch"" was plagued by a horribly slow storytelling, and it didn't really help that almost next to nothing happened throughout the course of the entire movie. It was only towards the last quarter of the movie or so, that the movie started to pick up pace and things started to happen.<br/><br/>One thing that did work in favor of the movie was the acting performances put on by the cast. The actors and actresses were really doing good jobs with their given roles, despite having a limited script and storyline to work with.<br/><br/>There was a really good and realistic atmosphere to the movie, and it definitely seemed like it was quite true to the time period in which the movie was set to take place. And the costume, props and sets were quite convincing, adding a lot of flavor and detail to the movie.<br/><br/>""The VVitch"" didn't fall into my liking, because it was just too slow paced, and the ending of the movie didn't sit well with me either. This was somewhat of an acquired taste of a movie by the hands of writer and director Robert Eggers, and I believe that having an interest in the time period and particular aspect of American history that ""The VVitch"" is set to take place in is a definite must to fully enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>One thing that puzzled me was the fact that if you have seen the original trailer to the movie, then you have essentially already seen the entire movie. Everything else is just filler that really doesn't serve much of a purpose to the story."

","'The Witch' is a film that stays with you. Upon first viewing I was a little bit underwhelmed by it but I must say it got under my skin and I kept thinking about it's creepy imagery. I think we are living in a very good time for horror films and 'The Witch' deserves to be heralded as a key piece in this horror renaissance. It's success stems from it's consciously constructed leisurely pace. The entire film is grey and overwhelming. The big scares don't come as jump scares per say but rather they unfold, ( a great example of this is when the boy Caleb meets his fate in the woods)<br/><br/>It's a thematically interesting movie too. Our lead character Thomasin endures abuse and disbelief from her family when things go slowly awry. She is an innocent likable character who is believed to be evil because of her becoming a woman. The religious commentary is strong too. One gets the feeling that the sense of doom is more palpably a result of the puritan views than the witches lying in the forest. The ending is spectacular and unsettling. You almost have feel catharsis when you see Thomasin give herself to Black Phillip.<br/><br/>Highly recommended"
"perica-43151","9","6","11","7 January 2019"," This movie is a research project
","This is one great movie, but it is not really a classical horror film with cheap thrills or jump scares. Rather, it is a much more serious exploration of all things related to the witches tale, from the folk stories to the very medieval mindset that gave rise to Salem witch hunts and the consequent atrocities. This is a work of love, and a product of years of very elaborate and tedious research into the historical context and origins of the concept, and the frame of mind of Puritans that made their primitive prejudices possible. The movie also skillfully touches on the related widespread folklore, that gave rise to the stories from brothers Grim to contemporary Disney rendering of the witches universe. But though there are many layers of interpretation of the movie, it is really in essence an exploration of the primitive Puritan imagination, that made supernatural interpretation out of even the most mundane occurrences, let alone the unexpected ones. This is the place filled with ominous witches, where sin is rampant, where Puritan oppression - sexual and otherwise - can find outlet in fantasy, leading to atrocities and abuse of all sorts. And this is the true horror, the truly scary thing about the whole thing. For, the medieval puritan mindset of New England and their folk tales of witches might be things of the past, but bigotry and close minded stupidity and prejudice are alive and well, especially in America. Salem witch trials and executions are long gone, but bigotry still gives rise to savage acts in the name of ""spreading democracy"", ""fighting terrorism"" or ""communism"", and to the unchecked USA atrocities all over the world. The origins of this horrifying, bigoted mindset are well explored in this movie. It is not supernatural elements that are appalling, but the palpable reality of human stupidity and wickedness of the nature of humans and their ""righteousness"", that is really the root of truly sublime horror."

","After seeing The Witch the first time I compared it unfavorably to the Shining and found it lacking some structure, expecting a psychological meta-narrative outside of the horror genre and outside the idea of witches in general. I wrote a review not really praising it but finding the film interesting. The film stuck with me, however.<br/><br/>I then read ""The Witches: Salem, 1692"" by Stacy Schiff which is an historical account of the much later trials (that we are all vaguely aware of, but whose details I for one was unfamiliar with). It also contains some of the material and texture that the filmmaker was employing in writing his film. Reading the book actually made me want to watch the film again and evaluate it on it's own merits, not some half-baked expectations of my own. <br/><br/>I saw it again and was amazed. <br/><br/>I found the film to be powerful, extraordinarily disturbing, dense with period texture and a real horror masterpiece. The psychological narrative was not some modern re-imagining of a mindset plagued by superstition, but an historical reconstruction of an authentic, period world-view which was dramatically and brilliantly played-out - it is eerily effective. I was sad it came to an end - I wanted to see and feel more of the experience the film provides.<br/><br/>I am delighted to have been so wrong about such an amazing film and able to enjoy it again, for the first time! I highly recommend this utterly unique film experience."
"MovieGuy92","5","6","11","16 April 2016"," They get points for historical accuracy and characters, but lose points for, just about everything else
","Remember back when we first started seeing trailers for ""The Witch"" or as it called itself, ""The VVitch"" (yeah, I still don't get the double V thing), and it actually looked terrifying. The trailers made this look genuinely scary, and as the film got closer, we started getting more hype in the form of reviews saying that this is ""the most shocking movie you'll see"" and ""it feels like something we shouldn't be watching"" and so on and so forth. It seemed like the closer this movie got, the more hype it received. Unfortunately, the film itself does not live up to said hype, not by a long shot.<br/><br/>So, what's the story? In the early colonial days of America, a Puritan family is exiled from their town for religious reasons and forced to live near a forest. The family soon learn that the forest is home to a coven of witches that are conspiring to tear the family apart, which causes paranoia and finger-pointing among the family, particularly towards their eldest daughter, Thomasin (I think that's how you spell it). Now, if there's one thing that I have to give the movie credit for, it's the characters. Other than Thomasin and the twins, who are both unlikable and annoying, respectively, I found myself getting attached to this family. They didn't seem like cookie-cutter horror protagonists, but rather real people with real struggles. The father in particular was a complex character, one I wound up feeling sorry for. The movie also does a good job at trying to realistically represent the time period, even down to the dialogue, which sounds very old- fashioned and unfamiliar compared to modern English. <br/><br/>Sadly, this is where the merits of the film stop. The fact of the matter is, the film works fine as a period drama but as a horror movie, not so much. The titular witches are barely ever on screen and when they DO make an appearance, they don't really do much. We don't know of their motivation, their origins, or really anything about them other than the fact that they're crazy flying naked women doing weird stuff. Of course, because of this, the movie has a noticeable lack of scares. It has a few creepy moments and disturbing scenes (including a very tasteless attempt at shock early on when the witches kidnap and kill the infant son of the family), but no real scares. <br/><br/>All of this, um, non-action ultimately leads to nothing really special as the ending is disappointing and sort've out of nowhere. So here's what happens: the father locks his remaining children in the barn as he believes them to be involved with the witches. Somehow, a witch enters the barn in the middle of the night and runs off with the twins. The dad finds out, gets gored by the goat (more on him later), the mother goes nuts so Thomasin stabs her, and then later finds out that the goat is the Devil, very quickly signs her soul away to him, becomes a witch, floats into the air, the end. Yeah, it's THAT kind of movie. <br/><br/>You know, I feel like this film would have worked better if there really WASN'T anything supernatural going on, and the family's belief system and paranoia were all that were tearing them apart, but when you try to still play up that angle while at the same time revealing that there really are witches doing bad things, it doesn't really work as well, especially when you have critics and audiences talking about the ""paranoia of the times"" and ""rethinking your religion."" I admit, the belief system of the early Puritans was questionable, but in the universe of the movie, when the things they're afraid of actually exist and pose a genuine threat, doesn't that kind of justify the paranoia a bit? This movie appears to send mixed messages. There's also another aspect of this movie that bugs me, and I've seen it quite a lot in these types of movies lately: the absence of God. The movie quite clearly establishes that the Devil is real, but he can't exist without God too, so why is he just mysteriously absent? These ""demon"" and ""witch"" type films lately give credence to the existence of the demonic, but for whatever reason leave God out (prayers and exorcisms don't work ""just because"", or Divine intervention seems almost nonexistent). As a Christian, this kinda bothers me. That's why I like movies like ""The Rite"" or even the original ""The Exorcist"" that showed the threat the forces of Satan pose while also acknowledging that the power of God can beat them. Okay, enough of my ranting, time to wrap up. <br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a film that doesn't work because it tries to be too many things at once: a period drama, a commentary on 17th century beliefs, a tale about family bonds, AND a horror movie. With all of these different genres thrown in together, what you have is a disjointed mess of a film that does some things really well, such as drama and character development, but other things like horror and a clear message, it falls flat on. This leaves us with a movie that should have worked and should have left me disturbed and emotionally shaken, but ultimately just left me disappointed and wanting back the money I spent on the ticket!"
"Roadwarrior85846","10","6","11","22 February 2016"," A True Definition Of Psychological Terror!
","The Witch is one film that chills you to the bone and will warp your mind while you watch in fear, confusion, and anxiety. There hasn't been a horror film like this in a very long time. Any horror buff will agree that this film is a valuable gem in an underestimated genre. I had very high expectations on this film before seeing it, and it bargains much more than I expected, in which is highly rare nowadays.<br/><br/>The film takes place many years before the Salem Witch trials and it starts off with a Puritan family leaving a plantation, due to disagreement beliefs. They find good size piece of land that is outside of a dark forest and built themselves a cabin and a farm. Once their newborn baby disappeared under the care of the post- adolescent daughter named Thomasin, things go downhill from there for the family. Crops of corn go bad, no luck on hunting food, and an ongoing grudge between Thomasin and her mother Katherine. Things get much worse when they sense evil is coming from the forest and the only thing that can save them are prayers and faith. But, for how long?<br/><br/>The first thing that brought to my attention is the dialogue. It is an awesome idea that director and writer, Robert Eggers,had wrote it and execute it this way. It feels like we're seeing a prequel of the Crucible (I never saw the movie, but I've read the book. Unsure if the Winona Ryder film followed the original writing). Next, the atmosphere felt very authentic. You can sense absolute no civilization around the family and the cool, damp, New England weather, even though it was filmed in Canada. Third, the acting is tremendous! Nothing was campy, cheesy, or off. They felt like legit pilgrims on the screen. The father, played by Ralph Ineson, is my personal favorite character in the movie. It felt like I was watching a young Donald Sutherland. And last, but not least, the fear factor. It's intense. This film shows no mercy to the victims and to the viewers. There aren't that many casual jump-scares like in your everyday horror flicks, but just gives you a psychological fear that makes you highly uncomfortable. The fear just gradually builds up throughout the plot rather than spurts of scares here and there. It feels like a nightmare that you can't wake up from. After watching the movie, it makes you just speechless.<br/><br/>If you a huge horror fan that wants something completely fresh without the cliché, The Witch is for you. After you watch it, you can't stop talking about it. It's that good. Robert Eggers did such a fantastic job and will be a household name of horror such as Stephen King, George A. Romero, Guillermo del Toro and Sam Raimi. this maybe too soon say this because we're in February, but I believe that this is the best horror movie of the year. I don't know if any upcoming horror films that'll be releasing this year can top The Witch."

","I'm a big fan of the horror movie genre and I was excited to see this. The whole '1630s New England' thing and witchcraft interested me, but I knew I would be thoroughly disappointed from about 45 minutes into the movie. <br/><br/>The movie falls flat miserably and has very slow pacing with no pay- off. The acting was very mediocre at best. The only noteworthy performance was Anya Taylor-Joy, but obviously that wasn't enough. The actual writing had no ambition and I feel like the director took too many conservative options with the story just to be safe. This resulted in no significant set-pieces to happen to create tension or any kind of suspension or mystery. My biggest con is the non- existent soundtrack. A fundamental element of the horror genre is the gripping soundtrack but this movie just didn't have any. Because of this, many parts between segments were just stagnant. Cinematography was poor as well. They could've done a good job at capturing the wickedness of the forest, but they showed no ambition at doing that.<br/><br/>Overall, an extremely lacklustre and unambitious movie.

"asda-man","10","8","16","2 May 2016"," A future horror classic
","This ain't no Hocus Pocus kids! Witches aren't usually the first port of call when coming up with horror film ideas. They work well with family film's like Nicholas Roeg's surreal adaptation of Roald Dhal's The Witches but can cackling old women with pointy hats and broomsticks scare grown adults? After seeing Robert Egger's striking debut, the answer would seem to be a resounding yes. The Witch is the best horror film since Kill List and is sure to become a future horror classic. I like to think of myself as a hardened horror movie nut but The Witch did actually manage to scare me, more so than the recent It Follows and The Babadook.<br/><br/>It's a fairytale for adults and Robert Egger goes down alleys as dark as a film can get. Within the first five or ten minutes, I could tell that I'd be in for a stunning ride as we're treated to some seriously nightmarish imagery involving a naked old woman smothering herself in the blood of a baby, accompanied by a screeching score which is sure to give you the shivers. Terrifying sequences like this appear sporadically through the film so it never feels overdone, it just adds to the mounting tension in each scene until it explodes into the most wonderfully indulgent finale.<br/><br/>A lot of films set in medieval times can be a bit trying. A Field in England and Black Death both felt like the setting let the film down by getting bogged down in confusing olde worlde Shakespearean-esque language. However, The Witch is never anything more than compelling throughout. The sole focus of the film is the family and all the parts are acted beautifully by the relatively unknown cast. The audience becomes incredibly involved and invested in the characters so you care about what's going to happen to them. There's a sense of dread in every scene but you're never quite sure about what's going to happen next which makes for unpredictable and absorbing viewing.<br/><br/>I can't talk about The Witch without mentioning just how gorgeous the film looks. You could pretty much take any shot and hang it up for display in a gallery because it's just beautiful to look at. The eerie shots of the deep wood reminded me of Lars Von Trier's equally unsettling, Antichrist, however The Witch has a more fantastical quality to the images which adds to the Brothers Grimm fairytale kind of vibe. There isn't a second in the film's tight 90 minute running time where a shot doesn't ooze atmosphere. It's so refreshing to get a horror film which doesn't rely on a few seconds of gore to shock the audience, but actually takes it time to conjure up genuinely frightening images. There's stuff in this film which won't leave my head for a long time after viewing it.<br/><br/>Equally as atmospheric as the imagery is the sound. I can't think of a more striking score or sound design since The Shining and it helps a lot to generate such an unsettling atmosphere. The exceedingly creepy dissonant violins and loud chants build scenes up to a shattering intensity where I found myself holding my breath. In fact, the whole film has such a strange and unnerving quality to it. It feels like you're watching something you shouldn't. It's no wonder that the film's even been endorsed by the Satanic Temple itself with the Temple's spokesperson calling it ""a trans-formative Satanic experience."" <br/><br/>The Witch has to be my favourite film of the year and one of my favourite horror films full stop. I found it absolutely captivating and full of tension from beginning to end. It's pretty much as perfect as horror can get and exudes the quality of a classic chiller from the 60's. Robert Eggers is definitely going to be a director to look out for in the future. He's proved to critics that the horror genre is alive and well and can still genuinely scare the hell out of people. The Witch is a sensational experience for the eyes and ears, it's cinema at its finest. It is a delicious masterpiece of horror."

","The storyline is as follows: a family is evicted from a village for being too Puritan. They end up alone is a field close to a forest and setup their new home. The baby is kidnapped by a witch and turned into a witch brew, another boy of said family is seduced by a younger witch and through a slow process killed after he returned to his family. Whilst this is going on, the family gets increasingly tensed: the elder sister feels guilty for having lost the baby under her supervision, the father for having sold mom's golden cup for badly needed hunting gear, the mom is upset for the loss of her golden cup because of emotional value, the remaining two young kids build up a mistrust against their elder sister. The family falls apart, they end up dead and the elder sister gets lured into becoming a witch herself by Satan, who hid in the shape of their black pet goat.<br/><br/>And that's it. You'd think it would be obvious that the influence of the witches destabilized their family, and of course such is the case, but that reason was very weakly implemented. This family could have easily been destabilized by events far less mystical. The kidnappings by the witches was just an arbitrary angle to the story. Again, in reality, nothing happened, other than a family increasingly becoming dysfunctional and a few cool shots with witches (three short scenes in total, so don't get your hopes up).<br/><br/>The movie is rated ""R"" for disturbing images and explicit nudity. I honestly have no clue what disturbing images they were aiming at. And the little bit of nudity was done so clinically, it's not worth mentioning. I hope it says a lot coming from me, because usually I complain about unnecessary nudity in movies.<br/><br/>More people than I have imagined seem to like jump-scares, and this is not that kind of a movie (thankfully, I despise that cheap technique). Nor is it a slasher though what happened to the baby leaves only little to your imagination. so no slashing and no jump-scaring, instead it was a slow movie trying to have a developing story towards the climax. That's the keyword here, slow.<br/><br/>Technically it's all fine, though I heard some complaints about the music or sound. My only complaint is the sound at the very end where the witches gather and chant their evil chants. The sound was too much post-processed, making it sound as if the microphone was too close to them. But other than that, that final scene was cool. So technically a minor glitch there is the message I was trying to bring across. Acting and whatnot was fine too.<br/><br/>So that's it. Another movie with great, but unused potential. My main complaint, to conclude, is that instead of being it a witch movie, it looked more like a family drama which had a few witches in it to keep your attention. I gave it a 4/10 because it needs two more notches to make it into anything but a slow paced drama."

I can only conclude that these people do not have much of an attention span, or don't have much of a horror palate. Or, they've been conditioned to expect cheap scares like the scary face moment in Insidious. <br/><br/>The Witch doesn't rely on jump moments, and to me that's a great thing. In the horror movie canon, I can think of a few jump scares that feel earned and really enhance the scene, but they are a small minority of the total. Some good ones would include the monster reveal in The Descent or the alien jumping out in the access tunnel in Alien. Most jump scares aren't like that. They're in the film to create fake tension. Unfortunately, I believe many moviegoers have come to expect the rush of adrenaline that comes with a jump scare and have come to associate this with the horror experience.<br/><br/>I would urge the people giving it 1 star to watch a lot more horror films and try to really gain some knowledge about the genre, and then come back and watch this one again.

The Witch is truly unique in that regard; it's a new breed of horror never before seen by the genre. If you're expecting jump-scared and quick-cuts, prepare to be disappointed. This is a film which takes its time and demonstrates mastery of several technical elements of filmmaking. The cinematography is beautifully framed, well-lit and really adds to the uneasiness 'The Witch' aims to evoke. The performances across the board are brilliant, even among the child actors (though, be warned, the entire film is in Old English so pay attention to the dialogue). The direction and production design is especially impressive considering this a first-time director and long-time production designer.

"skullhead739","3","5","9","13 January 2020"," Why does this have such high reviews??
","Okay just wanna say i watched this many months ago and only wanted to submit a review because of the high review score this has.. here's why.<br/><br/>Plot:
This movie is boring, like really really boring. It has lots of plot direction that leads no where and constant silence and confusion plagues this movie. The cast is good but the plot is incredibly bad and directing just as bad that this becomes hard to finish.<br/><br/>Acting:
The acting is the best part of this film. They have a good cast but with such bad directing, dialog and story leads to the performances being meaningless. You cant fix bad characters with good actors, you just cant.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
Now the special affects and scenes are done weirdly. Not good and a matter of fact not scary at all. The tone of this seems strange rather than immersive and thrilling.<br/><br/>Summary:
Please dont watch this, Its long and extremely boring. I love horror movies but this is no horror. More like a weird telling of strange circumstances happening to a family which doesnt lead anywhere and isnt spooky. You've been warned."

"shanayneigh","1","5","9","1 August 2016"," Fails miserably
","For the life of me I can't understand why they chose to market this movie as a horror movie. The tone in the trailer does not for one bit match the tone of the movie. No wonder a lot of people call this movie boring if they went in with high expectations after having seen the trailer.<br/><br/>The rookie director makes one huge mistake after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie when he shows that the witch is indeed real. Had he not done so the witch might have worked as, say, an allegory of religious hysteria or coming of age. But no, the witch is real and there's no room left for ambiguity.<br/><br/>But the major flaw of this movie is that it simply isn't scary, the one defining characteristic of a horror movie. The pacing is glacial. And a slow horror movie is fine if you're building to some payoff. But no, the movie sort of trundles along without any real excitement. When we do get nearer to the end there are two climactic moments that weren't scary, but funny, I assume unintentionally so. The main character's little brother has what seems like an epiphany on his death bed which was so over the top it almost felt campy. And when her two twin siblings freak out and accuse her of being a witch, forget how to pray, and fall to the floor, they had me laughing out loud. <br/><br/>The movie is well made. The cinematography is excellent, the sound and music is good too. As is the acting. It's just a shame that it was not scary and fails miserably as a horror movie."

"aharmas","10","8","17","24 March 2016"," Old Fashioned Horror
","It's been a while since we have been treated to classic movie making, a period piece where there's strong emphasis on shaping well-defined characters that go beyond simple sketches and are able to project various types of emotions, draw us into the drama, which in this case is more intense than recent releases because it takes time to develop but is firmly grounded on its themes and takes big chances, using realistic dialogue, natural cinematography, and some pretty incredible costumes.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" succeeds because everything in it is carefully tended. The opening scenes have the community dealing with a religious crisis. The camera moves around showing every detail of the austere life this community lives. They live under strict rules, in a new but dangerous world, and we have just learned, one of its members chooses to leave the safety of the small settlement and try their luck near the cold, dark, and very scary forest.<br/><br/>As if the world wasn't full of extreme situations that involve hard work, raising cattle, growing crops, and having a severe case of bad luck, there is someone living inside the dark forest, someone who might eventually destroy each and everyone of this family. At the beginning, crops start going bad, the animals sense some mysterious force is approaching, and a very young baby is snatched away by ""the wolves"", but it soon becomes clear that there is no animal, but a supernatural being that manages to becomes stronger after committing a terrible deed, something that must have taken a lot of debating before it made it to the screen.<br/><br/>Events continue, taking each of the members through a slow decay of their inter-relationships. At the center of this is the young girl who is blamed for the loss of her younger brothers, the very strange twins whose behavior hints at some type of dark influence, a guilt-ridden mother whose faith is faltering, and a father who is seeing how his world is about to implode.<br/><br/>The film is as naturalistic as it can be, and this makes the horrors appear stronger and very real. The branches of the trees are haunting and alive with forces we don't understand, but this is no art piece, and when nature (in the shape of otherwise, innocent looking creatures) strikes, we know we're dealing with something that will most likely cause a lot of destruction.<br/><br/>The world is a cold and nasty place; it's always gray. The sun never shines, and the wind looks like it might just kill you. The night scenes are spooky, and we don't feel safe, completely relating to what the various characters go through. Making the situation worse is that there are children involved, and we are witnesses to a quick deterioration of whatever strength the parents might have. Soon, we see how the forces around them begin to create divisions among them.<br/><br/>Another family member is abducted in one of the most shocking scenes in modern cinema, slowly leading to more horrific events, each of them striking even harder than the one before. The film is so powerful that it even uses one of the most popular representations of evil, and it is as if we've never seen it before. When we realize who or what it is, we know we are in the middle of the circles of hell. <br/><br/>Much will be said about the ending, but since we have grown used to this great directorial effort, giving us a carefully designed and powerful film, we might excuse the flight of fancy that takes the last minutes of the film. Yet, if that being's intervention looked and felt real, why isn't it possible that we believe that such a situation is possible.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the year so far."

","Greetings again from the darkness. If your own nightmares have become less frequent, and you find yourself able to sleep peacefully through the night, writer/director Robert Eggers' first feature film will likely fix that. Based in 1630 New England Â… a full 60 years prior to the Salem witch trials Â… much of the story and dialogue is based on actual historical documents corresponding to the fears of that era. It would be a mistake to head into this one thinking it's going to having you covering your eyes or springing from your seat Â… it's better described as unsettling and disquieting.<br/><br/>Religious fanaticism plays a key role here, and is actually behind a Puritan family being exiled from the community. They set up a home and farm on the edge of an ominous, heavily-wooded forest Â… and things start to go wrong. William (Ralph Ineson) and Katherine (Kate Dickie) are stern and stoic parental units to coming-of-age teenager Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), her younger brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), two spoiled and annoying twins Mercy (Ellie Granger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), and a new born named Samuel.<br/><br/>This is a slow-burn psychological horror film and it never relies on cheap jump-scares. Instead the eerie atmosphere, lurking Satanic evil, and unraveling of the family as they search for answers, all combine for a level of creep that's not often seen on screen. Adding to our pre-conceived notion that things rarely end well for closed-mind religious zealots is the unsettling use of Old World English Â… it takes some time to adjust your ears.<br/><br/>Most of director Eggers' background is in short films with an emphasis on Production Design and Costume Design. It's interesting to note the gradual decline of lighting as the movie progresses Â… most notably on the opening and closing shots of daughter Thomasin, who faces the most backlash as a suspected (by her family) witch.<br/><br/>This was a time when people prayed for food and for God to have mercy Â… and to explain the unexplainable. No amount of praying can make sense of the titular witch (Bathsheba Garnett), or the family's goat Black Phillip (voiced by Wahab Chaudhry), or an evil bunny that would make Monty Python proud. The dingo taking their baby might actually be a preferred explanation.<br/><br/>Eggers won the Sundance Award for a Director in Drama, and the film was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize. Mark Korven's score is unique and the perfect complement to the on screen happenings of this poor family. The film stays true to the time period, which of itself, feels like a parallel universe unfamiliar to most of us these days. Young actors Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw are real finds, and director Eggers will have a built-in and well-deserved audience for his next outing."

I actually feel this is an ""important"" film for Christians and just about anyone else to see ... and I don't say that about most movies.<br/><br/>The movie was extremely realistic, and just fascinating. It was also beautifully filmed, had a great score, and the casting was spot-on as well.<br/><br/>The family was a typical ""Calvinist (aka Reformed Christian)"" family and if one understands Calvinism before watching the film, one will get a great deal more out of it I believe.<br/><br/>Please note, I am NOT a Calvinist and consider Calvinism to be almost entirely unBiblical.<br/><br/>I even asked my own children to watch this movie and afterwards we had a wonderful discussion and Bible study as the film deals with a great many spiritual issues and is a perfect film to discuss afterwards.<br/><br/>One of the things that has always bugged me about many so-called ""spiritual"" movies is that they show Christians getting ""possessed"" when such is literally impossible. This movie did not do that and I truly appreciated such. Instead it showed devilish attacks and the like, but not actual ""possession"", at least not until and unless a character actually desired such, which is Biblically accurate.<br/><br/>Overall I simply feel this is a marvelous film, historically realistic, Biblically accurate, and worthy of being viewed.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this review and may God's perfect will always be done in your life, no matter the cost,<br/><br/>Author Repen T.

","I'm not going to say much about this film beyond that the trailer misrepresented it. We were expecting a scary movie. It isn't. At all. For that dishonesty, it really deserves one out of ten.<br/><br/>But, as a period piece and a reasonably well done depiction of an isolated family falling victim to their silly superstitions, it is a better prospect altogether.<br/><br/>I don't understand why people didn't understand the dialogue - unless they aren't native English speakers. It was simple stuff, a tad King James Bible-ish, and no-doubt fairly authentic for the period in which the film is set.<br/><br/>Oh, before I forget. Letting the screen go blank, for several seconds, every few minutes is a trick which went out of fashion in the 1920s. It doesn't achieve anything nowadays.<br/><br/>I read a comment which said that people who mark this film down obviously don't know anything about the horror genre. I suggest, instead, that the people who know nothing of the horror genre are those who made the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps three from ten is overly generous."

","I remember reading the 'official entertainment review' of this movie after it had come out. It was panned by the critics. I went to see it just to see what they were complaining about and I found a film that was original in every sense. The characterizations were a bit strong but maybe thats the way people were back then. Nobody can say for sure since nobody is alive from that time period. I thought that somewhere in the film they could have found some way to explain why they used two 'v's' to make the word 'witch.' The reason being that the word 'witch' came from Scandinavia in the form of the word ""vvitch"" meaning ""sorcerer"" (usually a male person as posed to a female person) which has a more powerful evil connotation that the commonly used western term 'witch.' The origins of the term are darker and imply greater evil than a 'witch.' Anyway-the film was gritty in an interesting and different way and I think the film attempted to convey the darker connotation of the concept of a 'sorcerer.' Not a film to watch alone at night. Effective horror- something that you don't see very often."

"JC_Stewart89","9","6","12","27 February 2016"," Haunting and unsettling depiction of hysteria in early United States
","The shadowy and untold world between what we fully believe and the unexplained is scarier than anything in your well-worn campfire stories.<br/><br/>A highly zealous puritan family in New England circa 1630 is banished from a large settlement and forced to live on their own in the uncharted spooky woods that surround the area. A year later as they forge a living together out in the wilderness, something begins to act on all of them, something devious, wicked, and insidious. Their oldest child, a daughter named Tomasin played remarkably by Anya Taylor-Joy, is taking care of the new-born baby when it is snatched away. Almost immediately an unspoken change occurs between her and the rest of the family especially between her parents played strongly by Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie. They begin to act strange around her, seemingly suspecting her of the deed and perhaps something more nefarious. But do they really believe that she is in some way responsible? Is she completely innocent or in fact turning into something from folklore and scripture?<br/><br/>This stunning debut from writer/director Robert Eggers is a tense-atmospheric- historical drama centering on the fringes on hardened belief, the unexplained and supernatural, and the maddening hysteria that can come from all of them crossing- over into each other. Set some 60 years before the infamous Salem Witch Trials, Eggers has seemingly traced the root causes of the tragedy, most notably with the extremely pious that anything beyond their understanding is an affront to God; the core of their beliefs. The victims of this infamous Witch Hunt tragically unable to plead their innocence against the tide of fear and paranoia that griped their towns, neighbors and families.<br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy as Tomasin plays the ostracized girl with doe-eyed innocence, but with fleeting glimmers that something may not in fact be right with her, supernatural forces notwithstanding. She is growing into maturity, suddenly experiencing changes both physical and emotional and because of the distancing she is feeling from her family she is coping with them on her own. Only her brother Caleb, played powerfully by Harvey Scrimshaw, seems to even be able to reach out to her, nonetheless an uncomfortable undertone to their relationship develops that further divides the family.<br/><br/>As family members begin to suspect one another of evil tidings, the grey New England skies seemingly become darker, their farm animals begin to act wildly and the very woods themselves take on a menacing presence. Getting to the point where even a wild hare is as unsettling sight as the titular Witch on-screen. That is masterful horror cinema, akin to Polanski and Kubrick, generating an constant oppressive atmosphere of dread. The horror genre is experiencing a welcomed resurgence in that last few years with the likes of The Conjuring,The Babadook, It Follows, because the filmmakers carefully take the time to portray their worlds from an oft-kilter perspective. To take a line from the Bard ""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark"". Something is wrong, we can't quite point it out, but something isn't right.<br/><br/>That is what true horror is, derived from a primal fear of the unknown and unexplained. Horror genre filmmakers in recent years have tried to manufacture scares into what one can call Shock cinema. Trying to put ""frightening"" images and gore on-screen and using jump-scares to try an jolt their audiences into thinking for an instant ""Well, that was scary."" While that may work for amusement park rides, film is a completely different beast. It is able to grant a unique perspective and understanding of the nature of fear. Nothing should be on-screen to shock an audience, at least in the cheap thrills department. You can be unsettled and disturbed by what is happening in the narrative certainly, but as part of the film's experience you should be trying to understand why you are feeling that way.<br/><br/>The Witch is the crown-jewel in the recent string of truly disturbing horror films. A darkly beautiful film shot by Jarin Blaschke that treats its New England forest setting in a suffocatingly claustrophobic manner. The production design team render period authenticity from the cloths, lodgings and especially the 17th century style of English- speaking that may be hard for some to follow but the dedicated performances keep you engaged and concerned. The eerie musical score by Mark Korven makes the haunted woods seemingly sing not unlike the monolith in 2001. All these outstanding cinematic elements compliment one another to create a vision of hysteria that would manifest itself in real-world horrific ways in the area's history.<br/><br/>At my screening just as the end credits appeared, another member of the audience cried out ""That's it? What was that?"" in a unsatisfied tone. ""What was that"" indeed, I guess we never really truly grasp what lies waiting for us in the darkness when we journey to the edges of what we're used to.<br/><br/>9.5/10 (An unsettling film that depicts the primal fear of the unknown in uniquely disturbing ways. An atmospheric horror film that has truly terrifying historical roots in the real-world, and never cheapens its storytelling for an audience.)"
"RforFilm","10","6","12","22 February 2016"," Understandably slow and with a total feeling of creepiness, The Witch embodies everything scary about an unknown world
","Today's movie The Witch finally addresses two things that aren't just scary, but terrifying; historical prejudices and a trapped location. The early seventeenth century marks the earliest of American history, not too long after the pilgrims made a home for themselves in the New World. With a land that was mostly unknown and passage back to Europe taking weeks, that's a great example of a location where you have no choice but to face it head on. Even without the possibilities of something supernatural, there's still animals and Native American attacks that could prove forceful and frightening.<br/><br/>At the time, the pilgrims left England as they felt the religious standards were too lose and wanted to practice without ridicule. The last thing you want is to be stuck with pilgrims as their moral beliefs steam from the ideal that if someone is acting out of the ordinary, then they must have made a pact with Satan. This would even lead into the famous Salem Witch trials that persecuted several people that were have thought to have practiced witchcraft. While this film is set decades before those trials took place, The Witch paints a scary picture that would make any fundamentalist into a pilgrim. <br/><br/>Within the early days of the New World, William (played by Ralph Ineson) is even more religious then his fellow pilgrims, deciding that he and his family need to leave the plantation and search for their own home. He settles on this parch of land where he builds a farm and try to make a life for his wife Katherine (played by Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), eldest son Caleb, twins Mercy and Jonas, and baby Samuel. Things get creepy right away when Samuel is taken while playing a game of peek-a-boo with Thomasin.<br/><br/>Katharine spends her days crying to god while Caleb and William do their best to hunt to feed their family. Thomasin overhears that her parents want to send her to another family now that she's approaching womanhood. This put more tension within the family as crops are failing and are not even sure they will have enough food during the upcoming winter. Caleb then goes missing during a hunting outing with Thomasin's twin sibling accusing her of being a witch. When Caleb is found close to death, more eyes from the family blame Thomasin for the bad things happening, despite her innocence.<br/><br/>The Witch is film that scared me more then half of the horror movies I've seen in the past three years. A lot of it has to do with the setting as the entire story feels unsettling. The dark imagery of the forest, the farm and even a simple dinner feel threatening as if there is no escape from any danger. <br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy is a total breakout as she represents the last of innocence that any girl would have, regardless of that time period or now, within this circumstance. She carries the movie well enough that we wanted to see whether she'd escape.<br/><br/>The story manages to remain more layered then it needs to be. With little explanation on what the monster is here. The filmmaker understands that the scariest ideas may not be the unseen force, but rather the people that start to look at you at the first sign on trouble. <br/><br/>I would love to watch this again, though subtitles would be a welcome addition. Everyone talks in an older, Middle-English tone that makes the setting more alien, though a little hard to understand. Slasher fans may find this too slow, but it freaked me out.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten black goats out of ten. The Witch is everything I want in more horror movies; a total feeling of creepiness, a defenseless set of people, and a unique setting. I'm sure that more horror writers will take inspiration from this."

","I'd never before in my life heard people in a movie theater boo after seeing a movie, until today. The place was packed, and people kept piling in after the trailers had started, so I thought perhaps the word-of-mouth was pretty good, and that it boded well for a positive movie-going experience. I'd heard it was slow going, which wasn't a problem, as sometimes, you need more time and measured pacing to set up a good story, but wasn't the issue at all.<br/><br/>It was like watching The Blair Witch all over again. An hour and a half of ridiculously overblown drama capped off by nothing happening until the last few minutes. At no point during the whole affair was I horrified, unsettled or disturbed by what I was seeing, nor was I impressed by what I was seeing on the screen. I admit to jumping once, after the father was gored by the goat, but honestly, much like the Spanish Inquisition, no one expects a goat to suddenly come at you.<br/><br/>It just seemed like such a waste. The acting was top notch, both the children and the adults, who all beautifully portrayed the severity of their situations. The cinematography was stark, yet gorgeous, and the premise alone was enticing enough to make me plunk down money for a ticket. But the metaphor of earthly woes being blamed on God's judgment/punishment and witchcraft fell absolutely flat, as did the drama of family turning on one another when the chips are down -even in this time period when superstition was high and such things were a common occurrence. By the end, the plot had made no sense and even when something finally ""happened"", the journey was not worth the destination.<br/><br/>After the round of booing and the lights had come up, as the audience piled out, I heard declarations of how stupid the movie was and how disappointed people were, and I couldn't have agreed with them more. What a complete and utter waste of what was, on its face, a compelling premise. It's rare for me to walk out of a movie theater feeling cheated of my money, but honestly, that's exactly what I felt."

","Once a year, a horror movie is released that doesn't follow the original ""hot girl, jump scare"" plot, and delves into a mind twisting story that slowly builds up until you're completely lost in awe. 2016's example of this is The Witch. What starts as a simple plot, a family getting excommunicated from the village in 1630's New England, turns into a tale of deception and family bonds being broken. One of my favorite things about the Witch was the dialogue; the entire movie uses Shakespearian-like dialogue that really draws viewers in. The acting itself is superb; there isn't a second that passes by where the actors aren't 110% in character. The film itself makes it evident that witchcraft will play a vital role in the plot, and while it does, the plot takes a turn and really builds itself upon the deteriorating family relationships. The setting of the film itself was beautifully haunting; shots of the forest surrounding the family's farm will fascinate you with a childlike sense of terror. The film's pace was also smartly planned; a well paced build up leads to one of the most intense endings in cinematic history. Overall, this is one of the best works of film I've seen in years, and not only is it an example of what horror movies should be, it's an example of what the art of cinema is."

","When I saw the first preview for VVitch in October, I pondered whether or not to see this movie, not because it didn't look interesting, but because I questioned the impact it would have on my spirit and moreover my soul. Rob Zombie's The Lords of Salem (2012) was one of the better takes on the witch in American Cinema. His representation was frightening and enchanting, drawing you into it's madness as the female protagonist, played by Sherri Moon Zombie, slips into the world of the witch. Cable TV Shows like American Horror Story and True Blood also crafted their versions of the folkloric succubus, while mainstream media and broadcast TV typically glamorize these demonic women to fit popular culture.<br/><br/>The Witches of Eastend (Netflix, Jenna Dewan Tatum) put a Norse spin on the origins of witch clans, while the shows Salem and A Penny Dreadful brutally recant the trials which suspected and actual witches faced. Both shows are led by phenomenal actors; Janet Montgomery, who plays Mary Sibley in the Lovecraftian drama, Salem; and Eva Green, Casino Royale's to die for Bond-girl, who darkens every scene with her piercing blue eyes, passionate prose and gorgeous charisma. <br/><br/>Last summer, I listened to an audio book entitled, The Teachings of Don Juan, by Carlos Castaneda. The book is an autobiographical account by Castaneda of his exploration into the world of hallucinogens, with a Native America (Don Juan) witch doctor serving as his apprehensive guide. After returning from one of his hallucinations, Castaneda is warned by Don Juan that a witch has found a way into his psyche and might manifest him/herself in the physical world unless Don Juan draws her out. The account of the exorcism is a frightening moment for the reader and author. It is the same underlying feeling of Castaneda's journey that courses through each word, each scene, and embodies this real world witch, a movie so carefully and perfectly crafted by Robert Eggers, it ensures cult status. <br/><br/>The Witch is horrifying in its very presentation, with the threat of the unknown always looming. A shining light within the film, Anya Taylor-Joy, plays Thomasin, the beautiful eldest daughter of a farm fed family. Her coming of age, along with several subtle nuances create a duality within the film which is slowly delivered with small, yet impacting, climactic moments. One of the more apparent overtones in the movie is represented by a beautifully candlelit sequence where William (Father), played by Ralph Ineson recites a prayer while holding up a bit of bread that will soon be broken and eaten by his family. William's appearance resembles that of an imagined Christ, on one occasion his clothing appears as swaddling cloth as if an aberration of the Son of God was plucked from a Renaissance painting and superimposed into this film.<br/><br/>William's twin children are an indulgence of the eyes and ears, to say the least, their perfect delivery of the well-crafted dialog all but solidifies the films believability. Their relationship to the families blasphemously black, horned billy goat is a trepidation, their counter charm an essential ingredient in the films making. It's always difficult to see children in a role which may expose them to moments of stolen innocence, yet the poetic dialog and tactful inclusion/exclusion of the children during brutal yet necessary moments in the movie allowed for a clear conscience. That's not to say you don't get your witch. The Witch is monstrous, horrifying, cunning, and seedy enough to gratify your well-deserved disgust."

","Almost unbearably intense, this horror-drama from Robert Eggers is a serious horror fan's dream come true. Set in 17th century New England, it follows the banishment of a family from a plantation to the unforgiving woods, where they must battle not only the harsh elements but also a sinister, malevolent presence in the woods that manifests itself only by slowly uprooting the family's strict religious morality and using it against them. Recalling the best of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining,"" it has scenes of slow-building tension that register far more for being so disquieting and unassuming than most jump-scare horror films, but the real star of the show is the underlying morality play - this isn't so much a straightforward horror movie as much as it's an indictment of the underlying misogyny of Puritanical morals, which castigated women as subservient and submissive to a patriarchal structure that repeatedly exonerated itself of its moral failings, while simultaneously demanding rigid adherence from women. With knockout performances by all involved (in particular Kate Dickie, whose sorrow and mounting emotional vortex bleeds on every frame she's in) and a terrific use of a saturated color palette, ""The Witch"" is a bonafide genre classic waiting to happen."

","Do not go into this movie expecting horror or gore, this is movie is all about the atmosphere, calm and mellow at times, but surely intense enough throughout. Absolutely stunning imagery and scenery all throughout the film a it is set in a 1630's forest. The movie does not solely revolve around withcraft and magic as the title might lead one to believe, it takes a rather different approach giving us insight into the heavy religious influence in the 17th century.<br/><br/> Overall, the movie has a great vibe to it, watching a film like this makes you forget about the usual appeals of horror/thriller movies as you easily get sucked into the atmosphere of this movie even without much crazy and intense action you are feeling the rising tension between the close-knit family as the eldest daugther becomes suspected as a witch. Note that there is an enourmous religious prejudice and bias in this movie as it is all about god worship and being an obedient person living out god's will. If you have a problem with the heavy religious tone this movie has, i would suggest not watching it, because i can understand how redundant that can get at times.<br/><br/> A really relaxing, but tense film, that is worth watching for many different reasons, do not expect gore or horror as i have said above, enjoy the sound effects, beautiful imagery and the usage of old english, which is rather rare in movies and art nowadays!"
"scottbeaudette","9","4","7","6 July 2018"," Not everything fits into the ""horror"" category cleanly
","The Witch is an atmospheric period drama/fantasy/thriller that is true to its surroundings. At the time and place, superstitious ideas about witches and devils, sins and redemption was a very social and personal normal condition. The Witch takes the classic fairy-tale approach down a dark path and one becomes a helpless spectator in a world that is both beautiful and frustrating at the same time. The acting is superb and writing borrows directly from historical Puritan and Elizabethan documents to preserve accuracy of dialog, set pieces and culture. It's a disquieting journey with a twist, but if you appreciate this kind of emotional investment in a film, you should find The Witch to be rewarding. What one makes of the ending is entirely personal."

","From the moment the film begins, you're trapped in a spider web of dread.<br/><br/>This is the tale of a deeply religious English pilgrim family who is exiled from their community, and made to start over alone in the countryside with nothing. From there, things go from bad to worse. That's all I should tell you about plot.<br/><br/>For right now, let's talk about the overall aesthetic of the movie.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is one of the most deliriously gorgeous films I've ever seen, owing most to its impeccable direction and production design. This is a movie that could potentially unseat ""Eraserhead"" as the most atmospherically bleak, unsettling, tense, and hopeless film ever (okay, at least for me). The experimental, string-based score ropes everything together -- deafening crescendos are shuffled with uneasy undertones and moments of paralyzing silence. The acting is excellent on all fronts; my only slight complaint being Ralph Ineson's overall diction, which seemed forced at times and occasionally muddled his line delivery.<br/><br/>But for all intents and purposes, this is an incredible movie. The reason for my 8/10 and not any higher is because it just isn't accessible to most people. Despite its stunning design and direction, many will be left unsatisfied or feeling stupid because they feel like they don't ""get it."" Probably like you, I hate movies that make me feel stupid. When I saw ""The Witch"" in theaters when it first came out, I felt stupid. I thought the movie was terrifying, but I felt stupid.<br/><br/>After a rewatch two years later, I finally understood why it's so scary, and why none of us should feel stupid, whether you've already seen it or not. I'll explain.<br/><br/>This is a movie that has been lambasted for being ""slow,"" ""boring,"" and having little to no discernible plot or explanation. While the film is admittedly a slow burn, you have to be prepared for what you're getting into. The hint is in the movie's subtitle: ""A New England Folktale."" That's exactly what this is -- it's a period piece, and a culmination of extensive research into the behaviors and speech of 17th century settlers in New England (look for an interview with director Robert Eggers with the British Film Institute). Much of the script is in an early-modern dialect, which can be confusing at times. Some of the themes could initially be dismissed as laughable; for example, the idea of a witch stealing an infant being both fathomable and deeply horrifying. <br/><br/>It's easy to see why many wouldn't be engaged by this movie beyond its production qualities. But we mustn't forget -- this is the era of Puritans and the Salem trials.<br/><br/>Let's get some context.<br/><br/>The correct mindset to watch this film in is thinking about it as an experience similar to reading ""Macbeth"" in high school. The cool thing about early-modern literature is that we all experienced it the same way -- whether we're currently 18 or 80, we all read that play in high school and were probably initially bored by it, despite understanding its importance. It's something that we imagine was probably terrifying and original a few hundred years back, but today seems stale. In truth, it was the written/oral product of King James I's obsession and fear of demonology and witchcraft. It was the real deal back then.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Puritans are settling in New England because they don't think the Anglo-Catholics are taking God seriously enough. The seed of witch hysteria across the Atlantic is planted, and we all know how things go in Salem.<br/><br/>The United States wasn't introduced to Shakespeare until the 1800s, long after this time period. But if they could've read/seen it, would ""Macbeth"" had been scary to the deeply religious Puritans? Maybe. What if they could experience a terrifying folktale as we experience movies today in the 21st century? Would they run screaming? <br/><br/>Today's horror films that are watchable mostly use (or at least attempt to use) original ideas and themes. ""The Witch"" isn't that. It's a folktale. It's written and shot like one. This isn't ""It Follows;"" there is no deep, allegorical connection to be made. It's a bedtime story told to impressionable little children by candlelight.<br/><br/>Dark folktales are never exactly masterpieces of plot and thematic structure, and this movie isn't one either. It has a very simple plot that isn't very scary (at least by modern standards). What's scary is the way it's delivered. Don't go into this movie like you're a snob and grasping at straws to develop ""hidden meanings"" or whatever. If you're really into film, this is probably ingrained in you whether you like it or not. Get rid of it before watching this. There is no hidden meaning to this film. It's not pretentious -- you're just thinking too hard.<br/><br/>Relish in the atmosphere. Go where the film takes you, even if it's confusing or nonsensical. It's okay to be confused. Being confused can be scary and uneasy. The monster under the bed is scarier if you don't know why it's there or where it came from.<br/><br/>Experience this movie in complete darkness and with the best possible sound system."
"Ricky112101","8","4","7","21 December 2017"," Disturbing and scary
","""The Witch"" is one of those types of horror movies that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or sexual content to be a success. No, this is one of those unsettling and terrifying horror movies. This particular film has an excellent cast with Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, and Kate Dickie carrying the film. Because the film is set in 17th century New England, it is quite hard to understand what is being said a lot of the time, but that is what makes this movie work in a sense.<br/><br/>The film is basically about a Puritan family who are told they are banished from their own village because they violated some religious rule that we are not told of. They end up moving to a small farm in the woods with a horse and several goats. Well, from there, things start going downhill. Their baby goes missing, presumably snatched by a wolf, but the children think something more sinister is going on. Supernatural disease also strikes when Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) goes missing, but comes back in an apparent possessed state of mind. The film is terrifying and suspenseful, and absolutely nothing is cheesy about it. It is actually quite mysterious, too. Is it a wolf? Is it a witch? Is it a demonically possessed goat? Is it Thomasin? Give this one a watch. I'm going to rate it 8/10."

","The Witch, or as I prefer to write it, The VVitch, follows a family as they are exiled from their home city and settle on a new plot of land where they are haunted by what they believe to be a witch from the woods. <br/><br/>I went into this movie knowing it was slow, particularly the first 20-30 minutes. However, I didn't find this to be the case at all. Maybe this was because I mentally prepared myself for the beginning or maybe not, I don't know. But I'd suggest preparing for a slow movie right off the bat. <br/><br/>Everything about this movie is pretty phenomenal. To start, the acting is spot-on. Every character is almost perfect, with the exception of one or two points with the child actors. But even then it wasn't terrible, it was just not as good as everything else. For the most part the child actors were great. Every line of dialogue is very well delivered, despite the fact that it's an old way of talking. Every actor seems to feel each line of dialogue and made it genuine and real, which I haven't seen at all in these kinds of movies. <br/><br/>The writing is, while done in a way from the 1630s, easy enough to understand while still maintaining that accuracy. It requires the audience to pay attention to what they're seeing to properly understand it, but it's not too terribly complex, nor is the story complicated or requiring you to understand every single word to know what's going on.<br/><br/>The movie actually has a very original concept. It takes a relatively unoriginal general idea/type of horror and makes it something original. The VVitch is more of a family drama caused by the result of a witch hanging out in the woods. And in that way it makes the characters realistic and relatable, but it's also something we don't see every day. Its a realistic, relatable horror movie that shows the effect that an element of horror has on a family. <br/><br/>Of course, part of making a good horror movie is making it scary, and this one succeeds on that level as well. It doesn't cater to all the typical horror tropes, but instead goes for subtlety. It's a slow- burn horror, so naturally the horror is few and far between, but thanks to the immense build up of tension and curiosity throughout the film every reveal or bit of horror is all the more effective. <br/><br/>The movie is mostly straightforward, but there is plenty that isn't explained. It requires you as the audience to think just a little to completely understand the movie, which I appreciated. The movie doesn't just spoon-feed you all the information you need to be completely satisfied. It treats the audience like a bunch of capable-of-comprehension people and allows you to figure stuff out on your own. Again, it's not like it's overly complicated though, it's pretty easy to understand.<br/><br/>The ending was pretty great too. Without any actual words, the movie manages to communicate a lot about the story to the audience. Plus it's just creepy and messed up, and that's always to be appreciated in a horror. <br/><br/>To top all this off, the movie has a great look. The shots, especially at the beginning, are beautiful. While they do die down towards the second and third act, the entire set is just so cool to look at that every shot is a scenic one. But as far as visuals go, it's not just in scenery. The set itself looks fantastic, and the costumes are spot on. I rarely notice these things, but dang, the costumes were good. Apparently they were even made from the same materials and patterns from the time, and it certainly shows. <br/><br/>I got so into this movie that about half an hour in when I wanted more pizza I didn't want to get up to get some, nor did I want to pause the movie. I didn't want to break the momentum of the story, and I didn't want to miss anything. So I sacrificed pizza for this movie. Eventually my friend paused the movie, at which point I grabbed the rest of an entire pizza and and took it with me to finish the movie. I wasn't going to going to risk going hungry again. The movie managed to steal my appetite by the third act though. It wasn't gross, it was just unsettling. <br/><br/>Overall The VVitch is fantastic. It's got great actors, great characters, great writing, an original concept, a great ending, and is overall a great movie to look at. I absolutely loved this movie. It's easily one of the best of the year, maybe even the best of the year. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie, so long as your not going in expecting your typical garbage horror flick."

","Slaughter, repressed sexuality, scarcity and family conflicts sway around the darkest corners of the eerie Puritan psyche.The Witch strikingly approaches the genre with its psychological horror and theatrical touch that stands out from the current flood of threadbare horror flicks.<br/><br/>The Puritans were a group of English Reformed Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who sought to ""purify"" the Church of England from all Roman Catholic practices, maintaining that the Church of England was only partially reformed. The British newcomers plundered and enslaved Native-American tribes from the North-easterly region. Their religious strictness led them to hold a series of trials that deliberately condemned innocents lives, a bleak period of the American history known as The Salem Witch Trials.<br/><br/>The film puts the viewer in the middle of a trial with a vague background: A clash of religious beliefs between the extreme austere father, William, against stern community leaders. Ostracised from the village, the scraggy farmer is compelled to take his dispirited family to homestead nearby wilderness, on the back of beyond. The forest adds up a claustrophobic sense to the scenery that almost engulfs the ramshackle dwelling and its residents who will gradually descent into hysteria and madness.<br/><br/>The intricate art of shocking audiences does not solely rely on paranormal creatures but on the set-up of the unknown. American film director, Robert Eggers, seems to majestically grasp the formula with ease by combining bleak Christian fanaticism with a grim distorted reality at full-bore .<br/><br/>Slaughter, repressed sexuality, dearth and family conflicts sway around the darkest corners of the eerie Puritan psyche. The denial of religious dogmas coupled with family conflicts takes the experience over plot, imbuing viewers with uneasiness and sheer dread. The film doesn't limit itself to delivering visceral bits, which undeniably build up dreadful peaks, but are far away from playing a key role. Furthermore, the use of negative space and the unsettling soundtrack devoid of clichÃ©-ridden rising crescendos grippingly evokes a disquieting atmosphere, in which a cascading series of ghastly events unfold.<br/><br/>The blurred line between reality and wicked fantasy are masterfully drawn in order to not only frighten audiences with abhorrent takes, but also outlines aspects beyond witchcraft and bigotry: The retrograde narrow-mindedness that ruled over Christian farming communities, which are categorised for its stark repression on any form of self-expression. Thomasin, the eldest daughter, is the embodiment of the paradigm-breaking spirit that opposes preconceived ideas, which once posed as unquestionable truths.<br/><br/>The end falls short in causing any unexpected reactions, however, it is a satisfactory cathartic conclusion of a flawless piece of art that is The Witch. Unfortunately, for its verbose framework, the film might dismay audiences that are yearning for unpredictable jumpscares, but most certainly, will enthral those who are in urge to plunge into an unique sombre experience."

The scenery is powerful, it could portrait any HP Lovecraft tale. The characters are believable, actors well directed. They all look, talk and act in a far distant culture, that sets you really in other world of possibilities, knowing for true that the forces involved in the development of the movie were just undisputed. <br/><br/>You know, science came after and a there's a thick layer of ignorance still now about a lot of matters. But in that solitude ? in the awakening of America ? I found myself watching my back, for my home's little cracks in the middle of the night.

Movies like The Babadook and It Follows continue to haunt me at the back of my mind whenever I think about them, like now... This year we have another frightfully good one - The Witch. <br/><br/>Like the previous luminous examples, Robert Eggers' debut film focuses on themes rather than on the usual tropes and plot to drive the story. It is a marvel of minimalism and a wonder of unnerving terror. Eggers' meticulous construction of historical details is spellbinding and he even goes to the extent of having the entire cast utter King James English. The Puritan world of Christianity is the disquieting battlefield and the sweet family stands no chance. It almost feels like the story of Job in which God has deserted them and lets the devil play with them like dolls. The drab cinematography is immaculately precise, every frame carefully thought out. Above every aspect of filmmaking, Eggers got the difficult ominous tone spot-on. The sense of dread is so overwhelming and enveloping that you can't breathe. 5 minutes will feel like 10 minutes - usually when I say this I mean it negatively, but not with The Witch. The film has coffin-loads of atmosphere, and the horror is so real that it borders on pure torment."

It seemed so simple and disturbing, a British family in the 17th century that has traveled to America in hope of finding happiness and success. Not agreeing with the local church, they leave the village they've been living in, to move out to the country and build their own house. Once they are settled in, strange things begin to happen and it seems that someone in the family is more than a human being. Relatively unknown actors and a feature film debut for director Robert Eggers.<br/><br/>Witches on film have been portrayed before, like The Blair Witch Project. It is something disturbing and brutal about witches, especially if you think about our own history here in Sweden where we for a long time burned women believed to be witches. The Witch is a drama horror film that doesn't rush its introduction. A lot of the story is created from the mood and the music. Instead of telling the story and explaining things through dialogue, Eggers lets the music and the cinematography speak for themselves. Sometimes the camera sweeps around the forest with creepy music playing in the background. Also religion plays a big part in the film. God and the belief in him, is always there and gets even worse when the family thinks they've been cursed. To make it even more realistic and believable, the dialogue is written in old English taken directly from old real writings from the same time.

","This movie is one of the worst cinematic experiences of my life. It suffered from a painfully slow pace (I think I aged whilst watching it), a senseless plot, ill-developed characters and unintelligible dialogues. The acting was mediocre, if I'm being kind. The trailer was misguiding, making you feel as if it would be a suspenseful and horrific mix of witch craft, fear and panic. It was nothing of the sort. For those who think it's a great take on America's historical dark magic period and depiction of terror and religious unraveling, that is all a farce. This movie is really not deep enough to be confused for 'art' or cinematic genius. It was deplorable - stay away."

It's a good story all around, maybe could have been expanded slightly but it was still good.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The setting/visuals. The time it was set, and the location on the edge of the woods makes for a great horror movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>One of the only problems with this movie is that it shouldn't really have been labeled a horror... although I'm not quite sure what would be a more accurate genre. Something psychological. Like ""The Shining"", but with much less of the scary/creepy visuals. (there are still some) It's more about a family's mental breakdown.<br/><br/>The other problem I had was that yes, it is a little hard to understand the characters sometimes. The dad is the worst. I had trouble in the beginning but if you devote a little more of your attention to what they're saying it should help.<br/><br/>My advice is, don't go in to it thinking you're seeing a run of the mill horror movie where your heart is pounding, wondering when the next jump scare is going to be. There's few, if any. (depending on how easily startled you are). Go in thinking you're going to see a well put together movie, with some psychological elements to it.<br/><br/>I was thinking about giving it an 8 because the acting, setting, and dialogue really blew me away, but, I gave it a 7 because I felt the ending could have been slightly better."

No build, no tension, a single jump scare and credits.<br/><br/>The score for this film is a tad offensive, it's the same exact score other B level horror films blast so loud you have to cringe a bit, followed by nothingness. Basic dialogue taking place in a pretty setting, then when you believe the film might be starting it is over and you're wondering where the hell the film from the trailers was, or where the ""horror"" aspect was hiding. The biggest flaw of this film is that no story is told, it's a couple of scenes strung together that don't build to anything, and in the end there is nothing of interest. No scares, no story, no narrative, a couple pretty shots of the wilderness and a goat.<br/><br/>If you really like old accents and monologues in dark rooms, this is for you.

This is just a piece of..well, I digress.<br/><br/>Other than the three ""cheap scares"", using overblown music and jump out tactics, and the BAD rubber prosthetic makeup, there was no horror. There was little suspense. There was a cheesy plot. There were undefined conflicts.

And BORED is what I was.<br/><br/>I do give high marks to the actors, that handled the archaic language nuances and seemed to be in character, but a mediocre script, and a lack of intensity/direction sunk this flick. My wife, a big horror /paranormal movie fan, was disappointed as well.<br/><br/>I should have known something was up when links to the ""preview/trailer"" landed on the Director explaining how he tried to be authentic to the time period.

I couldn't call it a creature feature, or a psychological thriller. Its not a docu-drama, but seems to try to be all these things without achieving any of them.

Well, at least a brother enjoys watching under his sister's shirt - you can consider that as some liking. They pray when they are alone, or together, during dinners, when walking...

"MoviesAreLife93","10","8","18","20 February 2016"," A wicked masterpiece
","""The Witch"" is undoubtedly one of the most skillfully made horror movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. This movie excels on multiple levels: the performances, the cinematography, the score, art direction, production design - and above all - its unmatched uniqueness. I'm fully confident that this movie will be remembered for quite some time.<br/><br/>Something so horrifying occurs during the first five minutes that we are 100% invested for the rest of the movie. We have seen this in the trailer: a young woman is playing peek-a-boo with her baby brother in an open field. Suddenly, the baby is snatched up by an invisible witch and taken deep into the woods. For the record, this movie does not attempt to leave the baby's fate up to question; we see everything. This is an incredibly bold move to make in the first five minutes, and it's frightening as hell. <br/><br/>This is not a movie that relies on jump-scares or gore. Rather, it's a perfectly paced slow-burner. Through flawless directing, we are completely aware of how serious of a role religion played for people of this time period. This allows us to understand their overwhelming fear of witchcraft and evil. It wasn't a superstition to them, it was a reality. What makes this film so exceptional is that we are able to feel that fear for ourselves. We sympathize so much with the family on screen that it breaks our hearts to see them afflicted with so much fear. It feels like we are witnessing an incredibly convincing nightmare from 1630s New England. <br/><br/>From start to finish, we are presented with so much vivid historical detail, that it's hard to look away from. The dialogue, the costume design, and the historical accuracy make the film all the more realistic. It legitimately feels like we are seeing the 1630s in-the-flesh; not one detail is missing.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie - not just to horror fans, but to film-lovers everywhere. The sheer level of focus makes it unlike any other horror movie. The performances are so convincing that we see actual fear in the characters' eyes. Nothing looks fake. The score is eerie and deeply unsettling. The cinematography is hauntingly flawless. <br/><br/>""The Witch"" is never difficult to take seriously. It is all at once a perfect historical film, a heart-breaking drama, and - above all - a blood-curdling horror film."

","The only thing scary about this film is that you have to pay to see it. I was truly disappointed and feel Walt Disney could have done a better job with it. The accents of the actors was very hard to understand at times and you had to really try to listen to what it was they were saying. The costumes and scenes were good as they did portray that era and what it would be like to be living in those conditions and times. The movie did try to be a scary thriller, as some critics stated it was supposed to be, but only with a couple of scenes (two or three). After a while the film got to the point of where it became boring as you waited and waited for something to scare you or make it worth while to see. Finally, the ending came and you sit there in disbelief thinking on the money and time you wasted."

","After just reviewing The Invitation and praising it's use of building tension, it saddens me that The Witch failed to do that. It's a very long slow story of an exiled family forced to live in the woods. <br/><br/>The twins are PURE evil and the old English accent had me reaching for the mute button after 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The parts that actually contained any sign of a witch were the only bits that made me perk up. There were some actually shocking and gruesome bits with the Witch involved however they were so rare and sparse it hardly deserves to be called a story about witches at all. <br/><br/>I had such high hopes for this but was majorly let down.

The cinematography was strong in most cases, though it was hard to distinguish exactly what you were looking at. The dialogue could use subtitles, as these accents, whether fake or real, are uttered in such a glib manner that you'll have a tough time understanding. Oh, and the prayers. Someone is saying a prayer every five minutes in this movie. I thought I was at a Jimmy Swaggart prayer-a-thon. But that's not the biggest problem. This movie sets you up with suspense, chilling music, and some interesting imagery, AND DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WITH IT. Think of this as M. Night's worst movie except with no attempt to scare you. Watch it on NetFlix....not even the tiniest bit scary."

","""Evil is the nature of mankind."" Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown<br/><br/>Hawthorne would be comfortable writing in the world of Robert Eggers' The Witch, depicting 1630 Puritans and the repression fostering that witch hunting world. (Need I mention Hester Prynne?) Sins have been committed, no doubt, and retribution seems to be the order of the day, but as in any solid horror flick like this, the evil forces are not clear, hiding as they do behind forests, quick cuts, and darkness.<br/><br/>William (Ralph Ineson) and his family are banned by the elders for his pride, never fully explained but seemingly stemming from his willfully breaking of the communal laws or his severe interpretation of religious law. Once outside the safety of the community's walls, the family is subjected to various horrors beginning with the snatching of the newborn child.<br/><br/>What witch snatched him, and it's never in doubt that witches are responsible, is briefly conceded to the shot of a voluptuous, ravenous female seducing teen son, Caleb (Harvey Schrimshaw). Beyond that truth lies a host of allegorical possibilities including Brown's sweeping indictment of humanity (see intro quote) with thoughts no doubt going to Adam and Eve.<br/><br/>More possibilities lie in the teenage lust Caleb has for his beautiful teen sister, Thomason (Anya Taylor-Joy) and his brother and sister's collusion with the black goat, a sure stand in for the demon. Along with Dad's sinful pride, these sins seem waiting retribution and what better situation than this self-righteous family situated on the edge of a Hawthornean forest peopled by witches.<br/><br/>Beyond the explication of punishment and myth, The Witch is just darn good horror filmmaking: The mise en scene has multiple little objects to carry bleak-house metaphor well, the cinematography emphasizes the dark landscape and hidden horrors, and the characters are grimly poetic enough to be holding pitchforks in front of a Gothic farmhouse.<br/><br/>Having been a Catholic altar boy and schooled by nuns, I can vouch for the film's accurate and titillating setups for sin and guilt. This is a horror film bound to please horror geeks and novices and the rest of us sinners in between."

"justynschwoegler","10","5","10","30 May 2016"," The Best Horror Movie Since The Shining!
","Well some movies are a bit more haunting than others. The Witch is a Period Piece set in 1630's New England, American. It centers around family who moves out into the woods and suspects that there is a Witch that wants to hurt them. I'm just coming out honest that this movie is a 2016 Masterpiece in Psychological Horror. Let's start off with the acting.<br/><br/>The Acting is amazing and each character fits their roles very well. There is also a lot of character development between the characters. The Mother played by Kate Dickie is the more sad character and you feel for her in her scenes. The two children played by Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger do very well for what they are given and are not that annoying as some other children in other horror movies. The Other Male Child played by Harvey Scrimshaw is amazing also for what he is given and really becomes his character later in the movie. Finally the two best characters were the father played by Ralph Ineson and the Oldest Child played by Anya Taylor-Joy are both fantastic characters and please watch out for them I bet there gonna be in some major titles soon (Anya Taylor-Joy is gonna be 2016's ""Morgan"").<br/><br/>The Cinematography is top notch! Easily each and every shot in the film could be in a Art Museum. That's because there is a lot colors and depth to each and every shot which something we don't see in most films today. There are a lot of color schemes of Gray which work for what it is and is likable.<br/><br/>Now the best part of the film is how scary it is? Umm... This Movie may just be the scariest movie ever made! There are tons of scenes with tension and lots of disturbing scenes (which I will not spoiler) throughout the film's run time. It also gives some time to think in between the disturbing scenes. Surprise! There is absolutely no Jump Scares in the film, the Film uses horrifying sounds, and disturbing images to scare the viewer to the bone. Also the Film oozes Atmosphere and tone which the tone feels like we really are watching something real and we shouldn't be watching it!<br/><br/>In Conclusion, The Witch is a 21th Century Masterpiece and is my Favorite Film of the year. So do yourself a favor and go out, rent (or better yet buy) this Movie, Watch the movie with some friends, and live deliciously."

","The witch is a slow burn. It isn't filled with spooks and scares, but instead relies on an atmosphere of constant tension created by the Gray and barren landscape and its subtle yet foreboding string instrument score. This is the work of an up and coming great director who seems to understand directing much better than just about any horror director as of late. The camera stays pretty still the entire movie. There are no tracking shots, no 10 minute one-take scenes, and besides a scene in the beginning with the family leaving Jamestown colony, I cannot recall the camera moving much at all. This lack of movement helps emphasize the isolation that the family must be feeling throughout the entirety of this movie. Now most people I assume won't enjoy this movie at all. Nothing is spelled out for the audience(even the dialogue is accurate to the time- period, so it is not easy to understand, especially with their heavy accents). The ""witch"" itself is never given a concrete form , which I'm sure will also frustrate people, and the ending is very ambiguous and maybe even anticlimactic, but for me it worked. This is a film that begs to be seen multiple times and dissected. From the family members each mirroring one of the deadly sins, to the fact that this movie may or may not have unreliable narrator syndrome, the witch is a s=dense film. Besides some minor pacing issues and some bad choices when it comes to background/ off screen noise, this movie is a near perfect period piece horror film. A solid 9/10 and the movie to beat in 2016"

What's creepy about this film is the atmosphere and the musical score. What was scary about the film was the haunting imagery. The acting for the film is phenomenal everyone does a great job. When I was watching this film it felt like I was in the 1600's. Whoever did the set designs and the costumes all deserve an Oscar nomination. The directing for this film by Robert Eggers did a fantastic job for his directorial debut and I can't wait to see what he does next. There were a couple problems that I had with the film but they're only minor ones. The pacing of the film does have a couple slow parts and the language that the characters speak is hard to understand but later on in the film you start to have a better understanding of what they are saying. A lot of people didn't like the ending but I thought it was a good ending and I will be remembering that last shot for awhile. Overall if you're a fan of these art house horror films then this is for you. I think this is a film that will be analyzed in film schools and will come down to a horror classic."

Instead there were a bunch of great beginnings, and that was that. The dialect I understand was spoken to the time period, but the way they spoke it, with accents and pace, made it somewhat difficult to understand and decipher at first. It was hard to keep up with what they were saying, which got to be annoying. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more had I found this movie on Netflix or Redbox, with subtitles & lower expectations.

The film throws a scary scene featuring ""The Witch"" at us in the first ten minutes but after that it builds(if you can call it that) unsuccessfully for over an hour. the first thirty minutes the audience accepts as necessary to build suspense and flesh out the characters but one boring scene after the next has the people bored and unamused. Now keep in mind I'm not the kind of person who requires instant gratification in film. The babadook is my favourite horror film in years. The Witch is not that film. Several times we expect something scary to finally happen only to be greeted by a rabbit. This film felt like it was edited in the 70s and is choppy at best. It also ends more times than LOTR with each fade to black making us hope that it's finally over. This film is well acted but that's about it. It's hilariously unscary."

I was excited when I had to take a restroom break in the middle of the movie, if that tells you anything. At the end of the movie, I looked at my friend and said ""I told you we should have seen Deadpool."" The audience, all in agreement, said ""No Kidding!"" Not one person left the theater happy that they saw it, save yourself and avoid this train wreck."

"cody-phillipsphotography","10","6","13","29 February 2016"," A completely new experience in the horror genre
","Horror has been having it's highs and lows as of recent. There have been some fantastic film, like It Follows and some duds, such as last year's Dark Summer. Luckily, out of the dark waters of big budget horror comes spectacular indie horror films that defy the genre. The Witch defies what horror has been and what it will be.<br/><br/>The Witch is one of the only films to rattle me to the core. I found myself alone in the theater, luckily being the only one to watch this film. I had nobody else there to watch with, feeling just as isolated as the characters in the film. I had to tell myself that this was just a movie several times throughout, as I became so invested in the film that I forgot it wasn't real. Being alone, I was fully able to immerse myself into The Witch, a feeling that I never will forget.<br/><br/>This film is beautiful. Not only is the script perfect, the score is absolutely beautiful. It is absolutely haunting, creating the perfect atmosphere for the film. The score was perfect, coming in at the right times, causing so much more tension when there could have been some just from the film alone. This film, as many others films could have been, relies heavily on its soundtrack, as it puts forth even more dread than presented in the film. Without the soundtrack, this film would have felt extremely empty. But, the score needs a great movie to work efficiently. And Robert Eggers directing the film makes the film worthy of such a fantastic score. His camera work seems like he has had years of experience, while this is his debut feature. He had control over all aspects, as well as a clear goal that he wanted to achieve. His choice of color palate also was fantastic, as the cool blue tones had the feeling of dread, which is constantly present throughout the film. There were some scenes that were extremely dark and hard to watch, but this makes the film even more mysterious and it makes you even more uncomfortable than you were before. If this film were directed by another person (many other horror films are like this), the film could have been an absolute trainwreck. But in Eggers' hands, The Witch is able to prosper and become the film that achieves its full potential.<br/><br/>The acting was superb as well. These performances felt extremely pure, since it seemed as if I were watching something filmed during the time the movie was set in. The standout, of course, was Anya Taylor-Joy. Her performance was the most genuine, where Ralph Ineson gives the most powerful performance. Both actors together had fantastic chemistry, creating the tension and bond needed for the film to succeed. Katie Dickie also was fantastic, being able to completely become a grieving mother. This cast was honestly just stunning.<br/><br/>I can say that The Witch is not for everybody. I've read countless reviews claiming that this is the worst movie that they have seen. I feel that this film should not have had a wide release, as the general public won't, and hasn't, enjoyed the movie at all. If this film was released in independent theaters, I think that there would be a whole other reception from the public, as not everyone would be going and seeing it. Nonetheless, The Witch is absolutely an amazing film.<br/><br/>While 2016 doesn't seem like it will be the year where many quality horror films are released, The Witch absolutely makes up for the movies that won't be coming out. While this film may not be for everyone, it should be taken with a grain of rice and should be at least considered, as it is a fantastic film. I can say that this may be one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the greatest horror movies to be released."
"amyamy-49421","3","6","13","27 February 2016"," Weird, Creepy, Unique, Disturbing
","Weird. This movie was definitely weird, and that in itself is not necessarily bad. Weird can be okay. I found this movie to be weird, unique, disturbing, interesting, and creepy. Not scary, more creepy. The good parts about this movie was the scenery, the acting, the uniqueness (no clichÃ©s in *this* film), and the time period (mid 1600's). The absolute worst part of this film was that I couldn't understand most of it. I didn't understand most (and that means over 50%) of the sentences. I wanted subtitles. I'm reading from others that the dialogue was a wee bit hard to understand. Ya' THINK? That's kind of like saying a cannon fired on a ship gives a few splinters. Anyway, I understood about 20% of the dialogue. The second worst thing was that it didn't tie things together. SPOILER ALERT (kind of): I waited for the end to tell me who the witch really was, what did she do, was the teenage girl insane (that would have been a better ending in my opinion), why did the mother hallucinate, was anyone really evil, what happened to Caleb in the cave, what happened to the twins, etc. etc. The third worst element was the over dramatized scenes for effect -- he gets gutted, she gets strangled, he upchucks a bloody apple, she gets the knife, he gets shot in the eye (but later, no blood!), she gets hen-pecked, the boy has a 1950 haircut... my WORD! And the ending was just silly to me. A talking goat? At that point, I wondered if the film was realistic and someone lost their mind. Nope. Sheer silly fantasy. This may be my failing in that I was expecting realism from a fantastical film. But the dark mood, the cinematography, and the imagery haunted me. The acting was superb. Also, the paranoia, suspicion, and mistrust that existed in a family who loved each other was done well."

","Yep folks exactly that! I had heard a great deal about this new, little flick that could. Apparently there was a good vibe about this movie as well as positive response and feedback...the darling movie at Sundance...<br/><br/>So naturally, I went in to see it with some interest and some hopeful, albeit modest, expectations. After all this time of the year treats it's movie going audiences to a plethora of toxic cinematic garbage. <br/><br/>Case in point ""Deadpool"", nothing more than a pedestrian cinematic mediocrity, sits at the top of the crap pile. <br/><br/>So in order to avoid Ryan Reynolds at all costs and his painful mimicking impression at being edgy and original, I went for ""The Witch"" as somekind of anti-dote...<br/><br/>And instead of anything remotely original, visionary or at least entertaining, I was treated to a overwrought, self-important, self-congratulatory, lazy and underwhelming turd of a movie! <br/><br/>Interesting cast, gorgeous cinematography...the rest...forgettable, disposable and utterly inconsequential. <br/><br/>You know, it is very easy to pick on big budget or genre movies and to bring them down and pounce on them. But indie movies have somehow gotten a pass over the years, because of this fake aura of authenticity they seem to carry whenever they come out of a film festival, like Sundance for example. <br/><br/>Not this time. Nope, not at all. ""The Witch"" plain sucks...badly...and unfortunately in the process reminds me of ""The Blair Witch Project"" another fetid piece of putrefaction, which gives me vivid migraines to this very day!"
"Ramascreen","10","6","13","18 February 2016"," If you're a true horror fan, you have got to watch THE WITCH
","A cinematic achievement in horror. THE WITCH is superbly crafted. Writer/director Robert Eggers has given us the perfect blend of psychological and supernatural thrill that will terrify you to your core. You'll never stop talking about THE WITCH long after it's done.<br/><br/>A family in 1630s New England was banished from their settlement, and so the couple and their five children are out living in the wilderness, struggling to survive. Faith is the only thing that keeps them together. But their newborn son mysteriously vanishes and their crops fail, and the family begins to turn on one another, as they are torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.<br/><br/>What's brilliant about THE WITCH, on top of its excellent attempt on trying to be accurate to the period it portrays, is that it's very different from any of the other horror movies we get out there. No jump scares, no cheap gimmicks, no pointless plot. Everything is built up to lead you to creepy and unnerving discomfort and much of it also reminds me of dark paranoia thrillers of the '70s, where there are plenty of suspicions and blame to go around. Writer/director Robert Eggers successfully messes with his characters' and the audiences' minds. In addition to that, great choice on using the olde English mixed with excellent costume design and chilling cinematography, and young talent Anya Taylor-Joy is a revelation, THE WITCH gives a unique and refreshing take on this genre. It's frightening, it's terrifying, full of twists and turns you don't see coming a mile away."
"swilliky","5","6","13","18 February 2016"," The Witch is creepy but also confusing
","This New England folktale shows the difficulty of settling a new land, the delusion of blind devotion, and the troubles of an isolated youth. The movie moves slow with brief disturbing scenes to bring the viewer into the plot but overall amounts to a more confusion than actual horror. There are certainly things throughout that will leave viewers cringing in their seats, or on the couch since this film seems to have trouble showing in all theaters and may be more of a rental. The horror is certainly there and the Writer/Director Robert Eggers does plenty to ratchet up the tension but falls short of a complete story.<br/><br/>With only a family in the midst of the horror, the characters are a majority of kids with the two parents being Game of Thrones alumni. Kate Dickie plays the mother Katherine who slowly devolves into insanity as her family is slowly picked off by malevolent forces. Ralph Ineson plays the father whose faith is out of control. His deep croaking voice delivers dialogue in such a profound way and worked perfectly in this haunting setting.<br/><br/>CHECK OUT MORE OF THIS REVIEW AND OTHERS AT swilliky.com"

"rojobaron-197-234498","2","8","19","28 February 2016"," Historical Realism, Suspense and Disappointing Excuse for a Plot
","This was my wife's choice for our movie entertainment this weekend which was surprising since suspense has not been a traditional choice of hers if at all. I think that the historical realism as regards costume, setting and language was what baited her in. Those characteristics were available in abundance but they certainly didn't save the story. In fact the language was as much a detriment as a bonus. You end up trying to figure out what is being said more than following the plot which for this movie might be a good thing. Suspense was mostly characterized by spooky music with zero action to accompany it and depressing sets/scenery. You come away thinking that 17th century colonial life is gray, cloudy and dismal. The plot is characterized by a couple of gruesome actions that are barely related to each other and do nothing to build much of a story line. I felt like I was watching short stories from ""Creepy"" magazine that the writer tried to tie together but didn't quite succeed. The historicity disclaimer at the end, telling us that the movie was based on period records and dialogs, were poor attempts to document and pretentiously justify a shambling, depressing fantasy whose finale is a talking goat and chanting naked women floating around a bonfire (which are not DOCUMENTED as ever actually happening in any source I know of). When the credits came up my wife looked at me and said, ""Really?"". Apparently, to many, this bit of pretentiousness is meat to the large number of people who have jumped on the bandwagon of the even more pretentious Cannes Film reviewers that thought this was a good movie. I mean c'mon, did you really enjoy this dog?"
"dave-mcclain","4","8","19","19 February 2016"," ""The Witch"" is a stylistically inventive cautionary tale, but is lacking in basic entertainment value.
","1692, Salem Village and environs, within England's newly-renamed American colony, the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Political upheaval, town and family rivalries, religious disagreements, constant fear of Indian attacks, and some individuals' psychological and medical conditions created a perfect New England storm that exploded into what history calls the Salem Witch Trials. Based on unquestioned belief in the Bible, these colonists believed in the literal existence of witches and demons. Stemming from a lack of scientific knowledge, the Puritans also ascribed many natural occurrences to God or the Devil, depending on the prevailing opinions in their society. And, finally, the lack of separation of church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that their government wrote and executed laws (and sometimes executed their people) based on their religious principles. The result of all this was a mass hysteria which occupied the colony's governmental apparatus and legal system for over a year and led to the killing of 20 accused witches. Now, having said all that, I have to tell you that ""The Witch"" (R, 1:33) is not about the Salem Witch Trials. However, taking place in the same general area 32 years before the witchcraft hysteria in and around Salem Village, all the same elements play out in the life of one Puritan family.<br/><br/>William Nolastname (Ralph Ineson) is an extremely pious man, so pious that the leaders of Massachusetts Bay invite him to take his family and leave. (This is kind of like ISIS breaking away from Al Qaeda for not being radical enough.) William happily packs up a horse-drawn cart and takes his wife, Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), and son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), the younger twins, Jonas and Mercy (Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger) and baby Samuel even further out into the wilderness. They establish a homestead in the shadow of a deep, dark forest, but, despite their fervent prayers, things aren't going quite as well for them as they would've hoped.<br/><br/>Life is tough in colonial America and it's even tougher when you're a day's ride away from anyone else. William's crops fail and the hunting ain't so good either. Then, baby Samuel disappears. One moment he's enjoying watching Thomasin playing peek-a-boo with him and the next, he's just gone. The family assumes he was taken away by a wolf, but the audience knows that the reality is even more frightening. As the family members venture into those forbidding woods looking for answers (and food), things go from bad to worse. Caleb disappears, family members reveal uncomfortable secrets to each other and as their stresses and insecurities build, serious accusations of witchcraft are tossed around.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a stylistically inventive cautionary tale, but is lacking in basic entertainment value. The characters speak in Old English (think: King James Version of the Bible) and with antiquated British accents. This makes the dialog simultaneously interesting and hard to decipher (although it does get easier as the movie progresses). The acting is outstanding which, when combined with the small setting and even smaller cast, gives a realistic, even voyeuristic feel to the action. The plot, however, is intentionally un-realistic. First time feature film writer-director Robert Eggers has based the dialogue on actual official records and personal journals of the time period, and his story, on popular folklore and superstitions of the day. The result is a film that's original, but convoluted, and has open-ended plot points that call to mind a more European style of filmmaking which many Americans find frustrating. With a terrific cast and original (or at least, unusual) tone and style, along with great educational value (in understanding how something like the Salem Witch Trials could have happened) and relevant lessons as they relate to the dangers of religious extremism in the modern world, ""The Witch"" is just a little too overwrought and unsatisfying for me to call it ""entertaining"" and recommend it.

","I'm sitting in the theater, the movie just ended, I am in shock and awe (amongst many other emotions). There were maybe 5 groups of 2-3 people in the theater. They immediately get up to leave as soon as the credits start rolling and I hear one of the groups say ""this is the worst movie I've ever seen"" and another group says ""what the f--- was that, can we get our money back? *insert obnoxious laughter*"" At first, these sentiments made me feel a little bad because I enjoyed the movie so much. But this is not a people pleasing movie. It would be easy to just say ""They're sheeple. They don't understand it."" But honestly, the movie is quite hard to follow; due to the language. The pace is incredibly slow; for the average Hollywood horror flick. And what horror elements that we do see is completely bizarre and psychological.<br/><br/>I don't even want to talk about the plot, storyline, acting, or directing. It's all so unbelievable. Everything about this movie is just perfection. There's nothing I could say to appreciate the hard work that went into this movie and the imagination.<br/><br/>Noroi had been my most favorite horror movie of all time for 7 years until I saw this one. Nothing came close, but now The Witch is easily #1 on my list. It's a... different... movie. It's definitely not for everyone. But I'm really glad it's had as much success as it's had.

"FelipeCarrillo","10","7","16","16 April 2016"," ""The VVitch"": A Jewel of Pure Horror Since ""The Conjuring"" Film.
","Robert Eggers joins the list of the best directors in the genre of the horror of the decade with his first invention of the genre, along with my great idol, James Wan.<br/><br/>There are great attributes in the film, the most important ""printing"". It is logical to think that the movie will comply with poor requirements of today's horror films, but no, this goes beyond, it has tone, it has history, it has soul and has strength. The debut of the director and writer Robert Eggers revolutionizes the genre for the 21st century; trampling all the clichés of the genre and proposing a new face for horror films, it is intelligent, absorbing, stressful and really leaves the audience with a trauma after leaving the theater.<br/><br/>The project of Eggers has own terror and does not need jump-scares or any other discounted help to create an atmosphere that even without that it passes nothing wrong feels tension and danger. Perhaps, it is true that ""The VVitch"" won't have the same thematic impact that had ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1991 but if it will have a drastic impact on films of last 5 decades. To create a masterpiece like this, it is not necessary to record scenes difficult to understand (""Inception"" - ""Donnie Darko"") but record scenes difficult to see, film does not take decisions easy but is one of the few excellent horror films where the psychological is not the first trick. The only purpose of the director was capturing the true tale of the New England where religion took side against evil.<br/><br/>An extremely religious family composed by mother (Katherine - Kate Dickie) - a Christian woman committed 100 percent to pray and be in communion in all respects religious-, father (William - Ralph Ineson) - a woodcutter who must confront himself for standing to his family and deal with everything that is over him-, the eldest daughter, and face female protagonist of the movie (Thomasin - Anya Taylor-Joy) - a teenager girl from a religious family that's happening by physical and hormonal changes typical for a young man who is prone to overlook the situation that will give a twist to the plot of her life-, the duo of younger siblings, (and so frightening) Mercy and Jonas - Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson)-two ordinary children who serve as gate to destroy the little stability that the family had had after they banished them (this sounds very similar to ""Adam and Eve"") is confronted to begin again once they were evacuated from the villa where they remained (have to take into account that it is the MDCXXX century (16th century), where there are no hotel, houses or shelters) for purely religious reasons. The father being the head of the family, decides to entrust himself to the Lord and bring them to a forgotten forest to begin a new life together filled with love and peace. After settling there, children play, the father imitates a grower, mother do household chores with her daughter, all normal, until evil touches to their door. Strange but meticulously timed events begin to happen and tension and flame of the film is born and progresses in an uncontrollable manner.<br/><br/>A big plus for the movie was the period where was record it, where everything seemed a film of horror, even Eggers' team make it seem better than it was at that time. It is imposing the eye and hand of the director for a show scene with such high quality, dark, evil, totally expressionless. Touching parameters of all horror films but revolutionizing them, as the rain where terror was more dramatic than physical, the forest, where someone was not intended them, someone wanted them, the witch, the presentations were great, Eggers is my third master.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect. The formula is again present. No Hollywood stars is needed to give tone and fame to this project. The little unknown cast made us familiarize ourselves better with the characters and in part served to launch the notoriety to Anya Taylor-Joy (born in Miami, but proudly bred by Latinos) and two children.<br/><br/>The first appearance of the witch is totally frightening and surprising, it makes to scream to the public with natural elements, with images and a monumental instrumentation that decorate the scene as a typical and disturbing tale of fear.<br/><br/>The second appearance of the witch is too much ""Red Riding Hood"" but the more praised. I have no words to express the mysticism, finesse but at once grotesque introduction, ambiance, scenery, everything, everything...<br/><br/>While some people, the end not has seemed them very good, for my was the best, and that it was the result of an excellent game, that had that be the end and the way how they projected it was ambitious, real and mysterious. Colors, soundtrack, photography, cinematography, art, performances and the contribution to the genre of mystery and horror is colossal. It left a mark, a record."

"ronakkotian","9","3","5","29 June 2019"," Not your typical everyday horror movie
","The Witch is a very different type of horror. I'm saying this now, NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS FILM! In a world where we're used to films that rely heavily on jumpscares, The Witch goes on a more psychological route where it doesn't use any of the modern-day horror tricks like loud noises or jumpscares. This is what makes it very conflicting for the audience. For me, I found this technique highly effective.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the horror genre, I haven't seen a horror film which is so capable and insanely crafted like The Witch. This is the writer-director Robert Eggers' first feature film and I could tell he has a lot of talent. Each and every shot is handled so meticulously that I'm surprised that this is Eggers' first movie. Eggers really cares about this project. From the colour scheme, the costumes, the lighting to the atmosphere. All of this became so important to make the audience feel like they're in the 1630s. The attention to detail fully immersed me to this world. The decision to make everyone speak in the Old English language further enhanced the realism and brought you even closer to the characters and atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting by everyone involved was perfect. The way everyone spoke and emoted felt so real and so believable. Each performance was strong and felt like this was a real family. This aided me into believing all the events that take place over these 90 minutes. The script is thought-provoking and requires the audience's full attention to understand what's happening. A core element in a horror movie is the music. The Witch has such an uneasy and terrifying background score that adds to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>I loved the way the makers portrayed the Witch in this film. Despite not showing the Witch much, you still sense its presence terrorising the family allowing the film to become more unsettling. The only problem I have with the film is its pacing. I felt it was a bit too slow. However, the film's harrowing atmosphere and characters made this feel like an experience like no other.<br/><br/>As a debut, I have immense praise for Robert Eggers' take on the horror genre and look forward to his future projects. As mentioned before, The Witch isn't for everyone. This movie is made for horror and film lovers who appreciate the craft that goes into creating a movie as well as understand what true horror is."

","I understand the disappointment of those who expected The Witch to be a horror. There aren't jump scares, monsters or running with Satan in a forest. But there is atmosphere, authenticity (oh, the old English), tension and great acting. Moreover, in the first 10 minutes it's shown that the witch is really there, and no twists like ""the main heroine is the witch"", ""everything is just religious psychosis"" or ""it's open to everyone's interpretation"" will follow.<br/><br/>The witch is not portrayed as a monster that goes around forest, murdering teenagers on every corner, but mainly as a ubiquitous, untouchable evil. The scenes with her are short, but just as effective. <br/><br/>The Witch has problems because it is psychological, historically authentic and without action. I liked it, but mainstream used to ""horrors"" like Annabelle won't probaply get it."

","Modern films such as Kiki's Delivery Service or any film in the Harry Potter franchise take the idea of a witch and make them characters that the majority of people will like.

It reminds/teaches us that witches can be freaking scary. <br/><br/>This movie seriously feels like we're being told a story around a campfire in the best possible way. This must be what people during the Salem Witch Trials believed happened on a regular basis. It feels like a legend (or a legal account depending on where you are in history) being told to warn sinners about what could happen if you let the devil into your life. The movie even outright says it in its alternate title, The VVitch: A New England Folk-Tale. If you go into the movie with that kind of mindset, more of the elements will start to make sense. <br/><br/>This movie would have been rated higher if I could just understand the entire script! I luckily was able to piece most of the story together through the dialogue I could understand (props to Anya Taylor-Joy and Kate Dickie) but the father and the son were very hard to understand through certain parts of the film. It's hard for me to be fully immersed if I have to go back in my head and think of what they could have possibly said.<br/><br/>I hope more people see this film. Seeing the discrepancy between critics and audiences sadden me because this was really well-made. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, with diction being lost to historical accuracy (i think) and shots that lasted a little too long coming to mind, this movie deserves (most of) the credit it is given."
"Tehmeh","9","3","5","5 January 2017"," Moody, raw and disturbing.
","I don't quite know what to say about ""The Witch"", but I'll certainly try. To sum it up in a stupid way, it's about a family of settlers coming to New England from England. They're extremely religious, to the point where they are driven off from an already religious community. So they live alone in the crude wilderness. Life is hard. They live in poverty, under all kinds of stress and tragic events soon follow. There might or might not be a witch involved. That is all, no spoilers.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a horror movie that is actually a movie. It's not a soulless studio product, it's not about jumpscares or about dumb and uninteresting characters you won't care about. It doesn't dance around hard subjects, and if it wants to show you something, it doesn't shy away. It has that '70s movie feeling to it, so the quality is there. The craft of cinema is continuously on display. It's very well shot, very well paced, filled with exceptional acting and it takes a minimalist approach to almost everything. The locations and clothing feel so real, because they are. You feel like you are in the dirt with these people. <br/><br/>Religion is a big part of the movie. I think many people might avoid it for that, religious and non-religious alike, but hear me out. The religion of these people certainly is of a strict kind. Many might find it offensive, as if the movie is making a statement against religion or Christianity in general. Maybe it is, maybe not so much, but I, as a Christian, didn't take offense to it. In fact the movie might have worked on me better because of it. I did recognize parts of myself in some of these characters. Many people back then treated their religion with utmost importance to the point of raw harshness, and I like how this movie shows it. What I like about the religious aspect (which is always present in the film) is that the characters aren't made to be ""evil"". You certainly question them a lot and some of their words or actions do seem outright crazy, but ultimately the movie shows them as real people under unimaginable stress, not so much as villains - which is vital for the movie to work. <br/><br/>And the movie works. I was always questioning the main characters, their mental stability, but I was also sensing that perhaps there really is something dangerous and evil out there. It's not a Shyamalan movie that just takes a sudden turn in the end, but there are turns. And when they come, they are deserved, and they do not destroy the earlier parts of the movie leading to those revelations. There is ambiguity to this film though, and I think it's not about the writer/director Robert Eggers being lazy. It certainly doesn't feel like a ""just bring your interpretation to it"" - hack job, but instead it leaves you thinking about it. Not out of frustration on your part or pretentiousness from the writer's part, but out of curiosity.<br/><br/>The actors are top-notch. Veterans Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson are outstanding which is a given. The two older children are played by Harvey Scrimshaw and Anya Taylor-Joy. Scrimshaw and Taylor-Joy are excellent, and Taylor-Joy really steals some low-key moments. She has a good career in front of her, it's easy to see. It was these two people that stole the show, and I haven't seen them anywhere before this. I'm glad I did now. However I want to make a special mention about the little kids. You know this isn't a soulless Hollywood movie when the child actors don't make you cringe. In fact, some of the most harrowing scenes in this movie involve pretty good child acting. So well done, Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger. <br/><br/>I already complimented Robert Eggers. He did a very good job, and I'm looking forward to his future movies. I must also compliment the DP, because this is a beautifully shot movie. The shots are well framed and lit, and they linger on for quite some time at the right moments. I got some ""Shining"" vibes from some of the visual aspects. It's not that great, but there are some similarities. Same with the music - it's not really ""just"" music, but noise to make you uncomfortable along with the visuals you're seeing. Just add the hard life of wilderness, and the disturbing mood is set. <br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a hard watch. It's not a popcorn movie, but it's not a shock film either. It's just so raw and real, and the tension is always present. The tension eats you a little and gets under your skin. There are some really disturbing scenes, and the minimalist approach works wonderfully with them, because the movie doesn't make a big deal about any of it. It just shows them to you, and they're so much more powerful because of it. <br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie for everyone who hates what the horror movie industry has become and yearns for the good old days. I'd recommend it even for those who normally don't like to watch anything to do with religion or occult. It's a slow burner, but it's full of real, raw quality. If you want a fast-paced spookfest or a clear-cut story with every question answered, then this movie might not be for you. For me it's a gem. A gem that I won't be seeing again soon, because I think it got a bit too far under my skin and like I said, it's not an easy watch. Whatever the case, it's an excellent movie. Not just a horror movie, but a movie."
"ben-00747","9","3","5","24 July 2016"," The VVitch, not the witch project.
","I understand why people don't like this movie. If you don't get it, go watch horror movies that don't involve Hollywood themes. Many independent and foreign films offer aspects of an open mind, which can lead you in the right direction. If you're looking for the next Blair Witch Project, then look elsewhere.<br/><br/>This film can hold a candle to the greatest, not like Braveheart or the Gladiator, but more like the Piano. It takes an understanding of the time period and classic witchcraft to follow this epic film. That being said, this movie was spectacular, it has a feel of what could or would have happened. It's not some cheesy jump scare or gory Hollywood slasher, it is a true art form horror. <br/><br/>This movie had me on the edge from the beginning. I've watched a lot of artistic horror films and this one is a real masterpiece. I am honored to know that films like this are still being made. I would have added more nudity and gore, but it holds its own and doesn't really need my suggestion. When I thought it was over, they stacked more, and that little bit was even better. All of the parts played were riveting especially Anya Taylor-Joy; which left me breathless and begging for a longer run. Wonderful work! I absolutely loved this film, please make more like this!"
"skybrick736","9","3","5","10 July 2016"," The Witch (9/10)
","The Witch is set in New England during the early European settlement period of America in the 1600's. The dialogue of the film was too written well considering the dialect people spoke back then. At one point the English subtitles had to be turned on just to properly follow some of the things the characters were saying. The characters with the tough script really pulled off this horror film with high emotions and uncertainty of faith, something obviously very important to people back then. The atmosphere of the film was very hopeless right from the get-go creating uneasiness and a somber mood. The film steadily gets better and more disturbing, leaving the viewer mystified to many different aspects of the story-line. The Witch is very much a psychological horror building up to the climax, which had a fantastic pay-off. The ending is very chilling with a couple memorable scenes and bits of dialogue. The Witch, in my opinion, is a highly recommended film and it's also shown by many positive reviews surrounding it."
"Icedooitle","8","3","5","25 May 2016"," To Fear a Witch
","The full title is, The Witch: A New England Folktale. Like Grimm's fairy tales, American folklore has taken revisions over the centuries to become a palatable collection of juvenile life lessons. Anyone who has read the original versions of these stories knows how brutal, horrifying, and far removed they are from our current values. As much as I would not condone reading original classic witch tales to a small child, they do contain much deeper implications and ideas than the simple ""Don't tell lies"" that are gleaned from modern revisions. What's fascinating about The Witch is how familiar the setting and story is, without a single cliché or moment of prediction to speak of. The evil that was feared in 17th Century Puritan America has been so eclipsed by the human horrors of The Salem Witch Trials, that we have forgotten what it was to fear a witch.<br/><br/>We know these characters only by their Christian names. William removes his family from their Colonial settlement due to an incompatibility of faith. The colony of Puritans isn't Christian enough. With his wife, Katherine, William takes his 4 children into the wilds of the Northeast. Airs of The Crucible envelope the setting. Common pronouns are replaced with ""thines"" and ""thous"". Dialogue is delivered as if quoted from Shakespeare or the Bible itself. In the past, this oral dynamic has always sounded ardently rehearsed. Somehow, it's natural here. Considering William's rigorous faith, you might expect him to be an overbearingly shrewd father. He is in fact a loving and good man of his time; often a pushover. Katherine is the more fearsome parent, with a shrill voice and gaunt pointed face. While they do live in hardship, this is a good family. Once Fall deadens the colors and greys the skies, things begin to take a disturbing turn.<br/><br/>Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie play the parents without an exaggeration of the material. Remarkable still are the actors portraying their children. Harvey Scrimshaw plays William's 10-year- old son, Caleb, as natural as can be imagined. The dramatic beats of a horror movie come with taxing climactic moments and Scrimshaw acts beyond his years. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the eldest daughter Thomasin; a doe-eyed blonde beauty who plays the most relatable character of the flock. The dynamic between Caleb and Thompsin has notes of innocent sexual tension. Their secluded life leaves a great deal of new feelings that can't be addressed due to their customs. These feelings lead to foreign temptations that are preyed upon by the timeless evil beyond the trees. <br/><br/>The greatest achievement of this film is how faithful it is to its setting and story, while keeping enough behind the veil to become engrossing. The tale feels as old as any, drawing from universal fears and motivations. How it draws you in, keeping you tied to the victims and their perspective while keeping the evil at arm's length, shows a discipline of craft that greatly compliments the material. Much like vampires, witches have been trivialized and diluted by film into something superficially attractive and entertainingly evil. As with Noseferatu, seeing a witch living a damnable existence of ugliness is much more appropriate. If they're ever beautiful, they won't be for long."
"TheRedDeath30","8","3","5","21 May 2016"," What It Lacks in Originality is Made Up for in Tension
","One needs only look over my ratings and reviews to see that I watch a lot of horror, from classics to modern, from the lowest budget indies to Hollywood mainstream, I'm always on the quest for a great horror experience. It's interesting to me when Hollywood releases what is, truly, a great horror film and the responses to it. The ""general public"" will gush about how scary the movie is, but these same people enjoy garbage films like THE PURGE. On the other hand, the horror hipsters will go out of their way to bash it just because it's popular. Yet these same people will rally around bland, uninspired movies like STARRY EYES just because every other horror hipster said it was great.<br/><br/>I believe that I try my very best to judge movies on their own merits, no matter what the budget or hype going into it. That can be hard, of course, because expectation alters perception. In THE WITCH, I firmly believe that Hollywood has released a horror film that may not be a ""classic"", but is just as thoughtful and intelligent as anything indie horror is doing right now. The horror in this movie works on so many levels, yet one would be hard pressed to point to many ""scary scenes"". Indeed, many of the complaints I have seen are the typical ""not scary"" nonsense that haunt any intelligent horror film. Yes, there are no jump scares, not really any terrifying monsters, no gore and few creep out scenes, yet the tension is palpable and I found myself hanging on the edge of my seat. I am not going to throw out the ""slow burn"" phase because I don't really think this qualifies, but indeed it is a movie about the simmering tension of fears and terror, rather than outright hitting you with any fright.<br/><br/>On one level this is a film about the terrors of oppressive religion. The family is outcast by their Puritan society at the beginning and left to flounder in the wilderness because of religious belief. Indeed, the family's daily life is a litany of catechism and prayer. As many a film has explored before this, when the stuff hits the fan, this religion becomes the very thing that makes it so easy to tear them apart. What begins as childless implications of witchcraft become quite real accusations. A family that spends every minute of every day together is found to believe that perhaps their children could be witches, an idea with no logical sense but believable to those terrified of the devil and touch of sin. Indeed, I found myself saying to my wife about halfway through this movie that their religion was far scarier to me than any witch.<br/><br/>On another level, we have a terror of a decaying family, another subject mined often in horror, but well done here. Left to band together after being outcast by their society, the family quickly falls apart after losing their infant youngest. The loss of that child begins to unravel this family. The mom falls apart, the father starts hiding things from her, the children turn on each other, the mom starts to despise her daughter for her part in the child's loss. This family that began as such a tight unit are suddenly their own worst enemies, which of course makes it easy for them to become ripe for the witch's picking.<br/><br/>We, also, get a heavy dose of the occult terror. Yes, there really is a witch, though only seen in a few scenes. I liked that she felt like a modern Baba Yaga, a real witch of the woods out of some Grimm fairy tale. Then, there's Black Phillip, a goat who may or may not be the living impersonation of the devil. All of the satanic goings on culminate in a great finale that feels at home alongside Rob Zombie's LORDS OF SALEM.<br/><br/>Another terror seen here is creepy children, using the young twins as unsettling little monsters. At first they are merely annoying, then that lingering creepiness settles in with their possibly evil little nursery rhymes. Much like the real Salem witch trials, it is these children who ultimately start throwing out the accusations that destroy so many lives. It is rare that a first time director is capable of making so many things work so well, all at one time, all while creating a film that is stark and sublime in it's evil beauty as well. <br/><br/>What's keeping this from being a higher rating, for me personally, is that so much of this felt done before. That's to be somewhat expected in the horror genre where just about everything has been done before, but in this case it all felt familiar quite often. There are elements of THE CRUCIBLE, THE SHINING, THE INNOCENTS, and other horror classics. At no time does this feel like a re-tread of anything, but it also didn't feel like I was watching some ground- breaking original either. That makes it all the more impressive for me that Eggers was able to make such a haunting film that will stick with you for awhile.<br/><br/>I'll leave with one more comment about the language, which is spot on for the era, in syntax, lexicon and accent. We are listening to people from the 1600s speak to each other. That seems to bother a lot of people in reviews and message boards. I would guess that these people never read Shakespeare, Marlowe or Hawthorne, or any other classic literature. I'm not going to stand on my intellectual soapbox and call people stupid for not being able to understand it. I do get that a viewer who is being challenged by the language is not able to be impacted as much by the story, but I also think that it is a good thing that our art is still able to reflect our history."
"dcarsonhagy","7","3","5","17 May 2016"," Religious Madness
","I finally was able to catch this film On-Demand last evening. Since it did not play in my town--as most types of these films NEVER do--I waited patiently for its availability. <br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a tale set in New England around 1630. A Puritan family has been banished from their local town because it seems the father was teaching religion that was in direct conflict with what was widely believed in this area. The family ventures out into the wilderness to restart their lives. Little do they know of the horror that waits.<br/><br/>I have read many other IMDb reviews and I can see how this film can be loved AND how it can be hated. Several scenes seemed incomplete. There are incidences that just do not make sense, i.e. the abduction of the baby by the Witch. Why did they not search for the child? Who was the Witch? Did she really exist? It is only until much later in the film that (I think) someone references the baby was taken by a wolf. I am still puzzled over the final scene, which I will not reveal.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was superb; however, I will say (again) that when you do a period piece with heavy British brogue, I just wish closed captioning was available. I had so much trouble understanding what was being said that it actually took my attention away from what was happening on screen. Anya Taylor-Joy is remarkable in her portrayal of the oldest daughter, Thomasin. Ralph Ineson plays the father, William very effectively, while Kate Dickie (who plays the mother, Katherine) proves she can wail with the best of them. The music and cinematography were both exceptional. Director Robert Eggers seems to know his way about the camera!<br/><br/>While this movie was billed as ""horror,"" to me it is simply a tale about what religion and all its trappings can do to even the strongest of minds. There is some real tension here, and it was very refreshing to see a horror movie that was actually character driven.<br/><br/>Rated ""R"" for violence and nudity--and NONE of it graphic--""The Witch"" is definitely a cut above most movies of its kind. However, I will caution any potential viewer to be aware of the pace and the accents. The movie is a little slow, and I've already stated what I felt about the heavy British brogues. Still, I would recommend it."
"michaeljtrubic","8","3","5","6 May 2016"," Photography - Stunningly well done
","I'm reviewing this only 28 minutes into it and I have paused many a time to absorb the imagery. The director is either a master photographer or has one at his disposal. <br/><br/>With period pieces such as this setting the mood is all important. Given the nature of the plot a dark foreboding presence is requisite. The scenes of somber candle lit interiors and rustic exteriors in the earliest of north American colonial life compare or even best what Stanley Kubrick did in Barry Lyndon. <br/><br/>Exceptional high production values. I will follow the work of these film makers. I tried to but failed making this part of my 2015 Tiff package - I was sad I could not include it in my film list. <br/><br/>Given this successful accomplishment further works will no doubt be shown in larger festival venues."

","The cinematography and the acting are amazing! Truly amazing. The sets, costuming, and props are magnificent. If you are a filmmaker, this flick is worth your time. You can tell that they are going for subtlety in the story, and it ends up being too subtle. Split between dramatic family dynamics, and the fear of a witch in the woods, the threads for tension are found and abandoned too quickly to give you a real thrill. It feels like they got written into a corner, so they take a left turn at the end of the 3rd act of the film, abruptly tying up ""loose ends"" subsequently leaving you with a ""twist"" that is so outside the scope of the world that has been created that it isn't even fun or shocking. It ends up feeling like you sat through a long period drama, and then got rushed through to the end without getting any impact. They talked about wanting the set and the props and all of the production design to be its own character, and unfortunately that does not come through. Yes, it is a beautiful and authentic backdrop, but it doesn't do much in the way of putting you deeper in the story. It's just a pretty set. I wanted my blood to curdle, I wanted to be creeped out, I wanted to feel like there was an air of mystery somewhere with a big reveal. Unfortunately this film has none of that. I've never seen such a flat story told with such stunning visuals."

The young lead actress, Anya Taylor-Joy is terrific. Hopefully a breakout role for her. Actually, all of the young actors are well cast. The 17th century ""yeoman farmer"" English country dialect is often difficult for an American ear to follow. The movie is a kettle on slow boil. Tough watching a kettle boil.

I don't usually watch fast paced horror movies, with rapid cut scenes and multiple plot twists.<br/><br/>I am quite happy to watch slow paced films - if they have an interesting story arc.

It doesn't go well for them. Stuff (duh! censorship!) happens.People die. The family disintegrates. The attractive teenage daughter survives long enough to get her kit off and walk naked through the woods to a coven of naked witches. End credits.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much it. They speak in that annoying English/New England puritan ""thou"" and ""thee"" syntax.<br/><br/>Oh and there's a witch lurking in the background.

The only story arc was the obviously inevitable disintegration of the family.

","heard allot about the movie and saw the 7-star rating on IMDb, but yet again IMDb rating are just as reliable as an old condom. What is wrong with people who have rated so highly for this movie? I mean come one people should have higher standard. This movie was not scary at all, instead it was just gruesome and pathetic. <br/><br/>First scene starts off with a family banished from a town then poor banished family settles on a open land surrounded by creepy trees. First the youngest baby disappears, kidnapped by the old naked witch just to turned into baby paste (YES BABY WAS GRINDED DOWN IN A MORTAR WITH A LARGE PASTEL, DISGUSTING!!!) then she puts on the baby paste all over herself. Next well scenes of day to day life of the banished family with scenes of incest little brother who is horny for his older sister (YES LITTLE BRO KEEPS PEEKING DOWN HIS SISTERS SHIRT!!!! WTF!!!!!). After they have given up on search for the baby, the incest little bro didn't give up and ended up going with his sister into the woods to look for the baby only to have himself lost in the woods. The sister finds her way back home meanwhile the little bro finds the witches lair or den or nest whatever you want to call it. Witch changed herself into a steaming hot chick, little bro getting all turned on gets seduced by the witch (predictable much?). anyway father goes looking for the boy but does find him however during some night the sister finds the little bro naked around the farms fence. Of course the boy is all crazy and dying coz he is cursed, after that the entire family (didn't mentioned the youngest twin bro and sis coz they are just annoying) accuse the older sister of being a witch. Well of course she isn't a witch but after few weird ass scenes of little bro suffocating and spitting blood he dies. Father then goes all crazy and boxes all the kids into a sheep pen because he thinks they are cursed and witches. Well middle of the night for some odd reason the witch (naked showing her old old old disgusting ass) comes into the little shed and I guess eating the sheep that was in it with the kids screaming in fear. The Father wakes up in the morning to find that entire shed and livestock destroyed and dead except the older sister, then started screaming and going crazy only to be impaled by the sheep's horns, ergo dies just like that. Mother who was in bad shape losing the youngest baby and then the oldest son and getting her boobs pecked by a crow (which was a disgusting scene btw) tries to kill the only surviving daughter because she also thinks that she is a witch. The daughter in order to save herself kills the mother (SELF DEFENSE!!!!!), after crying and moaning, poor girl all devastated cries herself to sleep in her house. When she wakes up, having nothing left calls on the devil, after a little chat and making her take her clothes off, gives her a book and guides her to a witch orgy in the middle of the forest (what's with the nakedness?) then all the witches including herself started to float and that's the end of the movie. <br/><br/>So that's about it, the whole movie is written in one paragraph so don't bother wasting your time watching it. You are better off watching the conjuring which is far better movie and very entertaining."

The son Caleb and his sister Thomasena go to find help, but are separated in the woods, and Caleb is molested by a witch. The family frantically looks for him and he appears naked in the yard, under the spell of a witch. He ends up dying, the young twin children accuse Thomasena of being a witch, she accuses the twins of being witches and the father locks them all in the barn. That night, the witch comes to the barn and destroys it, taking the twins. The father is sure Thomesena is a witch, but before he can do anything, he's killed by the goat.

","Honestly this movie was so terrible it's hard to describe. I am a horror nut, I love horror movies of all kinds from old creature features to modern scifi alien movies. But, in order to love them, they have to be in some way.. actually.. good. This movie did not deliver on it's high promises of ""outstanding acting"" and it certainly did not live up to it's hype of being ""the best horror movie in years"" or ""a cinematic masterpiece"". Frankly the thing that kept me from walking out of the theater on this one was the fact that I literally fell asleep. I have never fallen asleep during a movie before, it was a terrible experience. For a moment I thought, maybe I missed some good stuff, but with the reassurance of my friends who watched the movie while i passed out from boredom, I worried a little less about what amazing cinematic marvels i may have missed. Now, I didn't want to go solely on my friend's feelings, perhaps we were the only ones in the theater who disliked it. Well, that too was proved to be.. an incredible experience. With the last... Terrible. Shot of the movie, which was made to be dramatic and horrifying, half of the audience erupted in laughter while the other half, such as myself, sat in awe of what i was watching, in complete disbelief that someone wrote that down in a script and other people went ""this is good."" When the movie switched to credits, the room was taken over by a universally spoken ""okay then."" as people got up to leave. People literally said ""okay then."" in an un-amused, annoyed, and utterly disappointed manner.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. It wasn't in the least bit entertaining, which is really the worst thing a movie can be."

I'm just trying to pass along to others that it isn't worth the time. It reminded me of another bad movie, Cold Mountain."
"Akira-36","2","7","17","24 April 2016"," A well made horror gem marred by its horrible message
","This is the first time I ever gave a well made movie a vote of 2 due to its horrible message about faith, family and for its satanic undertone.<br/><br/>One point is given for its well-researched, written, directed and acted film. The production value and cinematography are excellent for an indie movie. I applaud the director's effort to stay true to his vision, and perhaps somewhere in there, was a genuine attempt to create a contemporary horror inspired by 'folk tales, fairy tales and true accounts of witch craft' as stated by the pre-credit scene. The director himself has said he wanted to create a horror tale that befitted his home in New England.<br/><br/>The second point is given for the cast's amazing acting, especially Anya Taylor-Joy. She was a revelation to behold, captivating and hypnotizing just like Natalie Portman was in Leon The Professional.<br/><br/>The movie felt like what it would be like if 'The Blair Witch Project' had been directed by Terrence Malick. However, unlike Malick's overarching theme of enlightenment or spiritualism via Nature and its ties with humanity, Egger's The Witch feels like the Bizarro of Superman. The Witch is like an evil doppelganger of Malick's movies, where faith, family unity and nature itself are constantly doubted, inherently flawed and imbued with the propensity towards Evil. <br/><br/>SPOILERS The animals, forest and weather in the movie are means by which the Devil himself tears the family apart.<br/><br/>The witch craft and hex scenes are truly disturbing and the overall tone of the movie made me feel sick. And I grew up watching horror movies for over three decades.<br/><br/>At the end when all the children are dead, the parents murdered and the baby boy slaughtered, we found the surviving daughter, Thomasin, actually converted to wicca and joined the coven. The very coven, whose member has attacked, abducted, molested and murdered her family. <br/><br/>Some critics said the movie was about feminism and its fight against patriarchy. But when The Satanic Temple praised its message about women liberation and satanic spirituality, is that actually a positive message? Would you equate feminism = satanic worship? Is Wicca = Satanism?<br/><br/>There are some horrific scenes in the movies that are disturbing on a visual, aural and intrinsic levels.<br/><br/>The ending also finds our young protagonist joining the coven, flying towards the moon naked and filled with ecstasy. All of these after signing her name on the book of the damned as she was tempted by Black Phillip. It was also revealed that the production house of the movie, A24, collaborated with The Satanic Temple in Detroit to promote the movie by setting up advance screening. <br/><br/>The production house might have thought this was a smart marketing strategy to promote the movie. The director, Robert Eggers, might have not intended a feminist read into the movie or even to make his film a satanic propaganda. Regardless of what their true motivations were, I find this movie thoroughly irresponsible in its depiction of nature worship, feminism and psychological traumas.<br/><br/>Could we believe that the award-winning level of fastidiousness and filmmaking skills of the director (and the studio) be complemented by such massive disregards for spiritualism. Is the nightmarish and downright anti-social message of the movie simply an ill-considered side effect of the director's attempt to shock and awe his audience.<br/><br/>However you want to cut this cake - I'd say for the love of everything that is good and holy in the world - stay away from watching this ill conceived movie.<br/><br/>It's not only sacrilegious towards religion, but towards life and nature itself."

","OK I went into the theater with high hopes of a terrifying tense film that will disturb the crap out of you. Good reviews also were a key thing to this expectation. I walked out of the theater well... disappointed. It will not scare you or even entertain you. There are many horror movies that don't scare you but can still be a good time to watch. This isn't any of those. I have to get it credit, for its incredible dialogue, and how it's shot. Based on the time this takes place, they did a great job on making it appear as though it is in that time. The dialogue is the same as well. But the plot is confusing, you will eventually get lost. It's not really a horror movie until the final 15 minutes. The rest is just a boring story of a family surviving for the winter. This film is so dead with zero tensity. It is hard to keep up and even get what, who, or why anything is. The ending is especially bad, you wait 90 minutes for something exciting to happen but nothing does. Just skip it. It will disappoint you. Waste of time and money."

","I trusted the reviews on this one and, boy was that trust misplaced!! The movie has a slow start and accelerates to a ho hum ""are you serious /that's it??"" ending. Although technically well done, the minimal story line doesn't do justice to the skill of the actors, director or crew; We've got dead end segments of ""why bother"" scenes and then there's the annoyingly low volume lines spoken too quietly and with heavy accents to the point the film needs subtitles. Not a scary film if you're and adult, but there are a couple of unexpected scenes that may startle a person of any age. Those very rare scenes are well done, but way too few. Finally, there's the curious, and repeated incestuous stare by little brother character to his big sister's cleavage. Big Sis, played by young hottie Anya Taylor-Joy, makes the film a must see for any dirty old sinner Â…male or female and sadly, that's about the only reason to see ""The Witch"""

","First of all, there are no special effects, so don't think you'll see anything cool. A man is unwilling to compromise his religious beliefs so he dooms his whole family by leaving town, which is ironic because religious persecution is why these people left England in the first place. As they set up a farm in the boondocks, a witch or a wolf or a goat may or may not be responsible for a string of misfortunes, a missing baby, a bewitched child, and a mother-daughter tiff. The family is torn apart as they accuse each other of being witches, and by this point the film has turned into a literal witch hunt, a miniature version of the salem witch trials. One wonders where the witch came from, if she emigrated from england like everyone else or if she was already living in north America when the settlers arrived; alas this issue is never explored and by the end the naked daughter walks into the woods and floats into the air with a bunch of other naked women. No, it's not even the least bit scary."

Many times the camera would just stay on the actors and the actors wouldn't do or say anything. Also, you cannot watch this film without subtitles. It is IMPOSSIBLE to understand what these people were saying without subtitles. The British accent and words like ""thou"", ""thee"", ""thy"", ""art"", etc.<br/><br/>Close to the end of the film, the mother and father are dead, Caleb is also dead, two dead goats, and the twin kids were gone. The movie never explains what exactly happened to the twin kids. Thomasin was being accused of being a witch by her mother the whole time and after all of her family members died, the black goat turned into this man and Thomasin decided to become a witch. Why would she want to join the witches? Thomasin acted like she didn't care that much about the fact that her family just died.<br/><br/>Some scenes did get my attention and at the end of the film when Thomasin was entering the woods in the dark completely naked, she had a nice ass.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie does not deserve a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.

"Hey_Sweden","8","4","8","4 June 2016"," A cut above a lot of other modern horror.
","A God fearing family manages to end up banished from their village in 17th Century New England. They decide to set up cabin and ranch at the edge of a truly spooky forest. Their troubles are only beginning when their adorable newborn son Samuel disappears without a trace. And a lot of the blame is laid at the feet of the teen aged daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy).<br/><br/>We never ever see very much of the title character in this effort by writer & director Robert Eggers. He chooses to parcel out his true horror rather carefully, instead focusing on creating a mood and atmosphere that is absolutely stifling. His film is somber, serious, and even depressing. It's definitely not for all tastes. It sets a tone in a sequence approximately eight minutes in, involving Samuel. This will cause ""The Witch"" to lose some viewers, for sure, but all I can say in Eggers' defense is that he spares us the goriest details.<br/><br/>Eggers was inspired by a variety of folklore, fairy tales (I can certainly see a ""Hansel & Gretel"" influence), and records of settlers during this time in North American history. His *very* literate dialogue is often taken from these records. The dialogue and its delivery is therefore highly antiquated, so that's one other thing that some viewers might not care for. But it's refreshing that Eggers takes such a careful, measured approach to telling a tale that could be referred to as ""slow burn"" horror. The look for this picture is perfect; its drab visuals are very suitable to the story being told. But don't worry; there is some gore here and there.<br/><br/>The performances are incredibly sincere and intense. Taylor-Joy has tremendous appeal in the lead role. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are superb as the parents. Harvey Scrimshaw delivers a mature performance as the son Caleb. Bathsheba Garnett has such a creepy presence in her seconds of screen time as the true form of the Witch. And the goat Black Phillip manages to be quite the character too, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>Overall, an interesting fable open to some interpretation, with many themes and questions of faith throughout.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","Any film which scares Stephen King (which this one reportedly did) has got to be worth a look- and this one is so rewarding in ways that most horror films just aren't these days. Most horror films, especially ones with as much publicity as this one, are reliant on the usual mix of jump-scares and over the top gore with not much substance at their core other than a bit of exhilarating blood-splattering fun. This film draws you into its world brilliantly through simple and effective devices like dim candlelight, claustrophobic rooms and thoroughly believable acting. It builds wonderfully and each of the horrific and eerie moments come at just the right time and aren't overdone. You become entrenched in the world of a small farm house by a big spooky woods through the eyes of the religious fervour and fears of an ordinary family in 1630. It is mesmerising, hypnotic and eerily thrilling and the faithfulness of the research done by its creators to portray the time as historically accurate is impressive. This is a film that I believe will be regarded as a classic in years to come, much in the vein of films like The Wicker Man. It is a timeless horror that will resound as much in ten or twenty years as it would have done twenty years ago. The essential elements of good filmmaking and horror story are all accounted for here. I heavily recommend this film to anyone interested in horror, history or drama."

","The creepy atmosphere was first rate and the performance by Anya Taylor Joy was outstanding, but unfortunately the script was utterly tasteless. There was certainly a mass hysteria promoted by Christian fanaticism in the colonial period and many innocent people were murdered because of it. I'm sickened by the direction that this film takes because rather than creating a horror film that explores how twisted and demented people of the time were and then gruesomely illustrating their terminal descent into madness, the film actually gives credence to their fanaticism by making their fears into reality. And to make the point, I'm not against supernatural elements in storytelling, in fact it's one of my favorite themes, but depicting women, animals and forests as wicked and depraved things to be scared of is completely unacceptable."

A horror film only has one job.. to be scary.. There is nothing remotely scary or even slightly spooky about the whole film. There are a few gross moments but nothing that remotely concerns the viewer.<br/><br/>The family have no redeeming qualities so there is little reason to empathise with them. They are a pair of religious nuts who have been banished because they are too nutty for the other religious nuts to live with.<br/><br/>The setting is nice and there is a good opportunity to build some suspense about the wood they live under... which is never taken.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems with the show is a technical one. The sound mix is horrible.. The score is ridiculously loud and jarring (irritating rather than spooky) and the voice channel is really low. This is compounded by the fact that the actors barely pronounce their dialogue in a coherent manner. I appreciate they are trying to recreate old dialects but there is no excuse for the muttering they deliver. In order to hear anything you need the volume way above normal and the the horrible score will kick and shake the windows. Seriously.. we had to rewind a few times just to hear what had been said and shrugged a few times.<br/><br/>There is one good point.. Harvey Scrimshaw who plays Caleb does a really good job.. the others are very forgettable.<br/><br/>I was ready to turn if off with 30 mins ready to go but the wife insisted we have come this far and should push on.

","Since the beginning of filmmaking Hollywood has struggled to deal with the subject of witches. In recent decades they have mostly just been used as a source for light humour and even children's films. Films like 'Practical Magic' and of course the 'Harry Potter' series have taken a mostly harmless attitude towards the subject, and the audiences have seemed satisfied. I am currently watching season three of 'American Horror Story' titled 'Coven'. Going into it I had pictured (and hoped for) quite a dark overall theme. Unfortunately what I have found is again a lighter approach, and I would have to say I'm not overly enjoying it. So when I heard there was a film coming out titled 'The Witch', which seemed from the trailers to have a very dark approach taken, I was excited. Did it live up to my expectations? Sort of.<br/><br/>I left 'The Witch' with a sort of ""Meh"" feeling, despite having enjoyed it for the most part. Frankly, I had hoped for more. I was aware this wasn't going to be your standard type of horror film with jump scares left, right and centre. An atmospheric horror is fine by me and something I often enjoy more than the alternative. But for me the atmosphere wasn't really having an affect either. It didn't help the dialogue was nothing short of exhausting to listen to and take meaning from. For me that element unfortunately took away from what the film was trying to achieve. It had to be there, it's simply unfortunate.<br/><br/>There was a little bit of a mystery element surrounding things, which was probably the aspect I enjoyed most about the film. That may have lead a little to the ""Meh"" feeling I got too though, as I felt the mystery never really came to much. The acting was superb, it would have to be said, and that side of things did a terrific job in covering up what could otherwise be considered a very slow-burning story at times. After the film I was left to ask myself a question. Are witches a potentially scary film subject? I'm yet to be convinced they are."

","Maybe my mistake was reading the reviews prior to seeing the movie because I was really looking forward to an excellent psychological horror drama. What I got was a kind of dull, slow moving, not-so-tense film that was a good study of a family's descent into madness. The first 10 minutes or so were very promising but then things slowed down to a crawl. The movie isn't really so much about a witch but rather how a family, in those times (and this is very important), dealt with adversity, pain and most importantly, the presence of evil in their home. I didn't find the movie scary but I did find it interesting. I like stories about early America and this film paid respect to the time with beautifully authentic costumes and language. It hardly mattered to me that I really couldn't understand a great deal of the dialog. The acting was so good that I was able to understand what was going on, despite the difficulty understanding the words. The film was obviously very low budget and you'll see this in some scenes but that's OK--the cinematography was great and it didn't have that same feel that many low budgets have, if you know what I mean. The acting of the main characters was superb--mainly Thomasin and the mother and father. The other kids were just OK. Finally, I didn't hear one positive remark from other people as they left the theater. In fact, most said they thought it was horrible. Guess it is that kind of movie--you either will love it or think its so-so. There's a lot of good about the movie (costumes, acting etc) to appreciate so it would be hard to hate it. It won't be a fan favorite and will probably be out of theaters quickly if word of mouth gets around, despite the great reviews."
"sgourley-844-300070","10","6","14","19 February 2016"," The Witch: Allegory of Female Suppression
","The Witch renders the world described in Nathanial Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown and The Scarlet Letter as well as Arthur Miller's The Crucible.  This is a film with roots in the great American literary tradition with a twist that leaves the viewer wrestling with some important questions, and like great literature it does a marvelous job posing questions, providing differing view points, but ultimately leaves the answering of the questions to the viewer. <br/><br/>The Witch can be consumed as a ghost story and, as such, it is top notch.  It has enough spine chilling moments and frightening images to rank among the great horror movies.  If, however, one looks at the metaphysical aspects of this tale, it is very much a warning of the dangers of suppressing and subjugating the feminine in a society and how this practice leads to destruction.  It also demonstrates the folly of relying on belief over thinking.   <br/><br/>This movie is literally dripping with symbols representing the feminine, the givers of life:  teats, breasts, lactation, an egg, and suckling young are featured throughout the film.  We also see the damage that is being done to the feminine over the course of this movie.  A babe at it's mothers bosom is lovingly shown at the start of the movie and by the end we see that very same bosom being pecked apart by a crow while the mother believes she is nursing her dead baby which has inexplicably come back to life.  We see a hen's egg looking diseased and when it is dropped a bloody half formed chick issues forth from the egg.  The life sustaining goat milk which nourishes the family sprays into the milking can as a stream of blood towards the end of the movie.  In short, the movie is symbolically yelling at us that the feminine is being snuffed out by this family environment.  The female characters in play include Thomasin, the teenage daughter, Katherine, the mother, and, of course, the title character herself, The Witch.  <br/><br/>If femininity is under attack, it is under attack by the prideful, faithful and incompetent males, most notably the father, William, and the brother, Caleb. One feels for Katherine as both she and the audience begin to understand that William is taking on challenges for which he is clearly not equipped.  He is a stubborn man with a fool's notion that with prayer and confession, God will provide and have mercy in the wilderness.  William lacks honest, integrity and let's his prideful theological musings be the catalyst for the family being jettisoned into the wild.  Caleb admires his father and is working to understand his religious dogma as well as the survival skills that William cannot teach.  Additionally, William spends much of his time chopping wood; the only survival activity he has mastered.  Perhaps breaking apart organically structured forms is all he is really good at. <br/><br/>The female repression is most clearly illustrated with Thomasin.  She is working hard to win her mother's approval and support her father's dream even though she most clearly sees the hypocrisy and overall weakness that her father represents. To add to Thomasin's mental strain, we see Caleb straining to look down her shirt and the young twins calling her a witch.  All of this comes to a breaking point when Thomasin overhears that her father is planning on bringing her to town to either marry her off or enlist her in to some type of indentured service.  <br/><br/>The forces at play have Thomasin near or beyond her mental breaking point.  We also have The Witch who is shown in the opening scene murdering the baby of family and rubbing the youthful renewing blood all over her naked body under a bright moon.  The Witch hounds this family and ultimately is their undoing.  She seduces young Caleb and the power of their union leaves him naked, cold, and babbling incoherently.  Caleb ultimately dies, but only after vomiting up an apple which clearly symbolizes his sin and also evokes thoughts of the original sin where the feminine was held solely responsible for getting humanity kicked out of the garden of Eden.  Silly females, if only Adam had been around to think through the devil's bargain for Eve things may have gone very differently.  Perhaps Adam was busy napping, praying, or chopping wood, who knows. <br/><br/>After Caleb dies, things go equally badly for the rest of the family until only Thomasin is left.  She meets the devil, signs his book, and joins a coven of witches dancing naked in the woods.  This is a clever twist on the old tales where we are led to believe this naked woodland dancing is the fabrication of repressed school girls seeking to add a little excitement to their lives. <br/><br/>This movie holds blind belief and faith up as a poor strategy for survival against knowledge and know how.  It's the mocking of believing over thinking that provides a clue to the real events in this movie.  The film is called The Witch and we come to believe and except that this supernatural being exists. If we spend some time thinking though, we see a much more clever ending - THERE IS NO WITCH!  Thomasin is the murderer.<br/><br/>William treats the women in his life badly, he demonstrates pride and immaturity by leaving the safety of the village and he pays the ultimate price for this folly.  If he had listened to his wife and daughter and displayed a modicum of empathy for them, these events never would have happened.  Sadly though, the story of the masculine overpowering and ignoring the feminine is very much with us today, and it is one we need to evolve past or we risk unleashing the destruction symbolized in the character of The Witch."

While I am offering faint praise, I'll also add that it was a respectable effort in conjuring up the way these colonials might have actually spoke back then. However, the content of what was spoken was hideous 90% of the time, spitting at the bible and making a mockery of it throughout.

The dialogue is based on Puritan times but you can hardly understand what they are saying. Some of the characters were so annoying that you are glad that they were killed off.

"thesar-2","5","5","11","31 May 2016"," Not Really VVitchbored
","I think this movie made me more afraid of religion than VVitchcraft. <br/><br/>I asked a question of my friends today at work, and I did receive some good answers. I asked, summed up: since I don't believe in magic, witchcraft or other things associated with witches, I wonder how really the Salem witch trials went down. I did receive some sad and definitely gruesome answers, but in a logical sense. Exactly what I was looking for and what I believe in. <br/><br/>Now, this movie is pure fiction, but it was absolutely amazing on how well they recreated life before the American Revolution. The dialogue, cinematography, sets, acting, clothing, accentsall outstanding. Plus the minimal special effects and clever mood made this a must-see for real horror buffs.<br/><br/>Now, that saidto see a second time? Or more accurately, is it worthy of repeat viewings? Not for me. Still, I would recommend it for people who want to get back to the root of evil in horror movies.<br/><br/>Basically, it's Christian man vs. Christian men and who's the better Christian. The men, and village prevail, and the man (with his large family in tow) are banished. Surprisingly, the one man is able to build a large house, barn(s,) fields, crops and get livestock in fairly no time. Also, in no time, their youngest gets snatched into the nearby woods and the search is on! (Not really – we only hear of a search for their baby that they pretty much give up on instantly.) <br/><br/>From there, it's paranoia and fear, not to mention concerns about eating into the winter, for the family. <br/><br/>As real and authentic as the movie sounded and looked, a ton of the time I found it hard to understand what they were saying. Luckily, they were always praying or scared of God or the demonic possessions, so it was easy to tell what the context was. <br/><br/>Despite not believing in voodoo, black magic, spells and the like, it was refreshing not to see yet another ghost, haunted and/or found footage horror movie. Way to go, HollywoodI am sincerely proud you can think outside the cash box. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Though, that would've been awesome to see a found footage movie set in the 1630s. It probably would've been more realistic than most found footage movies set in/around today's time."

"Kino_Corner","9","5","11","12 March 2016"," An Expertly Crafted ""Folk Tale"".
","It has been a considerable while since a film had elicited such a pure reaction of gut-wrenching horror from me. As a horror veteran, tired of the same generic haunted house garbage we get month after month, year after year, I am so happy to write that Robert Eggings brings us a film that transcends all expectations and clichés. The Witch is a palpable breath of fresh air for horror; or rather, a forced serving of black bile poured down your throat to churn inside your stomach and send shivers down to your soul. <br/><br/>Even if, and I am certain of it, nothing here will be noticed by such a sanitized society like the Academy or an immature audience seeking cheap thrills, the fact remains that everything on display in The Witch is of master-class craftsmanship. The choice of 1.66 : 1 aspect ratio, a highly subtle effect, is most likely responsible for much of the film's highlights and weaves a strongly claustrophobic environment. Many of the shots are close-ups on characters' faces or characters' backs, a technique that seems to be gaining popularity as shown by last year's phenomenal Son of Saul. The camera rarely expands beyond the intimacy of our characters' personal spaces and this creates a sense of attachment and empathy wherein the viewer experiences a feeling of active participation rather than safe and casual outside observance.<br/><br/>The gray and murky autumnal environment is succinctly rich in flavor which accentuates on the film's aesthetic of a ""folk tale"". The sky is ever overcast, and the trees in the woods are all stripped of leaves, remaining tall imposing husks that are easy to get lost in. The aesthetic and environment are almost like characters themselves in The Witch, hearkening back to Eastern European tales of the macabre, the Grimm Brothers, or Nikolai Gogol. And like a classical folk tale, subtlety is key here; you will find no obnoxious jump- scares or cheap gore here. <br/><br/>The heavy immersion power of The Witch is pulled along by the small cast of characters who luckily, are mostly unknown. I personally recognized no one besides Kate Dickie from Game of Thrones but this was nothing distracting. It is easier to sympathize with people whose faces you aren't familiar with, rather than thinking to yourself, ""wow, Leo is doing great work here"". This holds immersion for the viewer, and because the cast was enormously talented, nothing broke that immersion or tension. The 17th century script the cast works with is written with great care and effort and remains understandable and relatable, creating no barriers between the film and the audience. <br/><br/>There is a lot more I can comment on, but this is a spoiler-free review. For any comment in regards to story, I can say that the way the story is presented is an extremely tense family drama, punctuated by brain-searing sequences of horror. Robert Eggers, for a debut film, shows total command and mastery of the genre he presents, and plays all the cards right. The sensation of horror is crafted through just enough lingering on certain imagery, and just enough glimpses of the horrific and supernatural to make a world of difference between a competent period piece horror, and one of the most disturbing films of the 21st century."
"samgiannn","10","5","11","28 February 2016"," The Witch (2015)
","Ever since seeing the trailer a few months ago, I've been dying to see The Witch. It calls to mind recent art-house horror movies like The Babadook and Goodnight Mommy, but The Witch is far scarier than those movies. It's a grim, perverse, and disturbing tale of religious paranoia among a crumbling family that will surely be remembered alongside the likes of Rosemary's Baby and The Omen. The Witch takes place in 17th century in Puritan-era New England. A family is excommunicated from their village and settles on the edge of a vast forest. Soon thereafter, their baby goes missing into the woods, and the family is torn apart by accusations of witchcraft, black magic and possession. From the first ten minutes, The Witch has a morose atmosphere and starts out with an incredibly disturbing scene. The initial shock is carried through the next few scenes which are dialog-heavy and slower, causing the dread to continue to the next horror. The terror never lets up and only amplifies as the plot progresses until the final 20 minutes are agonizing to watch. I could only vaguely tell you how the movie ended because I was watching through my fingers. It's perversely scary. The acting is fantastic from the entire cast, especially from the child actors. They're given heavy stuff to work with and pull it off with unsettling results. Along with amazing cinematography and an ominous score, it'll be difficult to find a better horror movie than The Witch this year. It'll leave you shaking."

","I am really surprised by the relative low rating on here. I guess the slow pace and that the film is focused on religious doubt throws a lot of people off. To me this is archetypal tale of witchcraft and I love the film's refusal to explain anything in great detail. There is a naturalism to the acting and the setting that lends itself to this feeling like folktale handed down by the generations. The film's quite unnerving specifically because much of the details are left to the imagination. While the film is ultimately supernatural horror I found the film's treatment of a family dynamics getting frayed to more emotionally involve then the average horror film. And the father's pride getting the best of him really works as a religious message.<br/><br/>In any case the visual lushness, especially the cinematography, of the film is rather hypnotic and the film has quiet power to it. Eggers is a really gifted director at invoking mood and atmosphere. This feels like a Puritan warning more than a modern horror film.<br/><br/>Good film"

"jsalinas-22364","8","2","3","29 December 2019"," A horror movie for more sophisticated watchers as well as those with a love of slowburn tension
","Let me say: this is not your typical horror movie. This is a film that relies on slow, slow tension, to the point it could probably be a thriller if it weren't for the horrific imagery. It's relatively sparse on jump scares (which, in my opinion, makes them more effective), there's no over-the-top gore (once again, used sparsely and mainly offscreen, therefore more effective), and the movie has one element that will either endear viewers or turn them away: period-accurate English. Seriously, unless you're a fan of Nathaniel Hawthorne novels and can understand the kind of English the pilgrims spoke, it might be best you watch this movie with subtitles.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is a really good movie. The acting is incredibly spot-on, even that of the young children. Anya Taylor-Joy is a standout as she's arguably caught in the center of most of the story's conflicts. Each actor makes it believable that they are suffering through the hardness of the undiscovered American wilderness made worse by their own paranoias. The costumes are spot-on, the movie's mythology pays a ton of respect to real-world witch lore, and I recently learned that the movie was filmed using only natural lighting, which certainly adds to the feeling that we're enduring the family's hardships alongside them. And the entire movie absolutely drips with tension as we're left wondering how long it will take for everything to fall apart and what will be the main cause of everything: either the family's world or the family themselves. Blend this in with some truly disturbing imagery (occasionally made laughable by the complex English) and you've got yourself quite an unconventional horror flick.<br/><br/>In conclusion: slowburn horror film with great acting, plenty of tension, disturbing imagery, and the required usage of subtitles"

","(Rating as a movie) After watching The Witch, I felt something in my stomach. It was a feeling that I rarely feel after watching a film. The feeling that this movie created in my stomach was dread. Is this movie scary? I think so. But it wasn't the actual witch that had me sweating throughout the the film, rather, it was the psychological torment that the main characters were going through during the events of the movie. Seeing each character break down into madness was haunting, and was only complimented by the amazing soundtrack that added an extra layer of tension to each scene. The characters were extremely well written, each with their own motivations, fears, and flaws. The acting in this movie is fantastic, and never at any point did I not believe any of the characters, they were all portrayed very well, and even the child actors did a pretty good job. The whole film takes place around one small house, which creates a feeling of isolation and hopelessness, which is complimented by the film's ugly, grey color palette and dark lighting. Disturbing things happen throughout the film, but despite this, the film never relied on cheap gore to shock audiences, but rather sets up a disturbing canvas, and asks the viewer to paint the rest of the picture. It leaves the most disturbing moments up to interpretation, and as a result, made them more impactful to the audience. This psychological build up continues to grow until the very end, at which point the film just pours out all of the madness that it's built up for the audience to witness. I wouldn't classify The Witch as a horror, but rather, a dark drama with disturbing elements of horror sprinkled in. As a movie, I'd rate The Witch 10/10."

","At a time when horror movies are a dime a dozen, there are very few that manage to stand out from the crowd. The VVitch, or The Witch, is one of said movies. It's the work of Robert Eggers, who would later go on to do The Lighthouse. The premise is that puritan family in 1600s Massachusetts moves to the woods over a religious dispute and come to believe that they are being hunted by witches, or that there is a witch among them.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in this film is fantastic. 80% of the movie is set in their small cabin and farm, with most of the remaining 20 in the woods. There is a strong sense of isolation, even among the group, which is felt by the audience. It's a very creepy film. It has zero jumpscares. The scary factor comes almost entirely from the tension built up throughout, and it's very effective.<br/><br/>What's particularly notable about this film is the dialogue. It's not just set in the 1600s. They talk like it's the 1600s. The period accurate dialogue is fantastic and adds to the feeling of being in a different age. It's the same type of language you hear in Shakespeare. It feels very authentic. It's still understandable, because you still feel the weight of it in the visuals and emotion in the performances.<br/><br/>Spoilers: the twist in this movie is the type that gets you off guard. The whole idea of the Devil taking the form of a goat is something that is known, as there is the image of Baphomet, a demonic entity seen in folklore who has the head of the goat. Everything about him is unsettling. The way he talks, the way he's barely visible... it's an unforgettable moment."

","If you are into artsy films with solid substance, then you will appreciate this film. The Witch takes risks and succeeds on nearly every one of them. The unsettling and eerie nature of each scene gave me goosebumps. The score gives off a similar feeling that The Shining had, and it elevates each scene when it is used. The actors succeeded in being believable in the films dramatic and thrilling scenes, and the script asked a lot out of them. I cannot commend the cast enough for pulling off certain scenes. This film may disturb many people, and I would definitely proceed with caution if you are sensitive to religious themed horror.<br/><br/>My only true negatives would he the slow start of the film and the rewatchability.

","Talk about old school!<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a painstaking recreation of Puritan life in New England. The lifestyle is mimicked. The clothes are period-accurate. The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It's as if Mel Gibson decided to update ""The Passion of the Christ"" by 1600 years.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until... okay, no spoilers. See the movie.<br/><br/>This is a dark and effective movie. I can't remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to ""get"" me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won't lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster's ""Hereditary,"" if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end.<br/><br/>That being said, the film isn't perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it's perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It's kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is quite an achievement and I'm glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking ""The Lighthouse."" Definitely worth checking out."

","Looking back, The Witch seems to be at the forefront, if not the genesis of the current ""horror film as serious film"" resurgence we've been seeing in recent years (Hereditary, the Suspiria remake, etc.). One of the standouts from indie film darling A24 and the debut feature of Robert Eggers, this is ostensibly a classic horror story on the surface. It speaks to how few risks more mainstream movies in the genre are ever willing to take, and where they might go if they did (the answer: further, but definitely not as far as this). The Witch excels in all facets. The performances are pitch perfect, unnerving and believable. The cinematography is top-notch, using the natural light of a remote Canadian location to mimic the bleak New England we see on screen. Eggers is a perfectionist and it shows. Every shot and every piece of dialogue has been considered deeply. An astounding first film."

","It's between this film and ""Hereditary""; the two horror films that I consider to be the best of the decade. What makes ""The Witch"" such a powerful horror film? In my opinion, it's that the scariest thing to happen in the whole of the film happens in the last few minutes, leaving the viewer with a shocking image that has such dark and grim meaning behind it, that it's nigh impossible not to be shaken and disturbed. I remember the first time I saw this film I thought it was great, and then I walked out of the theater and went about my day, but that final image kept creeping into my mind, infecting the dark corners of my room as I lay waiting for sleep. The implications of those last images are truly, in every sense of the word, horrifying, but more on that later; the rest of the film does an almost perfect job of building a world that feels infringed upon by evil on all sides, creating a place of apparent solace that is still rife with corruption. ""The Witch"" is about the infectious, parasitic, and sumptuous powers and allures of evil, and there's nothing more horrifying than that."

"schkeegs","8","2","3","3 June 2019"," The Witch - a Minimal, Haunting, Thriller
","Horror movies, often associated with jumpscares, possessions and demons, can feel cheesy, attempting to scare the viewer at every turn. Unlike these films, Robert Eggers The Witch, instills fear in the audience with his depiction of an old witch, hidden in the woods and attempting to undermine the main characters. A concept simple in ideation, but in execution, Eggers knocks it out of the park with his minimalistic style and focus on the effects the witch has upon the mentality and outlook of the settlers.
Using the folklore from the 17th century, Eggers builds the story of a family of settlers, expelled from their religious plantation over a dispute. The family moves into a clearing far from the plantation and along the edge of the woods. Their family continues to grow as William (Ralph Ineson) and Kathrine (Kate Dickie) have yet another child to join their existing four children, the oldest being Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) followed by Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and their twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson). Thomasin is sent to watch the child while her family works around the home, during her game of Peek-a-boo with the baby, she opens her eyes, only to reveal the baby has vanished. The family is plagued by paranoia, the loss of their beloved child sends the family into a downward spiral, flinging accusations at each other, playing directly into the witch's hands. The witch slowly tears away at the family's bond and shreds the last strands of faith they had in their religion.
The minimalist approach Robert Eggers took to film this movie is one of the key reasons I can watch this movie over and over. Eggers took such a natural approach, only using the natural light from the sun and moon as well as candles to help reinforce the setting in the 17th century. The constant use of single subject frames and centered shots makes us viewers feel that our characters are all separated from one another, they have lost their connections to each other. The slow separation of the family grows as Thomasin is followed by a wave of misfortunes, she's the only one who knows the truth, but the family will never believe her after she let their newborn disappear.
Sound design, and particularly the musical score, in The Witch is terrifyingly magnificent. The witch uses the family's baby for a ritual, gruesomely churning the child into a gory mush, but as she's quickly using her staff to grind the child into a bloody paste, in fades a quick humming sound, playing at the same tempo she seems to be mashing with. These eerie stringed instruments fade in, as it slowly zooms in on the witch, the music slowly climbs and climbs in volume. The scene changes, but the sound of her pounding away continues as we see her rubbing the poor child's remains across her naked body. Choir singing starts to fill the scene as the sound continues to build in complexity, it grows and grows, aiming to reach a climax but never finding it as the screen goes black, the sound cuts, and we're thrust back into the lives of the family.
While this movie is certainly a fantastic example of horror without the overuse of clichÃ©s, It seems less scary than I expected it to be overall. It has a fantastic ability to build tension, but if they had been able to use the gore the same way it was used in a movie like Hereditary or even take notes from The Blair Witch Project with how they dealt with an unseen evil and using its violence to more effectively instill fear in the characters rather than just having gore with little impact.
Even with slight drawbacks, The Witch is still a paralyzing movie, mesmerizing the viewer and drawing them in with its fantastic approach to filmmaking and focus on building immense tension in simple spaces. It has such an emphasis on atmospheric pressure from the setting surrounding the family and kept me locked in my seat for the entire movie, anticipating each interaction and ultimately had me wanting to watch it again as the credits rolled."

","We all have our vices and hot-buttons. In the horror genre, I find the most fertile ground remains the push and pull between God and the Devil.<br/><br/>It's also the most challenging and ambitious field to plough, as films such as The Exorcist and The Omen have commanded top billing in this pantheon for a half-century and counting.<br/><br/>Imagine, then, the thrilling shock of discovering the film The Witch toying with the idea of competing with those cornerstone films on their own turf. Beautifully shot with coldness to the cinematography that perfectly suits the harrowing subject matter, this is a claustrophobic film in which feel isolated and cornered despite taking place in the middle of nature. We feel the mounting terror of the characters; a natural reaction, surely, when Beelzebub is systematically and incrementally messing with you as he closes in, and just because. This is nothing short of one of the greatest horror films made."

The main reason why this isn't enjoyable (for me at least) is because you wait the whole movie for something interesting to happen and it never quite gets there; there are 2 or 3 strong scenes, a bit of tension in them, but they do not do much in favor to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Maybe I got my hopes really high or something, idk the hype was big.

"sddavis63","6","2","3","22 October 2018"," This Would Have Been A Better Horror Movie Without The Supernatural Angle
","At first, I thought this was going to be a kind of a rehash of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village."" It does sound very similar: a group of people living at the edge of a forest in primitive conditions start to believe that there's something in the woods out to get them. In this case, they believe there's a witch, or even the devil. But, although this has more of a supernatural element than Shyamalan's movie, in some respects it also has a more authentic feeling.<br/><br/>This movie really is set in the 17th century. An apparently strict Puritan family, recently arrived at a plantation colony in the New World from England, is banished from the colony because of their religious beliefs. They take up residence in a clearing, with only themselves for company and without the protection of the colony, and with the dark and mysterious forest right beside them, and tragedies start to befall them almost immediately - beginning with the death of the infant son. The family seems divided into various alliances, for lack of a better word: mother and father, older brother and sister, and younger brother and sister. All of them are impacted by the baby's death in a variety of ways, but it's the eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) who becomes the target. She had been caring for the baby when it disappeared. Gradually, as things continue to spiral downhill for the family, Thomasin is suspected of having made a deal with the devil; of being a witch - with results that are ultimately tragic.<br/><br/>There is an authentic feel to this. There were fears of witches in the early-mid 17th century, and especially in New England. There were isolated families, in a strange new land, not knowing for sure what lurked in the forests that weren't very far away. Many were hyper-religious. They were inclined to see Satan at work when hardship befell them. They did turn on each other - many of the ""witch"" accusations that were made in the era were started by children making up stories that got out of hand because the adults took them seriously. So I actually could buy into this story. I actually could feel sympathy for poor Thomasin as the accusations against her from her own family spiralled out of control. And the performances in this from everyone really were very good. In addition to the sympathy I felt for Thomasin, I was intrigued by the character of William, the father (played by Ralph Ineson.) Yes, he was a strict and hyper-religious Puritan, obsessed with sin and fearful (or at least uncertain about) his eternal fate. But there was also a strangely compassionate nature about William. He did love his family - often very tenderly, kind of turning the traditional stereotype of the strict Puritan father on its head. It was a very good performance. I thought that director Robert Eggers also did a very good job. The movie was filmed in a very isolated location in northern Ontario, and Eggers used the location to great advantage, right down to using only natural lighting, which added to the atmosphere of the movie. He also insisted on using English actors, supposedly so that the accents would be authentic - notwithstanding the fact that the English of the early 17th century probably had a different sound than a modern English accent.<br/><br/>And yet, ultimately this disappointed me. The story does, in fact, go for a supernatural ending, as Thomasin, who emerges as the last survivor of the family after killing her own mother while her mother was trying to kill her, does in fact make a deal with the devil (who's represented in the movie by a black goat the family has named Black Phillip.) Ultimately, she ends up joining a coven of witches deep in the forest, with the last scene showing all of them levitating. Perhaps this may seem strange, but I thought that last scene weakened the worth of this as a horror movie. For me, the actions and thoughts of real human beings are far more chilling than supernatural silliness, and the horror of this movie was really the slow buildup of paranoia as we watched the family turn on each other, blaming each other for things that could well have just been natural tragedies. No devil or witches needed, in other words. The ending came across as just silly to me, and detracted from rather than summing up everything that had come before.<br/><br/>But that last scene aside, I can't deny that I enjoyed this movie. It was a reasonable look (the ending notwithstanding) at something that could very well have happened in that era and in that context. (6/10)"

While its ending is too mysterious and leaves many holes, it is still fascinating in its own special way.<br/><br/>The greatest flaw in the film is that much of the dialogue is incomprehensible. It has the right intention in using old English and an older dialect. However, as some important lines are muddled, much gets lost.<br/><br/>Despite this flaw, the acting is quite good as are the production values. There is a suitably bleak mood that rightly surrounds a family falling apart in facing great difficulty. Their dour, paranoid views of God, Satan, and witchcraft don't help matters.

It seems to have a concept of good and evil ut the lack of execution and follow up in its characters makes it very annoying to watch. I would in no way call it a horror movie, there are one or two disturbning scenes that seems to come out of nowhere, but they neither drives the movie forward or has anything to say that you don't know already.

In fact, nothing in the movie is really surprising, or shocking, and it's not in the least scary.<br/><br/>The filmmaker went to a lot of trouble to get the actors speaking and sounding right, and looking right.

","I watched The Witch and I thought it was alright. The acting is pretty great and the child actors were just as good as the adults. The cinematography is great as well, but some of the shots are ruined by bad CGI, there's a shot where the smoke from the chimney is frozen still. The script is also pretty good and the use of the dialect of the time period was interesting and worked very will. That's what I liked. I thought the pacing was really bad and it made the movie boring when things that don't directly effect the plot were happening. Speaking of the plot I did not really like the direction the film went, it felt quite anti-climactic despite some really important things happening, I felt this way because I could see where the story was going as soon as the third act started. Finally something that is very important to me is music in and out of film, and the music is this film sucked, even worse than having bad music it was so inappropriately used that it genuinely ruined quite a few scenes for me. Having the main score absolutely Blair over a still shot of the forrest is so obnoxious.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend The Witch if it's the type of movie you think you will enjoy, overwise you might not enjoy it."

"benlegeard","7","1","1","1 October 2019"," So much potential, so little commitment.
","This movie is quite removed from the traditional notion of modern-horror. The story takes place in the 17th century New England and follows the life of a religious family venturing out of their colony in search of prosperity. The movie does not use jump scares or other cheap forms of horror to achieve its blood curdling results. Instead it brings to life a complex historical mythology. The constant development of this mythology in the story works well in capturing the viewers interest time and again. With all of this said, the story does fall short in certain areas. The film's ambition is exciting to see, however, it comes up short due to poor acting in some parts and seemingly forced plot points. Had the film flowed more naturally from piece to piece it would have had an overall greater impact in its execution. The film tries to balance pacing with high quality cinematography and the results are accordingly underwhelming. If the movie had been stretched to even two hours, I believe the progression of events would have been magnificent. It is unfortunate to come away from a movie knowing that it could have been so much more than it was."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","1","1","31 August 2019"," A disturbing and unsettling period horror film
","Any genre has all kinds of avenues to explore when it comes to storytelling. The setting alone can be a factor as to how a story will play out. Specifically period pieces. These types of tales can be a bit tricky to handle based on the accuracy the picture and the direction the narrative heads in. If there was a time though to focus on that was one of the scariest, it would be when witches were a big deal. Witch trials were a serious thing during their medieval times and onward. As soon as a witch was even spoken of, things would go south pretty quickly. People would begin having fanatic fits of hysteria and meltdowns, all to be sure such creature was never present. This is more or less what happens here in this uniquely horrifying film.<br/><br/>The story to this film is about a family in the 1600s who is banished from their plantation after a religious dispute. After moving out and settling elsewhere, the family's newborn son is snatched away as to what was surmised as a witch. Fearing the worst, the family begins to suspect everything around them, including themselves. Writing and directing this was Robert Eggers, in his first feature film debut. Accomplishing this is not an easy task to begin with, which already is an impressive start. The script is simplistic yet effective in its story to show just how little is needed to make it good. One of the contributing factors to this experience is the atmosphere that is felt. Much of it is unsettling and ominous looking because of how secluded the location is.<br/><br/>The cast are believable in their roles. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the first born daughter who witnesses her youngest sibling's vanishing gives a memorable performance. That and her chemistry with her father William (Ralph Ineson) and mother Katherine (Kate Dickie) are quite the struggle. Thomasin's other siblings Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) are also perform well. Caleb comes in second to that of Thomasin for length of screen time. Both Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie were in the HBO series Game of Thrones. While Anya Taylor-Joy was in Split (2016) and Glass (2019). Bathsheba Garnett and Sarah Stephens who play the witches are quite unnerving to say the least and are very convincing.<br/><br/>The minor issues in the story are the parts that are not explained. Some characters' fates go unresolved. Nothing is shown what might have happened to them. This is critical when it comes to showing closure in a story. The other flaw was the cause of the whole plot. As the narrative is executed, the thought of someone being a witch begins to surface. Yet it is never explained as to who was the witch, if at all. Understandably so there will be confusion, but also clarity should be brought to light on the inquiry. As for horror, there's only one jump scare and it doesn't even involve a sting which is great. The rest is unrelenting dread that is displayed. There is blood and gore but not much. It's more of the sense of being left alone that is more horrifying.<br/><br/>Cinematography was well shot too. Handled by Jarin Blaschke, the camera remains steady and focused. Many times, the lens is aimed strategically at one place in order to cause unrest with the viewer. Blaschke also filmed for Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet (2009) and Fray (2012). Lastly there's the film score composed Mark Korven. The music heard is a mix of ethereal female chants, minimal strings and very light percussion. All of which present this story in such a disturbing way, it will make the audience feel like there really is something among them that is not right. Korven also scored films like White Room (1990), Cube (1997) and Cruel & Unusual (2014). Either way, it is simple for all the right reasons.<br/><br/>Minor points like character resolutions and definite cause of plot is the only issue here. The actors give solid performances, the visuals are quite discomforting (in a good way) and the music is creepily memorable."

"sol-","Null","1","1","22 October 2016"," A Family Torn Apart
","Paranoia tears apart a superstitious and devoutly religious seventeenth century family in this unusual horror movie that debuted to considerable acclaim at Sundance. The film's most striking aspect is the attention to period detail; not only are the sets and costumes authentic, everyone also converses in Old English with appropriate vernacular, which helps to capture the flavour of the times. The film additionally benefits from a superb lead performance by Anya Taylor- Joy as the eldest daughter whose parents and siblings gradually begin to suspect of witchcraft as she undergoes adolescent changes. The less said about the actors playing her siblings the better though and the film's attempts at authenticity are sadly compromised by the washed- out visual approach with so many greys and blues favoured that the style calls attention to itself. The project also narrowly misses the mark for psychological horror. It is, after all, made quite clear that something sinister and malevolent is in the midst, giving little room to question whether it is all in their minds, onset by religious paranoia. That said, there is much to like in the notion that religious fanaticism further drives the family apart and causes them to distrust one another rather than bond together to combat the evil around them. The ending, if a tad overly literal, is highly memorable too and the film certain leaves much to ponder over. 'The VVitch' may not be all that it could have possibly been, but it is quite understandable why it has amassed such a following in this era of highly recycled horror movies."

","""The Witch"" is a decent film that told the story of a seventeenth century family that was forced to find a new life outside of the New England village they called home and when trying to build that new life circumstance surrounds their lives causing them to turn on one another all stemming from the strange abduction of their new born baby. This film was intense and very disturbing but in in my opinion it could have been a little better. I wanted this film to be straight up scary but it wasn't. I think the writer/director wanted to focus more on how the family was breaking apart due to the evil that was surrounding them instead of focusing more on the evil itself, which I'm not mad at because it made this film different and a little more interesting. The horror part was kind of put to a minimum but it was just enough to keep a horror fan like myself interested. Although I say that this film could have been a little better it is kind of underrated. I think this film was brilliantly written and different from most others of its kind. If you're a true horror fan and want to see a horror film that didn't need to show too much gore and is a psychological thriller, this one is the one to watch."

"chicagopoetry","4","7","18","20 February 2016"," Pointless and not very successful exercise in mood
","I was highly disappointed by The Witch. I just don't understand why independent horror films keep failing to scare me these days. The closest anything has come to scaring me in recent years is perhaps Babadook and Goodnight Mommy, but even those fell a little short of their potential. <br/><br/>In this one we have a handful of creepy scenes that are completely wasted, because this film so lacks anything resembling a plot that that's all they come across as, just random scenes.<br/><br/>OK, here we go, I'll try to explain it (spoiler warning). A family is for some reason exiled from an early 17th century New England town, so they go off and find a spot to live on their own, but they don't seem to know how to grow or hunt for food. The family isn't properly introduced to us in the first place, so it's a little confusing (is there one or two families living together) but soon we figure out it's just one family with a lot of kids. They all talk like Shakespearean characters so it's hard to identify with them. One day the little baby vanishes in thin air and apparently there's some old witch living out in the woods who took him and I guess, ate him or something. From then on nothing is explained. The witch does make another appearance, but she's just a flash and she never becomes a character in this story, is never explained whatsoever. The older boy disappears in the woods and when he returns he's possessed, I guess, or maybe he's just sick and delusional. I don't know. The older daughter and the younger set of twins then start accusing each other of being witches because their goat gives blood instead of milk, while the mother thinks she's breast feeding her baby when really a crow is pecking on her. The father chops a lot of wood in at least four or five scenes of him chopping wood. Their goat then becomes murderous and everyone goes nuts and the girl discovers that the goat is Lucifer himself, I guess, and he tempts the girl to sign her name in his book and she goes off into the woods to float around in the sky with the other witches.<br/><br/>The end."
"Quinoa1984","10","7","18","19 February 2016"," gets under your skin and haunts you
","Sometimes you can't believe what you're seeing in a cineplex that will more than likely only show the latest from the major studios. A film like The Witch or most other films from the studio A24 - mostly (if not all) done independently and then picked up for distribution - such as Under the Skin or Springbreakers, would normally be relegated to some art-house theater where not many people could see it. But unlike some distributors who think in only day-and-date theatrical/VOD (or just VOD only), A24 puts something like The Witch as basically a mainstream release (needless to say I saw the trailer for months, many times, in front of big horror and other releases). But I love that a film that goes for being all about simply scaring you by its brooding imagery, period dialog and actors who you won't know unless you have every cast member of Game of Thrones memorized (hint, it's the parents), gets to be seen by so many people. It's not about silly jump scares or characters who are idiots... well, not in the sense of the usual teenagers, but let's get to what I mean.<br/><br/>This is all about witchcraft, but it's also not the simple 'riding around on broomsticks' shenanigans or anything that comes close to being jokey. Filmmaker Robert Eggers (which is all the more astonishing as it's the director's *debut*) suffuses his actors and crew into a setting that is unmistakably 17th century New England, and it's from here everything else can be conjured up. His story follows a family of Puritans from England who are cast out from their community (we don't know why, no real need to, except that the father and mother are, to say the least, very religious, even for the Puritans!) They set up a farm and are preparing for a long season until they can grow their crops. They have a bunch of kids, an teenage daughter, an adolescent boy, two twins and a baby. Right at the start the baby is taken by... who? What? <br/><br/>Sometimes having some ambiguity can work in a film's favor to make the horror from the story and place even more potent. There's not too much ambiguity with The Witch (unless someone wants to warp around things to their liking, or found something I don't know), and it's clear: there is some real heavy-duty black magic going on in the nearby woods, and whether the spirits (in human and animal form) come to the family because they're religious or just because they're evil beings that like to slather themselves with blood is a little more open to interpretation. And in less confident hands it could have become schlocky or unconvincing, set in a period so that either monotonous imagery could unfold (it could have easily been a too-hard-to-take pace wise effort) or all about the special gore effects.<br/><br/>Eggers finds the sweet middle ground, and creates a portrait of a family undone by their own religious fervor, while also being true to what were, at the time, historical accounts of witchcraft. Whether those carried much creedence, Eggers doesn't care - he commits to showing these woods and showing something like a goat or even an apple as something deathly serious, and yet loaded with significance. He doesn't move the camera around like crazy, and of course he doesn't need or should have to: the production design is among the greatest in any horror film, not to mention the certain color palette that he and DP Blaschke give to every shot so that it's like the world is drained of color - grays are even grayer, browns dirtier, and blacks somehow much blacker. It's a serious, darkly directed film, but there's always an intensity about it that doesn't make it ponderous to a point that takes one out of the movie.<br/><br/>A large part to why the film is so effective and chilling is the acting. The main adults (Ineson and Dickie, rarely below a 10 emotionally speaking, though Dickie has the trickier role as the one who has to try, up to a point, to keep his wits about him) are very strong here, both playing variations on God-petrified mortals, but the movie for me really belongs to Anya Taylor-Joy (her first major movie role, expect to see her in many things to come) and Scrimshaw as Caleb.<br/><br/>For the former, she has to carry many scenes all based on why she is a trustworthy person, and she sells it, while for the latter, this boy, it's a role that needs someone to play the period dialog (which is only occasionally obfuscated by the accents) and having to be genuinely scared to death when faced with the evils in the woods. When you have characters who are both ""simple"" folk of the Lord while also being capable of being twisted by the same dark forces they can't escape, you need people to sell it. They all do, to lengths not unlike out of Polanski at his fiercest.<br/><br/>So combine a filmmaker who wants to make Dread with a capital D his priority, a setting and location and things like just a barn or a door that feel eerie and ominous, and actors who dig in to characters who could very well destroy one another due to their fears (except for Thomasin), and you got a unique genre piece that works just as well as drama as horror, if not better."

","I don't understand why ""The Witch"" is supposed to be so ""critically acclaimed"". Amateur critics don't count. Won 5 awards... 4 were from people that live in their parents' basement and run awards nobody ever heard of and one was from Sundance, if that tells you anything about from where this acclaim is coming. Granted, a film doesn't need awards or recognition from major groups to be good (the reviews I most trust come from some cynical film fans on the YouTube), or even come from a major studio. But I think some people view these ""outsider"" type films as being instantly high art and great films just because they're not some ""cold, materialistic ad space"" or some other stereotype of major production films.<br/><br/>I don't want to say it was bad really... the acting was good and the idea was good, it was even well shot for what it was.

They try too many angles at once for the story and don't really develop any of them. This, I wouldn't even classify as horror, though luckily it did stay away from the modern ""horror"" tropes of not being horrific at all and relying on cheap gore or ""jump-scares"". If anything, it was more like a suspense film... but with all the suspense removed.<br/><br/>The whole thing is one long build up, touching on all these details very superficially and not developing them until the last 10 minutes. Actually, about half-way through, there's a scene that makes you think: ""finally, the exposition is over"". Then it immediately ends that rising drama to go back into more exposition. They should have picked an angle or one underlying cause for the drama and developed it. But this goes on until the final 10 or 15 minutes of the film where the story just sort of hits a brick wall at 5 miles per hour. ""Wait, that was it? I sat through all of this for that?"".<br/><br/>It is a shame that such good acting and shooting had to go to waste on basically zero story development.

They tend to be either ridiculous slasher pieces or goofy fantasies of people who, either way, don't understand that witches do exist and they're victims of a lot of massive and extremely unfair persecution.<br/><br/>And here we come to this movie, which tries a different take by presenting a period piece of a Puritan family, beset upon by what we are to believe is a witch. Oh dearie me, how hilarious this is from the get-go. We've got all the stereotypes here, and it's pretty embarrassing. But the most embarrassing part is the fact that the script is incoherently-composed, and the acting is either dialed up to 11 or sleepwalking.<br/><br/>It is nothing short of amazing, and definitely worthy of praise, that the cast could even deliver the ponderous, dense lines as well as they did, though. Especially given that the direction was not particularly great, with extremely questionable choices on photography, blocking, and focus.<br/><br/>But what really ended up the most questionable of all was: what was this film trying to say exactly? Who was this film even for? I find it hard to imagine that anyone would actually enjoy it except as a goof in October, when they're in the mood for a ""scary movie"", but not too close to Halloween because it's just not good enough for a special occasion. It's not even really scary, it's just something to watch because it's supposed to be in that genre.<br/><br/>None of the family is remotely sympathetic or likable. They all come off as idiots or phoning it in, until the time comes for their Oscar bid, at which point they turn it up to a ridiculous level of ham. They also do incredibly stupid things, like stacking a precariously steep, narrow wall of firewood, ignoring giant animals that realistically they would know are dangerous and should be handled carefully, and naturally -- as with all films of this type -- turning on each other at the slightest hint of danger or threat. Because nothing helps people survive being set upon by supernatural threats by attacking...each other...instead of trying to come together to meet the danger or running away.<br/><br/>So I'm not exactly sure what movie some of these crazy praise-filled gushers are on about, but it wasn't The Witch. It's so incoherent, you can't even really be sure if you should be offended at the stupid and clunky misappropriation of the titular term. Who knows what was going through the mind of the writer-director?<br/><br/>I will be kind and say that this might have worked much better as a short film, perhaps half an hour at most. At the very least, the feature-length film is not as self-indulgently long as some I've seen (at about 90 minutes), so even if you're as unimpressed as I was, it doesn't overstay its welcome as horribly as some of its type."
"MattBirk","7","5","12","19 February 2016"," This is a Movie about Faith, not a Witch (You've been warned!)
","The Witch is one of those films where heading into the movie you sort of need to know what you are getting into. This IS NOT a movie about a witch, it's about a family's faith being tested and the fallout that follows...all the while a witch lurks in the woods nearby.<br/><br/>The Witch is being touted as a movie with pure, unrelenting dread. While that is the case at times, the atmosphere dwindles during the many times the characters repent. And they repent an awful, awful lot. I understand that the movie is about a family's faith being torn apart from within, but the movie's 'entertainment value' dips during some of those scenes. The tension is killed the moment they start bickering and doubting one another. It's just as one might expect, however, the Devil (evil) is a whisper in your ear which creates doubt with one's faith. And that is just what The Witch is, it's a whisper of evil. <br/><br/>There are swift, small build ups that tease there is evil afoot, but just when you expect something sinister to occur, nothing. The hare, the goat, the raven (all heavy symbolism of Satanism) are all present. But they are used ineffectively half the time that they feel like child's play (literally at times) rather than signs of their forthcoming damnation.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie more than I actually did and that's a pity. A case can be made that the hype got the best of me, but I was just as hyped (if not more) for It Follows and The Babadook and those two turned out to be some of the best horror movies of the decade. The Witch did have moments of tension and trepidation, but when the time came for the payoff it simply wasn't sufficient enough to justify the many teases of evil."

","I understand the film was not meant to be an action film, but it failed at keeping my attention at many parts. I also fail to see how this was a horror film at all. It was incredibly dull, which once again, I understand it's not meant to be exciting and keeping you on the edge of your seat, but this movie did a terrible job at being a calm film. It was too calm. <br/><br/>Secondly, the film killed off the characters too quickly and strangely. It seemed as though the directors took too much time introducing their family, and needed to hurry the plot up. The father, mother, and twins all died within 5 minutes of each other in the film. By that point, there was only 15 minutes left of the film anyways. <br/><br/>The movie was eerie, but it was not scary. It didn't strike me as a professional film either. It looked very college-level and amateur. I do not recommend this film."
"geohoward","1","7","19","23 February 2016"," The Trailers are misleading, the previews lie
","If you get the urge to go see a movie, let me tell you about the one I saw last night. The Witch... What can be said about this movie? The preview had a better plot. Yes the plot of the movie is different then the preview. It was so long and drawn out, that at times I wasn't sure if it was ending, or if it was actually going to go somewhere. The plot twists and foreshadowing music leads you to believe that it's going to come to a climax, and you start to look forward to something interesting, but then the screen goes black, and they cut to a new scene of the same drawn out garbage. It's listed as a Horror. But the only horror out of this documentary was the fact that someone invested actual money into it's making. The climax came before the movie started, because you are expecting to be scared out of your mind, the rest is a lecture of religion, like sitting through a 10 hour long catholic mass. No offence to Catholics, but your sermons are not really known for there zest for life. The end of the movie plays out beyond prediction, as if you can tell the director simply gave up on the film and had to make some kind of conclusion, and it makes about as much sense as wearing a winter coat to the beach in July and about as exciting. ... In short, if you want to go see a movie, and your thinking about watching this one...... Don't. Go to Walmart and look at what people are wearing. Trust me, that was actually more interesting and scary."

","I fell asleep 3 times and had to force myself to stay awake to watch the entire thing. In my humble, unimportant opinion, this ""film"" was just a study in the evils of religion, whether it's puritanism or present day evangelism. Long story short: religious fanaticism and some old hag in the woods destroy a family. Yay. Other reviewers have said it has psychological terror. I didn't see it. I did experience boredom. Also, an evil goat!! Maybe I've seen too many of these so-called horror movies. Maybe I'm too picky. However, if you call something a horror movie, it needs to scare people. I don't care what manner it employs, but it needs to be scary. This was NOT psychologically terrifying. Had I stayed awake, I might have laughed instead."
"hellholehorror","4","4","9","2 February 2019"," Unengaging
","I found this more annoying than scary. The ending is painfully predicable within the first ten minutes and once you have guessed it then the rest of the paranoid mystery leading to it is boring. The music that they use to imply witches is beyond annoying, it really grates on your ears. The acting is solid and it looks beautiful. There are some intense moments but this is let down by unengaging scenes, painfully slow pacing and a total lack of anything happening. I didn't like the stuff involving children, even knowing it is fictional I knew that it had to be acted and that really did not sit well with me."

"CinemaClown","Null","4","9","8 September 2017"," A Soul-Shaking, Blood-Curdling, Skin-Crawling, Bone-Chilling & Nerve-Wracking Nightmare
","A soul-shaking, blood-curdling, skin-crawling, bone-chilling & nerve-wracking exercise in persistently looming dread, paranoia-inducing terror & never-ending nightmare, The Witch (stylized as The VVitch) is one of the best films I have ever seen and is destined to rank amongst the greatest works of 21st century cinema in the years to come.<br/><br/>Set in 17th century, the plot concerns a family of devout Christians who are banished from their Puritan plantation and settle on the edge of a secluded wilderness where they build a sustainable life for themselves. But when their youngest mysteriously vanishes from the premises & crops fail, the family starts to crumble and is torn to pieces by an evil that lurks in the woods.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Robert Eggers in what's actually his directorial debut, The Witch is one of the strongest debuts in recent memory as Eggers' direction exudes both passion & perseverance that one expects from an auteur. The writing is top notch too as Eggers fills his tale with believable characters and their finely scripted arcs only lends more credibility to its diabolical plot.<br/><br/>Production design team create a sinister environment that reeks of evil, and the peripherals of the isolated surroundings only add more eeriness to the whole setting. Cinematography is a highlight, relying on natural light to imbue a sense of realism while its earthy tones, cold colour palette & controlled manoeuvring of camera inculcate an aura of foreboding that only magnifies as the plot thickens. <br/><br/>Editing is methodically carried out, for every bit of its 93 minutes runtime plays a relevant role in the final outcome. Mark Korven's terrifying soundtrack further ups the ante by amplifying the tale's nightmarish element, thus catapulting the viewing experience to another level. Every single aspect works in perfect harmony under Eggers' supervision and brings to life a cinema that's as unique as it is unearthly.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Witch features a devoted cast in Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw & others, and they all chip in with commendable inputs. Taylor-Joy is an absolute revelation in her role and renders her character's increasing vulnerability with great effectiveness. But the real show-stealer is the goat named Black Phillip, and you have to see it for yourself to find out why.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Witch is a deeply unnerving, extremely disquieting & powerfully affecting cinema that feels like it was crafted by the Devil himself. An absolute gem of genre filmmaking that's just as polished in the storytelling department as it is accomplished on technical scale, this ill-omened folktale is the best movie of its year, one of the finest films of the decade, and one of the genuinely great works of horror in recent memory."
"Rainey-Dawn","9","4","9","30 October 2016"," I Am Blown Away - Intelligent, Suspenseful Horror
","One of the biggest problems with most modern day horror films is the fact they spend more money on fake blood and guts than they do paying good actors, directors, writers, etc. Most of the modern horror films are the stupid in-your-face blood, guts and gore with a crappy or non-existent storyline. And they do not know how to build up suspense and create subtle, intelligent horror. This modern day horror film, The Witch, is quite the opposite. The Witch is highly suspenseful, very atmospheric, excellent story and over all scary.<br/><br/>The film is considered to slow to some people, and I can see why... it's not the silly chop them up film that they are used to. The Witch is in the spirit of good classic horror... slowly building into a terrifying ending to a fantastic story. It's about a very religious family in the 1600s who's child came up missing, their crops failing, intense family moments and witch nearby in the woods. Very creepy things happen to the family.<br/><br/>If you like the subtle, suspenseful, eerie horror films - then watch this film! I am blown away at how good it is. I fell in-love with this film the first time I watched it - and it's rare for me to enjoy modern horror but I truly enjoyed this film. <br/><br/>9.5/10"
"lisa-ravenclaw","8","4","9","13 July 2016"," Tense and haunting
","When I think of witches, I think of Halloween and Harry Potter. I remember cartoons on TV about plucky young girls casting spells and saving the day, before speeding away on a broomstick. Excitement, fun and melodrama. I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too! My point is that witches no longer frighten us. Homicidal maniacs and evil spirits tend to terrorise the protagonists of horror films today, while the witch is considered so harmless she appears almost exclusively in stories that we tell to children. The original meaning of witches, and the sinister source from which they were thought to take their magical abilities, has largely been forgotten.<br/><br/>The Witch succeeds as a horror movie, because instead of attempting to modernise the witch, Roger Eggers' debut film reminds us of what witches once signified to people â€“ and of how very real they seemed.<br/><br/>The year is 1630. William and Katherine are devout Puritans who have recently emigrated to New England with their five children. Living alone on the outskirts a vast wood, they want to find the kingdom of God. When their infant son vanishes one day, the parents are distraught. They pray. They repent of their sins. But the family has unwittingly entered the domain of a witch, and evil closes in around them.<br/><br/>The fascinating thing about The Witch is that most of the story and the dialogue is taken directly from 17th century documents and reports, meaning that people claimed to have actually witnessed the horrifying things that we see on screen. The film's events unfold to chilling music, with such a matter-of-factness and at such a steady pace that the overall effect is not only one of dread, but of mounting despair. On his knees in the rain, William pleads with God to save his children. But just like that, due to no obvious fault of their own, God has forsaken the family.<br/><br/>Immersed in the tense, haunting world of the film, I found myself suddenly understanding the hysteria that once surrounded witches a lot better. The family disintegrates, because of the belief that witches are not born, but created when a human being pledges themselves to the devil in exchange for power. They begin to suspect that one of their own could have become a witch. Fear ultimately conquers love."
"engulfedindark","1","4","9","14 June 2016"," Trailer good, went downhill from there
","This movie has some good reviews...but, it seems like all the production companies in opening credits where each working on a different movie....spoilers....Costumes and accents I believe where authentic. However, any background music while appropriate for some scenes was found in others...I kept thinking the wheel would fall off the wagon, for one. Something that was funny was how the father kept chopping wood, while everything else feel apart. How quickly he accused his children of being witches and then changed his mind?? It was really a mess. Oh and moments of no sound and black screen. The was more that once I thought the theater stopped playing the movie."
"the1weasel","4","4","9","19 May 2016"," Somewhat tense at times, but not truly horrifying
","This movie was not the best in this genre or style. It was not slasher-graphic, so if that's what draws you, skip this one. It was tense without being really frightening. I feel that the movie tried to build terror and suspense, but I watched this around 8am after a good nights sleep and had to back up a couple times because I dozed off. It seems to want to be a more sophisticated horror flick, but did not provide enough chills for my taste. The imagery was also dark at times...which can be pretty spooky if the action and characters are detailed enough for you to still see what's going on. Lastly, I found the language (pilgrim-speak?) more difficult to follow than say...Shakespeare or Homer. Keep your subtitles on and pay close attention!"

","Seems like you either love this film or hate this film. I fall squarely into the ""love it"" camp.<br/><br/>Off the bat, this movie movie knows atmosphere! From the first few scenes it caries with it an intensifying dread, rarely if ever letting up. If you're looking for a slasher or creature feature, steer clear. This is a deep, dread building, slow burn, void of cheap jump scares.<br/><br/>I could be mistaken, but I believe this is writer/director Robert Egger's feature length debut, and holy s**t does he deliver. He mentioned in an interview spending at least 3 yrs on the script, crafting dialogue directly from puritan American period sources as well as first hand ""accounts"" and myths. Boy, did he deliver. Believe me, this is a director to look out for.<br/><br/>Special shout out to the casting director and actors. They pulled some unique and fresh talent. Everyone was on A-game. Specifically Anya Taylor-Joy whom I guarantee will be a household name in the next few years. She was standout.<br/><br/>I could go on but I'll spare you. This film is so refreshing in a genre that seems to be lacking innovation and falling back on paint-by-numbers story telling. Prepare to watch a family be ripped apart by their fears, both spiritually and emotionally."

"zombie134","7","4","9","18 April 2016"," My kind of movie! Horror with a deep theme! Not the Conjuuring OK!
","I can see why many people misjudged this film. For me it falls into a list of films that include a base theme while telling a story. Apocalypto it was fear, Revenant was about forgiveness, Remember was about revenge. For me the VVitch was about temptation and evil. All of these stories strongly connect with good acting by your characters, especially the character you begin to relate to. In the VVitch the eldest daughter Thomason is the focus. As the story progresses we can relate to her. <br/><br/>The puritan lifestyle pretty much sucks. It's a hard life riddled with guilt and tedium. As she begins to realize the evil out in the woods she is drawn to it. The director gives us very shocking glimpses of this evil to let us know it is real but the witches are not the focus of the story. As an audience we want to see more even the brief images we see are ghastly. We want to see more just like our protagonist. <br/><br/>Beautifully filmed, well acted with good themes this movie is not a monster movie. It certainly isn't shallow entertainment and it had me thinking the next day. My kind of film. Loved it although I know it's not for everyone especially the douchebags who gave it a 1 thru 5 stars probably gave London has Fallen a 9!"

The cinematography was good, but scene cuts were rough at times. It was a good look at the rough lives of early settlers in New England and the difficulties in staying alive and raising a family outside the (relative) protection of a large settlement.<br/><br/>We hoped to enjoy a suspenseful, scary, non-slasher movie.

I found myself confused as to what the final bit of the movie did to garner such shock and awe, as I found it to be rather stupid and intelligence-insulting. Also - there was NO HORROR! Common to modern garbage filmes, it was another drama posing as a horror movie. <br/><br/>You're better off spending your money on superior offerings: The Village, Blair Witch Project, Antichrist, the original Wicker Man.. even Kill List.

"jonathanbrown12","2","3","6","3 October 2018"," Bored...confused...
","I finally saw this on Netflix, and the best thing I can say is I'm glad I didn't pay money for this. It was supposed to be a horror, but there was nothing scary about this. I am a horror film fanatic, and was hyped bout this when I first saw the preview; but now I feel like that is 1.5 hours of my life I will never get back.<br/><br/>Where the time period is always an ideal era for a good horror film, I found the movie lacking as a whole. The dialogue was fantastic (I'll give you that: the delivery of old time English was very well) but I feel maybe they spent so much time trying to get the dialogue right that they missed many grand opportunities to take the movie further in the scare factor. With many plot holes, the movie just led me in a confusing circle. 
 The whole premise of a family that chooses exile for their beliefs, striking out on their own only to (unbeknownst to them) fall prey to a coven of witches seems like breeding ground for thrilling effects and damaging faith searching. Instead, the characters seemed to really take all that away.<br/><br/>The mother seems to hate her own daughter, for whatever reason we don't know (it does mention in the end about Thomasin trying to seduce her brother) but it seems to have been a deep rooted hatred. The father is in constant denial that anything evil is going on. Though he is strong in his faith that God will help them, I feel that he is constantly dismissing the notion of evil lurking literally outside his door step. He goes so far as locking his remaining children in a barn with a supposed evil goat that just randomly shows up. Thomasin is, of course, the heroine in the movie. You want so much for her to vanquish the evil witch and be able to save her little brother and sister; only to be disappointed that she joins the coven of (unnecessarily) nude, floating witches led by a transforming goat that, I'm sorry, were those spurs??<br/><br/>Where did the witches come from? Why did they curse the family? What was exactly the point of grinding up the baby at the beginning? These were only some of the questions I had while trying to decipher this film.<br/><br/>My point of this rating is to share my views in this movie. I know I can't speak for everyone; I've seen quite a few high ratings for this. I for one, am not giving this higher than a two. But maybe it's just me. Hope this helps."
"CountJonnie","7","3","6","2 June 2018"," More contemporary drama with great character work, than thriller/horror
","The Witch is a praised movie, that falls under the horror genre. We went into this movie with different expectations, which helped us to enjoy this movie. Although there is a witch, and although there are supernatural elements, that isn't what this movie is about.<br/><br/>The movie is about a family of outcasts who try to maintain a living on their own, when natural elements are threatening their life (food, animals), but also their faith in God. Their faith is such a strong foundation and source of love, that when their faith is seemingly threatened, life and sanity start falling apart.<br/><br/>And that is what this movie is about. A pretty natural reenactment of how life was in that period. The surrounding, the clothing, the acting, the lines are a very loyal representation of life and values in those times. That alone makes that the movie can feel like a thriller. The brilliant acting and character work will make the viewer feel like he's in a thriller, because the threat comes from the inside, from lies and from naivity.<br/><br/>Thank God those times are over, but also thanks for giving the viewer insight in those times, strengths and weaknesses."

"waffle247","1","3","6","25 March 2018"," Bad lighting & a loud soundtrack
","I'm pretty sure half the visuals in the film were hidden by bad lighting. The same goes for the dialog, either the backing music (cliche horror scream-chorus) was to loud or the actors were mumbling. From what I gleaned of the rest of it, a slow burner to nowhere. I gave up about half way through because the score had a constant whine to it that felt like simulated tinnitus, & the scenes had apparently devolved into children shouting each others names in scared voices whilst carrying candles (there may have been other things in the scenes but it's hard to tell as they appeared to be lit by candle light then darkened with a filter post production).<br/><br/>It felt like someone was trying very hard to make a cult classic horror but I think if you take off the soundtrack it would be obvious the movie is more a period drama with paranoid people. I can't say I noticed much of a plot... at one point there was a rabbit that was clearly scary because of the ominous music, perhaps some sort of Monty Python homage that was so deadpan I missed it. <br/><br/>TL,DR: Turn up the brightness on your screen if you want to see what's happening."

","The Witch marks the directorial debut of Roger Eggers, who meticulously researched this tale of a 17th century Puritan family banished from their community due to a disagreement over the interpretation of the New Testament. The characters and dialogue are based on actual court transcripts from the time period as well as folk tales that reflect the supernatural beliefs of the people of that era.<br/><br/>The attention to period detail is perhaps the film's greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness. Eggers' protagonists--consisting of parents William and wife Katherine, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas, as well as their daughter, Thomasin (who emerges as the story's antagonist)--feel as though they were delivered directly to the screen via a time machine. The verisimilitude of the characters is that convincing. At the same time, because they speak in the arcane style of old English, dependent on the Bible, you might find it quite difficult understanding the words that are being uttered—unless English subtitles are available on your DVD.<br/><br/>The story begins with the family living in a remote, rural area. Thomasin is babysitting Katherine's newborn son, Samuel, who is kidnapped—and we soon learn that a witch snatched Samuel and killed him for his blood (to make a flying ointment). When William takes Caleb hunting, he confesses that he sold Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. Later, when Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of the cup, she implies that not only did she steal the cup but also had something to do with Samuel's disappearance. Meanwhile, the other children claim that the family goat, Black Phillip, has been talking to them.<br/><br/>When Caleb decides to go hunting in the forest by himself, Thomasin insists on joining him. Eventually William finds Thomasin but Caleb ends up in the clutches of a witch and when he finally returns to the home, he's dying of a fatal illness. After the young boy's death, the twins and Thomasin accuse one another of being in league with witches and William is forced to lock them all up in the goat's stable.<br/><br/>What could have been a nice little story of a 17th century family's paranoia leading to murder, is replaced by a silly folktale about witches being responsible for the carnage that unfolds before us. The sequence of events is as follows: the twins disappear, William finds Thomasin unconscious in the stable with blood on her hands, Black Phillip kills William, Katherine blames Thomasin for William's death and attempts to strangle her, and Thomasin kills her mother in self-defense. <br/><br/>Eggers appears to buy the superstitious mumble-jumble of those times when he has Thomasin end up in the forest talking to Black Phillip the goat, who of course is actually Satan. When she signs Satan's ""big book,"" it's the old trope of signing away one's soul to the devil.<br/><br/>Alan Scherstuhl, writing in the Village Voice, couldn't have said it better: ""The Witch purports, at times, to confront ignorance and hysteria, but in the end, for horror thrills, Eggers's film sides with the preachers and executioners."" In other words, despite all the impressive research, The Witch is just another dumb horror movie. Despite the earnest performances (especially an intense Anya Taylor-Joy playing the accused Thomasin), once we're force fed all this nonsense about witches and a goat morphing into Satan, all bets are unfortunately off."
"Saiph90","7","3","6","29 January 2017"," Not a horror.
","This film has a lot going for it, excellent acting, some beautiful cinematography, this showed the vastness of the 17th century wilderness and the claustrophobic living conditions. I think films set in this time frame work better as it was a time when gods and devils seemed real to the uneducated people of the time. I did not find this a horror movie but did find it disturbing, some of claimed it is anti religious which it is to a degree showing the nonsense of inherited sin and the tosh of needing someone to redeem these sins. The film is based in 17th century America and the early Puritans, one family is forced out and sets up a house in the wilderness. I am not sure the film needed a demonic element but could have stood alone as a film showing religious hysteria prevalent at the time."

Using low lighting to minimize the visual effect of scary scenes is counterproductive. This types of techniques won't work in the horror genre nowadays.

There were so many times that it seemed to be building to something exciting, only to go completely nowhere. I so wanted to leave early, but just had to wait till the bitter end to see if there was a payoff. No such luck. No horror. No excitement. There was even one point towards the end of the film where the screen goes black for several seconds and I was hoping and praying it was over. It wasn't.

The oldest boy was nearly impossible to understand but the rest of the cast was not much better. The amount of screen time for The Witch was seriously laughable. The baby got more screen time.

"utgard14","7","4","10","21 June 2016"," One of the more interesting horror films in recent years
","Slow-burn horror movie about a Puritan family in 17th century New England trying to survive their harsh life in the wilderness while battling their own demons as well as dealing with the threat of a creepy witch in the nearby woods. It's certainly a great-looking movie with an authentic period feel. The performances are all excellent. Two of the biggest complaints I've read are that (a) it's boring and (b) the witch is real and not just a metaphor or something like some would prefer. To the first complaint I would say that those people should stick with their found footage garbage. To the second complaint, which is coming primarily from certain types of critics, I say I'm glad the witch is real. I understand the power of suggestion and I value psychological horror as much as the next person, but it seems like the majority of movies made about witches, particularly about them during this period, have been unsubtle studies of persecution and superstition. That's all well and good, and interesting in its own way, but this is scary because the threat is real and you know it's real the whole film. Yes the family is at each other's throats and the bulk of the tension and drama comes from that, but the witch and who she serves are also a big part of the film and provide some of the most terrifying scenes. It's not a perfect movie by any means but I give it props for trying to do something different than the glut of banal exorcism, slasher, found footage, torture porn, and poltergeist movies that fill the horror field nowadays."

"Viator Veritatis","5","4","10","11 May 2016"," Artsy flick trying to mesh horror and psychology
","First, this is not what the trailer wants to make you believe it is, namely an enjoyable horror movie. It is an extremely slow, convoluted attempt to mesh conventional horror with a psychological study on 17th-century belief in witchcraft. Everything that happens is balanced so that it can be interpreted either way, which is probably fascinating to admirers of modern (degenerate) art. However, the movie makers didn't dare to carry this approach to the very end. The finale settles the movie on the supernatural side in a half-hearted attempt to offer some kind of rationalization.<br/><br/>The plot and action are extremely fragmentary and devoid of logical connections; I don't know whether this stems from an attempt at surrealism or if it is aimed to capture the disconnected structure of popular imagination concerning witchcraft (and the way witch processes were carried out). Anyway, the film's broken structure, extremely slow progress, illogical behavior and lack of characters development shall frustrate any viewer not interested in artsy flicks.<br/><br/>On the plus side, if you are patient, intellectually bent and interested in history, this is a very original, atmospheric approach to the witchcraft topic with nice visuals, good acting, lots of research, some impressive scenes and a refreshing immersion in a different age and culture."

"kieranbattams","8","4","10","12 March 2016"," the most unnerving cinematic experience in a very long time.
","I've heard a lot about this film prior to going in. It is the sort of film that you either really like or really dislike and it is clear why. The Witch is a 1630s English folktale and it doesn't shy away from showing that. Things get very real very fast and i can easily say this is the most unnerving films i have been to see for quite some time.<br/><br/>By that i don't mean it is a jump scare fest. I've seen a fair share of horror movies this year and all of them have been complete tripe, with countless jumpscares and a put you to sleep kind of vibe. The Witch features my favourite type of horror, the psychological type, and with that it provided something truly unique. The plot is simple, a 1630s family is torn apart and plagued by witchcraft and terrible unsettling things happen. Of course a lot more does happen, and over the course of the film i felt more and more uneasy. I have heard people complain the 1630s feel makes it boring, but never once was i bored. I was transported straight to this time period and i was transfixed to the screen for the entire duration. This is very much a family film and every member of the family does such an amazing job. The father of the family plays his role so well and you are constantly guessing what he is possibly hiding. This film will keep you guessing the whole way through, but does a stellar job at getting right inside your head and under your skin.<br/><br/>The first scene where the witch was introduced to the audience happens quite early on, it genuinely terrified me. Not to the point i was screaming aloud and jumping out of my seat, it was a different type of terrified. I was glued to my seat, not able to take my eyes off the screen as the sounds from the speakers were ringing through my ears getting louder and louder until the scene changed and put me back into reality. All of the scenes like this were the same, they would consume and take you out of reality for a bit to remind you that what you are watching is something that could have easily happened. It was terrifying also how realistic this film actually was, i know it was only filmed over a course of 25 days but it feels like the camera crew literally went out to film a 1630s family suffering from the threat of witchcraft and put it into a 90 minute film. I love when a 90 minute film can pull you in so much that it feels like a lot longer. <br/><br/>I hope psychological horror makes a huge comeback, i said this when i reviewed It Follows and until now, nothing had quite compared, but The Witch does. It is the best horror for a very long time and is one that i will honestly be thinking about for well over a week because that is what this genre of film does for me. Go and see it in cinemas.. but if you are faint hearted then beware because it will keep you up at night, in the best possible way."

Their 5th child, an infant, is kidnapped and grossly murdered by a humanesque creature who is never full identified, but is implied to be Satanic in some form, and this creature proceeds to harm and divide the family.<br/><br/>While the screenwriters may having been attempting to draw the battle lines between good and evil, they instead seem to go out of their way to criticize Christianity, and the role of man as leader of the family, both of which were common and the way things were three centuries ago. I admittedly got a chuckle out of the depiction of the wife as completely irrational and unable to be pleased (some things never change). But this was probably not the direct intent of the movie.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, good dies and evil wins by the end of the movie, depressing the audience and making us wonder what we just watched and why we bothered to watch it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the implied references to the evil that Satan's minions do are cheap and stereotypical, from the highly sexualized little red riding hood woman taking advantage of the helpless preteen boy, and continuing to the surviving oldest child's being freed of religious bonds and drifting away in a sea of naked spirits at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie was hugely disappointing and insulting."

","It was not until I had finished this movie that I remembered the tiny village of Las Paules in the Spanish Pyrenees where I had lived a few years ago. There, in the year 1593, twenty eight women were accused of and hung for witchcraft, almost exactly a hundred years before the infamous Salem Witch Trials. I would have judged The Witch to be a solid, rather unusual and very slow horror flick, but because of this personal"" connection to the theme of the film I decided to spent some more time thinking about it in greater detail.<br/><br/>First of all, I think The Witch is a very well produced movie. According to IMDb, director Robert Eggers most often works as a Production Designer and a Costume Designer, and it shows in the dedication to detail. Here and there, that attention to apparel was almost a bit overdone, which would have turned the movie into a hipster thing, but ultimately, it was well balanced and congruent to the story. Everything has a strong feeling of craftsmanship. The acting is down to earth, accents are thick, the sets look as if a group of Amish had just finished them. In my book, this evokes a pretty neat impression of seventeenth century New England. Which helps in diving into the story.<br/><br/>A father of four is banished from a puritan plantation because of quarrels with the local church. He decides to take his family into the wilderness that lies beyond the high palisades of the plantation village, to find a place where they can live according to their own set of beliefs. Unfortunately, everything goes haywire.<br/><br/>Eggers decides to give us one of the most gruesome moments of the film – the kidnapping, murder and processing"" of the youngest child – right in the beginning. Then he cuts back to the everyday life of the family on their secluded parcel. This is odd, but interesting. What will be problematic for some is that from this point on, the movie has the pace of a slow art house film. Not much scary stuff is happening. The treeline next to the family's home and the dense forest are used in a very effective visual manner to create an atmosphere of general creepiness. Other than that, the only scary attempts come from some off screen rustling of leaves and branches, which seems to indicate that the family is stalked by something. This is repeated several times and felt like a rather cheap scare to me.<br/><br/>There are hints at some sexual tensions between the family members, with some of them entering puberty or adulthood. Those surging feelings are obviously conflicting with the puritan mindset of the head of the family. Issues of poverty and morale are introduced, as the father needs to sell his wife's heirloom for some corn. As he doesn't disclose his actions even when the wife suspects their daughter of theft, questions of honesty and loyalty are thrown in. Tensions rise from scene to scene. At this point, the movie seems more like a study of the problems and constraints that puritan settlers were facing while trying to domesticate the wilderness around them.<br/><br/>When Caleb, the oldest son, get's lost in the woods and stumbles on the doorstep of the very witch that kidnapped his baby brother, things start to completely disintegrate for the family. While accusing each other of making deals with Satan, William the father makes some desperate yet destitute attempts to restore order and keep his remaining family alive. He ultimately fails due to the fact that he is facing Satan himself, who has been infiltrating their lives in the form of a black goat.<br/><br/>As the dust settles, the only person alive is Thomasin, the eldest daughter. In a unfathomable moment, she decides to give herself to Satan and to join the wild esbat in the depths of the forest. This depiction of witchcraft as something evil will probably not make this film very popular amongst certain women's groups, since the perception of what a witch is or was has dramatically changed in the last century. Robert Eggers obviously did not try to be politically correct, instead he created a visual representation of the superstitions and nightmares of our ancestors, and with this, he succeeded."
"prathiba-anbarasu","5","3","7","10 May 2016"," Its a good period movie.. Horror movie? No.
","I had been reading a lot of reviews about how you get chilled to your bone while seeing this movie.. and that it's understated yet you feel the evil in the movie. None of that is true. It's a movie about an exiled family living near the woods.. A family that worries about being damned if dead. Their religious overkill is what gets them killed eventually. It's about a weak human who blames another woman/girl for ""seducing"" her own brother and father. But that was how women were treated in the past, blamed for everything automatically. This film is simply about losing the child that invokes the weakness in the adults. It's not even remotely scary, it does not have any horror (except maybe couple of minutes). It's a well done period movie, including the language. But that's it."

","This is a horror movie without much substance or much tension really. What makes it stand out though is the atmosphere and the cinematography. How it just doesn't try to go into that generic Hollywood horror flick genre direction. However this needed to take the rawness to another level. Because it felt like the director was holding back in certain areas and lacked the gut-wrenching moments that it needed. The trailer made this movie seem more terrifying than it really is. I think going in a more art-house direction with more surreal elements would have really benefited this film. It's like the director had one foot in and one foot out when it came to making a genuinely raw film. This movie tries to give the audience an illusion of suspense and tension. Despite there being few haunting imagery, when it comes to this movie as a whole it comes off lacking when it comes to making it a engraving experience. Overall, it had potential to be a really haunting and visceral experience but faltered. Instead it just came off as a bleak and nihilistic movie.<br/><br/>3.6/10"

Not so. It's not very scary at all, more on the weird side than anything and it is very slow paced. Ralph and Kate are the devout Christians in 1630's New England that are forced to leave the colonial American settlement they have been living in with their 5 kids-I did not really understand the reason why they had to leave-and find a new home, away from everyone. After building a new house in the middle of nowhere, Ralph and Kate let Anya, the oldest daughter of the 5 kids, watch her baby brother in a clearing near the edge of the forest. Unbeknown to the family, Bathsheba is their neighbor and she performs strange black magic witchcraft during the night. Her latest ritual calls for a baby and Bathsheba decides it won't be a big deal if she was to just pop over and borrow a cup of baby. That is when the whole family starts acting strange and accusing each other of being witches, their animals start acting weird and their crops suddenly go bad. I read that the director used real transcripts from this time period to make the dialogue sound authentic but I had problems sometimes just understanding them, you know, with the thick English accents. As far as the set pieces and the look of the movie itself, they did do a good job on that. It's rated ""R"" for violence and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes. I would not buy this on DVD. I would not rent it on DVD, either, if I were you.

If you are a horror movie fan like me, and by that I mean real horror, the kind that gives you the creeps, then I advise you to pass on this one. Because honestly there is absolutely nothing horror-like about The Witch. To resume the movie in short it is very simple, people speak the old English in a way that you want to punch them in the face after fifteen minutes, there is about 0% suspense or anything worth mentioning, it's a complete waste of your time. But if you like that kind of crap movies, with on top of that half of the movie religion bullshit, with no action at all, then you might like The Witch.

"The_Celluloid_Sage","3","2","4","6 April 2020"," Utter pretentious crap. Don't be fooled by the high praise here
","Production, costume and art director Eggers gets his first feature debut here. Personally from this unknown critic's point of view, he should stay away from the camera. But then given the huge profit this film rutned around, I guess we will be seeing much more from him as the average movie-goer seemed to lap this one up, despite it being very much mutton dressed as lamb in cinematic form.<br/><br/>In the early seventeenth century, we start with what appears to be some kind of trial which which our characters are trying to do something or have done something, nothing really is obvious. Naturally they lose whatever it is they are having a hearing about and our hapless family leave the small village in which they reside and go out on their own. They eventually end on a clearing at the edge of a large wood, whereby they promptly kneel and begin to pray.<br/><br/>The family starts a new life for themselves here with a small homestead like farm. Daily life is a routine for the family with the children do what they do as well as helping to tend to the many chores around the place. But the darkness of the wood is an ever-looming presence over their lives and as they will soon find out, can contain many an evil within. Looking after her newborn sibling, Thomasin (Taylor-Joy) momentarily looks away then realises that the baby is missing from right in front of her while the ominous dark wood and trees look on.<br/><br/>So let us start with the good. Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this film is that it was nearly all shot with nothing but natural light. This does show in parts more than others but is impressive all the same and does add some level of authenticity. Along these lines, the costumes and sets are also quite good and the use of locations are shot well to match the rest of the film. Unfortunately though these are perhaps the only highlights.<br/><br/>Compared to the very soft audio in general, the score is very jarring and cold. Once again, a film (and or it's audio directors) fail to try and normalise the soundtrack resulting in lots of uneccessary volume changes with the remote. Again guys, this is basic film study stuff. While music and ambient audio is important, it does not need to drown out what people are saying, or need to blow peoples ear drums apart after they have been struggling to listen to a conversation due to more badly optmised audio.<br/><br/>While this film has been praised as a horror masterclass, I have to wonder what exactly they see in 'good' horror, as this feature is so incredibly dull it numbs the senses. I'm all for slow films with long build-ups but there needs to be much better acting and a script in order for this to actually work. The children have to be perhaps some of the annoying I have witnessed on screen, and as for the witch herself, well, given her whole three minutes of screen-time they should have considered calling this film The Woods instead.<br/><br/>With plenty of religious (most likely accurate the era and location) and sexual symbolism the film certainly tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. I'm really struggling to see exactly what this film wanted to be or what tyhe directors vision was, or even for that matter what the point in making it all was. Simple folk being unbelievably stupid with a catastrophic mess of nonsense as an ending. I thy were thinking to maybe this thine film then perhaps thy probably should.<br/><br/>

","Robert Eggers vividly recreates an authentic Puritan world in this unnerving film boosted by a strong atmosphere and tremendous performances from its cast. Ralph Ineson steals the show here as William, a devout Christian father who takes his family out of the plantation they are living in after a disagreement he has on religious matters with the plantation leaders. They set their markers down in the New England wilderness, and begin to farm. Strange and devastating things begin to occur before long. The baby Samuel vanishes while outside with the eldest daughter Thomasin (brilliant performance by Anya Taylor-Joy) and the crops fail. Facing starvation, the family soon begins to turn on each other, as Puritan fears and paranoia suffocate the household.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" offers a subtle type of horror in an original and unique setting. The film plays like you are watching a heavy drama on stage (""The Crucible"", perhaps?) and yet the horror elements just keep building and building, accompanied by a strange score, and serve to rack up the tension, and your nerves, before reaching its crescendo in the final scene. Eggers put a marker down with this film. What more is to come?"

"Daedsikcaj","10","2","4","12 August 2018"," Absolute Perfection
","Along with The Cabin in the Woods, It Follows, and perhaps also the first Insidious (2010...counting it), The Witch is EASILY, EASILY one of the greatest and most original horror movies of the current decade. <br/><br/>The filmmakers went further than anyone has before in authentically recreating the time period and place, very early colonial New England, and the language the characters use may be initially off-putting but do what I did, turn subtitles on and make an effort to try to appreciate real historical accuracy that took a lot of effort in the face of being unpopular. If you are honest with yourself, you'll admit that you are following what's going on just fine and the realism is what sells the film. It gives more credit to the depiction of the ""true"" stories that were used to inspire the film. <br/><br/>There is just the right amount of....witchery.... to be completely terrifying and seem as though it really could be something that really did happen. Any more focus away from a more ""normal"" setting, any more footage of witchcraft would have taken away from the power of what we ARE shown. <br/><br/>Yes, it is a supernatural based horror film, but its dedication to historical accuracy makes it come off feeling so real, so possible, so plausible, and if you give yourself over to it, it becomes absolutely believable, as well as giving us today a better understanding of just how horrifying witchcraft was to people of that era, almost to the point of understanding why the witch trials of early America took such a hold over people, people who didn't have beliefs more rooted in science and reason. Witches were accepted as fact and if you submit to the movie and suspend that disbelief, you'll see how terrified those people might have been when coming face to face with what they believed to be credible stories of witches and witchcraft. <br/><br/>And if it just did happen to be real, witchcraft I mean, this is the indisputably most accurate depiction of real witches.<br/><br/>

","Let's travel back in time.... way back to the time of the settlers. Things were very different back then. Religion had a much stronger presence in society. Along with that, you had rampant paranoia of witchcraft. These two historical facts play a big role in the core plot of The Witch.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on a family that has just been banned from a village. With nowhere else to go, they travel outside of the village and try to make it on their own. They start growing their own harvest, each member of the family doing their part in the work. They rely heavily on their very intense Christian faith. Unfortunately for them, weird things start to happen.... starting with the children. <br/><br/>Soon it becomes clear that supernatural forces are at work around them. The only question is.... who is to blame? Paranoia plays a role here, so much so that it eventually leads everything to a breaking point. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is some of the finest you'll see. The performances given scream talent, you can really tell that this cast was passionate about their roles. Anya Taylor-Joy blew me away as Thomasin, she really captured the emotion and depth necessary to play the role. Kate Dickie is also great here, she plays Katherine, the distraught mother. Dickie throws herself into this role and delivers a truly captivating performance. Lastly, is Ralph Ineson, who plays the extremely devout Christian father. I loved him in this role! He totally nailed it as William, portraying a confused, angry father trying desperately to understand what's happening to his family.<br/><br/>I absolutely adore the score in this film. It's so unsettling and sets the perfect tone. That along with environment and visuals create a very chilling watching experience. What I love about films released by A24, is that they are all so raw and disturbingly realistic. If you want real horror and it's an A24 horror film, you're almost guaranteed quality. The ending is another great asset this film carries, it ends in the most chilling and unsettling way. I refuse to spoil anything, you'll just have to see for yourself. <br/><br/>9/10 for The With."

","At its roots, the horror genre attract us because it forces us to face our personal demons: this kind of terror coming from facing unknown monsters that are metaphors of our daily life struggles or fears strangely intrigues us. <br/><br/>When horrors deal with religion though, they usually just use it as an excuse to make horned demons appear pretty much everywhere but The Witch is extremely different: we barely see any monster, violence is kept at a minimum and the terror usually comes in form of a terrible sense of unease. <br/><br/>When this New England family is banished and forced to live in exile amidst the woods, we immediately see that their journey is doomed. 
The younger child, Samuel, disappears and it doesn't take long before each family member starts blaming each other until accusations of witchcraft and demonic possession arise. 
Not too differently from Carpenter's The Thing, The Witch focuses on the personal relationship between the cast members and their feeling of un trust that the father tries to sedate through prayers and sermons. <br/><br/>The Witch rarely gives some answers, it keeps the viewer constantly wondering why some things happen, whether someone in the family has signed a path with the Devil or some evil force has simply decided to put its hands on the Abbot family.
The more we watch, the more we're inclined to think someone in particular attracted the Witch of the Woods and we're left wondering until the bodies start piling up. <br/><br/>The Witch isn't a movie for everyone though: the slow pace doesn't always help building up the suspense and more in general the screenplay asks the viewers to be patient and wait for the final climax. 
Those who are up to it though, will enjoy one of the creepiest and amazing horror movies of the past years."
"Sleepin_Dragon","8","2","4","22 March 2018"," A very good, tense, atmospheric, gothic horror.
","To say I didn't get what I was expecting is a huge understatement, I was expecting a run of the mill horror, with all the usual cliches, obvious and blatant scares, etc, but instead I got to watch ninety minutes of rather subtle, intelligent and subtle horror. The film is hugely atmospheric, moody and tense, it is visually fantastic, with great scenery and costumes. The story unfolds cleverly, when I think of witches, this is what comes to mind, as opposed to the more conventional. As you watch you never quite know what's coming next, or who the malign force truly is. Some truly unsettling and disturbing scenes, it's not a horror in the conventional sense, the scares are not cheap, but very poignant. Very good performance from the cast, Ralph Inseson and Kate Dickie in particular. On occasion the dialogue sounded a little flat, but it was in keeping with the setting of the movie.<br/><br/>Very watchable."

"IMDbUser1002","10","2","4","21 October 2017"," A masterpiece of both archaic drama, colonial representation, and psychological horror
","This movie immediately struck me as what the result of a Shakespeare & Brothers Grimm collaboration would look like. The film is like a beautifully embroidered tapestry, with an interestingly somber & sullen style & theme, and surprising authenticity. The most notable & well structured aspect of this film is the design of the early 17th century set. All the actors speak in an old, yet recognizable English. You likely won't understand half of what the characters are saying unless you've studied Shakespeare. The somber and misty feel of 17th century New-England is captured in a beautifully perfect & realistic fashion. The actors clothing, manner of speech, and heavily religious mindset is accurate to that of 17th century New-England that the movie uses as its setting. The film does a good job of making a statement about how hard it was to be alive in the 1620's, and that these peoples lives were never easy. Even if you're someone who's never studied the hardships of this historical era, or the lifestyle of settlers in the new world, the film gives you a powerful impression that it was extremely hard to be alive in this time. (It accurately captures the grueling lifestyle, while it also remains true to what witches were believed to be in this time)<br/><br/>The first glance at the forest is chilling. The battalion of impenetrable trees seem to pulse with a ominous intent, and the portrayal of 17th century witches is both deeply disturbing, and unnervingly accurate. The witches on-screen moments, and her actions throughout the movie have an overpoweringly gripping effect on the audience, as the witches presence and potency seems to span over the entire forest, and echo a dark omen for the poor family of seven that resides by the forest side.<br/><br/>The film is frightening in a rather subtle way. (mostly after the ending, which resolves all the disturbing occurrences in a solemnly saddening conclusion, which has the most powerful effect on the audience) Robert Eggers immaculately designs a thick, omnipresent tension which further contributes to an increasingly uncanny atmosphere. The film conveys a unique design of horror that's chillingly unfamiliar these days, (but not absent) and deviates from the unusual expectations from an average horror film. (That being said, this is most definitely not an average horror film. (In a good way) I mostly enjoyed this film as a piece of genuine art and as a folktale. If what you desire from a horror movie is jump- scares, gory images, and creepy faces, (Or most of what the horror genre is producing today) rather than a layered and deeply soul-shaking story, than this movie is most definitely not for you.) The film is scariest to those who think deeply about it, and those who understand the 17th century folklore, and the importance of faith in this time, since the film is also frightening at a religious angle. The audience can do nothing but watch as the families faith is questioned and attacked by theirs God's absence in their suffering, and as the family is plagued, tormented, and (figuratively) torn to shreds by the deceitful & manipulating hand of the evil that resides amongst the trees. Thus, the events of this movie are a perfect presentation of a Puritan's worst nightmare. Some of the most frightening & disturbing implications are hidden behind seemingly innocuous, yet slightly sinister things. And some of the most saddening, most horrific implications are hidden beyond the ending, leaving contemplation and speculation on the viewers mind for days or weeks after. While each time you recommence speculation of post-movie events, you also remember how well the film captured your subconscious in its quintessential design of psychological haunts, and you're reminded of the depth of this profoundly powerful story. Robert Eggers combines these layers of subtle horror with expert film-making to create a truly nerve racking story about religious paranoia & familial trauma.<br/><br/>I felt like the full impact of the movie didn't strike me right away. But as I thought and thought (which I guarantee you will) about the plot and the genuinely saddening conclusion, the film started to grow & gnaw at my thoughts until I realized the sheer magnitude of depth & meaning of what I had watched. There is Biblical symbolism scattered throughout the run-time, a perfect display of how religion ruled the lives of people living in this time, and some much deeper elements that I cannot reveal without spoiling major plot points. But overall, this film is a masterpiece, as a horror, a drama, and as a film in general. Everything about it is executed in a perfect design, and the unbelievably disturbing ending will shake you to whatever is at your core."
"Andres-Camara","2","2","4","30 November 2016"," Very good interpretations for a film that did not know where it goes
","Watching this movie, knowing that it is based on legends from those places, I expected to see a scary movie. The pity is that I do not know what I have seen. I have not seen a scary movie or seen a movie of legends, nor have I seen a film of lack of culture, but rather a mixture of everything. For me that is the problem that is not decided by any and joins them all from there the concoction that I do not like. When I was half a movie waiting to see something that scared me, something appeared that was supposed to frighten but disappeared and until then.<br/><br/>This film has even badly composed planes, distant planes, with actors on one side and the other side with nothing.<br/><br/>The actors are great, everyone can see that there is fear. You see they do not know what's happening. The problem is that they are not afraid. In short, of the culture, I imagine but nothing else, because I have not seen anything that has to be scared until much later and does not enter to tell us any of this.<br/><br/>He has a great picture. It's cold as the movie. The place is very well thought out, completely isolated from everything. It is well set with a magnificent wardrobe.<br/><br/>I also do not know what the touch of incest is, which does not come to mind and does not lead to anything.<br/><br/>The movie is slow. I do not look for scares of sound or anything like that, I do not like them, but if I look for a film that gives me some uncertainty, nervousness, uneasiness and this movie does not give me any of this.<br/><br/>Spoiler: In the end he tries to fix things by saying that the daughter is a witch or a witch, but in the whole movie, we have not seen any of this. Only people who are scared of what they do not know and brand it witchcraft."
"evanston_dad","8","2","4","18 October 2016"," Pilgrims Going Bonkers
","Up until its hard sell, literal ending, ""The Witch"" proves that it knows better than most horror offerings these days how much scarier stories are when audiences are left to fill in the blanks with their own imaginations. It creates and builds a creepy sense of foreboding and dread, and is precisely scary because it creates horror out of happenings that anyone could relate to: loneliness, isolation, male inadequacy, religious extremism, disintegrating family dynamics, mental illness, the death of a child. You don't need supernatural oogie boogies to make any of these things scary. Up to a certain point in the film, and despite the fact that we see the witch herself, the film allows its audience to interpret the story as not having a supernatural element at all, and instead be the physical manifestations of the internal mental anguish of its characters. But not content with that, the filmmakers have to make the Satanic spin literal, which immediately makes the film less scary, since I don't believe in God, Satan, Heaven, or Hell, so there's very little in any of that mumbo jumbo for me to be afraid of.<br/><br/>What does scare me is religious fanaticism, and that's where I think this film is most effective. It shows what happens when a group of people who have nothing but faith on which to rely begin to lose that faith, and the lengths people will go to to explain random events as not being random at all but rather the conscious design of a higher being. The mother and father in this film would rather see their own children branded as witches and likely killed than admit that cruel things sometimes just happen, not because humans are being tested or humbled by an all-powerful God, but rather because sh*t just happens. When you've got parents who are willing to offer up their children for sacrifice to prove to themselves that their belief in a fairy tale is justified, you've got an allegory, whether intended by the filmmaker or not, for the kind of religious extremism plaguing the world now, let alone 400 years ago. Now THAT's a horror movie.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"valleyjohn","3","2","4","24 August 2016"," More depressing than scary
","The Witch is about a family in 1630s New England are exiled from their village and go and live alone in a wooded area and area that has a Witch very close by. One by one the children are either taken or possessed by the evil spirits that surround them. This is a very difficult film to watch. Not because it's scary ( it Isn't ) but because the language and vocabulary spoken is of the period . It's also full of religious speak which grates after a while. I've read some glowing reviews of this film yet I didn't get it all. Call me old fashioned but I want my horror movies to be scary , this was just darkly depressing. The one good thing I can say about The Witch is that it looks great. The cinematography is first class and authentic . Shame about the rest of the movie."
"jochendevylder","2","2","4","20 August 2016"," Horrible movie, not a horror movie
","Positives: decent acting (hence the 2 stars).<br/><br/>Negatives: everything else! Senseless paper-thin story; no character build up; pacing (i am all for a slow pacing in a good movie which is mainly to build up something, but this movie doesn't build or really goes anywhere and that at a very very slow pace); badly lite scenes - even the day-scenes (to make everything more dreary i guess); a music score that tries to build up tension where there is none; etcetera, etcetera...<br/><br/>Some reviewers see in this movie a time-piece story about a religious 17th century family having to deal with being outcast into nature and being faced with sexual tension with kids entering adulthood...others see a story about a young girl who wants to break with her puritan family to become a free spirited woman...duh, i think these reviewers saw a different movie or read it as a series of symbolic scenes...sorry to say but this flick is no Stanley Kubrick ""2001, a space odyssey""!<br/><br/>Conclusion: not worthy of your money or time, the only thing you are left with after seeing this movie is what the f*** was that all about! If you want to see a decent psychological horror check out: The Haunting (1963), The Shining (1980) or Jacob's ladder (1990).<br/><br/>One thing i learned: apparently a 17th century male could build on his own with little or no tools a fancy 2 story house with brick fireplace + annex shed in the course of a few weeks in the middle of nowhere - eat your heart out all you survival diehards...i would have thought it was easier to just travel to another town/community..tss what a load of BS this movie!"

","What is it that separates a good film from a bad one? Certainly not budget (or lack of), not even acting talent. Not necessarily a cohesive story. Generally speaking, it is down to individual taste. With horror, gore and special effects can be added to the list of things that don't really matter â€“ it is, I suppose, a translation of convincing mood, of atmosphere, of fear. I say all this because 'The Witch' has received widespread acclaim, yet is almost the polar opposite of successful horror films of modern times.<br/><br/>This concentrates on the ascension (or descension?) of young Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) into a witch. Beginning with the exile of a family of six (Shortly â€“ if briefly to become seven) to a farm beside a secluded forest. The head of the family William (Ralph Ineson) does his best to provide for them, but lacks skill as a hunter and is surrounded by mysteriously failing crops. Whilst in the care of Thomasin, the new baby vanishes â€“ her older brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) also disappears only to return in a state of possession, and the two remaining youngest, Jonas and Mercy, display increasingly frightening behaviour. It seems an unexplained and tragic series of coincidences mars Thomasin, but as things transpire, events seem pre-ordained by the legendary Black Philip.<br/><br/>As a glut of unexplained circumstances occur that disposes of her family, Thomasin wanders in a trance, into the forest where she comes across a haven of naked witches who, after completing a ritual of dance movement around a blazing fire, physically rise and ascend into the trees. Laughing, Thomasin joins them.<br/><br/>The acting in this is extraordinary throughout, even from the youngest members of William's family. Occasionally, the olde-world dialogue spoken with thick, regional accents, is hard to make out. And we only see a witch once in close-up. A seductive, long-haired woman emerges from a cottage deep in the forest and appears to seduce young Caleb (there is also an incident where her coven break into the barn when Thomasin has been imprisoned by her father, and drink the blood of the animals, but this is shrouded in darkness).<br/><br/>It has been suggested by a handful of reviewers that this could be a kind of loose prequel to 'The Blair Witch Project (1999)', which, if you forget the change in location, is an interesting possibility â€“ if you want it to be. Any connection is, I think, entirely unintentional.<br/><br/>This is a leisurely-paced, stunningly shot psychological horror in which a family's worst fears actually become a distinct possibility. It won't please everyone, although it did well commercially and received well deserved critical acclaim."

","I consider myself a horror movie buff. I have seen nearly every horror movie out there that has been made in the last 30 years. However, in regards to this particular movie I could not have been more disappointed. From the majority of the reviews I had come across on various websites related to this film I began watching with the expectation of a good scary movie. But boy I could not have been more wrong! Between the Older English dialogue and the inconsistent volume of the actors' voices it was difficult to understand what was being said, if at all. The actual ""story"", and I use this term loosely, was practically nonexistent. There was one, only one, scene that was startling, in the sense that it could make you jump. All in all this movie was a waist of time and money. Huge let down!"
"csyl93","8","2","4","18 June 2016"," Excellent Supernatural Psychodrama
","I'm not sure whether or not this should be billed as a horror movie. But then again I'm not Christian and it can well be horrifying for a devout Christian. I would call it more... unsettling? Creepy? The director certainly did a great job at the setting and the mood of the story. You can clearly understand why the family was under so much psychological stress. First, they are running low on food. Then they have no one to turn to if things go wrong. They were dealing with the father's lies and hypocrisies and pride. The young son and daughter are struggling with puberty. And most importantly there are evil forces in the woods that seem hell bent on messing with them (to put it lightly).<br/><br/>I'm not saying they're not at fault. All of them had their own little flaws which contributed to their ultimate fates. Katherine was a bereaved and an unhappy woman because she never wanted to leave England and the plantation in the first place. She left anyway we can presume out of respect for her husband's authority, but inwardly resented the choice. She stopped trusting her daughter after Thomasin became associated with Samuel's disappearance. To her, at least, her son's disappearance can only be due to either malice or negligence on her daughter's part. It was not surprising that she eventually turned on Thomasin after the deaths of her two sons and the goring of her husband (did she ever found out the twins were missing? I forget). And then, since she has some good (but not valid) reasons to think her daughter probably has a hand in the deaths of two of her children, you can almost understand why she wanted to kill their murderer.<br/><br/>William was prideful and ""principled"" to a fault and would not swallow his dignity to allow his family to live in the relative security of the plantation. His actions exiled his family and he foolishly thought he could make it in the wilderness. And then when his wife asked him to return (they have many good reasons at this point, including the lack of food! And plus there are supernatural forces that want to, again, mess with them). He proclaims perfect religious observance and lords that over the judges in the plantation and THEN we discover that he's lied and stole from his wife to do what he thought was right, then tacitly allowed his son to lie to his wife too, and allowed Thomasin to take the blame for the theft (if only for a little while). While he seems to be a loving man, he's also a deeply flawed one. You could still see how much he loved his daughter even to the end, even if he expressed it very imperfectly.<br/><br/>And Thomasin, well, she's not the perfect daughter and it was clear the witches were conspiring to recruit her all along, but I can hardly blame her by the end. She was blameless for Samuel's abduction. It was not negligence in the conventional sense because she was up against a witch; there's no way she could have stopped the witch; she whisked him away without making one sound then disappeared! She was not involved in Caleb's death either, although you could see why her parents would think so. She's also linked to the twin's hysteria. Given this it's not surprising that her parents turned on her. But on the other hand she is mostly blameless through all of this, except for the cruel prank she played on Mercy in the beginning. Her turn to the devil was just a logical next step for her. She has nothing left. Her family has betrayed her and she was forced to kill her mother in self defense. She could never have made it to the plantation; even if she could there's no telling what they could have done to her. She had nowhere to turn at that point. Her final scene, her ""you all think I'm evil and betrayed me so I might as well own it"", was the most tragic of all.<br/><br/>The film is an excellent look at how terrifying living away from society can be, how nature is harsh and unforgiving, and what fear/paranoia can drive a person to do (a mother trying to kill her own daughter anyone?). You can feel their stress and their fears and you understand why they're acting jumpy and irrational. They were trying desperately to keep it together in the face of starvation and supernatural evils trying to wreck their lives, but in the end destroyed each other through paranoia and some truly astounding (but understandable) leaps in logic. The movie itself didn't scare me in the conventional sense. What was scary is that while I don't morally support any of the characters, if I were as religious as they are, and had this happen to me, I might well have made the same mistakes. The terror is in how wrong things can go for ultimately loving and decent people, how your one character flaw can REALLY mess you up in difficult situations."
"gorepump","8","2","4","30 May 2016"," Very grim and unsettling horror flick...
","I caught this one in the theater a few months ago and, while VERY impressed, was just too damn busy at the time to muster up a review for it so I figured I'd give it another watch upon a good ol' home media release before I added in my two cents. Lately, here and there, some very decent horror flicks seem to have been slipping through the Marvel-saturated Hollywood sewer system of wider theatrical releases and I gotta say, I really f*cking loved ""The Witch""! Maybe a demand is growing. Hell, I'm game. Give me a reason to go to the theater and I'll f*cking bite.<br/><br/>So, we're back in New England, circa 1630, where a family is banished from their plantation for their kooky, ultra religious bullsh*t and are carted out into the woods to start anew, ensconced in gloomy, righteous solitude. Right off the bat, their baby is swiped by an evil forest-dwelling hag and more run-ins with sinister presences ensue - showing that the family's devout, god-fearing lifestyle is no match for one of the evilest f*cking goats and rabbits you'll ever see...<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it, ""The Witch"" is pretty slow and for the most part might as well be in another language, given the thick dialect taken straight from legit sources (diaries, letters, etc...), so if you're a stickler for knowing precisely what's being said at all times in a movie you'll want to have your English subs on. Frankly, I didn't really see it as being too crucial to the comprehension of the story since a good portion of the dialog seems to be just quoting scripture while the rest is intelligible enough, I'd say. The authentic period vernacular is the icing on the cake, however, of what makes ""The Witch"" a very unsettling flick. Bleak tones and eerie, evil moodiness on top of infanticide, devil goats, apple regurgitation, pedophilic witches and zero hackneyed jump scares! This movie is full of uncomfortable sh*t. The acting is phenomenal across the board. Remembering and reciting all of the f*cking ""doth hath's"" and ""hither's"" while actually putting forth an intensive performance is f*cking grandiose, if you ask me. All believable performances that really 'strike' you if you're like me and are disturbed by deeply religious jargon - most notably, when a dying child is 'ascended into Christ's loving embrace'... Yeesh. If you're hankering for something creepy and a bit f*cked up that won't insult your intelligence with clichÃ©s, check out ""The Witch""! I look forward to director Robert Eggers' take on ""Nosferatu"".<br/><br/>More horror reviews @ http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/"
"chaos-rampant","Null","2","4","26 May 2016"," Crafting the witching
","There are two movies at work here (see also the title). One is about placing us in a remote place and time, New England in the 1600s when it was uncharted wilderness, giving us a presence in a life outside maps. A family has been ostracized and comes to live in a remote farm at the edge of the woods. Dread here comes from knowing we are on an edge of the world and no one will be coming for help.<br/><br/>And then we have another kind of presence as you might guess, lurking in the woods and circling from afar. The apparitions are scarce, which seems to have put some viewers off, but are harrowing when they came so we stay the duration until the next one. The first one in particular is so well timed and ghastly; we know right away this will be a world without mercy, without cuteness about evil.<br/><br/>They made it overall, this is worth watching, it creeps. The difference is all in the first kind of presence that ushers us in a world of human frailty. There are all kinds of ways to explore that edge, only one of which is the notion that evil is being hallucinated, reality cursed by belief in a narrative about evil powers. The forest as playground for chance havoc transformed in the traumatized mind. The filmmakers toy with as much in the scene with the kids becoming possessed by the sight of possession, then snapping out of it. And it's of course in Thomasin giving herself over to delicious madness, levitating out of mind that witnessed what it did. <br/><br/>I would have liked to see a Herzog version, even more knowingly centered in shedding knowledge to give us mind levitation, from his days when he was still a shaman of the craft of seeing. Or this with a lusher camera that listens for the night. We don't altogether escape movie- ism here and this kind of film more than others needs to reach me primal, although it must be an uphill struggle. Was Blairwitch the last time our viewer defenses could be witched away?"

","Story - 5/10 pros: it's an interesting concept and a nice setup for a horror movie. Wonderful time period to explore the isolation and danger of religion. It just moved way too slow for me.
cons: The filmmakers capture a wonderful eerie feel to this film, but rely to heavily on it to continue the audience through a slightly uneventful tale.<br/><br/>Cast - 10/10 pros: Anya Taylor-Joy is mesmerizing. Without her I think this film could have fallen apart. She is delicate, creepy, and sinister all at the same time. Ineson and Dickie provide some truly disturbing performances along side her.
cons: nothing to list here, this is one of the major strengths of this film<br/><br/>Direction - 8/10 pros: Eggers captures an unbelievable feel of despair and isolation, reminiscence to Kubrick's work in the Shining. He is not afraid to take his time to create a sense of feeling.
cons: maybe he relied on superior filmmaking and didn't focus on story quite as much.<br/><br/>Pace - 6/10 pros/cons: this is a tough one so listing pros and cons together here. This is a slow moving movie, a very slow moving movie, it can be tough to sit through, but at the same time that is one of it's major strengths; it's ability to make the audience squirm.<br/><br/>Atmosphere - 10/10 pros: the isolated farm films beautifully. the soft hazy overcast days provide a perfect backdrop for a tale that is just as scary in daylight as it is in the dead of night. This is the brilliance of this film, every day life is just as horrifying as a monster in the woods. The camera work and lighting is top notch. Every shot appears perfectly planned. The costumes blend into the desolate gray of the rest of the world and provide a perfect topper to the sadness of this life. The makeup and blood work is truly disturbing.

","Talk about old school!<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a painstaking recreation of Puritan life in New England. The lifestyle is mimicked. The clothes are period-accurate. The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It's as if Mel Gibson decided to update ""The Passion of the Christ"" by 1700 years.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until... okay, no spoilers. See the movie.<br/><br/>This is a dark and effective movie. I can't remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to ""get"" me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won't lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster's ""Hereditary,"" if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end.<br/><br/>That being said, the film isn't perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it's perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It's kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is quite an achievement and I'm glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking ""The Lighthouse."" Definitely worth checking out."

Didn't find it one bit scary, just strange and somewhat disturbing.<br/><br/>Overall the camera work was good, acting okay, audio was terrible, storyline was diabolical, so much so that the writers should be embarrassed. Setting, scene and location was good, a classical looking 17th century village. Visual effects was very minimal, effects only were applied at the end scene of which still failed to excite me.

The movie only gets interesting during its closing several minutes.<br/><br/>These problems, however, are overshadowed by the movie's biggest flaw — most of the (literal) Puritans populating this period story are so unlikable that you'd care little about what happens to them. They are verbosely, tiresomely God-obsessed. I myself might strike a deal with the devil if he'd silence the two creepy tots, and maybe the shrewish, hysterically shrill mother (Kate Dickie), too. He wouldn't have to kill them or anything — muting them would suffice.<br/><br/>Yes, the film does succeed somewhat in establishing mood and tone. But the result is still nothing to write home about. This isn't ""It Follows"" (2014).<br/><br/>The film has two things going for it. One, as other reviewers have noted, it achieves authenticity quite well. The sets, costumes and dialogue were so meticulously developed that I actually did believe we were in 17th Century New England.

","Why are terrible horror films being critically acclaimed like they're essential viewing for fans of ""genuine horror?"" ""Crimson Peak"" was horrible. Felt like a personal betrayal from Guillermo Del Toro for eating talented actors and having them do nothing for 2 hours. ""It Follows"" is another example. That movie had no genuine tension, no earned scares and the execution fell short of its promising concept. Unfortunately, ""The Witch"" or VVITCH is another example of that.<br/><br/>I admire what debut director Robert Eggers was trying to do here, and I can also appreciate the serious time and effort I know he put into this film, with Old English dialogue and great cinematography with impressive compositions. But once again, the execution is just wrong.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a family that's banished from their village but God knows why (I know there's a reason, but I'll elaborate on this in a few) and after they begin to live in the woods, some strange supernatural things begin to happen and the main daughter (played pretty well by Anya Taylor-Joy) starts being accused of being a witch by her own family. This could lead to very interesting things, since the concept really is a very interesting one. I've written many essays and research papers about the Salem Witch Trials and the whole topic of witchcraft always catches my attention. But nothing happens.<br/><br/>What we are subjected to are long scenes that have ""dark and brooding"" music when you're just looking at trees a majority of the time, moments that don't really further the plot and a handful of creepy images that after a while become trite and eye-rolling rather than evoking a reaction from the audience. There was a scene where the mother is having her breast eaten by a crow while she laughs and instead of being disturbed, I was joining her laughter by doubling over and holding my stomach in pain over how ridiculous the image was. The movie actually depends on the music for instilling a feeling of terror and tension, and that is not good. Same thing happened with Mickey Keating's ""Darling"" and that movie was a travesty.<br/><br/>When I said the family is banished from their land for ""God knows why,"" I only said that because I swear, you cannot understand a single word any of the characters say; you seriously just have to hope to get the context of the scene to follow what's going on. It's not the Old English dialogue that's confusing, but it's the father's gruff mumbling, the mother's near-constant screaming, the children screaming, the main actress crying and the son just being annoying. <br/><br/>I'm telling you, the high praise this movie has gotten is just for the fact that people haven't seen a movie like this in forever and they've been sick of found-footage horror movies and anything produced by Blumhouse Productions. This is not a good movie. It's a thorough waste of time and should only be watched if you want to see how many times you can roll your eyes during a film. Good try.<br/><br/>P.S: Black Phillip (the goat) does nothing until the very end. The critic that said he's ""the most powerfully eerie animal presence in recent movie memory"" is a moron."

'The Witch' isn't all about scares & spooks, but a tale that grabs you & throws shivers down your spine, even without a single cheap scare. <br/><br/>'The Witch' Synopsis: A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.<br/><br/>'The Witch' is an exercise in fright. Believe me, after the All-Time Blockbuster The Conjuring, 'The Witch' is another film of the 2010's that does the horror genre right. Eggers's Screenplay moves on an intentionally slow-pace, only to build & build to an unforgettable culmination. You watch the ill-fated family being torn apart from the evil & although heartbreaking, the narrative remains engrossing. Eggers's Direction relies on treatment & he has aced it here. He treats every moment with a sense of paranoia & unpredictably, adding all the more force to the goings-on. Egger is the True Hero of 'The Witch', as he gives his all & rises with a superior Horror Film.<br/><br/>A Special Mention Jarin Blaschke's excellent Camera-work & for the Performances by Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson & Kate Dickie. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Witch' is a solid watch. Go, get scared (for real)."

","Did I watch the same movie as everyone else? This was by far one of the worst movie's that I have ever seen, which is a shame because I love scary movies. I gave it a four because it was creative (seemed realistic, good imagery, scenery) and the acting was excellent. The actors were very talented and did an amazing job. However, this movie was far from scary. I mean some of the ""scares"" were foolish and came across as funny. Had the audience hysterically laughing. I was expecting something much more terrifying. Plus there were some important pieces missing to the plot. They could have provided much more details about the characters. Very upsetting overall."

","The movie ""The Witch"" is based on stories about witches and devils that have been circulating for over 400 years or so. The last name free Puritan family of William (Ralph Ineson), wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), daughters Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) Mercy (Ellie Grainger), and sons, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Mercy's twin, Jonas (Lucas Dawson) and infant son Samuel are the main characters in this story.<br/><br/>The story takes place in 1630, 10 years after the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts. The family is incredibly zealous even by Puritan standards and this doesn't set well with the community who kicks them out. William is determined his family will not let the woods tear them apart and the farm will be a thriving one. <br/><br/>The life of the family literally goes to hell when baby Samuel vanishes while Thomasin is watching him. The crops begin to die and the chickens lay dead eggs and the goat gives blood instead of milk. The one animal on the farm that gives the most grief is Black Philip. The twins claim he talks to them and they also claim Thomasin is a witch. <br/><br/>The only real witch in the story is the one who killed Samuel and who seduced Caleb when the older boy went out for food for the family. Caleb comes back naked and delirious. He is in hysterics in bed and this wears out his heart and he dies. Mercy and Jonas don't help matters either when they both collapse on the ground in hysterics as well! <br/><br/>In the end, the whole family except for Thomasin is killed. William is gored to death by Black Philip while Katherine is killed by Thomasin in self-defense. Katherine tried to strangle her daughter and Thomasin stopped her. Black Philip is really the devil who set in motion all the bad things that happened to the family. He has Thomasin sign the book he has and leads her to the woods after she strips naked. Thomasin is now apart of the coven of witches in the woods and in a weird way is much happier now. Before everyone made her feel like she was a witch and abnormal because she was a teenage girl struggling with puberty. <br/><br/>This was a very interesting, scary movie about how a belief system can turn people against each other. This family forgot about love and acceptance all belief systems should have and the devil was able to get a hold of them. All the characters were excellent with special mention paid to Anya Taylor-Joy as the misunderstood Thomasin! Robert Eggers really did his homework in regards to the language, clothing, and religion of the time and it shows!"
"distancedself","10","3","9","23 February 2016"," A Classic!
","The Witch is not a conventional horror film. In fact, this film deserves a new genre because this film is horror-drama. Everything about The Witch was phenomenal, the acting, the writing, the beautiful yet eerie shots, and the score. I have been waiting for a movie like this. There is no gore, just true suspense and creepiness. For instance, there was a scene when the oldest daughter was milking the goat and saw blood instead. In a different setting this would be merely a concern of the goat's health, but it was truly unsettling for her and thus the viewer. This is a movie that encapsulates the viewer into the scenes themselves. Everything felt like it was touched by evil thanks to the flawless execution. I thought it was refreshing that even though it was titled ""The Witch"" you only saw her once, making these happenings more mysterious. The ending was my horror fantasy come to life. Not because i haven't seen witches dancing naked by the fire, I've been around the horror movie block a few times, but because of the good daughter you're rooting for becoming an agent of the devil and liking it. This was a drama version of Lords of Salem and a horror version of the Crucible. So creepy and good."

","The Witch has made me unnerved and scared in a way that I haven't been scared in a very long time. It's not a crippling fear, nor is it a jumpy fear but a fear that will make you squirm in your seat. This movie has a undertone that I can only describe as being ""incredibly uncomfortable"". Robert Eggers found a way to take the once campy and silly Halloween decoration that is the witch and make her feel real and terrifying. 17th century dialect helps you stay grounded and adds to the realism that this movie goes after. I give this movie a 10/10, this movie is important for independent filmmaking and artistic integrity. Please go and support a great movie made by talented people."

","Big fan of this movie. Fantastic acting by Anya Taylor-Joy (Thomasin), Ralph Ineson (the father, William), the adorably diabolical twins, and of course, Black Phillip. Much like other recent A24 horror films like Hereditary and Midsommar, it is more of a slow-burn movie and also shares a bit of a 'left-turn' ending that I wasn't crazy about. Still, as a whole it was great and is one of my favorite horror films."

","I'm not gonna lie, I decided to watch this movie because of Robert Eggers new release ""The Lighthouse"" which I really enjoyed. I'm not particularly fond of horrors (or lobsters) and the last one I actually enjoyed was ""A Quiet Place"".<br/><br/>After watching ""The Witch"" I had a scroll through other people reviews, and one thing that struck me was that a whole lot of one star comments came from people where ""The Witch"" is their only written review to date. With a lot of horrific movies out there, this movie defied their expectations so hard that they wrote this one and only review, that's pretty telling!<br/><br/>Main reason to review it badly was that ""It wasn't scary"". In my opinion the trailer for ""The Witch"" is at fault in this case, the movie is described here as: ""One of the most genuinely unnerving horror film in recent memory"" David Ehrlich or ""A nightmarish picture that will make your blood run cold"" Rodrigo Perez, accompanied by the ""scariest"" images taken from the movie and dramatic score, sadly trailer did this movie a big disfavor.<br/><br/>Meanwhile on the poster we can only read ""The New England Folktale. Evil takes many forms"" well that's more like it!<br/><br/>To get things straight, ""The Witch"" It is not a horror movie, although it contains many elements of good horrors like the sense of dread, despair, distrust, confusion or doom. But never are those emotions played to please the audiences need to be scared. It is rather the contrary, where the movie dissects and tries to explain where all those emotions may come from, meandering at the same time between reality and fable-tale, challenging you to answer what is true, and what really disturbs you as a viewer. If you approach ""The Witch"" like this you shouldn't walk away dissapointed, but if you are looking for jump-scares and visceral images look somewhere else."

","Having thought the Witch having potential given the content and overall story. After watching the film, was left dissappointed and somewhat underwlehmed. The film isn't nearly as horror or thrilling as lead to believe, and at times the pacing is very much slow. Quite boring at some parts. Though the set and visuals is well done, the story is quite simple and nothing too bizarre occurs.<br/><br/>With some decent scenes, though the film does get betterafter its mid-way point (around which Caleb- the older brother enocounters a witch then later dies whil being ""possessed"" and ""spirited"" surrpunedd by his family).<br/><br/>Much of the dialogue is quite different to understand given the accent and dialect, which is better to watch the film with subtitles on. Assumed there would be more jump scares or thrills but for the most part, the Witch was quite tame.<br/><br/>Besides a few killings (one by their devil black goat named ""Black Phillip"" and another by its lead Anya Taylor-Joy to her mother- in a casual and predictable manner).

","It all starts when William's interpretation of the New Testament leads him to being banished from the plantation where his family has moved to from England. Instead of the safety of being around others, now he and his brood have to live within the forest.<br/><br/>One day, when the oldest daughter Thomasin is playing with the youngest, Samuel, the baby disappears, stolen by a witch and devoured. William insists that a wolf stole the child while his wife is decimated for the rest of the film. William's lies move the story further in motion - he takes Caleb hunting deep in the wood when he has promised his wife he would not and he sells her father's cup for hunting supplies. Meanwhile, Mercy and Jonas, the twin children of the family, insist that they speak to the goal named Black Phillip while contending with Thomasin that they are also witches.<br/><br/>The next morning, son Caleb leaves to see if he can get food for his family, thereby keeping them from selling Thomasin into servitude. She goes along with him, but their dog chases a hare and their horse throws Thomasin as Caleb is lost in the woods, eventually being seduced by yet another witch.<br/><br/>Soon, all Hell is literally breaking loose. Caleb returns, near death, and throws up an apple before his violent death. The twins forget how to pray and go into a trance. And the mother is convinced that Thomasin is behind it all.<br/><br/>Up until this point, the film moves at an incredibly slow pace. Get ready. I don't want to spoil anything, but it gets more and more demented, paying off everything you've been waiting for.<br/><br/>The first film for Robert Eggers, this shot in natural light film is something to behold. It seems much more confident than a first film would suggest. There is also a lot of attention paid to supernatural detail, such as the Enochian language used throughout for the witches.<br/><br/>I've debated the end of this film so many times. Is it about Thomasin's escape from teen to full womanhood? Is it the sin of William's pride destroying his entire family? Is it about the fact that evil actually exists and that it may claim even the most pious? Or is the issue that William only sees the hellfire and brimstone of the Gospel when he should be preaching the literal Good News, the celebration of Christ conquering death? Would Thomasin desire to live deliciously if her life had not been so oppressive? Is it about the divide between mother and daughter? Is it a Satanic parable?"

"gatheringsnow","10","2","5","25 April 2017"," Something Evil in the Woods...
","The Witch, or the VVitch, as it is so cleverly marketed, is one of the finest examples of supernatural horror I've seen in a film for quite some time, and considering the current trend of jump-scare laden cheese-fests, that's definitely saying something. Even more shocking than the film itself perhaps is the fact that this is the directorial debut of writer/director Robert Eggers, a New England native who skillfully drew from his childhood surroundings of isolated colonial farmhouses and lonely cemeteries in the middle of the woods as inspiration for this film. <br/><br/>Cold, haunting, dreary, and sinister are all words which come to mind when describing the look and atmosphere of this finely-crafted work of art. From start to finish a creeping sense of primeval dread and suspense embodies every scene in one way or another. Taking place in 17th century New England, the film focuses on a Puritan family, father William (Ralph Ineson), mother Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), adolescent son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson), as they are banished from their colonial settlement due to being too severe in their interpretation of the scriptures even by Puritan standards. <br/><br/>They travel into a deeply wooded, isolated region where they settle down, build a farmhouse, and try to start anew, with a newborn son, Samuel, soon arriving and bringing a tinge of joy to an otherwise dour household. However, other, unknown forces of evil are congregating just beyond the confines of their land, and it isn't long before they begin seeping into the lives of the family itself. The land itself is not very fertile and soon the crops begin to fail, and the animals, especially a goat innocuously named Black Phillip, begin acting strange and unnatural. Then things take a turn for the worse when the infant son Samuel, who was yet unbaptized, is abducted under mysterious circumstances. <br/><br/>Teenage daughter Thomasin, who was supposed to be looking after him when he disappeared, immediately falls under suspicion from the family and that's when things begin to get truly terrifying, for both the audience and the unfortunate family being tormented by some unseen evil lurking in the woods. <br/><br/>The Witch is not your standard horror film, as while it does have horror elements, parts of it also play out like a period drama a la The Crucible, a film which is often compared to this due to the similar settings/characters. However, while The Crucible is more about the dangers of mass hysteria and religious fanaticism, as opposed to witchcraft and sorcery, The Witch makes it far more clear that it's not simply paranoia slowly tearing the family apart, but something very real and very dangerous. The film moves at a rather slow pace, and doesn't feature any jump scares or any of the usual clichÃ©s found in horror movies nowadays, which is actually very refreshing. <br/><br/>In addition to that the soundtrack and cinematography perfectly compliment the film and add an extra dimension to the horrific plot as it slowly unfolds. As the family situation continually spirals downward into madness and chaos, and the family turns against one another out of fear and suspicion, the supernatural horrors of the surrounding forest become more and more evident, less subtle, and more terrifying, with a truly unexpected and shocking conclusion that I feel most viewers will not be able to predict, due to the very unpredictable nature of the film itself. In addition to the human characters, the animals and even the forest itself function as developed characters in their own right, perfectly complimenting the overall plot/story. <br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend this film for viewers who are looking for something different than standard modern-day horror fare, with a style that is more reminiscent of old-fashioned classics like The Innocents or The Haunting, with a dread-filled atmosphere, and slowly ratcheting suspense over explicit violence and gore. You won't be disappointed, Robert Eggers is a truly a force to be reckoned with."

Because this may have been promoted as a horror movie in many countries (and the filmmaker knew this could get him into trouble, but also that distributors like to put things in boxes to promote them), it's more a folk-tale as the full title is suggesting.<br/><br/>The movie is open to be interpreted any way you like. And it is also open to be viewed, liked or hated in any way the viewer sees fit. It will annoy a lot of people, but it also will delight a lot of people. It's not horror as I already said, but it is frightening if you get into the mood of it and let the movie do its job.

What does that mean? It means those looking for scares within the first minute, even the first twenty minutes, should go elsewhere.<br/><br/>And when the horror does encroach, it is GRADUALLY, like something slowly being injected into you. You become uneasy to a greater and greater degree.<br/><br/>The slow boil approach helps us feel for this family who, day by day, are being ravaged by hunger. The Mother, Father and Kids, including the young woman who is basically the main character.<br/><br/>A member of the family goes missing and how the family reacts tells us so much about them and their time.<br/><br/>The lighting, the music, the editing, the sound design...all of it are gorgeous.

"keithbrown-90195","9","2","5","12 September 2016"," Pure Atmospheric Dread
","Let me begin by saying this is perfectly constructed to recreate the feeling and mood of the time period. And even before the supernatural elements begin the cinematic frame is claustrophobic as the family leaves the plantation, and the disturbing sound design has constant wind and animal noises underlying the action. Natural lighting shrouds the film in darkness, and the time-appropriate dialogue has an edge of madness. The farm is under constant overcast, and the wood surrounding it has no traces of green or even the hint of something better around the corner. This is film making so precise it would be unnerving if we were to simply watch the family try and make it through the winter.<br/><br/>Shortly into the movie, we're introduced to a figure in the woods. We're also introduced to a skin-crawling score that takes this movie to a new level of unease. Scenes that depict the daily routine of trying to survive on a barren farm are marked with dread; the inner-family fighting occasionally boils to the surface in moments of fear and rage; and lonely figures walking through the woods are under constant threat of the demon that lurks within.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to wrestle with the meaning of the title of the movie, because there were questions I had throughout that I'm not sure were cleared up by the ending, or muddled even further. I do like the suggestion that the powers of the satanic forces were working to tear the family apart from within.<br/><br/>By the end, it contains some of the most frightening moments and images in recent cinema. There's a laugh that I'll never ever forget. And then there's that goat, Black Phillip."

","Beautiful cinematography and solid actors in a convincing period setting that ultimately largely fails to deliver on the goods, being neither a true psychological nor graphic horror film. Rather, I would characterize it as a Gothic Horror and if that's your bag, you'll enjoy it. The premise seems promising but the story is built around a few scattered supposedly eerie scenes that compose a rather fragmented attempt at a haunting tale involving a family that somehow gets mixed up with Satan AND a witch that resides in a Hansel & Gretel like hovel. As usual in Hollywood, the witch in the woods ( title character? ) is pretty hot with ample cleavage draped in a crimson velvet cape drawing stark contrast to the dour emaciated matriarch of the family who kills most of her day sobbing . "" Hey there Little Red Riding Hood, you sure are looking good "" ... at any rate, the devil, sporting a buccaneer outfit, sends the lead character of teen-aged Thomasina ( title character ? ), upon signing a devilish compact, into the forest to cavort with other nude nubile wenches in some sort of initiation into witch world where our story ends ... or does it, see Witch II for further adventures. This is a visually compelling presentation heavy with atmosphere that lacks substantive support, hardly a classic of the genre . The broadly favorable critical and popular reception is perhaps indicative of how starved we are for truly satisfying horror."

","""We will conquer this wilderness. It will not consume us.""""<br/><br/>Creepy little folk tale constructed with slow-burning passion and slack atmosphere. There's something to be said for director Eggers' attention to period details and the way he builds terror via conventions and subversions. Much like others have said, an easy way to sell this is to describe it as mashing together equal parts The Crucible, The Shining, and just a smattering of Blair Witch's atmosphere and A Field in England, oddly enough.<br/><br/>Cast really shines through, special props to gravel-voiced, six- packed Ralph Ineson of Game of Thrones notoriety, and newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy, who brings a sense of strangled fright to her leading performance. The script, combined with the Olde Englishe accents, proved a little hard to understand at times. The music overplayed its hand way too early for my taste, but it got more restrained later on in the film. The final scene is going to haunt me as I sleep later on.<br/><br/>Definitely see this one."

I am not saying it is not good but probably, I wanted more. Let's discuss pros and cons, keep in mind, it is from my personal view-point.<br/><br/>PROS- Acting wise, Anya was on point. She was very believable as the helpless girl in a strange time. Ralph Ineson, I loved his voice. I loved how he played a father with flaws. Dickie as the weeping mother with high superstitions and always irritated with Thomasin was nice. The cinematography was awesome. It completely captured the darkness of a time fueled by superstitions. I will give kudos to the director for choosing to make a horror film which is extremely difficult considering how horror movies are made nowadays.<br/><br/>CONS- The child actors playing Caleb and the twins didn't have the acting to pull off their characters. Probably they should have been given lesser screen time. I wanted more of the witch or at-least a back story as to how the lore of the witch had started. Not an origin story but a 15-minute intro couldn't have hurt. The goat totally put me off. I tried to be serious when I saw the goat but I accept it. Goats are my weakness.<br/><br/>All in all. It is a fresh inclusion to the horror genre and other horror movie directors can take notes from it. If you want to watch this movie, trust me, watch it alone. You will enjoy it.

A true Hollywood example of owing someone a favor. There was no suspense or build, there was no plot, and nothing made any damn sense. Why was this as scary as my daughters 4th grade haunted house? Was hoping to watch something relevant and instead got something that had the depth of a daytime talk show. Think The View is scarier and has a better plot line than this lame attempt at horror.

","I was totally disappointed by ""The Witch"". I think it's pretty safe to say this movie is the biggest ripoff/letdown of the year! Why? The movie is slow, boring, and adds nothing new to the theme of witchcraft among New England pilgrims. The story revolves around a dysfunctional family that's constantly fighting, and a witch in the woods that barely shows up. When she does show up, she resorts to the usual tricks we've all seen thousands of times before and which therefore leave us cold.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the protagonists speak with thick accents that are an awful mixture of cockney and archaic English and are very hard to understand for Americans. My friends and I couldn't understand at least 40-50% of the dialogs (especially the mother and father's) and so we missed a lot of details.<br/><br/>Getting back to the movie, the underlying theme seems to be ""evil prevails over good"" and ""don't expect your Christian faith to save you from the devil"". Well, tell us something we don't already know and haven't seen portrayed in movies at least a hundred times! Other than that, not much else happening in this so-called horror. So, I ask, was is the point of this movie? The answer is easy: none.<br/><br/>Friendly advice: save your time and money and don't pay to watch this mediocre movie on witches. Do the smart thing (unlike us) and wait till the movie is available on netflix before watching it, if you are determined to waste 90 minutes of your life."

","I think I was cursed. I had to have been because that was one painful experience. I must've been bewitched into even watching this drivel. I don't know what I liked less: the constant yelling, the old English or the backwardness of the family.<br/><br/>Just to bring you up to speed real quick: It's 17th century America and a family has just been banished from a colony due to their particular practice of the Gospel. Not long after settling in their new digs the baby is stolen away by what is presumably a witch. From that point on a lot of yelling, praying and insanity ensues.<br/><br/>I couldn't understand them much of the time due to the accents, the speech and the volume. And remember, it's the 17th century which means no electricity--so be prepared for darkness to ruin some scenes. I know that the Salem Witch Trials were real but this movie just made a mockery of it all. The more the family doubled down on prayer the more psychotic they became. I don't know if this movie was about the frailty of faith and prayer or the power of witchcraft. Give me the good ol' green witch on a broomstick."
"jkbonner1","10","3","10","13 March 2016"," Witches really do exist. Well, don't they? Yes, and No.
","I enjoyed The Witch immensely. The mood it captures so well. A real bone-chilling horror story that conveys full plausibility to the world that it depicts. And the scenery and music help the mood along very nicely.<br/><br/>William (Ralph Ineson) and Katherine (Kate Dickie) and their family are expelled over some religious dispute with the elders of a Puritan plantation in early 17th century New England (1630 is the date given). Even the language used throughout the movie is Early Modern English (1500-1700) with its thou-thy/thine-thee 2nd person familiar pronouns-now considered thoroughly archaic. <br/><br/>With their children in tow, they tough it out on a small farm somewhere on the outskirts of the plantation, growing Indian corn (aka maize) and raising goats, forbidden to participate further with their brethren in the fortress. This forced isolation from society and other human beings plays a significant role in the movie as does their intense religious practices and beliefs. They take the grace of Christ very seriously as they also do the wickedness of the Devil. The large dense forest near their farm also plays a part in the movie. <br/><br/>The focal point of the movie is William's and Katherine's elder daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is 14 or 15 in the movie and what today would be called a pubescent teen. She is the oldest child and is tasked to watch over the latest addition to the family, the infant Samuel. While Thomasin is playing peep-a-boo with him, he mysteriously disappears from her sight. The scene shifts briefly to the shocking scene of a strange nude woman bashing the child to death and smearing herself with his blood. William and Katherine are distraught with grief. At first William explains Samuel's disappearance to a wolf. <br/><br/>One other incident is worth noting. The two younger children frolic with their large male goat appropriately named Black Phillip. Thomasin is jeered by them as they hold her responsible for Samuel's disappearance. She chases them and asserts that she is the witch of the woods. After this they fear her.<br/><br/>After Samuel's disappearance things grow more awry. His father having failed to find game in the forest, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), their eldest son, and Thomasin mounted on the farm's only horse set out in search of game in the thick woods. A large hare stares intensely at them as though it has a mind of its own. Caleb tries to shoot it with his father's blunderbuss but he misses. The shot scares the horse. He bolts and tosses Thomasin to the ground. Caleb runs after the hare deeper and deeper into the forest. Soon he realizes he has lost his way. The forest is dense and scary. He stumbles onto a hut and is greeted by a strange but alluring woman who hugs him to her ample breasts. He returns home several days later delirious with fever and dies mumbling prayers as though he's committed some heinous sin. <br/><br/>As the incidents pile up, William and Katherine see something sinister and unholy in all the goings-on and become convinced that Thomasin is a witch and begin accusing her of witchcraft on their children, which she vehemently denies. They are both frantic with fear and loathing and soon they turn on Thomasin. Hysteria and chaos set in. In their struggle to take control of her, William is rammed and killed by Black Phillip. As Katherine tries to strangle her, Thomasin kills Katherine with a knife. In the commotion the two younger children are killed. <br/><br/>Thomasin is now all alone expect for Black Phillip. Although not clear, it was hinted that she's also had some kind of sexual relation with him. There is the mysterious scene of the witch seemingly milking a goat, but a more sexual interpretation can clearly be made. Docilely she follows Black Phillip into the barn where she partially disrobes, clothed now only in her tunic.<br/><br/>In the darkened barn we see the shadow of a man-creature who speaks to her in a deep male voice, asking her what she wants. To experience the world in all its splendor and glory she tells him. He instructs her to sign allegiance to him. She cannot write she tells him. To which he responds: I shall guide thy hand. <br/><br/>At the very end we see Thomasin nude in the woods observing a coven of naked witches dancing around a fire chanting curses and incantations and then hovering lightly in the air, they ascent into the sky. Thomasin has become one of the witches of the woods.<br/><br/>Was she a witch? It depends on what angle we view the facts presented to us in the movie. Within the cultural milieu in which she lived, one would have found her guilty of witchcraft. Her punishment would have been death by hanging or being burned at the stake. But what about our present milieu dominated by science? A different angle would be to see a young woman severely constrained by parental authority suffering from a neurological disease that would today be classified as schizophrenia, which often manifests itself in teenage years and early adulthood. In her case characterized by the display of both auditory and visual hallucinations (to a person having these hallucinations they experience them as completely ""real""*), paranoia, and aggrandized modes of thought. And in the cultural milieu and isolation that she experienced, she could easily believe she had become a follower of the Devil. So, the appropriate answer to the question is, Which milieu does the asker inhabit? <br/><br/>To the actors and director, kudos to all of them. A masterpiece horror movie. And one that is open to a sequel.<br/><br/>Regarding the archaic English, even though I could follow the conversations reasonably well, I honestly think subtitles would have been helpful. <br/><br/>10 out of 10.<br/><br/>* The mathematician, John Nash (1928-2015), learned how to control his hallucinations."

","'THE WITCH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed indie horror flick, from debut feature filmmaker Robert Eggers. It tells the story of a deeply devout Christian family, living in the wilderness (of 1630s New England), that are terrorized by a witch (and other evil forces). The movie stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw. It was made on a budget of just $3.5 million, and received rave reviews from critics (but poor reviews from theater audiences). I enjoyed it quite a bit. <br/><br/>William (Ineson), and his family, leave the New England plantation they're staying at (in 1630), and head out to the edge of the wilderness, to start life over there. William and his wife Katherine (Dickie) have their fifth child together, named Samuel, but he immediately goes missing. Katherine blames her oldest daughter, Thomasin (Taylor-Joy), for the baby's disappearance; since she was the one watching over him at the time. More mysterious, and very creepy, things keep happening, as the family continues to turn on each other; while always trying to stay true to their faith. <br/><br/>The movie is very purposefully slow-paced, and it works. It's always building towards something, and always digging under the viewer's skin. What Eggers does, with such a limited budget, is extremely impressive; and the cast is all great as well. The movie is very creepy, and horrifying, while never giving the viewer any cheap thrills; it's horror done right! It also has some great social commentary, on how being deeply religious can do a lot of psychological harm; to individuals and families (the Satanic Temple even enthusiastically endorsed this movie). Being raised catholic, I'm always fascinated by (well done) religious themed movies (like this). I can understand why the average (unintellectual) viewer wouldn't like it, but everyone else should be blown away!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/vlqkdyuq2zY"

","The Witch (2015) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Extremely well-made horror film set in New England during the 1600s as a family moves away from a colony and starts a new life in a house on the edge of some woods. One day the oldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) is watching her baby brother when something from the woods takes the child. Soon the family is torn apart by witchcraft.<br/><br/>Writer-director Robert Eggers' THE WITCH is the latest horror movie that is getting raves from critics and fans and it's also the newest movie to be called the ""scariest of all time."" I'm not going to sit here and say the movie scared me because it really didn't. With that said, THE WITCH really was a refreshing throwback to various European horror films from the late 60s and early 70s where atmosphere was the most important thing.<br/><br/>I really respected that Eggers tried to deliver a religious horror film that didn't deal with cheap shock effects and needless over-the-top exorcisms. There's really not any graphic violence or gore either. Instead of going for these cheap jump scares the director instead builds up a terrific setting and slowly plays out the action. The film clocks in at just over 90 minutes and rest assure that every single second is well-made, effective and it slowly builds up to its conclusion. I'm sure mainstream teenage viewers won't enjoy such a slow build-up but adults should enjoy this.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is certainly the selling point of the movie. I thought the director made you believe that you were watching something taking place in the 1600s and there's no question that the entire cast does a very good job in their parts. The atmosphere is certainly rich and thick and manages to set the film apart from most of the horror movies out there now. As I said, I wasn't scared by THE WITCH but it did a good job at slowly building up the drama and it plays out extremely well."

","It would be a challenge for any movie to live up to the hype that The Witch has gotten since its Sundance debut last year, but wow, what a gorgeous film. The craftsmanship is beyond impressive. Every shot could have been an art photograph. All of the sets and costumes and props were so painstakingly period accurate that the world of this film felt viscerally real. The oppressive tone never lifted for the entire run time so that you leave the theater still feeling a bit weird.<br/><br/>The Witch reminds me strongly of ""The Others"". Much of the creepiness was drawn from the set and the location. The pacing is similar. Both have super small casts and center the action around child actors. There's very little blood and gore. If you hated ""The Others"" and thought it was boring, then ""The Witch"" is not for you. It's not the typical Hollywood horror ""scare-a-minute"" CGI romp. There's no break in the tension for a comedic relief. It goes to a very dark place right from the start and never shifts that tone.<br/><br/>The dialogue can be difficult to follow. It's much more similar to a Shakespearean play than standard issue Period Piece English. I could understand them with some effort, and it made the world of the movie feel that much more real, but some might be turned off by it, especially since the film is so dialogue-heavy.<br/><br/>All of the acting performances were top notch. The Twins were creepy and every one of their scenes made my stomach turn. I appreciated that the plot didn't hinge on ""horror movie logic"". Really, the only complaint I have is that I don't know if I quite buy the ending. Definitely looking forward to seeing this one again, and I hope it makes money because I want to see more smart horror with fewer terrible looking monsters and more filmmaking craftsmanship."

Hypothesis 2: it's a nice style exercise, performed for authors and critics and not for the public; so anyone can see how good they are director, actors, director of photography, audio technician, costume designer, makeup artist, etc. (and they are really good), critics can praise the technique and cultural connections, and viewers can feel really disappointed."
"mflj","4","2","6","5 August 2019"," A lot of slow build-up for no payoff
","I honestly don't understand where the hype for this movie comes from. As a depiction of Puritan religious hysteria it may be well done; for a movie intended to be entertaining, particularly a horror movie, it doesn't fare as well.<br/><br/>I was aware the movie was slow going into it, but was expecting more of a buildup of tension. Instead, roughly 80% of the movie was a snails pace run-through of the characters squabbling with each other without making any marked attempt to really figure out what's going wrong. The only points where tension was built was when the musical score demanded it, as the characters themselves were unable to build up any sense of suspense. The witch that was shown didn't really help this as I found her to be almost comical rather than scary.<br/><br/>The use of old English didn't help this feeling at all; I understand that this is meant to be a period piece, but the dialogue was too burdensome to contribute meaningfully to the feeling of the setting. It often felt like characters were rambling on with no proper point, using far too many words to convey meaning. This ruined any suspense they may have generated, and I don't know if the actors were good or not due to them having to slog through such dialogue. I may be mistaken with regards to how peasants spoke back then, but as an assessment of entertainment value the dialogue was purely negative.<br/><br/>Additionally, the witch herself didn't contribute any meaningful or unique aspects as an antagonist in the film. She could have been replaced with a whole host of other villainous characters and the film could have been exactly the same, right down to the obviously evil children and unexplained, vague ending. If the film was meant to show how witches were perceived back then from a Puritan standpoint, I would've liked to have seen more of the witch side of things to make them more defined as an opposing force.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend this movie to those looking for a solid horror movie. If you're looking for a tense thriller without too much gore, 10 Cloverfield Lane (minus the final scene) or a similar movie would be more appropriate. For actual horror, a whole host of better, more interesting movies are available."

"brando647","9","2","6","25 March 2017"," THE WITCH is One of the Best Horror Films in Recent Years
","I love THE WITCH. The film is a period horror film from writer/director Robert Eggers, a man I'd never heard of but whose work I will be looking out for in the future. THE WITCH is haunting, methodical, suspenseful, and obsessed with detail. Listening to Eggers' commentary for the film, it's obvious the man has a fascination with early American life and their supernatural superstitions. It's no surprise. THE WITCH must've been a passion project brewing in his mind for a good while because he put every ounce of attention into it. It's the tale of a Puritan family in 1630's Massachusetts who are exiled from their community for the father's overbearing religious preachings that don't quite mesh with their own local beliefs. And so William (Ralph Ineson) and his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) pack up their children and move out into the woods to start their own little farmstead. Flash forward to sometime later, the family has settled in and built a home, started a little farm, and have welcomed their fifth child. One afternoon, the infant Samuel disappears right out from under the nose of eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). At the same time, the family crops are mysteriously dying and their animals aren't providing. The winter is approaching, their food is scarce, their youngest child is missing and presumed dead, and strange happenings lead to hushed accusations of witchcraft; there is something evil beyond the tree line and they start to fear a dark presence amongst them.<br/><br/>With little exception, everything in this movie works 100%. It really is one of the strongest horror films I've seen in years. I love that it doesn't have to rely on jump scares and gratuitous violence or gore. Don't get me wrong, it has those but it doesn't rely on them. When Samuel disappears mid-peek-a-boo, it's just as jarring as any jump scare and, while the family is ignorant of poor Samuel's ultimate fate, we the audience are privy to it and it'll make your skin crawl. Instead of slapping you across the face with horror clichés, THE WITCH builds a tension over the course of the movie. It starts with Samuel's disappearance. Then we see the family begin to buckle under the pressure. Poor Katherine is losing her mind in grief and the two youngest children, Jonas and Mercy, become increasingly more insufferable, teasing Thomasin that Black Peter (the family's black ram) speaks to them of her wickedness. Thomasin becomes a target for Katherine's angst and poor William, who hasn't had the greatest luck since moving his family to the middle of the woods to start a new life, is doing everything in his power to keep the peace. THE WITCH is just as much a psychological thriller as it is a traditional horror. These people are isolated from the rest of society and super religious; the idea that someone in their little family might be in league with Satan is something they're actually willing to consider. It's unnerving.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a horror film and the movie establishes that it isn't just paranoia from the very beginning. We, the audience, know of the witch in the woods. What we don't know is whether anyone in the family might be working in conjunction with it. Are the children telling the truth about whisperings from Black Peter? Or are the accusations lobbied against Thomasin based on truth? The very idea that one of the children might've dabbled in the dark arts is enough to tear the family apart in fear and suspicion. It's absolutely enthralling to watch. While everyone in this film delivers standout performances (well, except maybe Harvey Scrimshaw as middle child Caleb some of his stuff didn't sit right with me), the real accolades belong to Ralph Ineson and Anya Taylor-Joy. Ineson was perfectly cast in the role as the devout Puritan and loving father to the struggling family and elicits the most sympathy as a man just trying to keep it all together, but Taylor-Joy just knocks it out as Thomasin. From the start, she's a tormented girl. She seems absolutely miserable at the news that her family's been exiled and, despite trying her best to do her part, she keeps coming under fire from her grieving mother. There's no hesitation from her mother in blaming her when something goes wrong and the youngest children are just a royal pain. Her performance walks a line where you aren't sure if she's just good at bottling up her issues in the face of her family or if she's got something going on the side, like maybe some demonic-aided retribution against her tormentors.<br/><br/>And I haven't even raved about how much I love the production and costume design. Eggers really went for full immersion, with period-accurate dialogue and everything. He admits to taking a few creative licenses with some aspects to better suit the story but THE WITCH, with all the talent involved in front of and behind the camera, is one of the most authentic-feeling period pieces I've seen. This all adds immeasurably to the well-written story and amazing character performances. THE WITCH won't satisfy all horror fans, and the pacing may bore some others, but it's an enthusiastic recommend from me."

When it was over and there was no logical explanation for anything that happened, I felt cheated even though I watched it for free on Amazon Prime. <br/><br/>The movie is about a family that leaves a 17th century American community due to some type of conflict about worship. They try to make it on their own but things go wrong. I kept waiting for an explanation for all the things that happened that made no sense, but it never came. When we finally got to the end, there was a ridiculous scene that was straight out of a 17th century ignorant person's fantasy. We're in the 21st century; hello. It was exploitive and insulting.

"hoxjennifer","5","2","6","6 July 2016"," Don't be swayed by the trailer
","The trailer makes this film out to be scarier than it actually is. There are hardly any jump-scare moments, the ""climax"" of the film, is actually very anti-climactic in my opinion, and... not to spoil too much, but the movie is more about how the presence of the witch tears a family apart, rather than the actual witch itself.<br/><br/>In New England, a family is cast out from their plantation community for being too ""prideful"" - it is unclear what exactly their crime is, but it's something along the lines of they are being too devout for their own good. And you can see it as the film develops, the family is extremely Christian... and unfortunately, it is out there, in the woods, that bad things start to happen to them, nothing that even their prayers can save them from. <br/><br/>The entire dialogue is in an older form of English (I believe this was set sometime in the 16th century?), which some may find hard to understand. I certainly did at times, but it's very interesting and adds to the ""creepiness"" of the film, and if you're a history buff, adds a little grain of authenticity to the tale. <br/><br/>However, as a horror movie, it doesn't deliver as how it's marketed to be. Maybe this could pass as a historical drama, or a thriller, but at the same time not really. There were a few moments of great acting, and other moments that were just plain laughable. Overall, this movie was kind of creepy, but was certainly not scary. The plot was anti-climactic and the trailer hyped it up way more than it deserved."

","""The Witch"" is not your usual horror, it's much solemn and morbid, yet true-to-nature interpretation of the grim era. Admittedly, this might not mesh well for those seeking a higher pace horror, and it's quite understandable with the peculiar premise, but it has an intense atmosphere and cripplingly disturbing moments.<br/><br/>A family is banished to a faraway land with little prospect. In there, they find that danger lurks outside their farm and also within their family. Props for the actors, including the children, who manage to create a timely sense of the period. It's not the same medieval type movie, first and foremost it's unapologetically dark.<br/><br/>The tension arrives as this family is constantly dealing with daily pressure with not all members having the same footing. It escalates into real threat as the occult talk is seeping into their minds. The eerie soundtracks add to this effect, it just brings a feeling of dread and uncomfortable air.<br/><br/>However, this presentation can present a couple of problems, one being it might alienate audience. The accent and slow burn are not for everyone, also it doesn't have a hook like more mainstream The Conjuring with clear narrative as it plays with a lot of analogies and the philosophy of the time.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is a polarizing horror with the peculiar and slow theme, however it definitely succeeds on what it sets to do, presenting an entirely dreadful experience in the woods."

","Although directorially akin to British ethnographic horror movies such as The Wicker Man, The Witch is a distinctly American pastoral tale that sees a family exiled from their community due to religious differences and struggling to survive in a no-man's-land between civilization and the wild wood. <br/><br/>By using authentic-ish period dialogue, director Eggers recreates in his protagonist family a society steeped in the language and thought of The Bible. Alternating between piety and goat-poo, the family are repressed as much by language and thought as by an unyielding landscape and any supernatural menace the woodland may hold.<br/><br/>Parallels are drawn between the family's expulsion from their community and the Pilgrim Fathers' flight from religious intolerance. At one point England is evoked as paradise and the family seem to have entered Hell. So to some extent, this is a parable of colonial experience.<br/><br/>Eggers weaves a magic realist tale leaving most of the reveals to the final act. The witch is a creepy unnerving tale in which moments of dreaming and wakefulness, fantasy and 'fact' are not always clear. This world is lovingly concocted from old fairy tales and folk tales. It is unsurprising to find Eggers' subsequent work has included and adaptation of 'Hansel and Gretel'. Sometimes the symbolism is jarring – the inclusion of a woman in red hood, offering an apple to young son recalls tales of Snow White, Red Riding Hood, and, of course, the temptation of Eve but its in-your- face post-modernism wrenched me out of the fiction world. The Witch rarely strikes a bum note by eschewing cheap stunts like leaping cats, sudden crashes and musical startles. <br/><br/>Instead, the director opts for a disturbing ambiance that takes its cue from 'The Crucible' but actually delivers on the supernatural front. The cast - Ralph Ineson as father William, Kate Dickie as his wife and Anya Taylor-Joy, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainge, and Lucas Dawson - help draw the audience into the family's travails. It's a great ensemble cast. Harvey Scrimshaw puts in a gut wrenching performance as a young man seduced to the weird side by a stranger in the woods, while Taylor-Joy by turns loving, willful and afraid offers the emotional fulcrum around which the family revolves and finally dissolves.<br/><br/>This creepy tale may leave fans of mainstream horror scares disappointed but its scenes will stay with you long after you have left the cinema."
"laurahill-23172","5","2","6","19 March 2016"," Entertaining but underwhelming!
","I had been wanting to see this film for a while after seeing the trailer - which looked incredible. I enjoy films about witchcraft so I had very high hopes for this movie. <br/><br/>The eerie atmosphere is evident right from the get go and is maintained throughout the film with camera shots/music etc. So very well done visually. The acting is also brilliant. I often find that child actors can be a little cringey in horror movies but in this case they outdid the older actors.<br/><br/>However, I felt that each time there could have been potential for a really scary moment - whether that be a jump scare or something gory etc, it fell flat. It was definitely advertised as a horror and although it was filmed in a very creepy way which helped add to the tension, I felt it did not reach its potential and the trailer was actually quite misleading. I was also very disappointed with the ending, which was rather anticlimactic. <br/><br/>So all in all, maybe not the first film I'd recommend spending your money going to see but it was entertaining nonetheless!"
"utimategamer","9","2","6","29 February 2016"," An amazing period piece with horror elements
","The Witch is written and directed by Robert Eggers and is about a Puritan family in early 1600s who is torn apart by a witch living in a forest near them. Now I've been really excited for this movie for a while and now that I've seen it, I can honestly say that this one of the best directed movies I've ever seen from a first-time director. First off, all the performances in this movie are amazing, especially from the oldest daughter (Anya Taylor- Joy) and the father (Ralph Ineson). All of the actors aren't well-known so it was nice to see some new actors to look out for. Also, the tone and atmosphere make this movie what it is. This movie is really creepy, disturbing and, at some points, really hard to watch. Also, the musical score for this movie helps you feel the tension and uneasiness of what's happening. The cinematography and look of the movie also help set the tone. The movie is slow-paced and there are a lot of wide shots and it worked perfectly for this movie. Lastly, the ending was really disturbing and interesting. It's the kind of ending that is left up for interpretation and leaves the audience thinking about what it means exactly. If I were to say anything bad, it would be that this is not our typical modern-day horror movie. Compared to the horror movies that come out today, this is a slow-paced movie that will probably leave a lot of typical moviegoers bored and wanting more. This might be because of the way this movie is marketed, which shows it as a full-on horror flick specifically about a witch. While it is that in certain parts, this is really a movie about the effects that a witch has on a Puritan family. For what it is, this is a wonderfully crafted film that can described perfectly in one word: disturbing. I give this a 9.5 out of 10."
"smashbreakman","9","2","6","28 February 2016"," Finally, horror without cheap jump scares
","The Witch is exactly the type of horror movie I have been hoping to see for some time. It's a movie that chooses make you think, listen, and pay attention. Too often horror nowadays gives you a couple jump scares, then another 10 or so minutes of bad dialogue and silly plot points that give you time to make a bathroom break and get a snack before the next ""scary part"". This movie never gives you that break from the dread, even if the movie is slow. It's obviously intentionally slow, to truly build the characters. However it lets you know right away that the witch is real, and it takes the most vulnerable of victims almost immediately in very gruesome fashion. This is sort of the brilliance of this film; it gives you a vile antagonist, but then centers the majority of the movie around the religious beliefs of the family, and how it is tearing them apart, and then let's you decide which is worse. This is the type of movie that will leave some questions unanswered, and while it has its gory moments, it's not particularly violent throughout. And finally, the last thing I love about this film, is that it's clear mix of a ""true story"" and a fairy tale, which one depends on which century you were born in"
"jonsefcik","8","1","2","3 July 2020"," Unconventional but very effective horror film
","This is my second review I'm posting for this film. My original review from 4 years ago was a long winded comparison between this and Rosemary's Baby. The films do share many similarities I'll get into later, but don't think about that going into the movie.<br/><br/>This paragraph is my spoiler-free review, and everything after that will be more in-depth. All I'm going to say is The Witch is the last horror film I ever saw that legitimately scared me. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and its not like I was a kid when I watched this either. This movie came out when I was 20, it still unsettled me to the point where I had trouble falling asleep for the next 2 nights. No movie has done that to me since. I even saw it in the theater twice. It takes a lot for me to see a movie in the theater twice. I think the reason it affected me so much is because its a very unconventional horror film. After seeing so many scary movies, you get an idea of the formula. Chris Stuckmann said it best when he described The Witch as ""almost perversely designed to make you feel uneasy"". When I first watched the film, there were several points where I expected something to happen, and instead of that thing happening, it would do something else, and that thing was always way more disturbing than what I imagined. The isolation and tension the supernatural happenings drive into the family's life adds another layer of conflict, and it works very well. The 1.66:1 aspect ratio makes the protagonists feel small and the trees imposing and ominous. The score of slow strings and choirs creates a haunting, monolithic soundscape. The atmosphere is so effective, even in a scene where you can tell the sun's going down, you're put on edge in anticipation of what might happen at night. If the mere time of day in a film can instill suspense, that's good tension building if I've ever seen it. Overall the acting is strong, but the actors who played William and Thomasin were the real standouts. The young twins were annoying, but I think they were supposed to be.<br/><br/>Most of my problems with the film are minor, but the elephant in the room for me was how similar it is to Rosemary's Baby. The dominant male figure in our female protagonist's life seeking professional or spiritual fulfillment is the reason they're in a new environment in the first place. They are isolated (socially in Rosemary's Baby, physically in The Witch). In both endings, the female protagonist joins a coven due to their waning faith and because they are left with nowhere left to go. Their respective decisions to join a coven takes them from the submissive female roles of their respective cultures to positions of relative power, albeit in a perverse way.<br/><br/>I love both these movies, but Rosemary's Baby is undeniably the stronger film. The Witch is a great movie, but if you didn't like it, I would recommend Rosemary's Baby since its a similar premise but more timeless and overall better crafted. It's an amazing first film nevertheless. Since the release of The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers is quickly becoming on of my favorite directors, and I eagerly anticipate his future projects."

","For certain, The Vvitch is as creepy as it is captivating. Evil goats, crazy mothers, ultra-religious fathers... It has all the nice topics and with a chilling soundtrack, it makes this movie quite worth it."
"MagmaChou","9","1","2","5 April 2020"," This is how a horror movie should be treated
","This is a great horror movie, one of the best there is. Moreover, it is a great movie, without regards to the genre.<br/><br/>Opposite to cliche horrors, the VVitch is all about the plot, its different milestones and characters' impressions of them. In the best traditions of Lovecraft-inspired scary stories, it never actually shows ""the monster"", but speaks of its unspeakable devilish wickedness with words of main heroes. At some point the ideas in their heads seem to be more vile and cruel than the reality they face.<br/><br/>Some scenes (especially frequent close-ups) makes one assume that the story revolves around a girl, named Thomasin, played incredibly by Anya Taylor-Joy, but, to my mind, she represents kind of a medium, which links viewer with the story, while what fuels it are those puritan ideas, which elevate the level of fear in other characters and distort their perception until the reality is explained perfectly in the available framework.<br/><br/>Finally, the mood and the ambience are spot on! The majority of the developing events took place in gloomy and isolated sites, also offering some symbolism to note and speculate with.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is about the true nature of fear. It is subtly crafted with a great attention to detail, which makes it a must-watch to any fan of the genre."
"lucastews","10","1","2","3 April 2020"," Hypnotic and Surreal
","Exceptional story, writing and direction create a haunting and mesmerizing flick about a time in history we rather not talk about anymore. This ain't The Crucible my dear readers. This is a fantastic foray into a language and culture that was fiercely religious and completely afraid of their Creator. In this scary time of pandemic all over the world we would do well to take some extra time to pray to God and meditate on his power to keep us away from evil lurking in human beings - not to mention animals. This family pf puritans sacrificed living in a community no longer tied to a a heavenly reckoning in order to live a solitary life of confinement. Idleness and hunger breeds jealousy and hallucinations that are a pestilence to their heart and very souls. Believe me, a more relevant and disquieting film ye shallt not see with thine eyes forevermore."
"erikdlcd","7","1","2","2 April 2020"," Not your average horror movie
","The Witch is one of the best horror movies I've seen. The production design and the use of mostly natural light creates a realistic environment which reinforces the audience's suspension of disbelief which, in my opinion, is more important in horror movies than in movies of other genres. Eggers manages to create a dark atmosphere which makes you feel uneasy throughout the movie, a quality he improves on in The Lighthouse (2019). A common criticism of many horror movies is that they use cheap pop-up scares to scare the viewers, something Eggers avoids in this movie. There are only three, maybe four, scenes that look like other horror movies. The rest of the horror comes from the paranoia and distrust within the family the movie depicts. Strong 7/10-"
"joelblocka","8","1","2","29 March 2020"," Fantastic Historical Supernatural Horror
","The Witch is... something. It is not a traditional horror film, and really, the only apt comparison I can come up with is Eggers' other major film, The Lighthouse, mixed with a bit of Midsommar. Regardless, it is an awesome film. Eggers' writing and direction, combined with perfect acting and an immersive set design, create a chilling tale that stands out among modern horror.<br/><br/>First off, the acting. Wow. Each actor in this film is incredible, despite half of the cast being child actors. And I don't mean good acting, when you are watching and think, ""that actor is doing great right now"". I was not even registering that they were actors at all, I was so immersed. And their colonial dialect was authentic yet understandable, and seemed to be spoken completely naturally, which is often difficult to pull off. Each character became paranoid or corrupted throughout the film, creating a suspenseful tone that lasted the whole movie. I would like to specifically recognize Ralph Ineson, as the tormented, prideful, authoritative, and increasingly uncontrolled father. His performance stood out among an impressive cast as one of the best I've seen in horror.<br/><br/>Of course, this acting would be nothing without the writing that make this so convincing. Using writings from the period, Eggers makes the dialogue feel real, not like our interpretation of how they sounded. And the progression of the film makes it feel like a ""slow burn"" movie, yet so many events are put into the 92 minute film, that it is constantly entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. The exploration of the themes of paranoia, corruption, and religion are obvious, but not thrown in your face. The viewer will ""get it"", but not feel like it's just been entirely handed to them.<br/><br/>The set design and direction compliment the other factors in making a complete atmosphere for this film. The farm is shabby and poor, and in seemingly every shot, you can see the weak, unappealing crops, a subtle reminder of the coming desperation of the family. The woods loom over them ominously, never easing the feeling of dread and mystery. The movie is mostly lit by candlelight and features many close up shots of the characters, which outside of showcasing their acting chops, also keeps the viewer in the same position as the characters: wondering what will happen next.<br/><br/>All in all, The Witch is a stunningly suspenseful film, immersive in all aspects. Much like other A24 horror films, it is not something you can shake off right after viewing. It is absolutely worth a watch, but maybe not right before going out with friends."

"pesaresigiovanni","8","1","2","15 January 2020"," Robert Eggers is way above the average
","Written and directed by Robert Eggers, ""The Witch"" represents one of the highest artistic peak that horror cinema has ever reached. This movie tries to improve the visual concept of this genre with incredible direction and stunning photography, offering some photograms that clearly remind to flemish painting of 600. Is clear that technically and artistically this cinema piece is close to perfection. But ""The Witch"" is more than just art. In the movie there is a constant conflict between good and evil, life and death, humanity and supernatural, Christ and Satan, with a complex and elaboreted symbology. While you watch the film, the story of this unlucky family keeps growing in you with a succeeded climax of anxiety and paranoia that finds its peak in the terrifyng final. ""The Witch"" is beatiful, intriguing, terrifyng and terribly complex but maybe it will leave you with a sense of emptiness mixed with disappointment for not having understood the meaning of the film which is subjective and unclear."

"daniewhite-1","7","1","2","8 January 2020"," Weird Witch
","'The Witch' has a remarkable ability to sustain weird atmosphere and environment, and magical thinking almost throughout its runtime.<br/><br/>A crafted and deliberate film which reflects on themes and tonal attributes clearly important to its filmmaker: writer-director Eggers; this directness of vision benefits 'The Witch' greatly.<br/><br/>Technical credits and production standards are of a commendably high and effective standard.<br/><br/>The period portrayal, whilst necessarily dramatically formulated, is immensely interesting: the language and accents, including the ""vocabulary of ideas"" of the protagonists is a particular high point in this historical horror.<br/><br/>On the flip side most of the best moments of the film are clustered towards the first half with a diminution of highlights as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The climax is perhaps rather modern in its sensibilities which I found to be really jarring after a film that is constrained to its depicted environment so rigorously by the writing and directing almost all through the prior runtime.<br/><br/>Some of the character scenes between family members could have been more energetically staged and frame compositions are sometimes unable to make use of all the potential of the environment.<br/><br/>For a considerable contribution to the historical horror/folk horror genres, and from a first time director, 'The Witch' is a strong announcement of a filmmaker with vision and purpose; in itself there is much to commend.<br/><br/>I rate 'The Witch' a 7/10 and I would particularly recommend to fans of psychological horror/thrillers, historical films, folk horror and witchcraft/black magic horror.....it is far from perfect but with allowances made for a first time director this is a really good if not quite a very best or great standard film."

These are Puritans. The tone and language is from the 1600s. They escaped Europe, then exiled from their plantation when the father disagreed with its evolving religious beliefs, they pressed on. Actions have consequences. Being isolated has it's merits but again, it has drawbacks and consequences. This film captures the horror of the 1600s (including internal family affairs), religious differences and of course witchery. Brilliantly directed, shot and acted. The setting drips with the thoughts, prayers and ultimate damnation of this family as we the viewers never lose the vague yet acute energy of opportunistic ""VVitch"" in the forest. The colors are pale if not washed out. The VVitch herself is not shown often but when it comes time to deliver the goods.. this film does. The Devil, or in this case, the VVitch is in the little details. A film that was researched for five years to adhere to colonists like these in New England.. in around the 1630s. The wardrobe, the accents, the speech patterns and language. In many cases the last was lifted from court records and journals of the time.<br/><br/>VVitch it for the story, performances, the ominous score, and ""Black Phillip"". VVitch it for the playful period dialogue among the family (mostly between the children) VVitch it for ""Thomasin"" crying wolf leading to the unintended proverbial... Witch it for The VVitch, the rabbit and the goat.. who all happen to be creepy. Witch it for the perfect ending and think about the people, the setting the atmosphere, the misunderstandings and circumstances that they had to endure. All of VVitch culminated in Thomasin's decision. Essential viewing."

","A colonial New England family is banished from their community, and heads into the wilderness to build their homestead and fend for themselves. When their infant son inexplicably vanishes, it's apparent immediately that something unspeakable has happened. Daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) is held responsible for the child's disappearance by her mother, Katherine (Kate Dickie), though we know the horrible truth. With food scarce and the crops blighted, the family becomes increasingly desperate. When eldest son, Caleb goes missing, only to return in an altered state, the situation gets far worse. THE WITCH is set in a time when life was a continual struggle for survival, and superstition filled the air. The film is impeccable, capturing the look, feel, and language of the 17th century.

","This film presents us with an extremely disturbing, dark and depressing story, based on popular tales and legends, it is a horror story carried out in a different way than what we are used to. The Witch is not a movie for just anyone, it is not a quick horror movie or random jumpscares, it establishes itself as the narrative of the sad fate of a poor family as they are harassed by the evil powers of an outside witch.<br/><br/>The film is filmed in a beautiful way, creating fantastic images that get stuck in our minds, but above all, full of symbolism and icons that present us with constant subconscious ideas to build the story they are trying to give. The performances are fascinating and make us see the real panic within the characters, even the performances of children are quite solid. The direction is fantastic, the scenes are dark, medieval and cold, giving a strong feeling of desolation. With a fantastic script, it makes us see through the eyes of the poor victims of this story.<br/><br/>The Witch is a strong film, full of very incredible and spooky images, concentrates mainly on a very strong subject which is witchcraft and the powers of hell, teaching us the horrors that these entail, however, in a magical way and yet realistic, raw and sincere, without over-explained fantasies or effects. And it doesn't need explanation, that's what this movie is about, to face the horrors of powers that go beyond our understanding, our power and our mental health. Probably one of my favorite horror movies, a perfect movie for those seeking the ''special touch'' in the over-saturated genre of terror.

","22 May 2017. It's odd to hear a variation of musical strains from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) used in this horror movie instead of a ship floating along the surface of the moon or surrounding a dark, black monolith, but it's there. This movie has the raw and grittiness of The Name of the Rose (1986) and The Revenant (2015). This movie rather being so much as a scary, horror movie is more of a serious religious family drama with periodic insertions of the occult. It doesn't quite have the intensity nor creepiness of erotic horror film Under the Skin (2013) or Siren (2016) nor the more compelling story of Black Death (2010). The ending is also odd in that it doesn't really seem to flow naturally from what went on earlier in the movie, almost as if it was tacked on at the last minute to include some sort of dramatic ending."

","All I'd like to say about this film, is that it was completely and utterly fantastic! This is almost as perfect a film as one could get. It was eerie, unpredictable and very disturbing. The acting was superb. The film cleverly does not make use of visual effects and instead substitutes it with dark and foreboding forests, sheds and homes. This greatly enhances the tension and makes it more credible. The scene where Thomasin surrenders to witchcraft and becomes overjoyed and blissful as she transforms into a witch is rather disturbing - even more so since this scene was also done without CGI effects."

","""Finally no Hollywood crap"", says one of the reviews.<br/><br/>This, to me, is the epitome of a whole lot of things I'd consider exactly Hollywood crap. There's hardly any part of this that strives towards any kind of artistic expression. It's all about the things that count, and the things that count in Hollywood are that it has to be pretentious, acted in a certain way, visually pleasing and must avoid anything that would come over as too strong. It has to be bland, dumb and well packaged and this is certainly all three of those things, which shows in critic ratings.<br/><br/>There's not really a story here... just a series of events stranded together, but none of them carry any meaning. Not even one you could give yourself as a commentary on the real life situation, like in a documentary without a clear agenda. This movie is like wallpaper or elevator music, but taking forever to achieve the same effect. At one third I was afraid they had no idea where to take it, at two thirds I was 100 % sure of it. <br/><br/>The ending feels like the joke ran too long and they decided to go grab a snack to eat so they just shot whatever to sum it up.<br/><br/>The Witch is great at all the wrong things, at things that can elevate the experience, but cannot make it. And this is as elevated as something so shallow can possibly be. It knows that if it does not try, it can't be faulted for failing."

","Puritanism and witchcraft is a topic that I have found haunting for years. Maybe it's the ancient time period and troubling subject matter that makes it so terrifying, or perhaps its relationship with Satanism. Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" isn't the kind of horror film that necessarily scares you while viewing the film, but haunts you and sticks in your kind. It's a subtle bunch of scares that doesn't have pop-ups and gore, but a subject matter that's deeply unnerving. The family haunted by a witch in ancient New England is cast perfectly, each actor giving brilliant performances. This is a truly fresh independent horror film with more thought and cinematic vision than almost any horror film ever made. What makes ""The Witch"" so special is that it focuses on people, not a plot. It uses the family as a way of showing the oppressive nature of ancient Christianity and how religion and witchcraft causes people to change. It's the humanity of the film that scares you. And make the creepy goat has something to do with it. ""The Witch"" is truly terrifying and beautifully made. Thesoul-piercing score and a shocking ending are what stick in my mind the most, and I can only hope Robert Eggers sticks with the horror genre in the future."

","The atmosphere of this film is stellar. The setup of the family being ousted from their village and heading into the woods to live alone really drives home how incredibly lonely it must have been for many people back then. Without regular contact with others, some families only interacted with each other. This film sets up the extreme version of that, with the family deep in the woods. It is bleak and disturbing, even before anything supernatural happens. The acting is good, but it lacked the depth of character development that I needed to really care about the characters. Rather than feeling emotionally invested, I just felt like, ""Hmm, that's interesting."" And it often was. Though at times it was also quite slow. For such a hyped film, I though much of the critical lavish praise was overdone, but it's always nice to see a low-budget indie film breakout."

"oksanasinner","6","1","2","8 December 2017"," Original but overrated
","I first heard about this film on youtube. It would often pop up in reviews and top lists. I recommend you not to believe the hype and watch the movie with an open mind. Otherwise you risk being disappointed like I was. <br/><br/>The source material for this movie is amazing. Folktales are a horror goldmine and it's a shame you don't see it being used so often. The movie draws you in with it's original concept and stetting. <br/><br/>The approach to horror itself is very unorthodox in the sense that most horror movies nowadays rely on obscurity or grotesque visuals. This movie shows horror in broad daylight, the camera is steady, there are no monsters, no gore. So what good is it? - Realism. Especially in the supernatural scenes. The rawness of theses scenes is the best part. You're always asking yourself 'is this superstition or is this real?' and 'who is the real villain?'. Of course that's until the charm is ruined by the bullshit ending where those questions are answered in the worst way possible. If they left room for speculation and stuck to the subtle approach I would've given this film a 6 or a 7. <br/><br/>'The Witch' had some good ideas but it's far from perfect. I feel sorry for people who claim that this movie is some 'masterpiece'. Apparently they've been watching only shitty movies this whole time. The cinematography was dry and even felt effortless. I liked the composition in only one shot: the dinner prayer. The picture lacks tonal contrast to compensate the lack of color. It just fails at grasping your attention. Only parts where the dryness benefits the movie are the horror scenes, all the other shots are just tedious and repetitive. Sorry, but it needs to have style or at least some visual value before it can qualify as a 'masterpiece'. <br/><br/>The actors did a great job. My favorite was Kate Dickie as Katherine who I think came off as more threatening then the actual witch. <br/><br/>You can tell that 'The Witch' was heavily inspired by Stanley Kubrick's work (sadly Eggers doesn't take notes from his shot composition though). Not only has it similar motives to 'The Shining' but also a soundtrack that resembles Ligeti's 'Requiem' form '2001 Space Odyssey'."
"mrcardigan","5","1","2","12 November 2017"," Intriguing but fatally flawed
","I found this film very interesting if viewed as a psychological thriller rather than a horror film about witches, even though the director is reported to have said he meant it to be interpreted literally. I imagined somebody from the plantation finding the scene of horror at the family farm, the missing children, or perhaps even finding Thomasin raving in the woods, and explaining it in the only way that would have made sense to simple 17th century peasants. It was easy to understand that the family, alone in an unfamiliar and scary wilderness, could have terrified each other into believing anything, compounded by extreme hunger, which would have led them to try eating any plants they could find, including psychotropic mushrooms, as well as the ergot which is overtly shown on the failed maize crop. For me, that is why the scene at the witch's hut with the stolen baby was disappointing. Imposing the third person narrative viewpoint made it too obvious that this was supposed to be taken literally and couldn't be read as the hallucinogenic ravings of insane minds - unlike all the other diabolic appearances in the film.<br/><br/>However, the real big flaw in this movie which has made me reduce my rating drastically from the 9 it would otherwise have received was the appalling diction of the actors, which made the dialogue almost inaudible in places. Perhaps the younger cast members have not been taught how to project their voices to allow the whole audience to hear what they have to say, but I have seen Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie in other things so I know they are perfectly capable of making themselves understood, so it must have been a directorial decision to get them to mumble their lines so they were barely comprehensible.<br/><br/>What a terrible decision that was. What a pity as well, when obviously such a lot of effort went into making the dialogue sound as authentically seventeenth century as possible. What is so great about this trendy habit of directors to not want the audience to be able to hear what the characters have to say? Are they embarrassed by the weakness of the script? Or do they think it adds some kind of bogus authenticity to the story or the characters? Whatever, it is really annoying.<br/><br/>In the case of this film, it was only after I read a synopsis on Wikipedia afterwards that I found that I had missed some crucial plot elements, such as that Black Philip talked to the twins, or that Thomasin was to be sent away to live elsewhere, because I simply could not understand the dialogue.<br/><br/>Ironically, I watched this straight after seeing I, Daniel Blake and the contrast was stark. Every word of that movie was clear to understand, despite the fact that most of the characters spoke in broad geordie accents. For that matter, I don't recall ever seeing a Coen Bros movie where they had to resort to this ""mumble your words to make your character seem interesting"" style of directing."

","This film is not an easy watch, and is complex. The viewers can debate all day what was going on, but it is a genuine horror film, all because the director takes you back to the 17th century, a time where religious beliefs, were the glue that held families together. As the film unfolds the viewer sees what tricks the mind can play on the people living together in the wilderness, as things don't go as planned. This work is far more thought provoking, and chilling than so many so called horror films made for today's younger audiences.

","This movie is based on what I'd like to consider a form of artistic Minimalism. I admit I found it very amusing to enjoy the remarkable results of a movie whose simple plot, reduced employment of CGI and vaguely sketched atmosphere combine so organically. The archaic language is, to my judgment, the only touch of artificial sophistication in a product of natural spontaneity and linearity. What's more simple than a family living humbly in the woods? Yet, it is not what it is nowadays considered ""mainstream"" : the traditional setting of countless childhood fairy tales here constitutes the basis of a perfect horror construction. The contrast between innocence and vice, which also emerged from my previous considerations, is also the central point of this movie, joined by the, also mentioned, illusory nature of the most simple things. Words, looks, basic gestures, animals, even young children are, to quote a famous Log Lady, ""not what they seem"". Furthermore, the Woods used for the setting are simply majestic. The trees are like bricks of a giant wall between the outside and the inside (even if the two dimensions melt in more than one occasion). I find this work to be a clear voice of hope in the darkness of the boring horror scenario which characterized these last few years. ""The Witch"" does not simply rely on clichÃ©s to survive in the competitive world of contemporary entertainment, but it neutralizes their dead components exploiting what is left of their creative energy to turn tradition into innovation."

","""I am that very witch. When I sleep my spirit slips away from...my body and dances naked with The Devil. ""<br/><br/>Wow, this was the biggest disappointment of the year. After reading some laudable messages and the rather misleading recommendations on certain websites, I thought I was ready for again another original horror that, unlike most in this genre, doesn't have an overused subject. In retrospect I really wondered where the horror started in this story. Yes, the language used in that time terrified me. That's for sure. I understood absolutely nothing and I was glad that subtitles were provided. Is it the religious devotion in those days that scares you? I would call it religious insanity. As soon as something happens, those arms go up to the sky and that all-encompassing divinity is called on for help. Or is there really something pernicious in that dark forest, causing this poor farming family to be overwhelmed by adversities?<br/><br/>What if they'd called ""The VVitch"" a historic drama? Probably my opinion would be slightly milder (and probably I wouldn't have watched it anyway). But calling this horror, is a gross deception for many. In my view this movie shows the misconceptions and misinterpretations that were commonplace at that time. A bad harvest, another setback or an unexplained illness caused those simple and unknowing souls to wail and pray to the almighty. An era in which superstition and fear of the unknown thrived. Is that what this simple peasant family made insane? Such madness, that even the black goat in the family was regarded as the source of all evil? For me it's just a historical, psychological drama. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, the entire film is drenched in Old English. I can imagine that historians and linguists go all lyrical about it and get overexcited about it (I can see them sitting there already all slobbery). I tried to understand a tiny bit of it. As a result it required my complete attention mostly. I can believe that the mise en scene of the whole, looked accurate and authentic. The house-holding, the way they dress and the way of living were shown brilliantly and very well cared for. Likewise, the acting and dramatics. Especially the young actors were excellent and gave it a unique character. I can imagine that finding such good, young actors, isn't easy. Their hard work, while seeking a perfect cast, paid of.<br/><br/>Nope guys. This is far from being a horror. Or hearing yet another prayer gives you the chills. I like subtle films in the horror genre. It isn't necessary for me that it's all bloody and gory. But I'm afraid I've missed the subtlety of ""The VVitch"" somehow. The marketing department of the publisher probably realized suddenly that the label horror sounds sexier and more commercial than the ordinary label drama. Let alone they would even mention it's a historical costume film. Not that this is an insignificant genre, but the target audience is more limited in my opinion. In terms of atmosphere and film technology it's unparalleled. But I'm just allergic to deception on a large scale. A bit like religion itself, isn't it? Lets pray for that for once ...<br/><br/>PS. I've seen the trailer afterwards. Now I understand why film-goers thought this would be horror. <br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

I was watching this in the middle of the night, because that's how I roll when I wanna watch ""horror"" or ""suspense thriller"" films. Big freaking mistake. I had to spend most of the movie turning the volume down when the screeching score was too loud and the turn it up when they starting talking again. Ruined the whole experience, and at some point I couldn't stop laughing because it was so ridiculous. I know its supposed to build up tension and suspense, but the howling ladies just got awkward after a while. The film itself was beautifully shot, but overall it was about 20-30 minutes of the movie that was actually worth my time. I like a few scenes, but most of it was either ruined by mumbling actors or howling gospel.

I personally believe that the tale should take the time it needs to take with no rush. If its told correctly, it is not always about what they say, its more about what they don't say. I also wholeheartedly cheer for the more natural pagan way of life.<br/><br/>That being said - I found this to be a very interesting & immersive tale. The general feeling of the period and the acting in my opinion(IMO) was very good. The tale for me seemed to had a life of its own, with subtleties being included as if it had a tale within the tale, this was very well done.<br/><br/>The intensity and delight for me was the clear set idea of showing how being involved in a family (or society) that is based on religious fanaticism can very easily lead to extreme Xenophobia and self-righteous accusations of others to the point of downright violence for the ""cause"" so to speak. This was very well portrayed in this movie IMO. (history also shows us this type of behavior with the Salem witch trials between February 1692 and May 1693)<br/><br/>Although from the start I will admit I had no real like for the family, so if I was supposed to eventually fear for their safety well it just never happened. <br/><br/>I am glad that I watched this movie alone so my moments of hearty laughter at certain delicate points did not disturb any other people that may have been watching in a theater setting.<br/><br/>The ending for me was very joyous and uplifting.

","'The Witch' isn't your conventional horror film. It isn't particularly scary or gory, but it is eerie and atmospheric. The film certainly has some positives - it is very well made and it does build up tension nicely, especially towards the end. It is, however, ultimately let down by some major flaws.<br/><br/>The first being some of the acting. Generally speaking, it's okay, but some of the younger ones are guilty of overacting in a few scenes. UK viewers may also struggle to engage with Ralph Ineson's character, given his distinctive voice which is heard in many British TV adverts. All I could think of when he spoke was Dacia cars. 'The Witch' is also very, very slow to get going. The first half of the film is on the verge of becoming boring - there's very little tension and scares are few and far between, but it does pick up.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought 'The Witch' was decent, but it could have been a lot better. It is unique in its approach, placing a greater emphasis on the dialogue and content rather than simply the gore and scares like a lot of other horror movies. A solid but flawed horror."
"alexnguyen-68425","6","1","2","12 May 2016"," It is an OK horror movie with some gems and some apparent flaws.
","I decided to watch this movie after reading some terrific reviews and praises that it received. In the past, I have enjoyed slow-burn horror movies such as ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Anti-Christ"" tremendously, and ""The Witch"" appears to be in the same league. However, after watching this movie several times, I cannot help but feel like it leaves much to be desired. Overall, is it a terrific movie? I do not think so. It is enjoyable but not that great. I really wanted to like this movie but I simply cannot. Allow me to explain myself (mild spoilers ahead so please continue at your own risk).<br/><br/>First of all, let me discuss the PROS. <br/><br/>+ The female lead Thomasin is the brightest gem of the movie. The actress did a fantastic job portraying a naïve, pure, struggling yet strong and loving teenage daughter. I could not help but feel pity and sympathetic for her and the situations that she was pulled into. In my opinion, any actress that can provoke such a feeling from the audience deserves praise. <br/><br/>+ The twins Jonas and Mercy are also well-acted. They did exactly what they were supposed to do: be an annoying and hellish pair. I felt very uneasy whenever they delivered their lines or sang their Satanic songs. They create some pretty strong hatred in me right off the bat. Again, in my opinion, this is terrific because it shows that the actors know what they are doing by invoking the right emotion response from the audience. <br/><br/>Now, I will discuss the CONS. <br/><br/>+ The choice of speech: this movie suffers from poor choice of speech/dialects. The director chooses to use Old English in this movie to give it a more realistic feel. I think this is fine in itself. However, I feel like this choice has backfired. And the actors' talking manner does not help either. They sound incoherent and some of their conversations just do not flow well. More on this later. A lot of the dialogues are very hard to understand. I had to turn on the subtitles and I still had problems following some of what they are trying to say. First, I thought maybe the problem was because I was not a native speaker but then, I found out that even native speakers had trouble understanding the speech in this movie.<br/><br/>+ The mother: this character, in my opinion, is a failed attempt and really impaired the experience. Early on, the audience know that she is in pain due to the mysterious disappearance of her infant child. The audience are supposed to feel sorry for her and sympathize with her behaviors. However, I doubt anyone could pity her because she had very little character- development. All she does in this movie is be unreasonable, grieve, and complain in a high-pitched voice. Her speech is also incoherent because she 1) speaks too fast, 2) jumps from one point to another without using any conjunction, and 3) ends her sentences abruptly. I find her voice and character to be increasingly irritating upon repeated viewings. <br/><br/>+ The pace: for a horror movie, this movie lacks scare scenes. While I do appreciate how the director took time to deliver some good unnerving scenes, this movie is too slow and fails to keep the audience anticipated. It has almost no scary moments until the very end. And even then, the scenes are not that scary except for one or two of them (the crow being the best scene of the entire movie, in my opinion). I firmly believe that a few more scary moments and a less slow pace would help the movie tremendously. <br/><br/>In summary, this movie is decent. It is in no way a mindless average horror movie, but it is not that great either. I give it a 6/10. <br/><br/>PS: Sorry for any bad English in my review."

","I am surprised to read that this has an ""awesome look"", with details ""as exact as it was back then"". Being Robert Eggers an art director and costume designer, one of the things that struck me is that the wardrobe looked as if coming directly from a tailor shop or laundry (starch included), that it was not aged as much as needed, and that it looked too clean for working peasants (especially for the father who was the farmer). And to say that things looked ""exactly"" as they did in the 17th century is a silly sacrilege, a most fitting word for the occasion, when one decides to write a few lines about a motion picture that narrates a folk tale dealing with religion, and loaded with terror elements. I think that if writer-director Eggers had circumscribed his screenplay to folklore with its natural horror edges (a bit in the line of the wonderful 2000 Czech film ""Kytice""), ""The VVitch"" would have been a better movie. There is also a more realistic approach to the tale, within the frame of a psychological drama with supernatural elements (in the line of the fine 1961 production ""The Innocents""): superstition and religious belief erodes the basis of an English family that has migrated to North America, and the story slowly builds to tragedy. But Eggers fell into the traps of tired formulas of new American horror films, including omnipresent music, false build-ups of tension through music and sound (as if a tsunami were coming!) that lead to nothing for dramatic purposes, evil represented by a botox-ridden woman with low cleavage, a bit of pedophilia, and silly special effects –the ending is the best example, from the moment the main character takes her bloodstained dress off and sits at the family table, to the gratuitous final witch dance and ascent. In the end it seems a bloody, stupid way to recruit a new witch: was that entire massacre necessary to add a new girl to the coven? Let's hope that next time Robert Eggers decides to make things simpler, asks someone else to write the script, and a composer that knows when to stop, for Eggers shows a good hand for directing actors, and a good eye for composition and framing."

"Oberrated","8","2","7","21 April 2016"," Slowly terrifying and disturbing
","To put it simply, Robert Eggers delivers a terrorizing horror in the form of 'The Witch'. Do not go into this film expecting cheesy jump scares and scary apparitions. This one does not do that. Instead, 'The Witch' delivers a slow terror, unnerving, and mentally exhausting horror. The constant questioning of what is happening leaves the audience uneasy and when this film finally starts to pick up, it consistently bludgeons the audience with eerie terror. Some dislikes I did have, however, were that the old English is sometimes hard to follow and it can be found as being slow at some parts but it is all part of the style that Eggers is delivering his haunting moments. This is another Indie win for the creative horror category. I would place it among the ranks of last years creative beast that was 'It Follows'. Check this film out and try to keep your sanity."

","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>Good work with the contemporary music with violins and sad tones. Made by instrument that really sounds that it would come from the time of the story. Realistic scenes and even so very terrifying. The music and soundtrack makes the story and the subpoena horrific. Creeping upon you.... scaring me in a old, great way. Two worlds crosses and leaves the viewer in a realistic sensation of the strict holy life within ""God Jehova"" and the existence of evil; these two things just collide and creates the horror itself. The realistic and authentic pace and situations that clashes is more than enough to give this motion picture its atmosphere and message to the viewer. Even the language is old English and gives the film an even deeper touch of a authentic storyline.<br/><br/>The entire living of a family being banned for religion in the 17th century is very well depicted, in language, picture and social considerations. A tragedy strikes the family and throughout the movie it is highly entertaining to hear how the family is speaking off and to each other,and also how a piece of time could in total be about survival, crops and religion.<br/><br/>Some moments and surroundings of the production and the age which the story takes place in makes me think of another horror movie where a witch terrorizes the good; Warlock. <br/><br/>Slowly evil is being shown through several signs within the crops and the family... slowly.... slowly it is coming...... High class horror and mystery movie!<br/><br/>What brings down the rating from being terrific is the time in the middle of the movie to the impact of the witch. It could have been a lot more sights of the witch earlier and bringing more evil to the table in its pure existence. Another thing speaking of the negative sides is the more usual way of ending horror movies these days; evil prevails and win. That is just boring and wrong.<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made. Authentic and real. The picture and screen writing is plain and simple better than good, showing the cold weather and the harsh living. Sound effects and the music creates a frame in the mystery and the haunting horror in a fantastic way! The research of the religious Christianity and differences between Jehovas Witnesses and ""ordinary"" Christianity is well done. Give depth to the movie. - The actors : Great work showing the 17th century and how people lived by then.... the speech, the religious boundaries and the cold living for crops. Good acting is giving the story a really good sense. - The story : Good old fashioned.... good versus evil... a witch searching for more evil to spread around. Simple and straight forward little piece of art here in the storyline. - Entertainment : Had a good time watching this. All elements in this movie is giving viewing pleasure. - Age : 15. Scary and horrific.<br/><br/>7,0 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)"

","Yesterday I went and watched this movie expecting it to be a really scary movie. That was my first mistake. If I wouldn't of gone into the movie expecting it to be scary, I'd give this movie a 6. This movie was not necessarily scary, it was mainly about the story line. The story line however was just OK. It's a traditional ""old-time"" witch story. My least favorite part was the ending. The ending seemed predictable and is what disappointed me the most. I guess you can expect this in a witch movie. The actors did a good job, and I liked the way the director made the characters look. Other than that, the director should of added a few scarier moments and make an ending that will forever be remembered."

","The Witch really puts emphasis back into the word ""horror"". Very discomforting film, filled with such a large amount of disturbing images that haven't left my mind. It always keeps you at a distance to not fully grasp what is going on, but this adds to its lingering power. It honestly feels like a horror classic that has been able to stand ground with films like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. The entire ensemble cast is incredibly strong, being able to engage in this dialogue that could have felt inorganic but feels totally lived-in and natural. Not only are the adult actors strong, but the younger actors as well. This fits in well with The Babadook and It Follows as three legitimately fantastic horror films that all came out within the span of three years."

","Hood Review: VVitch (The Witch).<br/><br/>Quick Hits:<br/><br/>The Goat is the best actor. Bible Thumping Lots of it. Not a scary movie.<br/><br/>The R rating got my dander up for this one. That rating mixed with the spooky trailers had me hopeful. But 'The Witch' under delivered in just about every category. The trailer basically is scarier than the movie. There were some disturbing moments and couple jumpy parts. But outside of that, it is just not a scary, not even a little bit. I'd categorize this as more a drama sprinkled with suspense. Then add a dash of WTF, and a splash uneasiness moments and you have a Wrong Island Iced Tea. What it did capture very well is one family's struggles and how evil was able to divide their family bond and conquer the family unit by preying on their weaknesses and the weakened bond. Witches had an incredible amount of bible thumping going on, but being the story took place in the 1630s it seemed appropriate. So get ready to hear a bunch of ""thou"", ""thee"" and ""hither"" type speak and ton of biblical type scenes and references. A few times it took my brain a few seconds lag to decipher what was being said. This film did manage to keep an air of mystery, creepiness and interest through out the movie. The finer points were probably the direction and cinematography. I also get the feeling we could have did without seeing the Witch at all. The random, sporadic appearances of the actual witch did little to add value to this flick. The acting was so-so. That R-rating though. Them sneaky jerks. They snuck one in on me. How they managed that R- rating was by adding a couple lightly gory shots and a bizarre scene were a bunch of chicks were randomly twerking in the woods and chanting while naked. Outside of that this coulda been rated PG-13.<br/><br/>All in all, this was actually a good movie. But for all the wrong reasons, it's a blatant case of false advertising. If you like thrillers/suspense this would be a good one to check out. But horror and scary you are looking for? Move along, there is nothing to see here <br/><br/>And for that I am giving The Witch 2.5 EBTs."

","Witches in the 1630s were not 2016 modern gaia loving pagans who worship the earth. Witches *from a 1630s Puritan perspective* made pacts with the devil, drank blood, cursed and killed and this type of hysteria & paranoia is the premises of this film. It's a slow to burn, cerebral movie like The Shining, or Suspiria. But in this day and age of stimulation overload, and film goers who laugh at jerking off jokes, The Vvitch will no doubt be reviewed by some as ""boring""..sorry, there are no jump scares, no stupid one liners, this movie makes you think and feel everything. This piece of art was absolutely dark, unnerving, extremely disturbing and completely amazing. It is fantastically made and beautifully executed right down to the soundtrack which is every bit unsettling, containing no more than single string and faint wailing noises. This is the type of horror movie I've been waiting a very long time to see."

","My review is going to be about the content of the movie and not the movie itself example: acting, filming, sets etc.<br/><br/>The family of William and Katherine was banished from society. We are not told why they are but the movie is based on their survival in the woods.<br/><br/>The reason they were banished is because the daughter was into witch craft and bad luck was plaguing the people. That is why they were banished.<br/><br/>If anyone here knows anything about the occult you will know why the baby at the start was murdered. The occult is a counterfeit religion of Christianity. The death of the baby was a satanic ritual used to satiate the desire of Demons. This is a copy cat death of Christ.<br/><br/>Leviticus 18:21 Thou shalt not give of the seed (family) to offer it unto Moloch (the Devil), that thou defile not the name of thy god, for I am the Lord.<br/><br/>Let there not be found among you that makes his son or daughter to go through the fire, or that uses witchcraft, or a chooser out of days or that regards the flying of fouls, --<br/><br/>The family are obviously Calvinists. They believe in the doctrine of Jean Calvin and that is a false doctrine. They memories prayer and chant mantras for safety. They obey the bible and not God in hope their souls are saved.<br/><br/>How ever in the woods, the small boy clearly admits that his sins are not forgiven which proves the religion is vain.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The Goats used in the film are obviously used for demonic symbolism and not the benefit of the family. The crops fail and the goat produces bloody milk. These signs are all signs of the use of witch craft.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Witches and Witch craft is not reserved for a small period of human history around the 1600's. Wit craft is an actions reserved for Witches and Wizards. It is the method used by humans to commune with fallen angels. Thomasin conjures up her Demon at the end of the movie and it talks to her. It offers her prosperity which is exactly what Satan offered Christ.<br/><br/>Just about all the movies Holly Wood produces are filled with the ritualistic and satanic symbolism and is it no surprise these celebrities live deliciously? Not just the movie industry but the music industry also.<br/><br/>If you find it hard to believe that the craft of this movie is still conducted to this day I urge you to research someone like Charles Manson and learn that he to was using witch craft.<br/><br/>This movie is basically a $3,500,000 lesson on how to become a witch or wizard.<br/><br/>Exodus 22<br/><br/>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."

","The Pilgrim Fathers have set up shop, but devout William falls out with them and sets up a homestead miles away with his wife and 6 kids, going from teenager Thomasin down to a baby. But a couple of the kids disappear, and others are at odds with each over as to who is a witch and how witchcraft is affecting the family. Since the family all believes very strongly in witchcraft, this has a major bearing on relationships within the family.<br/><br/>It almost doesn't matter whether the witchcraft here is real or not: what matters is what happens to the family, and I'm certainly not going to spoiler whether the goat really is the devil, or whether Caleb really does fall foul of a witch, or whether it is all mind tricks and excessive devoutness. To do that would spoil what little enjoyment you might get from this film.<br/><br/>Because this ponderous movie takes itself very seriously indeed. The dialogue is archaic and delivered in Yorkshire accents, and is often very difficult to follow. The images are carefully composed and captured on film, and give a convincing impression of how hard, drab and dark life must have been. Yes, there is a slowly building sense of an awful fate in the offing, but the emphasis here is on ""slowly"", and the starting point is pretty depressing to start off with.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the performances are all excellent and great effort has been put into what the film looks like. It just isn't very entertaining."
"kimheniadis","9","2","8","21 March 2016"," A very thought provoking Horror Movie.
","My husband and I went to see this movie. I enjoyed it, he did not. I really like horror movies, he does not. Since this is what I would call a quiet horror movie (not lots of jump out scares or graphic violence), I thought for sure he would enjoy it.<br/><br/>I have always been fascinated by witches, and the time period around the Salem Witch Trials. Although this took place years before the trials, it was still interesting to watch. While there were horror moments, to me it had more to do with family dynamics and religion. Which to many people can be very horrific.<br/><br/>William does not believe that the village he and his family live in has strong enough religious beliefs. So he takes his family to live right on the edge of a creepy forest. This is when the secrets start coming out, slowly, building up the tension, and making for a very interesting ending.<br/><br/>There are a couple of secrets that if they would have been out in the open right away, the family would have fared much better, but then, there wouldn't have been a movie.<br/><br/>If you are planning on going to see the movie, and want to me surprised, don't read any farther.<br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>The subtle horror in this movie is amazing. Caleb is just beginning to have sexual thoughts, and his sister, Thomasin, is the only female of age, besides his mom. You can see him feeling horrible about having these thoughts about his sister. But since his father took them out of the village, there are no other females to project these thoughts onto. There's the underlying ideas of puberty, which is scary for anyone. Along with the possibility of incest.<br/><br/>Then when the baby is taken, the mother turns on her daughter. She tries not to at first, but when more strange things begin to happen, the whole family slowly starts to turn on each other. Besides the stolen baby, there are other secrets that are being kept, which just make the whole situation worse.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a slasher movie, or something with lots of scares that will make you jump, this movie will probably not be for you. But if you are looking for one with lots of subtext, and that will leave you with a creepy feeling long after you've finished watching, then I highly recommend this movie."
"bobhartshorn","10","2","8","29 February 2016"," The Bare Witch Project
","I approached this particular witch with caution. At first glance it appeared to be sharing DNA similar to that spooned from the same misfiring cauldron as two of my least favourite sub-genre outings of the past 15 years: M Night Shymalan's The Village and Ben Wheatley's A Field In England. The Buzz generated from early reviews & trailers promised the visual aesthetics of the former and theatrical bombastic lingo of the latter and I braced myself for another hyperbolic disappointment.<br/><br/>But I needn't have worried, as writer/director Robert Eggers debut effort delivers full on its promise with a slow burning historical tale of external evil manipulating internalised religious fervour to its ultimate sticky end.<br/><br/>The story involves a puritan family of seven ousted from the safety of their colony into a life of corn-crunching hardship in the fertile land of New England's past. But deep in the forest lurks an unspeakably malevolent force that wastes no time instigating a plan of destruction for its unsuspecting neighbours, and it isn't too long before finger pointing accusations of witchcraft begin and the ship of dread sets sail toward its unknowable, terrifying destination...<br/><br/>With more than a passing nod to lurid 70's classic Blood On Satan's Claw, Eggers' wicked 17th Century yarn is alarmingly brought to life by his informed ear for the period dialect and the remarkable DP work of his cameraman Janin Blaschke, whose lighting skills drain just enough colour from the landscape to make you believe we're right slap-back bang in the middle of pre-creature comforts 1630.<br/><br/>There's no shirking from the harsh day-to- day realities & tensions of these new/olde' puritans existence, but Eggers' screenplay never loses focus on their humanity as a real living, loving family unit either. As the dogmatic hubris of ingrained faith begins to tear them apart from within, the dynamics of the story stubbornly refuses to make snide, self-righteous judgements at their expense, so we always care about their survival even when it looks like things are heading to the point of no return. <br/><br/>Any whiff of archaic restraints imploding on the usage of Eggers' authentic dialogue is expertly staved off by a first-rate cast who deliver it with unforced conviction. Ralph Inesen and Kate Dickie as parents William and Katherine (respectively) are very fine indeed, but it's their brethren of offspring that steal the show with Harvey Scrimshaw's Caleb and star player Anya Taylor-Joy as Thomasin making the biggest splash via two of the most original and, not to mention, rudest sexual awakenings ever committed to a horror film.<br/><br/>And yes, The Witch is very much a horror film. Brooding atmosphere and disquieting menace take precedence over the urge to indulge the usual tired genre tropes, and the more conventionally minded patron seeking a roller-coaster broomstick ride might be put off by Eggers' steady, deliberate pacing. But when it's ready to get its hands dirty, out come the teeth and claws to reward your patience, not least by landing a jump scare I guarantee you will not see coming, but boy, will you feel it! This one isn't called The Witch for nothing.<br/><br/>Eggers' draws everything to a close via an orgasmic flash of perfectly timed delirium that, intentional or otherwise, hits a key visual beat from Logan's Run. The reference points don't stop there either as the eerier aspects of the iconic soundtracks for 2001 and The Shining are gleefully aped by composer Mark Korven's score. His music enhances the outlandish finale to such a spine tingling degree, you almost feel as though you've snuck a peek behind the magic curtain to witness one of the world's best kept secrets.<br/><br/>Voices of dissent have called out this ending as a step too far. But for me it's further proof of the movies balls and insurance against a branding from the dreaded 'Psychological Thriller' iron too. <br/><br/>The Witch is lean, mean and when it chooses to be, damn right nasty. By stepping back in time to the darkness of our past, Eggers' has sneaked the genre creeping and cackling into the 21st century with an entry to make you think twice about picnicking in the woods anytime soon. And to that, I raise a glass of bloody goat's milk. Cheers Phillip!"
"e_z_e-47370","4","2","8","23 February 2016"," Definitely Not For Everyone
","Going into this movie, I tried with everything I had to enjoy it. I was fully aware of the type of horror film it was, which I believe we need more of these days. Being scared by not seeing but feeling and not knowing what is the cause of the problems that arise. We fear what we do not know or understand. Going back to a time where if you were different than you were labeled as evil. I've always said that the perfect setting for a horror film would be the Salem Witch Trials. <br/><br/>With that being said, it felt as if something was missing throughout the film. Everyone was waiting for that moment of pure fear but it never came. A few intense scenes helped set it up, but there was never any payout or anything memorable.<br/><br/>I can appreciate wanting to keep this as authentic as possible with having the characters speak exactly how the Puritans spoke back then, but it was hard to follow for 2 hours. There were many times I found myself thinking ""I have no idea what the hell they're talking about."" Hats off to the cast for having to memorize those lines. <br/><br/>Don't go in expecting this to be anything close to the your typical horror film (which many in the theater failed to do.) I do not regret seeing it, but wished it had left more of an impression."
"hansolorulez","9","2","8","22 February 2016"," Not for simple minded viewers
","The response I've seen for this film is that people are expecting a simple, jump scare, gore filled, and conventional horror movie. I feel like the same people who are giving this film such bad reviews would really enjoy movies such as 'the brothers grimsby', a film I can only describe as being filled with slapstick and vulgar comedy that requires no thought from the audience.(based on the trailer and previous movies such as 'brüno' and 'borat' which are cut from the same cloth) Unlike those, this film requires you to really think and pay attention to whats going on. Not because of their accents and old way of speaking-this is a period film- but because what the actors are saying holds all the information to keep the plot going. If you miss whats being said, then you'll be lost. That being said, it's not without it's laughing moments, such as the twins leaning into black Philip and say ""baa baa baa"" or the way black Philip shows near human expressions (or the way he gallops away after killing). Although, I would have liked a little more involvement with the witch and maybe a little less rushed. Then again, it is based on folktales which aren't very long to begin with. What people need to understand is, this is more of a thriller than a horror film."
"StevePulaski","6","2","8","20 February 2016"," If Jesus couldn't save himself, what makes you think he's gonna save you?
","First-time writer/director Robert Eggers has had quite a ride with his debut film ""The Witch,"" earning the respect and endorsement from the Sundance Film Festival, the majority of American critics, and even the Satanic Church. His film is meant to be both an homage and an ode to New England folktales and fairy tales centering around witchcraft and the supernatural. Most of the film's dialog and structure came from folktales from over two-hundred years ago, as stated in the film's end credits, and the look and feel of the film is remarkably 17th century, right down to the environments Eggers utilizes.<br/><br/>If nothing else, ""The Witch"" is destined to be one of the most aesthetically refined and remarkable films of the year, let alone most beautifully shot horror film of the year. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke emphasizes the eeriness of the deep-wooded New England plantations, with precise focus on the location-swallowing fog and the overcast skies. As dreary and as miserable as the film looks, it's also immersive in the regard that it clearly plunges you into a different world; one you haven't been familiar with in horror films in quite sometime. Every year, we're almost guaranteed to get a Gothic-style, Victorian-era film that emphasizes lush scenery and immaculate cinematography, but rarely do the visual conventions of 17th century folk intersect with contemporary horror. In that respect, ""The Witch"" is a novel concept that sets itself up for noteworthiness on the basis of its locational possibilities alone.<br/><br/>Before I get any more carried away than I already have, the plot must be introduced. Set in the aforementioned century, the story revolves around a traditionalist, god-fearing family led by William (Ralph Ineson), the intensely religious patriarch. His family consists of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), his eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), his son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and his young twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson). The family leaves their old land to start a new life on a farm, where Katherine gives birth to her fifth child, which is subsequently abducted by a witch before being sacrificed.<br/><br/>This starts an unrelenting curse on this family that works to destroy it by going after its most innocent and helpless individuals, the children. Eventually, Caleb winds up becoming the witch's next victim, as a controlling and possessed spirit enters his body and begins to overtake him, all while the family is grieving over the loss of their newborn. Meanwhile, William and Katherine find themselves considering sending Thomasin into an arranged marriage now that she is becoming older, and seeing as she's proved herself in capable to take care of her younger siblings.<br/><br/>As one can see, ""The Witch"" is very much a family drama, with psychological and supernatural horror ingredients injected into the film's premise to add the unsettling undertones. Unfortunately, ""The Witch"" gets its atmosphere down to a tee so well that it forgets to make a story that's as creepy as it sets itself up to be, let alone moving or worthwhile. Despite such wonderful, gloomy settings, the film never becomes very creepy or interesting enough for audiences to care. Everything, from the characters' personalities to their religious guidance, feels within arm's reach of us, and while the authentic, period-specific dialog is a commendable element, it only works to further distance people from the film's themes.<br/><br/>This is truly a shame because I appreciate what ""The Witch"" sets up: a family rooted in deeply traditionalist, religious doctrine that is slowly finding out that Jesus, God, or any other kind of figure from their Bible cannot save them from the evil and sin that runs amok in the world. The idea that Jesus couldn't save himself is one that's hard enough to grasp, but what happens when one realizes that, because of that, he cannot save him or her either? William, played very well by Ineson, who goes for assertive and unnerving here, has the hardest time grappling with this idea as he watches his family crumble before his eyes.<br/><br/>With that being said, watching ""The Witch"" can be a frustrating experience just because of how lifeless it often is. The level of character interest doesn't come anywhere close to the interest level of the film's setting, and as a result, there's little to connect to or embrace. It wasn't until about the hour mark that I truly felt conflicted as a viewer; here's a film with a biting, interesting premise and themes that's weighed down, not only by its esoteric approach, but also by its lack of legitimate creepiness until the last twenty minutes.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" doesn't flatline entirely like ""The Forest"" or other horror films of recent years, particularly ones neutered in content and approach to attract a younger crowd, but it doesn't titillate or excite like ""It Follows"" or ""The Sacrament,"" both films with similar premises, strong themes, but far more accessible characters and consistently interesting setups. Some will claim my soft dislike for ""The Witch"" comes from my lack of tolerance for slowburn horror, but consistent readers of my work know I hold slowburn horror near and dear to my heart and vastly prefer it over the tropes that have become commonplace in contemporary, American horror. The problem with ""The Witch,"" at the end of it all, isn't its pace, it's the paces it takes in the wrong direction."
"ryanmark-57919","8","2","8","19 February 2016"," Very Unsettling but Well Put Together
","I think the best word to describe this movie is unsettling. The trailers hinted at just how unsettling the film would get but they barely scratched the surface of what was going to happen during the story. It's definitely a horror movie but it's unlike any other film I've seen in the genre before. There are parts where it seems like we're just watching a very intense drama but then the atmosphere kicks it up a notch and you're reminded that this is a really disturbing horror flick. The director is a guy named Robert Eggers who hasn't directed a whole lot just yet but I can't help but believe that he has a promising career ahead of him. Let's talk about the plot.<br/><br/>Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) and her family in 1630 New England are forced to leave their village because of a difference in religious beliefs. The family heads out into the woods to start a farm and worship the Lord in the way that Thomasin's parents (Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie) want them to. They're already having difficulties adjusting but things get even worse when the baby of the family goes missing. Unfortunately, this is just the first of many strange and horrible incidents that befall the family.<br/><br/>The cast does an absolutely phenomenal job and I have to give credit to Anya Taylor-Joy for carrying this movie as well as she does. She hasn't been in the acting game for very long but she already shows quite a bit of promise. Thomasin is a very ambiguous character since she obviously loves and obeys her parents the best she can but her situation is also stifling her. There are many reasons for this but the most obvious one is the deteriorating relationship with her mother. Speaking of the mother, Dickie gives a phenomenal performance as a loving but very strict woman when it comes to her children. I also can't forget Ineson's role as William. He comes off as a tough and hard man but he's afraid of letting his wife know about their true situation out in the woods.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that the movie excels at being unsettling. Well, there are a few reasons for this. First, the atmosphere out in the woods and around the farm is very claustrophobic and the it feels like there's never a good day around this place. It's always dank and it just feels miserable outside. The house and barn are both small and quite a few scenes take place with all of the characters scrunched together with barely any light to speak of. The film also lets you know right off the bat just how cruelly it's willing to treat its characters about eight minutes in.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed was how it dealt with the titular Witch. We only see the Witch a handful of times during the course of the story but it's obvious that this is a downright evil and sadistic character. We the audience know of the Witch's existence long before any of the other characters do and it makes what the family is going through all the more painful. The Witch is dangerous but the family starts tearing itself apart with accusations and a complete lack of trust. This is best shown in the way Thomasin and her mother interact with one another but Thomasin also has problems with some of her younger siblings. We slowly start to learn that this distrust is part of a larger plot but it definitely leaves you wondering what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film but it's definitely not the type of thing that leaves you smiling when you exit the theater. Horror fans will probably appreciate an excellent addition to the genre and even fans of period pieces will probably like the look at the past that the movie offers. However, this film definitely won't be for everyone. I found it disturbing and I have a pretty high resistance to this kind of stuff. I recommend it just because of how scary and well put together everything is but make sure you're actually in the mood for something downright disturbing and unsettling."

","I've not seen a film like this in decades. A throwback to a CGI-less era where special effects were minimal, the story well written and performances weren't phoned in for the paycheck. This film doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or loud music to trick the audience into scaring. In fact it relies mainly on tension and the paranoia that eventually overwhelms this New England story. I sat in a theatre in the afternoon with about 30 people. A group left 20 minutes before the story unravelled to a satisfying conclusion (their loss). The performances here are all spectacular, the cast made their roles appear utterly believable. Extra credit is due to the promising young actress Anya Taylor-Joy who stands out above a stellar cast. During the showing there no screams or gasps, just positive comments when the credits rolled. Already this film has found an audience, but I think it's the sort of film to grow ever popular over the next decade or so, possibly even studied. If you like your horrors dripping in guts, gore and profanity, then stay away. This is for fans of the old school horror films, reminiscent of the 70's horror classics."

","Legitimately terrifying horror film set in 1630s. A family banished from regular society makes their humble home at the edge of the deep woods. They are on the brink of starvation, with their decimated crop, but they have more immediate problems when their youngest baby is kidnapped by something from the woods. The remaining children (a teenage girl (played by the terrific Anya Taylor-Joy), a slightly younger teen boy, and two creepy twins who seem to be best friends with their pet goat) are threatened by their parents' grief and religious fervor (the parents are well played by Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie). First off, the film is just gorgeous to look at. Eggers has done marvels with the details of this film, and based the period-appropriate dialogue on actual writings of the time. I also have to thank any director making a film like this who's obviously seen and loved Benjamin Christensen's Haxan. I am not 100% sure what I feel about the ending of the film - it's either a bit too little or a bit too much. It's most certainly one of the best horror films of recent years."

Because they see a lot of films, and get tired easier from the same gimmicks than the movie goers. sometimes critics are unfair yes, but on other times the problem is there are a lot of reviews made by people that are not expecting that horror films can be like this.<br/><br/>so yeah, if i was 16 years old and thought insidious was an awesome horror film i probably wouldn't like this one (i actually think insidious is good, but way more standarized than this - and my favor horror subgenre is by far slashers) because it's very different. this is almost author cinema made in the horror field. because yes this movie can be scary - mostly by what you don't see. by the music, by the ambiance around the forest, by the cinematography...even by the language they're talking.<br/><br/>this is supposed to be a fairytale an horror tale that took place in the 17th century, a tale that you tell to young people to scary them amidst a campfire in the woods . this movie has all the elements of a traditional folktale and should be regarded as such. maintaining that speech was a very clever move, because it makes us travel easier back then, a time where pretty much people feared everything - and this family feels cursed right from the beggining. that fear is pretty much everywhere in the movie.<br/><br/>and yet the horror elements prevail: the idea something ""is hiding"", the fact that ""everybody is a suspect"", or saying ""ill be back"" might cost you. it's a tale made with the horror rulebook on point that wants to follow it. just its own way. i liked the ending by the way, where i think the truth is explained. and i really enjoyed to follow the deep suspicions of this family around themselves while something terrifying might be hiding close to them.<br/><br/>just please don't expect this movie to be a mainstream horror film. it's not. it has someone with a fingerprint, and only eggers could have done this, no one else.

","An unnerving piece, focusing in on self-imposed isolation emerging from a desire to be doctrinally pure. The film ostensibly builds on how a family, moving themselves away from the Pilgrim community with whom they entered the New World at the behest of a devout and driven father, begin to develop paranoid notions regarding their fate, both related to their abandonment by God and the influence of darker forces. The pacing of all this is done incredibly well and the acting compelling, especially the younger actors, who I feared were verging on being traumatised such was their commitment. If anything, the ending let's the building tension down little, giving as it does an unequivocal answer to the central concerns being presented throughout. I did wonder if leaving everything ambiguous might have been a bolder approach. As it is, arguably what is presented as explanation lets certain family members' perspectives off the hook somewhat."

The actors do give it their all, as dull as the script may be, with Anna-Taylor Joy being the obvious standout. In the end, The Witch feels like a better film that could have been than it was. It makes for some chilling moments, but doesn't have enough substance or scares to truly grab your attention, or enough story to satisfy.

"andrewroy-04316","7","1","3","10 July 2019"," Tense and atmospheric, The Witch is a period piece that inhabits the ideas of the time, for better or worse
","The Witch is a slow burn that pays off with a shocking but gratifying ending. Prioritizing a clear establishment of family dynamics and religious ideas over plot machinations, Eggers creates a movie that is challenging both to watch and stop thinking about. Taylor-Joy is as excellent in the lead as I would hope, and the cinematography and music really put the audience in a creepy, anything can happen mental space fitting for the witch-fearing setting. The primary focus is on Thomasin's development, as she is used or mistrusted by all of her family. The fear of witches does make it clear how people are eager to find a scapegoat and how the family falls apart so quickly as bad things start to happen. The ending where the goat talks and she goes to join the witches was extremely well done - she had played her part as a proper daughter and everything went wrong, so when she is finally free of obligations with her parents dead, she decides to see what lies on the other side. It's a dark movie and leaves plenty of questions unanswered and open to interpretation - what exactly happened to Caleb? Did the mom or the twins do anything wrong? Are the Satan people/creatures real, imagined, or inhabited by his spirit? As a story of Thomasin's development and family struggles in the time period, it's a good one, but so much of the evil is uncertain. That may be an intentional choice - nobody knew anything or had more than suspicions and fears in the 17th century, so this is a folktale playing off those ideas. It succeeds in its main focuses and brings that dark, heavy atmosphere in spades."

"oratiosanctus","7","1","3","7 October 2018"," A slow-burner that will work for some, but not all
","I recently watched The VVitch for the first time, after having heard great things about it for some time. Albeit, this was a very unusual film, and one that I grappled with for a little while to reach a conclusive idea of my final thoughts towards it. As the directorial debut of Robert Eggers, The VVitch (as it is stylised in the promotional material) is a film that germinates in your mind and leaves a stronger lasting impression days after watching more than it leaves an immediate one.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of subtlety that is utilised in this movie, and it is from the age-old concept of the 'fear of the unknown' that the film finds its niche. However, where the film has and will likely continue to divide some audiences is in its presentation. This was a remarkably bleak looking film, full of greys and darker tones; with not a skerric of any real colour to be found. By design, it is a washed-out looking movie. Set in the 17th century with a recently banished lone Puritan family at its centre, the movie is meant to present the hardships and blandness of that era and it does so by its choice of colour palette. The use of Early Modern English in the dialogue is another talking point. The use of this style of language will be jarring to some but it works effectively enough in the context of the film's setting, and apparently, at times was plucked word-for-word from local journals recovered from that period. While each member of the cast does a great job making it feel genuine, there are moments where it feels as if the archaic dialogue gets in the way of plot and character progression.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of a slow burn, having more in common with The Babadook than The Conjuring. Anya Taylor-Joy turns out a wonderful performance and is convincing in her role as the family's eldest child, who questions her existence as the family question their faith. This is a difficult film to recommend and is an atypical horror film, designed to creep under your skin than to shock outright. It is one more in line with those from the turn of the century."
"tlou-32728","2","1","3","24 September 2018"," A disappointment with no point.
","I didn't care for it.The actors that played the main family were OK but there did not seem to be much point to the tale. It did not seem scary to me but they used sounds to warn you when it was supposed to. I only gave it 2 stars since it wasn't the actors fault that it was not a good movie."
"englmustl","10","1","3","21 September 2018"," So uncommonly good that this review will be shared to social media!
","I am not at all a horror film person, so I found it very odd that Holy Spirit seem to kept saying that this one was for me.<br/><br/>I would caution that practicing an active life of faith, especially in the name of Jesus Christ, would likely make this movie more appealing; however, it isn't necessary to hold any particular beliefs to still enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Those who have come to rely on the sensationalism of Hollywood--blood and gore and overly graphic language--to inform them of how they should feel during a story might find the action sequences of this movie too few and far between the dialogue sequences, which is mostly prayer language and ominous music.<br/><br/>I'm only half-joking when I say that captions translating the spoken language from Puritan English into contemporary English would be helpful for many.<br/><br/>More importantly, I apologize, but I need to get on my soapbox for a second:
 What I love most about this movie is the understated way that it portrays the effects of witchcraft. Yes there are some graphic scenes and some horrifically creepy s***. But, you don't see any angels or demons flying around. And where, in a movie like Harry Potter, a curse would appear as a viscous jet of fiery plasma/lightning, all you see here is writhing on the floor in agony, crying out to God, with no visible clue as to what's going on. Guys, that's exactly how witchcraft works in the real world. No matter what you've been told about God and Jesus and the Bible, whether you've ever given a thought to spiritual warfare or not, it's all real. But almost none of it looks like something that most of us would want to pay good money to go see at the movies. I don't remember who said ""the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist,"" but it's true.<br/><br/>Fortunately, unlike the special effects, Dumbledore uttered some words that were very true: ""words are our most inexhaustible form of magic.""
The Apostle Paul puts it a little differently, ""for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but are mighty for the pulling down of strongholds. We demolish debates and any high-minded thing that would exalt itself above knowledge of God, taking every thought captive in obedience to Christ"" - 2 Corinthians 10:4-5"

I can't figure out what could steal a baby that quick. Conviently, the following scene alerts me, and I can safely blame a witch. <br/><br/>Start suspending all disbelief at that point.<br/><br/>Oh, and some reviewers say the movie represents the ugly nature of religious fanaticism, but ... there's a witch people. Come on, now.<br/><br/>This movie is not a feminist movie. Otherwise, the witch wouldn't be a pure evil villain. And a goat wouldn't steal the show. The witch doesn't get any respect as a woman or a villain.<br/><br/>This is not a psychological thriller, because the witch is real. The family argues and prays a lot. They live a subsistence farming lifestyle. In that situation, plenty of families turn abusive. It's not psychologically thrilling, it's just normal. So the story again, is a simple historical drama.<br/><br/>With a couple weird scenes to signal the end of the movie. And then 5 more minutes of weird scenes. And then the movie is truly over.<br/><br/>One of the character deaths made me laugh.<br/><br/>I give the movie 3/10 for the camera work, the historical research, and the character death, which humored me quite a bit. It loses 7 points because the movie does not pay attention to its audience. Not enough people are fanatics who will have nightmares over the material."

Instead, we get a handwoven basket chock full o' stereotypes: the mother of the family is only a mother, and her only contribution to the storyline is her overused, stereotypical obsession with a dead infant. Because moms don't have any character of their own ya know? They just make babies. That's all. And when the babies are gone they basically implode.<br/><br/>The other female lead is a nasty old witch that steals babies from respectable moms. The dad's an incredulous gruff alpha male that barely tolerates all the whiny (as in, high pitched shrill wibbling that has no content, just expresses a kind of animal hysteria) antics of the women in the cast. Yuck. Why waste such incredible style on such predictable, stale characters? <br/><br/>the story's set in the 16th Century; that doesn't mean that we have to regress 400 years just to watch it, but that's exactly what the makers of The Witch seem to have done.

For those who rate it only 1 Star, they never watched the movie, watched only 15 minutes of it, or are the top of guy who loves to jerk off to gun magazines. They would rather see Saw, Saw 2, Saw 3, Saw 4, and so on. Only blood, gore and guts gets these trolls off. Perhaps if they watched it with an open mind, they would appreciate the beauty of this film.<br/><br/>This was never about the evil witch in the woods, this was about the cultural and familial pressures that cause an otherwise innocent and good Christian girl to turn bad. A witch may have killed some people she loves, but she isn't turning towards a new family of women or serving the witches, she's turning towards a life of serving herself. Now that she's alone, she can be free, and must do something to save herself. Rules did nothing for her, and now she will live without them. <br/><br/>This is a movie about how you make witches, and the woman on the movie posters and dvd case is not the witch coming from the woods to do harm, it's Thomasin walking into the dreaded wild, away from God, away from oppressive, controlling Puritan society, and away from the bitter, painful life of pioneers and colonists that has won her nothing but loneliness, hunger, and abuse. The movie closes on her ecstatic face as she literally defies the rule of gravity, for the first time totally, completely free."

There are no Native Americans in 1630 New England.<br/><br/>The daughter is coming of age and the son eyes her, although that doesn't seem to be an issue.

Everything about this movie is on point and well made, it succeeds in everything it wants to be - the main idea of the movie is quite original and it is brilliantly executed.<br/><br/>What I meant by ""mind your expectations"" is that some people might watch the movie expecting to see a gore-fest and an insane witch terrorizing people, but that isn't the case. The witch's character is so well-built and written - she's not your typical horror movie monster going about killing off people, on the contrary - we rarely get to see her and she's basically a part of the terrifying atmosphere, we don't see her but, we're still afraid of her and so are the characters.

","I'll open my review by saying that I suspect that majority of the reviews here are fake means: they are ordered by the studio staff/owners, which is easy to do that today, all social medias, and those could be also friends and family members, you know, it happens all the time. now back to the main thing, the review: I will start by the positive because it's easier, shorter and it's better that I be calm when I write this while I already warmed myself above, but now am a bit relaxed because I said what makes me feel good, what I liked in this movie is the acting only, the actors were really very professional, both the adults and the little kids, all did their job in professional way and convincing, that's it. the sound-FX's were also fine, the the choirs are nice but a little bit over-used, it would be nice if there was a variety of choirs, not the same thing the whole movie because this produces boredom that I will talk about soon in this review. the accent was very heavy , but I think that it's relevant for the kind of this movie (it's origin/folklore) so I can't complain a lot, or I can complain but, I'll not blame the producers for that, it's simply me who can't handle 90 minutes such an accent, so be aware of that, it might let you feel heavy and tired. for sure they couldn't use accent of new-age Hollywood movies because then it wouldn't make sense for a movie that was done in England (or related to England) , so again, that was done because of production/story need , but today many people will complain for that , including those who wrote the fake positive reviews. so, now back to the boring issue. the movie has no characters except of the same family members, but with focus on the father (he talks a lot and very heavy, including his voice, low-notes and noisy) as someone who is a heavy-smoker (if you know what I mean), the general vibe of the movie isn't horror, but rather, a family that struggles to find a way to provide food for itself, so the father and kids try to hunt for food, later on the kids are dead at the farm (you don't see how) except of one of them, the elder sister, which is suspected to be a witch , her parents later die too, the father is hit by his goat, and the girl kills her mother when her mother tried to hit her so as self defense she used a knife, and that's it , that's all the movie, no serious horror that makes feel insane suspense. there are only few scenes of suspense when the father and his kids go to hunting in the forest, but only 2-3 scenes, nothing serious. it's not a classic Hollywood horror, but a normal folklore movie from UK.<br/><br/>I rate it 5 , 10 for actors, 5 for rest."
"DBLurker","6","1","3","10 April 2017"," Thy movie suffers as thine ending sucketh..
","First things first. Without doubt, one of THE best opening scenes introducing the ""big bad"" (the Witch) and setting the tone for a horror movie. Hell, the movie is worth seeing just for the introduction the Witch gets.<br/><br/>Now comes the part where the movie messes it up. It takes way too long showing an uninteresting puritan family's daily banter, which you most likely will have trouble understanding because thy speech is olde and rotten.<br/><br/>Which means that you have to listen to them pray every time somebody drops the spoon or thinks they sinned or something (which is pretty much all the time). It added to the charm at first, but after half an hour, it got old and annoying.<br/><br/>But the movie has another trick up its sleeves. The forest. That's right, the movie starts with the foreboding forest as the backdrop for the puritan family and presents it as a dark entity where only evil lives (why anyone would want to build a home next to it is a mystery, I sure wouldn't, I've seen Blair Witch :P). The scenes which are shot inside the forest are really well done with creepiness meter definitely on the edge constantly.<br/><br/>Now comes the part where movie decides to ruin it all, again, but showing the typical moronic ending the movies with witches have. Manages to kill any suspense anything the viewer might have imagined, by showing a generic portrayal of witches. I know they were trying to be authentic to the beliefs of the people at the time, but they REALLY could've used something original and creepy. I am trying to avoid mentioning anything that would give the ending away, that's why this para is vague.<br/><br/>I took of two points just cause of the last 10-15 mins which basically ruins any suspense or hope you had built up till then.<br/><br/>BUT, is it a must watch movie? I didn't get scared, I only find psychological horror (Blair Witch) scary and this movie is not a psychological horror movie. In-fact, it shows you the monster in the beginning and avoids jump scares (there are only few and they are toned down as well) religiously. What this movie does well is the creepy atmosphere, which I haven't seen done since I saw Blair Witch as a kid one sunny afternoon.<br/><br/>So yes, it's a movie you should definitely watch, despite my 6/10 rating. It would've been 8/10 with a better ending mimicking Blair Witch tone. Oh well."
"zkonedog","10","1","3","25 February 2017"," Sometimes The Best Horror Is Subtle
","While being touted as a ""horror flick"", ""The Witch"" only shares that designation in the sense that the events depicted within it can be quite unsettling. It is nowhere near, however, the type of movie that most theater-goers these days would consider ""horror"". It has nothing in common with, say, ""Paranormal Activity"", which uses jump-scares to produce its frights. No, ""The Witch"" is a much more subtle type of scary, the type that unspools with each minute as you begin to gain a deeper understanding of how colonial Americans dealt with such terror.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Witch"" tells the story of a family in 1630s New England. Father William (Ralph Ineson) has a major falling-out with the religious community in his village, forcing him to be excommunicated and banished to the wilderness lands where he must begin a new life with wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), prepubescent daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), well- meaning son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), as well as the young twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson). There is also an infant boy in tow, who quickly disappears near the edge of the forest. The family suspects witchcraft, but is there really paranormal activity afoot? Also, suspicions are raised that perhaps Thomasin herself knows more than she is letting on.<br/><br/>There are many deep and interesting themes in ""The Witch"", which automatically make it quite a bit more sophisticated than most stock horror fare these days. One major theme is how big of a role religion plays in the life of the family. Despite (or perhaps because of?) their devout Christianity, the mother and father are quick to pin the blame on such a nebulous concept as witchcraft. In today's society, where religion is often more of a ""commodity"" to be used when needed, it is a very interesting history lesson, of sorts, to see how religion used to be a major part of every activity in a family's day-to-day life.<br/><br/>Another interesting theme centers on familial relationships. The mother and father are constantly at odds about how to live their lives, especially with Thomasin just coming into her womanhood and brother Caleb's not-so-subtle noticing of that very fact. Even the little twins, who seem as innocent as can be, manage to rile up a family goat (named ""Black Phillip"") and are quick to point fingers (as children are wont to do) at a sibling's transgressions. It's a potent family mix that only becomes more combustible when the overriding religious concepts are thrown into the fray.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strongest suit of ""The Witch"", however, is its simmering and building of tension. It's almost like a throwback to the Alfred Hitchcock style of directing, where the suspense is given more screen time than the ""big reveal"". Whereas horror fans are used to being jump-scared out of their seats, ""The Witch"" again and again takes you just to the point of terror and then backs off. It really is masterful directing from Robert Eggers.<br/><br/>Now, I won't get too spoiler-ish here, but the ending of the film is going to rub people the wrong way. What I will say, though, is that a key to understanding this movie is to realize that it was constructed from the actual journals, writings, and other documents of New Englanders from that time period. It tries to be as authentic as possible in that vein, which obviously makes it difficult to construct a narrative around which contemporary audiences will understand and appreciate. Eggers does the best he can in doing this, but this requires the ending to be more ""oblique"" than ""final"". After some reflection and thought, I was okay with how it ended.<br/><br/>So, I think that those two words--""reflection"" & ""thought""--really are the key to appreciating ""The Witch"". If you are expecting one of those movies where every few minutes the tension builds and something jumps out, you'll likely leave disappointed. Instead, in typical A24 production company fashion, the real horror of ""The Witch"" probably comes as much after you leave the theater and begin to process what you just saw. The combination of fanatical religion, 1600s family dynamics, and the ever-potential presence of the supernatural will give you plenty to think about for days afterward."
"RussHog","6","1","3","17 December 2016"," This movie is ""Ye olde stupid!""
","It seems that somebody in the elite artistic community wanted to launch a new type of horror movie - and so they made a historic horror movie. What would happen if a horror movie took place in a historic period of time before modern audiences - such as the woods of Salem in the colonial era? Where - there may or may not - be a witch. <br/><br/>The film is partly a historical look at life in this time period - and to make the historic elements seem real the movie is filmed without artificial light - just natural sunlight and candlelight. The dialogue is written from the time period - and that is pretty cool at first but it gets hard to manage as the film goes on. <br/><br/>However - the witch portion of the film (the most important part) goes from brilliant to less than masterful. Apparently you need to be well versed in the lore of the Salem witches - and in fairness I am not.<br/><br/>It seems there is a witch in the woods and I guess the witches want the heroine of the film to join them? Something to do with Satan and a chicken and a goat. I think that either the film needed to really explain the rules of the world of the witch or use more of the witches - but there was a huge gap in communication between the story and the audience that felt vexing. <br/><br/>A horror movie - by and large - if it is going to be successful - needs to have a scare that is viable to a majority of people and a premise that is marketable. Jaws makes us scared of water - and the shark is a cool monster. Paranormal Activity make us scared of our house after dark. Freddy make us scared to go to sleep. Michael Meyers reminds us that the boogie man is real. <br/><br/>Most of us do not have a viable connection to a Salem Witch - so it is hard for most of us to understand or care about that. But this film did make it into theaters with a small budget and it did generate enough sales to warrant it a big success so congratulations to those involved - and I am sure the next film from this filmmakers will be more viable to more audiences."

","Witch is a different horror movie - not for everybody.<br/><br/>This movie is authentic and well made / produced. There is a mysterious atmosphere in the wild woods to say the least. The story may be interpreted differently - as a horror movie or a description of what people believed back then. However, it's a bit boring and slow - and a bit too depressive. <br/><br/>It is like an intelligent version of the Blair With project - but you need to be patient in order appreciate it. <br/><br/>That said, I believe there is a lot of potential in this way of making movies.

","I'm a history buff and a lover of a story well told. This story, The Witch, knocked me out with it's incredible depth of historical and cultural accuracy, the earnest and believable characters, and the extraordinary belief system that they held on to as a psychic buffer in the face of such risk and courage.<br/><br/>The director wisely chose relatively unknown actors to give the story an almost documentary subtext. But the actors were all sublimely believable and wonderful to observe.<br/><br/>I worry that the way the movie is promoted as horror, witchcraft and possession will keep some away from experiencing this masterful creation. I'd simply characterize the film differently: A psychological thriller based on how the people of the time would interpret what's happening around them in the world. A true New England folktale, as it's tag line properly declares.<br/><br/>The Witch is the best depiction of the early Puritan culture and challenges I've ever seen. I will watch again soon to absorb more of the rich details the director, designers, production crew and actors created.<br/><br/>Bravo."
"Coventry","6","1","3","27 September 2016"," Danger! Evil-staring Lagomorphs
","I got intrigued by the premise of ""The Witch"", like many others with me I presume, because it's allegedly based on authentic writings and immigrant stories from the actual era in which it takes place; namely New England in the 17th Century! Far too few horror stories take place in the Middle-Ages, if you ask me, and - at least to my recollection - the existing ones are only loosely inspired on contemporary historical milestones, like the several interpretations of the infamous Salem witch trials in 1692. The tale of ""The Witch"" is situated much earlier in that same dark century – in the year 1630 - and focuses on a family that gets banished to the far edge of the community, to a farm right next to an ominous forest, where they gradually get confronted with occult occurrences, so the least you can say about the concept is that it is original. The first reviews that I read on the internet or in specialized magazines were also very stimulating, as they practically unanimously agreed that ""The Witch"" is indescribably atmospheric and petrifying. Having seen the film now, I can definitely concur  ""The Witch"" is most certainly a unique experience when it comes to eerie atmosphere. Literally from start to finish, writer/director Robert Eggers creates a gloomy and foreboding ambiance that makes you uncomfortable and keeps you on the edge of your seat, even when there's basically nothing happening at all. The slow pacing, integer character drawings, bleak performances and silent but sinister extended shots of the forest and treetops all contribute enormously to the mounting of the tension, but there was one element in particular that personally struck me as ultimately macabre and innovative. Robert Eggers and his obviously multi-talented cinematographer Jarin Blaschke excel in filming ordinary animals but simultaneously making them come across as extremely menacing and even pure evil, like the goat – Black Philip – but especially also the uncannily staring hare! Can you imagine After literally having seen and reviewed thousands of horror movies, I honestly never had thought that I would get uncomfortable from looking straight into the penetrating eyes of a  rabbit! Unfortunately, the atmosphere and these unique peaks of suspense are the only true strongpoints of ""The Witch"" (apart maybe also from the solid performances). The plot, even though compelling and full of potential, is too thin while the continuous biblical speeches & dialogs are somewhat unnerving (although I surely reckon that the religious overtone is inseparably linked to the era). Since even the tense atmosphere is something you get used to quite rapidly, the lack of an actual plot and narrative structure causes the film to become soporific. To simply label ""The Witch"" as a period horror piece would also be unjust, as it much more qualifies as a harrowing drama, particularly during the many scenes where the family loses another child or gets torn apart due to (false?) witchcraft accusations. Being a father of a newborn child myself, the sudden and inexplicably mysterious disappearance of baby Samuel had a more than nightmarish effect on me. All this and more (style, casting choices, period recreation ) to at least ensure us that Robert Eggers is a promising and out-of-the-ordinary young director to keep an eye on! That same goes for the naturally beautiful and gifted young actress Anya Taylor-Joy."
"modernmonstersdotnet","6","1","3","21 September 2016"," Woulst Thou Like To Live Deliciously?
","The Witch is an ambitious movie, it's dialogue all in Olde English, yet it does not bring home the proverbial bacon. It is nevertheless driven by a vision, it is pretty well made and puts on the radar some awesomely gifted child actors. Set in 17th century New England, it deploys the drama of a community confronted with a brave new world, left to the devices of their puritan roots to make sense of it, and eventually conquer it. Problem is, some collateral damage is unavoidable.<br/><br/>Meet the Family, it does not have a name; they are an allegory of whatever can go wrong when America, land of the free, home of the brave, retracts into a witch hunt. McCarthy, neo-cons, whatever will happen next. Father (Ralph Ineson, whose gravelly voice is a third of the pleasure watching this movie), is banished from his community because he's too much of an integrist, even though he's a loving husband and father. He, his wife (Kate Dickie) and their five children are left to ""conquer this wilderness"" during an hostile season.<br/><br/>Things quickly unravel from there, in a weird mix of The White Ribbon and Barry Lyndon, with some John Constable painting and a dash of Caravaggio being poured in the mix. Tomasin, the titular witch, anoints herself so to get rid of her younger siblings' annoyance and it uncoils a death trap fueled by ignorance, superstition and bigotry.<br/><br/>Various animals intervene as God's will, or the Devil's. There is an evil hare, an even more evil raven, a hapless dog, and Black Phillip, a goat with a mellifluous voice, or so hear poor Tomasin, the unlikely heroin of the piece (Anya Taylor-Joy, wonderful). Then it goes like a country song, losing the last born, the harvest, the trust of your beloved ones, the horse, the wife, more children, your life.<br/><br/>Everything is blamed on possibly evil, menstruating Tomasin, including the death of her brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw, nothing short of astonishing), who meets the witch, maybe, in a spooky scene with awful consequences. Everyone dies in retribution from animals associated with the Devil, but Mother, so mad by now she attempts at strangling Tomasin. ""You reek of Evil"", she yells at who was her beloved daughter a few days prior.<br/><br/>One won't say how it ends. More ethnology than witchcraft, more puritan hysteria in the vein of The Crucible or The Devils than, say, Ouija 2, The Witch is a meticulously planned, meticulously filmed object of not so much fascination. It is quite good though, and its acting is superlative. Viewing advised."
"dworldeater","8","1","3","21 July 2016"," Hail the goat!
","I really dig this movie and have found The Witch to be very authentic and well done period horror that brings these morbid tales of New England folklore to life. The Witch is a very serious minded production and pays meticulous sense to detail from the sets, to wardrobe and to dialogue. It also has the right tone, psychology and atmosphere to deliver the creepiness and horror. The crumbling family dynamic is also a pivotal part of what makes this film relate able to audiences and have them encompassed in the story as well. Performances and direction are real strong and while The Witch may not suite all tastes, it is a solid and original horror story that delivers and one that I have grown fond of and truly appreciate."
"Screen_Blitz","7","1","3","19 June 2016"," Unnerving supernatural thriller with something more clever in mind
","For the past several decades, horror fans have grown fond of horror classics such as slashers, psychological thrillers, and supernatural thrillers dealing with characters batting against paranormal entities. Only a hand of full films of the genre are successful at balancing both cohesive character and plot development while carrying on an effective scare factor, even fewer achieve this feat as effective as this thriller directed by first-time filmmaker Robert Eggers. Rather than driving audiences into to straight-forward scare fest, this film centering on witchcraft as the primary antagonist, focuses on the eerie atmosphere and construction of the plot leading up to its shocking twist in the finale. The film is set during the 1630s, decades prior to the Salem Witch Trials, a period of prosecutions and executions of men and women who were accused of witchcraft. It follows William (played by Ralph Ineson) and Catherine (played by Kate Dickle), a devout Christian couple living in a isolated countryside of New England who value leading their five children into their following with God. When their infant son Samuel mysteriously vanishes and the crops began to deteriorate, the family begins to suspect one of them is cursed with witchcraft. As their fears and suspicions mount, the family find their lives terrorized by the demonic force.<br/><br/>This film is not the horror thriller many people come to expect, and instead has something more unique in mind rather than blowing up in your face with jump scares and sight scares that's become a common tool in many other films of this category. Relying heavily on visceral storytelling and character development, the film conveys it's scares by building up suspense through hints without feeling the need to fully reveal the occurrences but the aftermath of how the family is affected by witchcraft. When it's all done, the most of the scares come not from what the viewers know but what they don't know, along with an eerie, hair-raising music score by Mark Korven and a few shots of grim imagery. For most of the time, it's quite effective. Now the film moves at a fairly slow pace which is enough to bore those who lack patience, but in the end what results is creepy and intensely thought- provoking experience filled with engrossing performances by Ralph Enison, Kate Dickie, and Anya Taylor-Joy who plays the eldest daughter. Even the younger children make advantage of their time to shine. As Christianity and witchcraft play prominent roles in the story, the film moves in profound directions that demands you for questions. The biggest mistake this film makes is assuming you have expert knowledge on witchcraft. Though the film succeeds on provoking thoughts in viewers, it occasionally falls victim into convoluted elements raft are either confusing or overly ambiguous, maybe both. There are plenty of scenes you leave scratching heads. At the same time, there is plenty of shock and creepiness, particularly the ending. <br/><br/>The Witch is both a creepy and deeply visceral experience uprooted by an intelligent direction by Robert Eggers. Though it has some flaws, this film works at a fairly solid level and by the next decade, has a fair potential of going down as a cult classic. It is a unique experience that values more thought-provoking themes than typical jump scares, and by the end, it's a thriller that demands for your attention, even if it doesn't attract those looking for a straight forward scare fest."

There were people, rabbits, horses, other dogs, goats, and many sounds. I liked watching the dog. I found the dialogue difficult to follow, not just because my comprehension of spoken English is limited to about 12 words, nor the archaic mode of the language used was hard to interpret, but because I think the audio was mixed poorly or whatever. Look, I'm a dog, and a mongrel at that. I have no idea about this sort of thing, but the voice tracks or what have you should not be tinny and muffled.

At the end you are left with multiple explanations to the same story and that makes the whole thing just confusing.<br/><br/>The story starts of with a family getting banished from a town and in hindsight this scene was to short and should have made a better build up from where they were coming from. Arriving at the place they were banished to the baby disappears and that point in the movie kept me puzzling the whole movie thru. In my mind that was just to impossible to phantom and made me think this must be a dream or hallucination or something.<br/><br/>I got more of these feelings throughout the film but a lot of other elements in this film were handled pretty well. The actors all performed well in difficult roles to play, especially with having to adapt to the time period.Also the production value was high and the director was dedicated to tell his story in his way.<br/><br/>This movie gets better if you know some of the back story which unfortunately isn't in this movie.I still think its a movie you should see but it counts a lot on interpretation from your side.If this would have been less in the movie I think it would be a better watch for a broader audience.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with a lot of tension and the dark tones of the movie often intensifies that,they took a bold approach and I like that,also,the goat was really scary.<br/><br/>The actress playing the oldest daughter was good and I'm curious to see in which movie she will be next and also the next project of the director.<br/><br/>Recommend it, but under the terms I mentioned before.<br/><br/>Your choice."

","While watching ""The Witch"", I felt that the movie had a deeper meaning that many people might not have been able to see. Much like ""The Babadook"", which highlighted the feelings of guilt and loss, ""The Witch"" showcased the effects of corruption. Each member of this devote religious family are all seduced by the Devil in different forms. Mercy and Jonas, the twins are the first to be corrupted.The two bring devastation and misery to their family by unknowingly inviting the Devil into their lives. In the form of Black Philip, the demon manages to befriend the youngest members of the family and uses their naivety and innocence against them, using them as pawns in his efforts to destroy this family. Next Caleb, the eldest boy is seduced by his own lust. Soon to be coming into his adolescence, Caleb begins to have an interest in girls, which is established when he constantly finds his eyes are drawn to his sisters chest. However, when he is confronted in the wood by a beautiful woman, he is awe stricken and can't help but give into temptation. After suffering the loss of her two children, it doesn't take much for the mother Katherine to willingly denounce her faith in the name of children. Seeing the faces of her deceased children brings her to her knees, and the need to be with them clouds her judgement and she gives herself over to the Devil. In stark contrast, the father William is the only member of his family to completely ward off all temptation and stands with his faith. Everyday he tries his best to provide for his family and does what her thinks is best to keep them safe, even if those means are somewhat drastic. In the end, he is confronted by Black Philip and is impaled by his horns and crushed to death by the firewood he had spent so long collecting for his family. And finally we have Thomasin, who's journey to the powers of evil is long and devastating. Left with nothing, no family, livelihood or faith, she comes to the devil on her knees asking for help. After removing her cloths, leaving behind all sense of vanity, conventions and her religion, she leaves her home and ventures into the forest under the guidance of the devil. There, she joins a coven of witches, chanting around a roaring bonfire, and there, she receives the first taste of power in her life and lifts into the air becoming that which she feared the most. A Witch. Though this mightn't have been the most polished and pristine evaluation, this was my personal interpretation of what the film was trying to establish. ""The Witch"" was truly an experience and a film that, I hope will become a staple in the horror genre."

Near a large, secluded forest, the family build a farm, there Katherine gives birth to a son, Samuel (twins Axtun Henry and Athan Conrad Dube). One day, Thomasin is playing peekaboo with Samuel, during which the baby suddenly vanishes without trace. It is revealed that a red-cloaked Witch (Bathsheba Garnett) has stolen the unbaptized Samuel, that night she kills him and uses his blood and fat to make a flying ointment. A devastated Katherine spends the next few days crying and praying, while William insists it was a wolf that took the baby away. Katherine forbids the children from going into the forest, but William takes Caleb into the woods to lay a trap to catch an animal for food. Caleb asks his father if Samuel's soul will go to Heaven, William disciplines Caleb for asking this question and later reveals to his son that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the missing cup, and implies that Thomasin was responsible for Samuel's vanishing. After the children go to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family. Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check the trap in the forest, she threatens to wake up their parents unless she goes with him. While walking in the woods, they spot a rabbit near the trap, suddenly the horse Bert panics and the dog Fowler promptly chases the rabbit, Caleb runs after them, while Thomasin is thrown off the horse and knocked unconscious. Caleb gets lost in the woods and stumbles upon the dog's disembowelled corpse, going deeper into the wood he comes across a hovel, a beautiful young woman (Sarah Stephens) emerges from it and seduces him. William finds Thomasin and takes her home, Katherine is angry at Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods, while William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's silver cup to save Thomasin. Caleb is found outside in the rain that night, naked and delirious from an unknown illness, when he wakes up next day, he vomits a bloody apple, Katherine believes this to be witchcraft, Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft, their older sister had previously teased them pretending she is a witch, so she retaliates and tells the parents that the twins were having conversations with Black Phillip, the black goat. In rage, William puts both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house, boarding it up, he plans to return to the plantation the next day. That night, the elderly and hideous witch enters naked into the stable and drinks milk from the goats, the twins and Thomasin are terrified. Katherine has a haunting vision Caleb holding Samuel, in it she takes the baby and breastfeeds him, this is fact a dream, it is a black raven pecking at her bare and bloody breast. William wakes up the next day to find the stable destroyed, the goat mutilated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin with blood on her hands. As Thomasin wakes up, the black goat starts charging at William, impaling him with one of his horns. The commotion wakes Katherine, she is unhinged and blames Thomasin for all the recent tragedies that have beset the family and tries to strangle her, in self-defence Thomasin kills her with a billhook. Alone, Thomasin enters the stable and urges Black Phillip to speak to her, the goat appears to ask her if she would like to ""live deliciously"", then transforms into a tall dark man. The figure orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears, she says she does not know how to sign her name so Black Phillip helps her to do so. Now naked, Thomasin follows Black Phillip, back in goat-form, into the forest, she sees a coven of witches holding a Witches' Sabbath around a bonfire. She joins the coven as they begin to levitate, laughing and convulsing, Thomasin goes catatonic, and ascends above the trees, disappearing into the darkness. Also starring Julian Richings as Governor and Daniel Chaudhry as the voice of Black Phillip. Taylor-Joy gives a terrific performance as the adolescent going through many emotions brought on by horrific incidents, Ineson often does TV voiceovers and is impressive as the put-upon father, and Dickie does well also. This is not necessarily a terrifying watch, there are no real jump scares, it is certainly tense, with some darkly strange moments, while the use of drab colouring, and the choral score by Mark Korven add to the atmosphere, and the themes of grief, suspicion and hysteria work well, it is a most interesting alternative kind of period supernatural horror. Very good!"

","This review might reveal some details of the story. <br/><br/>It is undeniably a good movie, but it fails as a horror one. And I don't mean that because of the lack of gore, it's because throughout the movie, you worry a lot more about the family drama rather than about the Witch herself, which would make it a drama with bits of suspense. <br/><br/>I guess we can all agree that a horror movie does not need any gore to be a good one, and sometimes suggested situations scare more than anything that could be shown. But creating too much expectation without delivering anything to the audience, turns the experience into a frustrating one, and at the end of the movie you feel like they owe you something. Don't watch this expecting a horror movie, you won't get one, not exactly."
"Ben-Hibburd","10","1","4","29 July 2017"," Rapid Fire Review of The Witch.
","This is going to be a quick review, usually I like to go more in-depth in my reviews, but everything that can be said about The Witch has been said. So these are my quick thoughts.<br/><br/>The Witch is a masterpiece. It's what true horror is all about, it has a fantastic story alongside amazing acting. the film is accompanied with a brilliant brooding atmosphere, that is filled with absolute dread, that seeps into your very bones. This for me is the best Horror film in the last twenty years. It's far beyond the offerings of today's 'Horror' the Blumhouse type jump scare, poorly edited assembly line of crap films.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film, is the audience, people tend to go into this film not understanding what type of film to expect. Most people I know thought it was going to be a Conjuring type film. It's so much more then that, this is the type of horror that belongs in the 1970s. Robert Eggers had full creative control to do what he wanted. You just don't get that sort of freedom today, and despite it being his debut feature he absolutely knocked it out of the park. The Witch is a far cry from the usual copy and paste, play it safe jump scare horror, which in my opinion isn't at all scary. This film reminded me of Horror classics like Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now and even Ken Russell's The Devils. Like those classics this is true horror that gets under your skin and stays there. The Witch is a wonderful piece of pure cinema!"
"basementbanter","7","1","4","11 May 2017"," The Movie That Made Me Terrified of Goats: The Witch
","I am a grown ass man who likes his steaks rare, whiskey straight, and gets beat up for fun. And this movie made me sleep with the lights on. Straight up I turned the lights off, laid down on the couch and almost immediately turned them back on. This movie made me feel like a little kid alone in the grocery store, at night, surrounded by werewolves. I will never look at a goat the same way ever again, and I will never, ever play peek-a-boo again. This is horror at its creepiest and best, but it is not for everyone. This movie is slow with few jump scares, and the dialogue is an old English that is hard to understand so you might want the subtitles on. If you can get by those bumps, then buckle yourself down for one hell of a creepy ride.<br/><br/>The movie is about a colonial family somewhere in New England in the 1630s. The family is exiled from the settlement for the fathers religious views, forcing them to move out into the wilderness on their own. They are able to set up a farm a few days ride from the settlement, and things seem to be going OK, but there is something horribly wrong with the farm, and the family. A missing child, a make shift exorcism, and many, many pull-out-your-hair tense scenes later and you reach the end of the marathon of scares. And holy sh*t I never want to be alone in the dark again. The ending is deeply horrifying and is a great pay off to the slowly building tension that has been ever-present throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>The star is the lead actress, who is on the rise after starring in this and in M. Night Shamalamadingdong's excellent Split. She plays the eldest child, at 14-16 years old. This will cause serious issues with you over 18-year-old guys because she is absolutely gorgeous, but do not worry. She was 18 during production so your only a little creepy, but you know not pedophile creepy. She carries the movie as she is target of the paranoia and superstition that takes over the family. However, maybe the best scene is a make shift exorcism scene. Without spoiling much, the family thinks one of the kids is obsessed; and my god the kid gives Linda Blair a run for her money for best exorcism. It is brutal and made me uncomfortable and scarred in all the right ways.<br/><br/>This movie perfectly captures abject terror and the uncanny feeling that makes even the simplest shot of a forest scary. Within minutes you'll be uncomfortable and feel a chill go down your spine. And you will have no idea why. This movie scares you to the core without loud noises, cheap tricks, or overly gory violence. If you do not mind a slow burn, and like to feel your horror deep inside and not just a loud jump then I cannot recommend this movie enough. Just check out the trailer, and if that doesn't scare you then you are more man than I am."
"davideo-2","9","1","4","27 February 2017"," Brave, ambitious horror film-making, which may be lost to some
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>1630, rural England. A devout Christian family find themselves banished by the elders of their local community, on account of their father William's (Ralph Ineson) puritanical, uncompromising religious ways, into the wilderness. They set up a home in the forest, and live their lives strictly in accordance with the teachings of the Bible. But then, a mysterious curse seems to befall them, where their crops fail and the infant child of the family disappears into thin air. The family find their dynamics closing in on each other, with accusations flying around, culminating in daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) being accused of practising witchcraft.<br/><br/>Of all the genres, in recent times, horror is probably a strong contender for the one that's become the most stale and stagnant, a field that's become over loaded with remakes or original work that's highly derivative of other works that's gone before, and it's all become pretty samey and interchangeable. And so it's refreshing, at least, that feature length debut director Robert Eggers has delivered something like The Witch, a period horror piece that takes us back to the times of Ye Olde England, and drowns us in dialogue that recreates to a tee the spoken dialect of the time, a move that will wrap up and captivate many, and will sadly make it impenetrable for just as many others.<br/><br/>If the dialogue and text is something the average viewer might struggle to get their head around, one thing that will manage to appeal to horror aficionados of all ranges is the beautiful, perfectly creepy and unsettling sense of atmosphere, with the dense, barren forest and the thick, glimmering mist used to beautifully haunting, spooky effect, complimented by a soundtrack that jeeps and jars at just the right times for maximum effect. In the lead role, Ineson's gravelly Yorkshire drawl lends his spoken dialogue an added air of vitality. The climax sacrifices solving the mystery of the missing child for something more startling and ambiguous.<br/><br/>In an age where the average horror flick seems to think frequent jump scares, excessive gore, young teen stars with questionable acting skills being chased and a whiny grunge soundtrack playing over the end credits is enough, it's certainly a breath of fresh air for something like The Witch to come along, and receive a lot of the acclaim it has. And deservedly so, if only so much of the historical recreation wouldn't have proved so overwhelming to so many. ****"

","So there's a community of witches living in the woods who feed off baby's blood to keep themselves young (cheesy) and who get their instructions through a black billy-goat masquerading as the devil in the family shed? Really?<br/><br/>The dialogue was miserable and the acting not that good, regardless of what other people say.<br/><br/>There are some merits to this film, and it's definitely good enough to get a sarcastic review, but don't think this is going to be a gripping horror/thriller - it's not.<br/><br/>Getting back to the 'scintillating' plot; after being isolated, hungry and cut-off from the rest of society, the family end up accusing each other of evil, fighting in-house as to who's the most evil (you decide), culminating in the prettiest being the only survivor of the devil-induced family feud, serving the sole purpose of her having a warped enough mind to lead her into madness and willingly join the coven of witches in the woods.<br/><br/>I didn't see a flash of inspiration to suggest that the girl could be or become one of the witches, just that she ended up being one after all. It's nothing more than a mish-mash of rather unimaginatively implemented folk-tale ideas."

","So what this film is basically saying is that the Salem witch trials were in fact legitimate. <br/><br/>The women accused actually did perform supernatural acts that were, if not evil, then at least hateful. <br/><br/>I see the popularity of this film as a case of atheists/pagans/wiccans reveling in their assumed power and ""demonizing"" the sanctimony of the Christian establishment.<br/><br/>The witches' power when it is finally revealed is awful and in fact seems to justify the longstanding superstitions about witches and satanic practices. I know there are ""good witches"" and ""bad witches"" (I saw ""Wizard of Oz"") but there is only evil in this film. If it has a meaning or a message, it is that the old superstitions are true."

","A Puritan family is booted off the island, or in this case off the Puritan plantation. Now they are in dire straits by themselves on their dry little farm. One day the baby son suddenly vanishes basically right in front of the teen daughter's (Thomasin's) eyes. We see that a witch puts him to sinister use. The father thinks that a wolf took the baby.<br/><br/>We learn that the father isn't particularly good at anything but chopping wood and being pious. That forces the early teen son to man-up to to speak. For some reason they don't seem to be able to plant anything and have to make do with three goats, two white ones and a black one. The mother doesn't also do much but complain to god and dream of going back to England. At some point the father sold a silver cup that belonged to the mother's father, something that he doesn't disclose to her.<br/><br/>Their two strange toddlers are a little creepy and talk to the black goat and even sing its praises! One day in jest, Thomasin threatens the unruly kids pretending to be a witch. One night the son decides to leave at night with the horse and dog to find food to avoid the family's decision to sell Thomasin away to work for someone else. Thomasin comes along. The dog off course ends up dead, the horse runs away, and the kid is seduced by a beautiful woman. Later he appears at the farm naked and ill. He's somewhat possessed and this pushes the family to the limit. The kids accuse Thomasin of being a witch, which the mother quickly believes, Thomasin throws the father's uselessness in his face. The day after the kids are forced to spend the night with the goats, things have a bloody unraveling. And we learn why the movie is called ""The Witch."" <br/><br/>The Witch is a lovely atmospheric even claustrophobic little movie written and directed with subdued confidence and charm. It sets a great tone with the accented overly pious language but the obsession the God and scripture does get tiring after a while. It's supposed to be an independent movie but it eagerly follows the standard Hollywood political agenda. The father's incompetence is just too unrealistic, so is the overly democratic household. Things improve markedly from the monotony once things unravel and the two final revelations regarding the goat and the witch raise this movie several notches in quality and leave one with a very favorable impression of the movie as a whole. The Witch is original in a very good way."

Sadly, the film was a complete let down.<br/><br/>Where do i start? Well the acting was terrible, i just couldn't feel anything for the characters. The dialogue was hard to follow and understand? Or was that just me? The picture quality was poor, i shelled out over £4 for the HD rental. Now i understand the basic idea of the film. Family banished out of community to live near the forest where a witch lives. Child gets taken by witch...... As i said, i love a good horror film, particularly a good supernatural or psychological horror. But this film bored me!! Nothing happened!! I was fidgeting in my comfortable armchair.

","A pretty much paint by numbers horror movie that was popular this year so I gave it a try. If you are a horror movie fan, of course you will like it somewhat. But it didn't work for me. For one, I wouldn't even really consider it horror. It was eerie, creepy, and suspenseful at times, but it never quite scared me in a way that many horror movies have. There's really not much to talk about here. The only part of watching this movie I really liked was that it was only 90 minutes long. The first half was much better than the second. The final half hour just dragged and went by very slow in comparison. It's hard to understand what the actors are saying so that doesn't help, but beyond that, it just wasn't a good movie. This is one of the lowest scores I've given. The only reason it doesn't get a 1 is because it tried so a 4 is for effort and some effective suspense. Don't get your hopes up.<br/><br/>4/10"
"poe-48833","2","1","4","22 June 2016"," Scapegoat...
","It's never really clear why the Outcasts were cast out, nor why they insist on blaming all their woes on their goat. How this group manages to build (let alone maintain) a farm is beyond me: these folks lack Common Sense in great abundance. The script (for lack of a better word) is rivaled only by the direction in terms of amateurishness. (The single scene worthy of note: a long shot of a robed figure moving through the forest cradling a newborn baby.) Perhaps it's the lack of Perspective that hurts THE WITCH: it's never really clear if the filmmaker is wagging a finger at the gullible who persist to this day in believing in Gods or Goddesses or if he's just a Fright Film fan taking his turn at bat(...), and it's this unevenness that make THE WITCH just another dreary bit of business."

"worshipgeneral","7","1","4","5 June 2016"," Prepare for a SERIOUS creep-out out...
","Getting right into it, this movie will give you the creeps at some point: if not many points. This is also one of those movies that has a bit of a slow build up. However, it is ALL necessary. For whatever reason, now-a-days people just want all things RIGHT NOW and in a hurry. Give me action! Give me gruesome! Give me the feels... but in order to hit you right between the kisser just right, there needs to be some ground work laid. This movie does that. The other challenge is the period which this movie takes place: 1630. Not the most exciting nor technological times. What this movie does quickly is establish main characters and jumps right into plot. It lets you know that this movie is focusing just on this family. While there's mention of other people, you don't really care. The few main characters all add something good to this gumbo.<br/><br/>The art direction and cinematography are brilliant in setting tone, mood, direction and capturing the essence of the suspense, struggle and mysteries that seemingly plague this family. And then... there's that creep factor. On a scale of 1-10, I'd easily give this movie an 8 for 3 reasons. #1. This movie is based off of written accounts. Whaaaaaat?? #2. This is one of those movies that uses kids in that RIGHT way to slap you with effect. #3. This is not your cute little Bewitched or Sabrina the Teenage witch kind of stuff. This is the kind of witch you had nightmares about and made you not want to go back to sleep, ever.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this a 7 and not higher is because it lacks some depth and isn't quite unique, but is an original ""witch"" movie in my opinion. The Witch kind of reminds me of The Village and Wicker Man, but better than both combined and multiplied by 5. The build up isn't for everyone as mentioned above, but may take a bit to get through. Additionally, I'm not the reviewer to give out that covenant 10 or even 9 very easily. But, this movie does have a lot going for it and worth the watch if you want a good creep-out or horror movie. There's A LOT worse out there."

To make matters worse, they've moved into a witch's territory. Bad luck. So one way or the other, you know they're in deep s**t. This dysfunctional family of seven doesn't last very long, although they manage to partake in a lot of grief and infighting before their demise. I don't like seeing little kids getting yelled at and winding up dead. . . Oh yeah! And there's a killer goat, who also talks! Sheesh!

Other than the initial infant sacrifice there wasn't anything truly horrifying, gruesome or scary. The religious/superstitious/paranoia among the family is the real focus and anything supernatural that happens is more of a punctuation mark. The music keeps you feeling tense and unsettled throughout, which I'm impressed by, good eerie music can make a scene of someone washing dishes seem ominous, but visually everything is pretty anticlimactic. It's not a bad movie but it's not one that sticks with you. It's a one and done kind of movie."

"thenachoman","7","1","4","1 May 2016"," A solid horror movie (without jump scares!)
","The Witch is one of those rare horror films that pop up every few years, which are genuinely well-crafted pieces of work. One illustration of this is that it does not rely on jump scares like most horror films. Instead it relies on an increasing sense of dread to create its horror, combined with strange and unsettling imagery.<br/><br/>The film looks great. The colours are dull, and the New England forest setting is bleak and desolate. Perfect for a horror film set in the 15th century. The film's sound is also a standout, in particular the music. I don't know what the composition of instruments was, but it fitted the film perfectly. (One thing I found annoying however, was the dialogue, which in parts was difficult to understand.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately the story lets The Witch down. Even though I didn't watch the trailer or know much about the film, I was unsurprised by what occurred in the film, from about 1/3 into it. I find predictable stories, especially in horror films, boring to watch. Fortunately the execution of the story in The Witch is great, but it doesn't quite mitigate this problem.<br/><br/>In terms of casting, I think the stand-out here is Harvey Scrimshaw, who plays a young boy called Caleb. He has several key scenes and he nails every one of them. The other is Ralph Ineson as William, who seems a shoe-in for a Game of Thrones role at some point.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this to any horror film fan -- you will definitely enjoy it."
"eshwarmail","7","1","4","27 April 2016"," A beautiful experience and it gets the simple yet important things right. But not so much as a scary horror thriller.
","Horror is a genre that has a defined scope which is governed by certain rules based on society's understanding of how ghosts/demons/spirits/'witches' etc function. While believers treat it as a social drama, others do so as a fantasy. So it is very important for the makers to have enough clarity on who their target audience are. In the recent times the makers have mostly catered to the latter audience dealing these stories as fantasies where these unnatural forces have the capability to control the technology (read 'Unfriended' or 'The Ring' series) which is fun to watch sometimes when done good.<br/><br/>'The Witch' goes back to the roots of orthodox methodology of film making in horror genre which is thus far so overdone that it is difficult to present in a way that attracts audience attention. Director Robert Eggers does overcome this challenge with a tight script, suitable cast and going to a period (mid 17th century) when witches and witch hunting is still a norm in that part of the world. Right from the first frame, it draws you into that period, into their family, into their beliefs, into their conflicts. Once the connect is established, it plays around with its smart twists, whodunit mystery and creepy background score where you are forced to invest your emotions but not sure where.<br/><br/>William (Ralph Ineson) is a righteous believer in spreading the Holy word and that is the purpose of his arrival in America with the pilgrims. He feels cheated and confronts the society when he finds a changed agenda which gets him banished from the village along with his family comprising of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), elder daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), young twins and a toddler. When they settle in a plain near the forest, things go south when their toddler disappears from the hands of Thomasin followed by Caleb's abduction in the forest. When Caleb dies, each family member starts blaming each other and that builds up a certain disgust and mistrust among themselves leading to painful confrontations.<br/><br/>It takes a while to settle into and start understanding the period diaglogue, but that adds a little freshness into an otherwise simple story. There is also a huge variation in the character arcs and their performances - for example Kate Dickie plays a depressing character who goes all melodramatic, while Harvey Scrimshaw and Ralph Ineson gives a textbook stage performance. The twins are cute and high-spirited while Anya Taylor-Joy gives a rather subtle contemporary performance. Though the background score gets a little intrusive at the beginning, it settles down well and starts being effective and plays an important role along the way. The whodunit thread may not be a driving factor, but it adds to the mix of things. There could have been more scary thrills to give it a bit more mass appeal and some scenes could have been squeezed a bit more to generate the necessary edginess.<br/><br/>A beautiful experience and it gets the simple yet important things right. But not so much as a scary horror thriller."

","Some of the earliest settlers to America were religious fanatics - The Puritans - who believed in strict, joyless adherence to their principles. One byproduct of this strictness was the growing belief that the Devil, through Witches, would possess the pure in order to lead them to wicked ways. This fanatical belief in witches led to the famous Salem Witch Trials of the late 1690's.<br/><br/>Director/Writer Robert Eggers, then, asked the question in his film THE WITCH - ""What if these fables and folk stories of witches were, in fact, true""? The result is a fascinating and disturbing film that doesn't flinch in showing the supposed results of Witchcraft.<br/><br/>Is it a good film...not really. It's a little too slow and the Olde Engish language used is tough to follow (lots of ""thee's"" and ""thou's"") and, ultimately, the tale of a Puritan family's unraveling at the hands of the Witch is, as I have stated earlier, fascinating and disturbing to watch, but is it entertaining? Not really.<br/><br/>Is it a bad film...definitely not. It is a strongly made film by writer/director Eggers who is better know as a Production Designer and it shows, as the production values are strong and consistent, but the plot is weak (there really isn't a plot, except that the Witch is tormenting the family) and none of the family is particularly easy to root for.<br/><br/>So, do I recommend this film? Ultimately, I don't think so. I've used the words fascinating and disturbing quite a bit in this review and that is what this movie is...but entertaining? For me ""fascinating and disturbing"" does not equal entertaining, in this case.<br/><br/>6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","This is a well-done independent film ... but it's definitely not for everyone.<br/><br/>Think of it like a critically acclaimed, low-budget foreign-language drama or art film ... if you'd normally go see a movie like that, then I'd recommend seeing it. Otherwise, this might not be the right movie for you.<br/><br/>There were more than a few people who walked out on the movie in my showing - probably because they were expecting a more traditional ""hollywood"" style / mass-appeal movie, not Shakespearean-like dialog in a limited 17th century setting. I'd say that's 90% of the movie.<br/><br/>Outside of that -- I kind of liked it after I let go of my expectations. It's dark, well acted and, even if the dialog is nearly impossible to understand, quite atmospheric in terms of a period piece.<br/><br/>It's basically about a fundamentalist religious family that starts to experience misfortune when they separate from their settlement. Mentally, they can only understand the world in terms of being sinners and that fate is the will of God --- or is due to one of the kids becoming a ""witch"" by siding with Satan.<br/><br/>Yes - there is a supernatural element going on - but don't expect to see as much as it as you'd get in a traditional horror / scare movie.<br/><br/>Again - if good acting, atmosphere and foreign language or art-type films are something that would interest you -- then you have the right mindset and I'd say definitely it out. Everyone else -- I warned you."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5) <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: The Crucible meets The Shining meets Rosemary's Baby in Robert Eggers' well- received but wildly overrated debut film.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+<br/><br/>PLOT SUMMARY: Set in the 1600's, faith lends a shaky hand to a devout Christian patriarch and his family as they encounter strange occurrences in a small New England town. Labeled as heretics, the family is shunned by the community and settles near a dark forest with talks of witchcraft and other evil forces lurking about.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: While the film is called The Witch, it is its subtitle, A New England Folktale, that reveals more about writer / director Robert Eggers' first film. Folktales were originally cautionary tales told to impressionable children to forewarn them of the dangers in the real world. The film uses its time and setting most ingeniously, recalling the religious repression of that period and the mass hysteria associated with sin and witchcraft in a Puritan village. It has also garnered the awe of many impressionable critics as well. While this psychological thriller has some strong and disturbing imagery, it cannot hide the many illogical twists in the plot that are more evident after the film reaches its unsatisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>One is initially captivated by the story, production values, and acting as the film tells its tale of a family surviving on its own after being exiled by the community elders. There are strange satanic goings-on as they settle into the woods (a bad place to be in most fairy tale lore): daily fire and brimstone sermons from an arrogant shiftless father, William (Ralph Ineson), Katherine (Kate Dickie), a cold and hateful mother who seems more possessed than humanly possible, lustful glances by a confused son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), a pre-pubescent unhappy daughter, two creepy twins spouting evil talk, and a baby who goes missing. Nothing goes quite well for these outcasts.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is indeed moody and eerie, although the pacing of the film is in need of some stirring. Eggers is a solid director, and a talent that shows much promise. He creates a wonderful setting with much historical accuracy and his penchant for occasional surreal images with black birds, goats, wild rabbits, and subtle uses of blood to accentuate the perils surrounding the family are haunting and very effectively done.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly strong. Mr. Ineson, sporting an anachronistic 21st century six-pack physique that could have tempted many a Puritan, handles the speechifying astutely and Ms. Dickie brings a sullen and disagreeable presence to her character, but it is the acting of the two younger members of the clan, namely Mr. Scrimshaw and Ms. Taylor-Joy who deliver the emotional connection needed to care about this stoic family and their creepy dilemmas.<br/><br/>Yet, as the story progresses and more and more supernatural things befall these victims, the leaps of logic become harder to accept. Mr. Eggers' script ultimately lets down the audience. His flair for visuals compensates for a lack of cohesiveness in his screenplay. There is also an over-reliance of heightened sound effects and atonal musical cues that telegraphs something wicked before it comes this way. <br/><br/>Just as folktales are themselves cautionary stories, The Witch may hold one's interest in its storytelling, but this reviewer must caution any moviegoer that this well-crafted tale will leave you more bothered or bewildered than bewitched.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","It could be said that the point of this film is that the nature of evil is nature itself, as much of what happens could be explained, with today's knowledge and science, to be natural phenomena caused by the poor living conditions in the raw nature, but to this God-fearing farming family in 1630s New England, the unknown and unexplained was thought to be sorcery and witchcraft, as they slowly begin to suspect one of their three surviving kids may be a witch, possessed by spirits, following the death of their middle child.<br/><br/>But it could also be said this film, and all of its grey-hued frames, should have been released in independent/ art house cinemas, because I don't think general audiences will go for such a slow burning (perhaps a bit too slow, at times) Gothic, folk horror. Images of injured and dead animals, and dying and dead kids, were extremely difficult to watch, I had to look away a couple of times. Quite a few (maybe 8 to 10 of the 40-odd) audience members left during the film, and there was a mass exodus when the credits began. Within 30 seconds of the film ending, I was the only one remaining, the only one who stayed through the closing credits.<br/><br/>This has at least two endings, when the screen goes black for several seconds. The first time, another scene eventually follows. The second time, the closing credits eventually begin, which, as formulaic of a criticism as this may be, made this final scene feel tacked on.<br/><br/>While the film got under my skin, to be sure, I'm not sure could recommend this, or ever watch it again. This film also reminds me of the tone of 1971's, The Blood On Satan's Claw, another Gothic horror I enjoyed, but probably couldn't watch again. The shot of witch in red coming out of the dilapidated cabin toward the boy was beautifully eerie, and reminded me of some visual Jean Rollin might have done in the early 1970s.<br/><br/>I must give credit both to Ralph Ineson who, as the father, is excellent, and to writer/ director Robert Eggers for putting out such an uncompromisingly bleak horror film, not watered down for the PG13 crowd, but again, some of the images were too difficult to watch, even for a horror film fan like myself. Being a speaker of a multitude of languages, the use of Old English didn't bother me, but I can also understand why it put off a lot of reviewers.<br/><br/>If this was screened at Sundance in January 2015, that means it must have been filmed in 2014 (at least, if not earlier than that) so why was it not released until February 2016?"

The second half of the movie does pick up the pace a bit, and the ending is the best part of the film. And although I found this movie boring plot wise, it does do a good job of making the movie feel real and accurate to the time period. All and all this movie looks good and is an accurate depiction of the time period, but I personally found it to be boring for the first two thirds of the movie."

","If you want to watch a movie about a desperate family falling apart in the colonial era, then this is your movie. This movie is not about the witch - in fact she seldom appears. The movie kind of rolls along in a predictable way and then ends with a very linear story line that has little to do with witches. Great context for a story but not very well executed."

","There are multiple interpretations that have been offered on this opaque masterpiece, but the one I like most is that the piece is an example of a group hysteria that goes really badly wrong, or at least it's too simple to just blame the nymph-like beauty at the heart of the film for being 'a witch all along'. She actually comes across as the most saintly character up until the denouement. In the meticulously crafted dialogue of first-generation American pilgrims one becomes immersed in the wierd mindscape of 17th century Puritans, where there's an unflinching belief in the supernatural - be it heavenly or hellish... Somehow the horror seemed just so much more genuine here than amidst the usual comic stumbling fiends that make up the stock of the tired genre.. Anyway I loved it from start to finish, and felt such a transgressive kick, a liberated feeling becoming involved in a vicarious way with the goings on. One witnesses in subtle symbolism and audacious moments a bit of everything from murder to incest, suppressed greed & vanity, obsession in bucketloads, pubertal lust, love mingled with hate, hopes for salvation meeting fire & brimstone, to name a few. And it was all so much more pointed and realistic in the austere, sprititalised and just plain paranoid setting that the director so painstakingly creates. This is far too clever and too serious to be pidgeon-holed as 'horror'. It's more of a psychological thriller with buckets of blood and bible-talk. And the suggestion online that the whole family were all hallucinating on the ergot from rotten corn is way too delicious an idea to dismiss outright."

"WondrousMoose","9","1","5","29 August 2017"," The Witch, director Robert Eggers' debut film, is an atmospherically terrifying tale of manipulation and paranoia.
","2016 was a pretty solid year for horror films, with major releases like Don't Breathe and 10 Cloverfield Lane faring well with audiences and critics. While many releases were sequels, prequels, or lazy reboots, there were several that ended up as genuinely scary films. The Witch, an indie gem distributed by A24 (Ex Machina, Swiss Army Man), is one of these, and many people simply haven't heard of it. I'm not going to hide how much I like this movie. It fascinates me. I'm generally not much of a horror fan, but at the end of the day, a good movie is just a good movie.<br/><br/>The story takes place in 16th-century New England and follows a Puritan family of seven who have recently been banished from a plantation settlement. Distressed, they set out blindly into the wild, in hopes of building a new home for themselves. When a witch from the nearby forest abducts their youngest, the mother of the family completely snaps, and the rest must try to survive in the untamed wilderness as their relationships and minds deteriorate further. As they grow more paranoid and even accuse the oldest daughter of witchcraft, they threaten to destroy themselves.<br/><br/>The pacing of this film has remained its most contentious quality among audiences since its release. The slow and deliberate pacing starkly contrasts the exciting scare-fests that more casual horror fans expect today. Instead, this movie is oppressively tense, refusing to break the mood that it builds at almost any point. What the pacing and atmosphere of this film are able to create is utterly horrifying. The witch herself is introduced to us in just about the most repulsive way possible, and from that point onward, the film essentially builds as an hour-and-a-half nightmare. Without the relief provided by unearned jump scares, the tension from these scenes builds mercilessly and doesn't let up.<br/><br/>I also have to be sure to mention the acting in this film. Each member of the family, which serves as most of the cast of the movie, is thoroughly believable, from the parents to the young twins. While children in movies are with rare exceptions painfully hard to watch, both the child and adult actors in The Witch give convincing performances. This is a film featuring many relative unknowns who can remind us that a film doesn't have to be helmed by A-list stars to be effective. In particular, lead actress Anya Taylor-Joy delivered a well-rounded and convincingly emotional performance; I'm excited to see where her career takes her over the next several years.<br/><br/>The characters' mutual descent into madness is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece The Shining. Visually, they are both exquisitely constructed, though instead of the bright symmetry of the older film, The Witch presents itself visually in a sharp grayness of frank poverty, uncomfortable character closeups, and shrieking nature shots. Honestly, you'll end up afraid of just about everyone and everything in the movie from the paranoia that the visuals help produce and the chilling score of period instruments and melismatic chanting help to fully bring out.<br/><br/>There's a terribly vulnerable nakedness to the characters' condition in their small homestead. Protected from the wilderness by a shabby split rail fence, the members of this family appear so cold and fragile. While the titular witch is the villain behind what happens to and between this family, the land around them is so oppressively ambivalent that it become a villain all its own.<br/><br/>The film is a surprisingly spiritual film. Christian iconography is common in western horror films, but The Witch is able to meaningfully incorporate otherwise cliché themes and imagery into its narrative. The characters are deeply religious, often praying and quoting scripture, though a good deal of drama and tension derives from how horribly they treat each other in the worst times. By rejecting the joy and forgiveness that is central to the Christian faith, this devout family allows for a very real and present evil to tear them apart. Each of these characters is fast to instruct the others to pray for forgiveness because they refuse to offer it to each other, and in the end, they all suffer horribly.<br/><br/>Beyond its strengths as a horror film, The Witch is an undeniable accomplishment of period filmmaking. From the characters' way of life and view of the world to their immediately apparent costumes and speech, most elements of this film are placed and held believably within seventeenth century America. The dialog could have sounded contrived and artificial, and given the inexperience of many of the actors involved, I am impressed by how well it turned out.<br/><br/>Director Robert Eggers heavily researched speech, farming, religious attitudes, and more from the time period portrayed in order to authentically transport us there; his efforts paid off. I particularly appreciate his transformation of dialog produced by twentieth century actors into everyday speech of seventeenth century English expats. To my knowledge, the accent that the characters use in the film is accurate to what the English language sounded like at that time. The words used are also largely accurate; Eggers went as far as to incorporate records of actual alleged possessions and bewitchings from around that period in time into scenes in the film. The ease with which these lines fit the rest of the film is a testament to his efforts.<br/><br/>It's a shame that because of this movie's pacing and relatively understated scares I can't recommend it to many horror enthusiasts, but that hardly takes away from its artistic quality. The Witch is a testament to what can be accomplished in a film conceived and driven by a passionate and skilled mind. It is proof that there is more to the horror genre today whatever Blumhouse Productions is pumping out this month. Like the best horror films, it exists where fear and helplessness meet and holds you there with it until the screen has gone black."

","An English farmer and head of devout Christian family, William (Ralph Ineson), in fear of banishment from the 1630 church, leaves a colonial plantation and begins homesteading a remote plot of land at the edge of the New England wilderness. Wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), slow to complain, fears something evil lives in the nearby woods. Daughter Thomasin (Anay Taylor-Joy) plays peek-a-boo with a little brother that mysteriously disappears. In order to keep a little distance from two younger siblings, she jokingly claims to be a witch. Crops begin to fail, domestic animals become unruly and one of the remaining children seems to be possessed by a malevolent spirit. Paranoia sets in as members of the family truly believe Thomasin is guilty of witchcraft. Their faith has been attacked and will be tested. Why have they been forsaken? Is it evil living among them or something lurking in the woods? This movie could curdle Stephen King's blood. The fluctuation of music is haunting; various scenes will cramp your knuckles and the atmosphere is perfectly creepy. The wordiness adds mystery to the desperation of the characters. Cinematography is eerie. Kudos to director Robert Eggers.<br/><br/>The cast includes: Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson, Sarah Stephens and Vivien Moore.

","As of writing this I can think of many, many horror films that are coming out lately: Conjuring, Insidious, Sinister, The Possession, Babadook, and numerous exorcism based films. They all tend to be quite similar: jump scares, freaky imagery, etc. Well The Witch is not at all like these films.<br/><br/>The film is set about 400 years ago in a very religious and puritanical world. A man and his family are banished from a community and set up a small farm on the edge of a forest. Eventually supernatural problems occur...<br/><br/>Now don't think that it will be like the other horror films I listed. This film is slower and doesn't really feature anything too out there like spider-walking little girls or red-faced demons. Nonetheless it is quite thrilling for a horror fan who appreciates something different. And I don't think this is too much of a spoiler but this isn't a film where the protagonists can just shout about the power of Christ to make the antagonists run away. So it's refreshing in that way.<br/><br/>Technically the film is very well made. The acting is good, the scenery is believable and you really get the feeling that it is historically accurate.<br/><br/>I recommend it but do realize that it's a divisive film seemingly; some say its really scary (including Stephen King) and some say its so boring."
"pcqgod","8","1","5","20 April 2016"," Making deals
","'The VVitch' is a creepy and atmospheric psychological horror movie. Although there are no ""hard"" scares, certain scenes will haunt you long after the closing credits have run. The tension and horror only works in the context of people who are entirely convinced that Satan is real and striving every minute to trip innocents up with their own carnal urges, even in the most mundane, everyday situations. Due to the movie's use of authentic period dialogue, spoken in English/New England accents, sometimes mumbled or whispered and further hampered by the iffy enunciation by child actors, you have to pay close attention to follow the thrust of the dialogue in certain scenes."

That's it & so I'll tell you about the film.<br/><br/>The film was OK, but not worth the stupid hype & 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes! I don't get what's so good about this film, I really don't. Why critics seem to like boring crap like this & hate great films that are underrated is beyond me! What goes in their heads!? Anyway...<br/><br/>The plot of this film was thin & watery, but not too complicated to say the least. My issue with this film is the fact that it took abit of time to get going & was also quite confusing visually & dialogue wise. It got me abit lost at one point. But, we got there eventually when it DID pick up about 30 minutes in.<br/><br/>The dialogue was confusing as with the pacing of the film at the beginning! Why they couldn't speak normally was annoying! I mean it's like talking to someone about Star Wars & them not knowing what your meaning! The film makers & writer/directer obviously got too wound up in this film that they forgot to simplify the dialogue & what was going on in the first 30 minutes, if not the whole film itself! It may be obvious to YOU but it won't be too us! Make it general & not biased! <br/><br/>Also in all honesty, as much as I liked the simple plot, it was all TOO simple! Like you could say the plot within 1 sentence within 10 words or less! I mean I like films that have an easy plot generally as films now work too hard to be clever & end up confusing viewers & falling flat on it's face, but the least the could've done was add abit more complexity into it! It was too straight forward & didn't have a twist or clever plot whatsoever! How critics liked this again is beyond me!<br/><br/>The film did have some good points to it mind. The kills were interesting, the graphic violence did spice the film up abit & also made up for the first boring 30 minutes! I also liked the actress & the naked women near the end of the film! The goat killing people was quite funny & entertaining!<br/><br/>I had a feeling upon watching this film I knew it wasn't going to be epic & judging by the over hype it shows you can't judge a book by it cover! Over hype usually means it's sh!t & under to panned usually means good in the day & age! We also never got to see the witch too which was abit disappointing! <br/><br/>I overall found the film to be mediocre & very below average at best! Watch The Boy instead as it's far more entertaining & has a good plot twist unlike this film which is too simple plot wise & too complex & overly confusing visual wise, it should be the other way around complex plot, & simple visuals with great effects! At least then it would be more entertaining & worth the stupid over hype these stupid critics seem to churn up! <br/><br/>5/10"

The problem is that The Witch spends its entire run time setting up for a climax that doesn't really come. The audience is left hanging with no perspective.

","To be cautious, let me start with SPOILERS ARE INCLUDED. That said:<br/><br/>I will preface by saying I wanted to see this movie, and I wanted to like it. Historical horror has worked well with me in the past. The premise holds together as a great send-off. A family rejected by their community, forced to eke out an existence at the border of an ominous wood, fueled by zealotry and potentially paranoia. <br/><br/>What the film does right: It is beautifully shot. It gives a great atmosphere of starkness, and one can palpably sense what sort of desperation could occur. The lighting of the scenes, with its low glow and candlelit imagery reinforces this. The sound works well with this (most of the time), and the actors manage to deliver some effective scenes, two in particular standing out. <br/><br/>When a child first disappears, when a daughter confronts her father, these scenes by themselves read very well, if they don't connect well with each other. But herein lies the fundamental problem with this movie. It doesn't tell a story, at least not as a whole. <br/><br/>As you watch the movie, scene to scene, it seems more like a series of unconnected or at best very loosely connected vignettes than a story. In a different sort of film, that may have been all right as well, except this is a film that takes a singular point of view with this one family. At first, it looks like it will be a story of seeking a lost sibling, then a story of paranoia, then a story of supernatural witches picking off the family, then a potential story of punishment for indecent thoughts as a sin, then a story of child abuse pushing a character to enact vengeance on her family, and so on and so forth. The longer you watch it, the more you are waiting for the moment for the plot to turn, for the story, or whatever message the film is trying to put forth, to present itself. Except it never does. The writing at the end of the film pretty much confirms it, as the film reveals it was based on numerous separate witchcraft stories of the era. It doesn't tell a story because it has no one story to tell. Following its anticlimactic scenes, you are left with an ending that is as unsatisfying as it is nonsensical, and numerous holes in both the story and plot. <br/><br/>The titular witch is never really identified, whether it is an old hag, a younger counterpart, one of the main characters, or if any of these are the same person or not. . .and honestly, leaving the theatre I am not sure I cared. ""Evil animals"" switch likewise, from rabbits to birds to goats, with no specific internal logic or reason presented. Plot points are developed and just as quickly abandoned seeking the next ""scare"", but the scare never comes. And honestly, it is a shame. For a film with such great potential, a very worthy theme, beautiful shots, good sound, even a solid cast. . .I left never having any desire to see it again.<br/><br/>Two out of five stars, being generous, and that is mostly for the cast doing the best they could with little, and for the talented cinematography and lighting/sound designs."

It was strange that in this world of found footage horror films, bad cgi horror films, and really poorly made slasher flicks that we could ever get a period piece type of horror that seems like it would be closer to a true story than any past found footage movie. I don't think this is some artsy horror film like ""It Follows"" was, but I do think it is in many ways a sophisticated horror film that uses a lot of language of that time period. <br/><br/>Sadly I don't think that sort of old style speaking is going to appeal to the mass of people who wanted to see a horror films, but I do think that it will get them talking. <br/><br/>This is a real treat of a film that should be watched. It is not a psychological horror flick, but rather a scary and yet neat look into the ideas of the Salem Witch Trails that had once happened and brought fear into many people of that era. <br/><br/>It brings in the use of magic and witchcraft in a pretty new and different way. It is a film that works on all levels to make the reaction that the directors and writers want us to feel. <br/><br/>The Witch is creepy and daring and has a lot of characters to match.

Four people did so at the 7pm showing of Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" and I can't really blame them. The movie itself is well acted and the interaction between the characters is believable. Couple that with the excellent sets and costumes, period anarchism's and speech and you can actually believe that this is how 17th century Calvinists would of lived. However at no time did I feel frightened or unsettled by what was happening on screen. More than once myself and the majority of the audience actually laughs out loud or groaned in embarrassment at a sequence that was clearly intended to produce frights. In fact it is my opinion that this would of been a much better film if stripped of all supernatural elements and presented as merely a family drama that dealt with the issues of isolationism, mistrust and the effects of pride and religious fanaticism on the wellbeing of a colonial family.

However, the lines were mumbled at times and were undecipherable.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, it was a nice movie with great cinematography and a notable score. The problem is in the storyline. There is no tangible plot or created suspense. The relationship between the characters and the audience is nonexistent. <br/><br/>I wouldn't waste your money in the theater on this one."
"matthewssilverhammer","9","1","5","27 February 2016"," Overwhelming Experience of Terror
","The new indie-horror The Witch will cause one of the following two reactions in anyone brave enough to face it: 1) to run away as far and as fast as possible from the residuals of nightmare fuel; or 2) to dive in deeper, seeking out the bleak origins and intense terrors underlying its cold surface. Either reaction would be legitimate, as its unsettling visuals and themes are as enveloping as they are hard-to-stomach. Less a forceful, shocking horror than an atmospheric vision of fear, these two disparate effects point to the same truth: The Witch is an overwhelming experience of sheer terror. Set in 17th century New England, teenager Thomasin and her family are banished from their paranoid town and forced to make a life of their own. As witchcraft and black magic begin to make their way out of the neighboring woods and into the family's life, things go from bad to worse. Newcomer Eggers directs with such fervency for authenticity, it feels like he time-traveled to capture this unique era for horror. His characters carry all the affectations you expect of the period (old-fashioned English, enclosed communities), but more importantly, each member of the small cast is layered with empathy and dark humanity. Those characters, coupled with the dreary beauty of the visuals and the mesmerizing score, give us a clear first-look at a fearless talent. Eggers not only has a handle on the surface level aesthetics, but dives into some deep wells of thought, like religion vs. spirituality and the very notion of innocence. Thematically propulsive, visually rich, and disarmingly demented, The Witch casts a spell you can't learn even at Hogwarts."

","This movie was disjointed and disappointing. The existence of the ""witch of the woods"" was given away too early. Seriously, there was no mystery at all after about 8 minutes. Opportunities to expound upon sex roles (primarily suspicion of women) and religion were missed. The final scene was absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary (inapt comparisons to The Shining and other movies be damned) and the final 7-10 seconds of nothing but a black screen, repeating a theme that led the audience to expect more, was intellectually insulting. The score was often times inexplicable (dramatic music accompanying long shots of the forest from afar). Also, there isn't any consistent underlying point to the story. Most importantly, primarily as the result of the early reveal, it just wasn't scary at all.<br/><br/>That's the bad stuff. There is also good stuff. The acting was first rate, especially the children - specifically Thomasin and Caleb. The costumes, sets and scenery were excellent. The depiction of 1630 America and the people was entirely believable and well executed. In spite of the previously mentioned flaws, the director did a reasonably good job of ratcheting suspense and manufacturing dread.<br/><br/>To me this was a period piece about an unprepared family led by a less than competent husband under duress. There was also a poorly managed side story about a witch who quite literally lives in the woods, communicates with Satan and feels the bizarre need to mess with people's livestock and sacrifice babies. That last scene. Seriously. I have yet to read a sound justification for it that I can believe. What was the point?"

",". . . such as, ""What IF Satan is Real?"" and ""What IF the Devil always has been Top Dog in the U.S.?"" THE WITCH shouts a resounding ""You Betcha!"" in answer to both questions. If THE WITCH's viewpoint is correct, it certainly would make a few turns of events easier to understand, such as the unparalleled Genocide wiping out 90% of 837 Native American Nations, Black Slavery, The Civil War, Concentration Camps for the Japanese, John Wayne's anti-Semite Witch Hunts, and Trump in the White House. Certainly, the filmmakers responsible for THE WITCH have carefully crafted this flick with as much True Believer fervor and attention to detail as the people behind Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHR!ST. No corners are cut in the pains-taking regard for period language, belief systems, and social fabric here. It's as if viewers have stumbled out of a Time Tunnel just as America is signing over her Soul to Baal. This film does more to show Evil Triumphant than any movie Hitler's Videographer, Leni Riefenstahl, ever churned out.

"maurice_yacowar","9","1","5","20 February 2016"," Beleaguered innocent farm girl turns witch in this 17th Century film
","Robert Eggers' first feature film is an astonishing achievement: It's a Seventeenth Century film. If a 17th Century American colonist had our technology this is the film he would have made. <br/><br/>Everything in it is 17th Century: the characters, the language, the world view, the life, the clothing, the props, the lighting, the faith. <br/><br/>Mainly the world view. There is no sign of modern knowledge, science or medicine within the film. The only modern understanding is what some members of the audience may bring to it. Not anyone from the Republican/Tory Right, though — it's their knowledge and belief the film depicts in its total fidelity to the 17th Century. That, of course, is why the film was made today. Our current political debate makes Puritan religion a perfect emblem of contemporary pre- Enlightenment America. <br/><br/>The film reminds us that America's putative independence remained rooted in religiosity. When the constitution deliberately separated the state from religion its intention was not to privilege any one religion over the others, not to free the land from all religion. In God they still trusted but they didn't want to advantage any one god or path. This the ultra-Christian modern demagogues have self-servingly forgotten.<br/><br/>The religiosity smacks through the opening scene. A Puritan court — black and white in its religious morality and duds — banishes a family from the plantation because the father has been even more religious and demanding than they are. <br/><br/>The banished William and Katherine, with their five children, carve out a homestead in the wilderness. At first they seem the model of self-reliance. But when things go wrong, when they make mistakes, when nature proves noncompliant, they can only blame the devil and his spawn. That's why we have religion: to blame the devil for our failures and to court God with our arrogant humility. <br/><br/>Because this is a 17th Century film we watch the witch ritually abuse the stolen infant, we see the siren tempt son Caleb and choke him on the forbidden fruit (a desiccated Delicious), and we hear the witch descend in the wind to kill the goats and carry off the twins. What in a modern film would be supernatural horror in this 17th Century world is nature. <br/><br/>What begins in nature ends in supernature. First the ram Black Phillip kills the father. That's natural, what often happens when an animal previously out-rassled by his master, gets a chance for revenge. <br/><br/>But then nature is ratchetted up to superstition (aka religion). We hear the black devil ram seduce the oldest, Thomasin, and carry her off to join the powerful coven of sexually free women that terrifies domestic normalcy. That sexual paranoia, of course, is the psychological source of the legends of witches. They represent a rampant female sexuality that no man can control — so they must be demonized. <br/><br/>Certainly never elected."

","As other reviewers have said, ""The Witch"" is not a movie that scares you with the tired old tricks, or tries to make you jump out of your seat. It did chill me to the bone, however. The setting, the dialogue, the score, a goat named Black Phillip, all worked well together to creep me the hell out.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed by the ending, or maybe just confused by the choice to end it in that manner. I'd still recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining, different, kind of movie. Great to see some originality these days.<br/><br/>Also, Black Phillip, may be the best name of any character (human or animal) ever."
"vvanquish-85127","3","1","6","12 July 2019"," A clash of conflicted ideas.
","I finally got to watching this movie after years of hearing about it, and I ended up very disappointed. I'll try to keep this review short, but it may contain a few spoilers. Also note English is not my primary language.<br/><br/>To start with context, I'm not one for blockbusters, and I love slow burn movies who like to take their time in telling stories. I did not get into this expecting anything other than being along for an unsettling ride. And while I understand why people say it's ""deeply disturbing and unsettling"", it's mostly because of the setting and period this movie takes place in, not the plot.<br/><br/>This movie has no idea what it wants to be. On one hand it offers a story with supernatural elements, and with the other it tries to show you how terrible living in a witch-hunt era was. While you can make a mix of both and get something great, all I found here were conflicting ideas that made the plot nonsensical.<br/><br/>Thomasin is the eldest daughter of an exiled puritan family, with who we're supposed to relate to and feel bad for. Her family constantly blames her for everything bad that happens to them while it's never really her fault, and it gets to a point where they think she's a witch. Of course, this tears the family apart in a bloody fashion. Here's my main issue with this movie: if The VVitch was purely a period piece, I agree, it would be absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>But it's not precisely for one thing: it clearly has supernatural elements to it which point towards there being an actual Witch, with actual powers, among other things. The plot of the movie is being moved along by supernatural elements (baby kidnapped in a second, eldest son possessed, evil devil goat, etc) which cannot be explained with logic. Knowing this, you expect the movie to go somewhere with it, have some kind of reveal of sorts.<br/><br/>That never happens. It just fixates on this family tearing itself apart for fear of witches, which do seem to exist, but then never develops on it. It's almost as if the original idea was for it to be entirely a family drama, a period piece in which you see how scary being a woman back then was for fear of accusations of witchcraft (which would have been a great horror story IMO), and then some dude in a suit came in and said ""but what if we put an actual witch in it?"". The big problem with this is that it changes the paranoia of witches, the whole center conflict of the plot, into an actual threat. We go from terrifying paranoid reality to science-fiction with evil demons. The family ends up being justified of being afraid of witches after all as they are shown to be real, which made me unable to sympathize with characters, especially Thomasin. Instead of rooting for her, I spent the whole movie waiting for the reveal that she (or the twins) were actually witches.<br/><br/>Which never comes. And when the credits rolled, I was just left with tons of unanswered questions and a big feeling of ""that's it?"".<br/><br/>All in all, it's a big pseudo-intellectual piece of great cinematography, and it is only praised by the numerous fan theories that try to fix the incredible amount of holes in its plot. ""Head-canon"" does not suffice to elevate this movie. I give it 3/10 just because of the directing and acting which is really good, but in my opinion the movie is not worth your time. But seeing all the 10/10 reviews online, I guess I just don't ""get it""."

This truly is singly the way one composes a great work of art, not the only way, but feted surely to enter into the annals of History, may the Royal Society pay heed for the best is yet to come from this fantastic gentleman and fine scholar: Robert Eggers. <br/><br/>By giving us more than the wonder that lies far beyond the mere meager middling minds and souls of the average creative, Roger extracts from the vast quarry of the vast beyond, giving us not everything, for how can one know such things, but by digging and never stopping, until he extracts just enough, a fine and lustrous rare seminal diamond akin to one of the greatest films which surely must stand the test of time. <br/><br/>This is exactly how one moves the protagonist about a rich and robust plot disporting through a prevalent terror yet using the directing as a sort of spectral narrative in whose fiendish features, mobilize and galvanize the garrison for an all out assault on both phenomena and phenomenal classic reality. This is exactly how one wants to incorporate multi courses of ancillary characters whose affecting dialogue and multi-tiered peregrinations teeming with the style and wit of feeling from a seething stew over a hot steamy fire, perhaps a Witches stew, making everything start! And this is how you want to bolster a precious universal undercurrent whilst the classical prose like narrative, by one whose sophisticated sensitive nature of the most supremely intelligent persuasions brings it all together in an influx of manifold rhapsodical titular thematic explosion feted in supreme meritorious value; Pathos! This guy is a diamond in a sea of sinking wanna-bes', Who dare say, they cannot wait with bated breath for his next masterful work of art, and I want to stress the word artist, for 'The Witch' is a triumphant feat in the realm of classic works, a true opus! Truly loving it! Every dang second of it! Forever! ""Clickety Clackety!"" <br/><br/>Will it have the lasting power, the answer is already in the past, Yes, for it has already met its long term goal, and so, justly all its short term goals fall right into place. In the now, it has awaken a complex system of outward signs yet masked as dowdy gewgaws, but inside a strange transmutation has given rise to a deeper understanding of those opaque things which dance with the cold gusts of hot importunate winds by our casements and lure us with fantastic shapes and forms into concupiscent realms of sepulchral fancy. <br/><br/>It is compact yet eerily spacious. It has more than enough to make us ponder, then later reflect. Perhaps in the offing, posterity might hark-back and use this masterpiece to add the missing piece to the plight of our human puzzle, to effect change from the paternal quagmire our forefathers were presented with, dispatch with the hoax and forthwith call to the arms of science with a dash of the savage thusly spare us more wasted time, whereupon we are henceforth cast out of the darkest of centuries and hurled headlong into a polar contra-distinction so incredible, so fantastic, so irreprehensibly, inextricably sound it will make the nonce but a sad and petty prospect whose superstitious tenets bring only more discord and disharmony as a unified humane whole, with which to disobey would but surely shake the very foundation of sanity; conversely, we would all brainlessly stumble forth and crumble such to revert back to genuflecting at another more pernicious, more malicious tabernacle. Wake up, Heed the message festooned by 'The Witch's Jeremiad, let us step out of the penumbras of redundant turgid superstition which hitherto fells opportunity, and forthwith! Aye! give reason, science, logic and the arts the light for a new age! Lest one sits about in idle fancy, For 'idle hands are the devil's workshop'. So I say pray, beware of the witch and her resonating superstitions which rend and sunder all in her terrible wake borne on the wings by the lashing winds that echo her maddening prophecy in the night by and by, Alas! Do we want our children gamboling about half mad from fright mingled with confusion at the endless traceless nursery rhymes?

","Horror is inherently a very subjective genre. It is about as subjective as comedy, perhaps even more so. Both comedy and horror are ruled by emotions that vary widely from person to person. For example, most critics hate Adam Sandler comedies (with a few exceptions) but audiences still receive them. Why? Because they find it funny. The same can be said for horror. Paranormal Activity has gone stale for most people, but there are still a lot of people that watch it. Why? Because they think it's scary. There are going to be people that like the new Ghostbusters movie, and people that are going to like the new 'The Ring' reboot that is coming out this year (seriously).<br/><br/>The Witch, like 'It Follows' and 'The Babadook' before it, follows a trend of critically acclaimed, slow paced psychological horror movies that perhaps unintentionally market themselves as epic monster pieces that are full of scares. The Witch isn't full of scares. The concepts behind it are scary, but you won't jump in your seat. I didn't at least. The Witch is a mellow piece that builds tension over time. The cinematography is beautiful, the writing is moody and matches the time period, the music is amazing (probably my favourite part) and the young leading actress Anya Taylor-Joy was incredible in her role as Thomasin.<br/><br/>I liked it a lot, but it didn't scare me. I won't be having nightmares because of this film, and that is slightly disappointing. If you're able to appreciate this film for its story, watch it, but if you're looking for a movie to scare you out of your skin, this isn't it, unless you're afraid of Christian fundamentalism and/or naked old women."

This is an excellent movie that is a horrifying story. This movie does not give you any cheap jumps, is not gory, and is very slow paced. It also doesn't give you anything to laugh at, as a lot of horror movies do with their impossible and unbelievable situations. This in itself is unnerving. And I found it also very difficult to identify with the characters - an extremely puritanical family of 7 - leaving one just an observer of this strange foreign world and getting pulled into it, almost without realizing. <br/><br/>If you go into it with expectations, you'll find yourself impatient, looking for cheap thrills, and will end up disappointed - if you go with no expectations, and just sit and watch, you'll find yourself with your eyes and mouth wide open as the film slowly pulls you in and itself apart."

","New England, 1630: A family is banished from their plantation community over unspecified practical or doctrinal differences--father William's ""prideful conceit"" is all that we are told. They make a rough homestead in the wilderness, where their infant son disappears in the literal wink of an eye while under the care of eldest daughter Thomasin. . .catch the connotations of her name? A lot of creepy stuff follows.<br/><br/>While the plot line's a bit too hazy to be truly satisfying, ""The Witch"" is better and more original than most recent horror efforts. If more solid folklore and theology were brought in, this film might have been really great. It also could have worked better if the supernatural were left out altogether and everything was kept in the characters' guilt-ridden heads—or at least implied to be. I got a little restless during the draggy middle portions which, luckily, don't last long. That being said, those who want lots of action and constant surprises probably won't dig ""The Witch."" This film is also quite bleak, so the easily dejected should also perhaps avoid it.<br/><br/>An interesting blend of supernatural and psychological horror. Keeps you guessing who's really evil--the parents, the children, neither, or both? Is the rabbit just a rabbit, the goats just goats? Is the silver cup really just an heirloom? Is it deliberate witchcraft, unwitting obsession or possession, or is the family just stir-crazy, overworked, and over-worried about how they'll survive the upcoming winter? Some of the middle details, along with the turnabout at the end, help to answer these questions, though they don't entirely--and who wants them to? The children's attempts at fun and games—or are they more than that?— add a great deal. It's easy to see why young kids would be bored out of their minds and willing to do just about anything for entertainment in these surroundings.<br/><br/>Obviously fairly low budget, but the directors made good use of what they had to work with. A small cast and narrow use of settings, but good visuals, costume design, and dialogue. The latter is easy enough to understand if you know your basic thee-thou-hithers, etc. Still, it's hard to follow everything in a few places due to the heavy accents and muttering, so subtitles may be necessary—I saw this in the theater, where there were none. While ""The Witch"" avoids stereotyping the Puritan characters as completely austere and humorless, it conveys the setting pretty convincingly. Good acting by all the main cast, but especially those who play the four children."

It's refreshing to see something that is disturbingly all kinds of wrong.<br/><br/>The Witch is not a jump-out-of-your-seat-in-terror-brown-your-pants horror film but what makes this film especially unnerving is that it feels real and plausible. Indeed, this story is inspired by a series of historical accounts. <br/><br/>The story begins with a family in the new frontier of the US in the 1630s getting banished from their township and their attempts to create a new life by the edge of a forest. Nothing else need be said. Just watch and squirm and be prepared to look away. There are some truly unsettling moments.<br/><br/>I can tolerate all sorts of weird and freaky stuff with my movie watching habits, but the Witch had me rattled and I've not quite figured out why or how. The entire cast was amazing - the guy from the Office who plays Chris the sleazeball, that creepy Lysa Arryn from Game of Thrones, all four children, led by striking newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy who was impressive as Thomasin, the eldest sibling. The eerie soundtrack and the use of shadows in the cinematography were also very effective. The manner in which this was filmed places the viewers in the midst of the family's struggles making us helpless voyeurs and at times maybe complicit... I'll stop right here.<br/><br/>This is exactly how horror films should be done. It is one of the best horror films I've seen in a loooooong time.

Based on reading this, it is unlikely you will have a desire to see this movie, so stop here if you so wish, or just take my word for it that this movie is definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>Okay, here is The Witch at face value. The movie starts with a family of 7 being kicked out of a puritan community because...well I have no idea why they were kicked out, they speak in this crazy language that sounds like drunk Shakespeare. ""Dost thou barter a pic sixpense for me ninny?"" Is something that was said during this movie. So the family drives this wagon (that totally looks like it's going to fall over) out of Jamestown or Boston or some sh!t and drive it to a field where they're gonna start new lives. The father builds a house and other manly sh!t while the daughter plays peekaboo with the family baby. She closes her eye for like 4 seconds and loses the baby. Horrible babysitter. The family moves on, because you know, back in those days like 80% of babies died. Anyway, The father and eldest son go hunting and try to shoot a rabbit, but the rabbit looks at them menacingly and his gun jams and something flies in his eyes, which are unaffected for the rest of the film. Then the boy and father get home and the two youngest children are playing with the family goat. The next morning the boy wants to go hunting but his older sister won't let him go alone and so she goes with him. After like a mile the girl falls off of the family horse and the boy goes on without her and makes out with this hot but clearly evil woman who came out of a tree. The girl wakes up and runs home to tell the family, later that night the boy teleports back to the home completely naked. The eldest daughter is accused of being a witch because the naked boy who was left out in the rain won't wake up. Then he wakes up and it turns out he was just choking on a gross apple. Then he re enacts what would appear to be an entire performance of Macbeth before dying. The Father thinks a witch killed his son and does what every rational parent would do, and locks every one of his 3 remaining children in sheds outside. He then stays outside and prays while eating dirt. Meanwhile, a crow goes in to motor boat the mother. Morning comes, the family goat kills the father, the two youngest children vanish and the mother tries to kill her only remaining child. The eldest daughter stabs the mother, goes to nap in a shed, wakes up to talk to the devil, then goes into the woods where tons of tastefully nude women are dancing and flying. The end. <br/><br/>That's the movie, but you have to believe me...it's worth a watch."

First time writer-director, Roger Eggers, has delivered a movie that is soul-shaking, intensely disturbing, and gleefully Satanic enough that will likely satisfy most horror fans who can tolerate slow-burn style of movie. The Witch slowly builds its tension and thanks to its terrific production, performance, and music, all of which fit perfectly to create a dreadful tone and pressuring the audience the whole way through.<br/><br/>Like It Follows, the music in The Witch is just haunting and uneasy to listen to and really plays a huge part in creating the eerie atmosphere and tension effectively. The visual here is just as stunning and compelling as well with a brilliant production and setting that makes us feel like we are watching something we are not supposed to. While the story-line is not as spectacular as other elements in the film but it still manages to delivery the theme of faith and human nature effectively enough through the talented performance from all the cast. Even though this is a slow-burn horror film but it never gets boring as there are always something interesting and captivating to look at and the pacing here is just nicely flow with its tension rising up and down throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>The Witch doesn't rely on any cheap scares, like most modern horror film did, or over-the-top gore to shock the audience but rather its theme and concept that really creeps the hell out of them and delivers a spine-chilling experience. The Witch succeeds in almost every aspect in filmmaking giving horror fans an eerily rich and devilish experience that's pleasantly disturbing throughout. It's excited to see what the writer-director, Robert Eggers, has to offer in the near future as he has proved with The Witch that there's still hope for a horror filmmaking once again.<br/><br/>>>A-<<"

","So lets start off with saying this movie will not appeal to everyone. I saw it with my girlfriend who has become such a movie buff over the last few years that she now enjoys movies for the subtle metaphors and imagery where I still look for a great plot and close to flawless story. Once the movie was over and we both had a couple of days to let what we just witness marinate we both had two totally different opinions. She on one hand enjoyed it, where I felt it was just Meh. She liked it for the imagery, and bits of meaning behind certain scenes (I want to keep this spoiler free so feel free to see the movie if you want to understand what I might be referring to). I dozed off for a bit in the middle of it, but even with what little I did miss I doubt it would answer the question I left the theater with. Where I think many will get lost or bored will be with the old English dialogue, and constant references to religion which is needed since this is based in the 1630's and God/Family/land is what people lived for. What made this movie dull for me is that it seemed filled with useless dialogue. There were parts that I liked, but everything leading up to them really did not serve a purpose. I would have much rather have some back-story on the family, the Witch, or even where they got that creepy Goat known as Black Philip instead of just mumbled old English dialogue about god, and the hardships this family is going though in the now. Give me some story and some substance if you want to be considered a horror/mystery movie. The only thing I can say I really enjoyed about this movie was that there were scenes of suspense that could be considered chilling, and they didn't need to use any cheesy jump scares. If you love the horror genre I would say give it a shot, more so if you like to look for meaning in movies. Call me what you will but I think ""Lords or Salem"" portrayed the Witch culture/folklore better while giving a creepy and unique story despite the horrible ending, but that is for another review."

The atmosphere of the film never lets up making for suspense that really gets under the skin in moments where it really counts.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the actors were just as equally great as the direction, at first, the older dialect was hard to follow and didn't feel very natural. But after about ten minutes, the language flows better and every thing becomes very believable. Going on with the believability, everything in the landscape and surroundings felt as thought it fit the time period. The film just pulls you into the time period where you fell the struggles as the family does. There was a point where I had to look around the theater to make sure that I was indeed not in Old England.<br/><br/>The one thing that might be off-putting to some will be that the story isn't exactly about a witch versus a family. The story focuses much more on the family aspect as we see every family member deal with grief in their own ways as they sink deeper and deeper a psychological trance. There aren't as many straight up ""scares"" as one might hope, but there no doubt be times that make you jump and make you gut wrench. The family struggle is the fuel that drives the story forward and it makes for some great dramatic acting from adult and child actors alike. <br/><br/>As for problems, there are a few, but none to detract from the tension and drama that the film builds. The film is very gray and bleak, and at some points, it can be a little overwhelming at times, where you wish the color palette would liven up. To continue, there was a point where I thought the mother character was a little one- note, but I just assumed that it was her way of dealing with grief since she is obviously the one that gets hits the hardest in family problems. The ending can be polarizing to some, I wish there was a even a little more ambiguity, but the way Eggers decided to end is sufficient enough. <br/><br/>Lastly, a note must be made about the music and cinematography, both add to the film wonderfully and enthrall the viewer into whatever Eggers wants them to see.<br/><br/>Overall, The Witch is a very good horror film, certainly a brilliant start for Robert Eggers and easily a mark or two above the average horror film that is released nowadays. The closest thing I can compare this film to would be The Shining. So, just know what kind of film you are getting in to and you won't leave disappointed. <br/><br/>""Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?"""

","Here is a rare thing, the critics love this horror movie from A24 and all I have to say is... WHY?! For a movie called ""The Witch"" or the ""VVitch"", the witches get little to know screentime and no dialog. We never find out why the family was banished and was it part of the coven's plot? The pacing is terrible, there are long stretches of nothing happening. The cinematography is horrible. It's so dark, even during the day. There is a scene where we see the coven dancing naked but the camera is like a football field away and the only light is a bloody campfire. It's boring, having a black goat the devil was so obvious they didn't even bother trying to hide it. He's on the cover. I've seen several movies from A24 and so far they have Brain Damage failure record. But somehow A24 gets praised when they're the same crap as Brain Damage. Lastly: SPOILER ALERT! FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT IT SPOILED, THEN STOP READING.: Everyone is dead and Thomasin, the eldest daughter joins the coven. Which makes no sense, that came out of nowhere and they butchered her family, so why?"

","""The Witch: A New England Folktale"" is one of those movies that just catches you off guard. A family in 1630's New England area encounter witchcraft, black magic, possession. It starts out while Thomasin(Anya Taylor-Joy) is watching her baby sister for her parents. The baby abruptly ""disappears"" and very weird and nasty things start to happen. I won't go any further than that on the plot because this is a movie that needs to be experienced. With the lights out. The characters are brought to life by relative unknown actors. They are good. Really good. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the older daughter and boy does she deliver. Look out for her very soon. The dark, brooding visuals wrap you up in the story. Writer/Director Robert Eggers has put this together well, the flow is slow and methodic and keeps building. The music by composer Mark Korven only adds to the feel of the movie. A great horror flick that takes it's time but never stops moving forward. WARNING: It does get graphic – real graphic. Disturbing imagery and content. Weak stomach? You might want to avoid. 9/10 stars."

","I love horror films. Despite the many I've seen, this is the first of any film I've been compelled to comment upon.<br/><br/>Many currently titles seem to focus on a couple of good scenes which you see most of in the trailer. The rest is mostly filler to help the story along which may not receive as much attention. I believe ""The Witch"" to be a rare exceptions. The story, storytelling, acting, and directing alone would have been enough to make a good movie, but the combination of all parts made it incredible.<br/><br/>I cannot remember any dull moments in this film. The story, drama, and horror steadily crescendos until the last second. I must admit that the trailer didn't impress me. There are parts of the film which could have been added to make a better trailer, but it would have given away too much (as is the case so often). <br/><br/>Overall, I don't think you'll find another recent horror film which executes everything close to the degree of ""The Witch.""<br/><br/>Well done! Cannot wait for the next film from Robert Eggers!"

Really convincing and utterly believable! The oldest boy was phenomenal! The oldest girl too, but really, every role was perfectly acted! I really had a feeling I was in the 15th or 16th century. The mood and the tone of the film totally transports you to those dark ages of new puritan America and those religious fanatics... We have the devil in the movie, but I must say that the figure of father was reminiscent of Jesus ( on purpose or not - and maybe it is only my thought - did not read other reviews yet). The film is disturbing at times. The witch is ... well, I am not sure if there is only one witch or there are many in the film ( not counting the last scene) who were after the family.<br/><br/>The sounds ( I would not really call it music) was totally dramatic! It fits the mood / color of the film. The last witch dance and those sounds were ... chilly!!! <br/><br/>All in all, this is really a great film. Fairy tale horror I would say. Definitely would recommend to anyone!"
"MUFCOK","7","1","7","4 April 2016"," This won't be to everyone's taste.
","The Witch is an indie flick, it will be enjoyed by lots of people who are aware of this and were expecting this. It's a film for lovers of real horror, not Hollywood horror, people who have a passion for art films filled with great cinematography will appreciate this movie. The stereotypical, mainstream movie goer who is hoping for jump scares and cliché horror plots will ultimately be disappointed.<br/><br/>There is a scene within the first 15 minutes or so which is uncharacteristically brutal and gory. The rest of the movie doesn't resemble this level of horror and this scene will last in your memory long after the credits have rolled. This is a horror, there is no doubt about that, it just isn't a horror in the conventional way of the mainstream Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>A devout Christian Family are banished from their plantation and set up home on farm on the edge of a woods, in the middle of nowhere. Before long, strange things start happening, their new-born seemingly vanishes into mid-air and their crops start to die out. We see the stress and strain take its toll as they slowly begin to turn on each other and become more and more emotionally unstable. Paranoia, hopelessness and resentment are all strong emotional factors and we truly get to see how these traumas can shake a family to the core. Their distress leaves them as a collection of individuals rather than a compact family, vulnerable to the evils within the forest.<br/><br/>The Witch is a slow burner, a very slow burner. There were parts which I found boring and seemed to drag for no particular purpose. It is a very heavy dialogue driven movie with very little action; it focuses on the family and their relationships with each other much more than what is lurking in the forest.<br/><br/>The acting has been praised very highly but I honestly didn't see it as that strong. I can appreciate that speaking in Old English was a challenge, especially for the child actors and this showed quite glaringly. The father of the family and the eldest daughter gave the strongest displays, both showcasing their emotions very well.<br/><br/>The Witch has a fantastic score, the music used is perfect, capturing the old era and adding very strong tension. The music used with the breath-taking cinematography made for one very special looking movie. It is full of panoramic camera work, slow and drawn out shots which create tension and atmosphere perfectly. You never felt like there was going to be a jump scare as it is very obvious that it isn't that type of movie, but the tension is there nonetheless – it is essentially a very uneasy watch. Another strong aspect for me was the ending. I was watching the movie unravel, with underlying thoughts of how they would end this movie. I won't say too much as it's a spoiler free review but I was very, very impressed with how they did it. The very final scene was powerful and graphic, it ended in a way that felt very concluding way and ended in a climax of drama.<br/><br/>I felt like I had an idea of what this movie was going to be like and I was completely wrong, leaving me at the time, slightly disappointed. I have since been able to appreciate The Witch for what it is and when I look back on it I can see how very impressive this movie actually is. I will be watching this again as I feel I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have upon my initial watch at the cinema.<br/><br/>7/10"

","When a director has the courage of his (or her convictions), and doesn't resort to clichés and cheap scares to create a movie; coupled with a meticulous attention to detail, you end up with a movie like The Witch. There is a brooding tension right from the outset, and you really feel the plight and misery of the family's circumstances as their situation trying to struggle in a harsh and hostile environment reaches its conclusion. For fans of more old school horror film techniques, that rely on a story to develop through excellent acting and the use of 'what you don't see' rather than what you do, this film is for you. Think 'Whistle and I'll come to You' or 'The Haunting' for the 21st Century. I'm still not entirely sure I really enjoyed the ending. I can imagine Eggers might have had a few different options. I'm not saying it spoiled the film, it just felt like it jarred with the style of the previous 90 minutes, but I'm being picky! This is a mature and beautifully made film. An outstanding debut for the director."

","The Witch is a horror film set in 17th century New England, and after a family's youngest child is taken into the forest under supernatural circumstances, paranoia challenges the family's Christian beliefs and threatens their lives in ways they never could have imagined. The Witch premiered at Sundance last year, and following rave reviews, has finally received a wide release. The Witch is a very different horror film that relies on atmosphere, disturbing imagery, and sound to craft a slow, but terrifying, horror experience.<br/><br/>The story in The Witch takes familiar ideas of witchcraft and Satanism and puts them in an isolated setting with a family of six on the outskirts of the forest. The father and mother preach strict religious values, so after their youngest child goes missing, the family slowly begins to point fingers and the dark situation becomes a witch hunt within their own family. I liked this unique spin on witchcraft and demons, but I only wish the characters were more interesting. The mother and oldest daughter were the two most interesting characters, with the rest of the family being entirely forgettable. <br/><br/>The dialogue is taken straight out of the 1600s, so while it is authentic, some lines and words are hard to make out. Because this dialogue is combined with thick accents and some characters mumbling, there were times were I was legitimately missing entire sentences. The Witch does explore some interesting themes for a horror film, like faith and isolation, which I appreciated.<br/><br/>But most importantly in a horror film, is it scary? Yes, in chunks but not as consistently as I would have hoped. The scares are not jump-scares or anything like that. The scares are enhanced, and sometimes carried, by sound entirely. There are many times in The Witch where there is nothing on screen but the forest in the distance or a rabbit in the barn, but the sound gives you an unshakeable feeling that something terrible is about to happen. It's some of the best use of sound design I've seen in a horror film in some time.<br/><br/>There's also some really disturbing imagery I can still visualize a day after seeing The Witch. The use of off-screen space is cleverly utilized to add to the more psychological moments. There are palpable moments of dread throughout, but after these sporadic moments, there are lengthy scenes of downtime with the family speaking to one another in the cabin. So while The Witch does have atmosphere, the pacing of the scares and the storytelling makes for a somewhat uneven film from start to finish. However, the final 10 minutes are so incredibly twisted and satisfying that it makes up for the slower moments up until that point.<br/><br/>While I mentioned I was not in love with the characters in The Witch, the film uses the forest as a character itself, and very good one at that. The forest has an unmistakable presence and is completely captivating because of the potential darkness that lies within. Shooting on location with the forest and beautiful landscapes, combined with excellent costume design, results in a low-budget film that looks incredible. The cinematography is breathtaking, and I love the film's use of desaturated color to add to the dark tone.<br/><br/>While The Witch is slow at points and some characters are not very engaging, I still found the film to be a beautiful and unique take on the horror genre. Not to mention the last 10 minutes will remain etched in my head for the foreseeable future. If a horror movie can affect a viewer for even a moment following it's conclusion, it's definitely worth a watch from any horror fans who thinks they can stomach lots of gore, mutilation, and goats?<br/><br/>If you liked this review, check out my website for more reviews and movie articles www.watsonmoviereviews.com"

The realistic atmosphere pulled me in early and had me feeling very uneasy (in a good way) at times.<br/><br/>As many people have said before me, it is important to know what you are getting into when you watch this film. This is not the usual jump-scarathon type movie that we are use to seeing in theaters.

It was not the physical presence of ""The Witch"" that had you gasping for air, it was instead the pungency of evil that enveloped the entire film. The plot was outstanding and the realness of the situation truly left chills long after the movie was over. ""The Witch"" is not a film that was meant to be taken lightly. It was a statement, a portrait of how diluted and powerful evil can be. There are no gimmicks, no flashy scenes, no jumps. The fear is meant to linger and leave the theater with you.

","""The Witch"" is arguably one of the most racially prevalent movies of the millennium. This is a story of white (English) settlers who settle in rural America and are banned from a plantation. The plantation is a literal reference to the plantations that white forefathers originally enslaved blacks in colonial America. William (the father) was kicked out of the plantation for being too radical, to which he argues that his practices are, in his mind, justified because they what God demands. He and his family are banished and take their farm somewhere else. Black Phillip (the goat) symbolizes not just the black slaves, but the entire black race; when let out of his pen he is taunted by the children for being black and even his name: BLACK Phillip is a nod to the tyranny and oppression of the white man. Throughout the movie, however, Black Phillip learns to turn the white family against one another. Eventually they all kill each other.

","""The VVitch: A New-England Folktale"" is a 2015 horror drama directed by Robert Eggers starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Ralph Ineson. I experienced it firsthand that the movies of independent label A24 are somewhat peculiar in their style and far away from being the mainstream friendly features that pleases every single moviegoer. As of today, it is still a hit or miss for me, as I dearly love a few titles, some being unexpected surprises, but on the other hand also got a few titles that just don't resonate with me at all. May it be the utterly underwhelming psychological horror hit ""Midsommar"", a surprisingly intriguing crime drama like ""Spring Breakers"" or an innovative coming of age drama such as ""Lady Bird"", my opinions about the films of this production company differ wildly. It is not only in my case, the most unconventional titles seem to divide the whole viewership in general, sometimes I hear two totally opposite thoughts on the same movie. In the case of this film, this theory proves to be correct and happens to be a fact even in my own social circle. My classmate, who recommended this film to me and brought it to my attention, considers this film to be one of the scariest films she has ever seen and deeply loves it, on the other hand I have got my own parents who both agree that this film is a big snoozefest and think it is one of the most overrated horror films of all time. So, it is obvious that I didn't quite know what I should be expecting. I just went in with an open mind, and I got to say, it was undoubtedly an unconventional film, but I personally took a liking to it. What mostly stood out was the sheer authenticity of the whole production. From the contemporary setting over the costumes that are true to the depicted time, it all looks breathtakingly original, as if the crew travelled back in time and filmed an actual Puritan family and how they deal with their lives, but the thing that gives it the rest is the archaic language used in this film. Fortunately, I covered Shakespearean English and antique speech in my advanced course back in high school and surprisingly understood everything that has been said (given the fact that it is a foreign language to me, it was somewhat pleasing that I remember most of my education) and I think that was a strange but great experience. But of course, it isn't only this what makes this film so great. As I already implied before, the film's main focus lies on religion and especially Christianity. In the beginning, protagonist Thomasin and her family part ways with the colony they inhabited and start a life on their own in the wilderness, but once they arrived there, some scary things happen around them. It is indeed a simple premise and I understand why many might be bored by this, especially when the film itself is an extreme slow burner and horror fans that need everything to be graphic or to jump right in their faces are at the wrong address. The dread only creeps in slowly and one of the biggest factors why this film works out so alarmingly well to me is that it keeps up this certain kind of ambiguity until the very end. The baby all suddenly disappears, the brother returns from the wood and is visibly sick and no one seems to have an answer to that, except for the assumption that witches are after the family and that the devil himself has cursed them. The thing is, of course the members of the family try to explain the strange incidents reasonably (at least to a certain degree) and even though the film keeps up with the ambiguity and leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether everything is happening due to natural causes or to supernatural powers, the narration rather tends to go with the first option and tries to stay on the realistic way, but without excluding the other option completely. That makes it so unsettling throughout, as I didn't know what to believe in. Of course, there were several scenes that obviously depicted witches and their wicked actions, but all of them had this weirdness to them that made them appear like dream sequences or figments. They even could have been a part of a big metaphor. If you see the family leaving the colony as some form of banishment from the Garden of Eden and the aftermath as the struggle of surviving beyond the walls of paradise, the following things could be explained reasonably. The baby died of illness that resulted from the lack of comfort and Caleb got sick as well after got lost on his last hunting trip and the vanishing of the twins at the end of the movie also falls in the same category. People and children back in the day died comparatively quickly and when they had no explanation for what is happening, they scapegoated someone, mostly women, and accused them of being a witches. From a today's point of view, it of course is rubbish, but in this unenlightened time the easiest solution was also the correct solution. That is why I also think that the witches that are depict in some scenes could also be just a visual metaphor for this procedure to underline this paranoia. No matter what theory you believe in, the film itself has an indisputably unnerving atmosphere that never once let go of me. There was this invisible threat that haunts the family and even as the viewer I could not tell what the actual danger was. The fact that the film has shown some shots of the bordering forest for a few seconds from time to time without any connection to the actual context of the previous or following scene made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Like, it wanted to show us something with this, wanted to make us see that probably wasn't there. But what if? Even if I was just the one who watched the film while sitting on his couch, the film absorbed me completely and made me feel like I was in the film - and I felt constantly watched by something ... or someone. I mean, there was nothing shown explicitly, but still. The fact that I live near a forest and get a direct glimpse into the dark woods when I look out of my bedroom window made it even worse to me. Seriously, this film consumed me completely. Aside from the horror aspect, the film also contained a serious family drama that was shaped by paranoia, enviousness, and suspicion. To be honest, considering it was a family, it more seemed like they all hated each other with all their heart rather than loving each other, but that was the comprehension of family at that time, I think. They were stricter and more merciless in bringing up their children. Apart from this, most of the film also wouldn't work without the performances of the lead actors. Taylor-Joy is stunning and unpredictable in her feature film debut and carries most of the tension with her inscrutable innocence, Ineson is great in his role as the preaching family patriarch with the distinct bass voice and also Dickie's acting as the worried and grieving mother had something chilling to it. Believe it or not, the film hasn't even reached its final form of terror until the shocking finale. After each member of the haunted family, except for Thomasin, has been killed this way or another, it turns out that the witches actually exist in the context of the film. While it has been already subtly creepy before, the revelation that everything that has been going on throughout the whole film was indeed a result from supernatural forces makes it utterly terrifying retrospectively. I mean, they were in fact haunted and constantly watched by the witches living in the wood, right next to them and that sent shivers down my spine. At a moment's notice it destroys the illusion that everything that has happened was due to natural causes and that shocked me profoundly. The fact that the devil himself has been amongst them the whole time shines a whole new light on the religious meaning behind the film and subliminally confirms that evil exists ... while God doesn't. I mean, in the beginning, Thomasin prays to God and asks for salvation from her and her family's sins, but who shows up in the end? Who answers? It is superb how the film that focuses on the Christianity of its protagonists eventually subliminally draws the atheistic conclusion that there is no God and only pure evil. This whole thesis is then wrapped up with the conversion of Thomasin, as the pious young woman then turns herself into a witch and ultimately leaves behind her faith. She has been accused of being a witch throughout and was innocent all the time, so this act is also one final expression of disobedience towards her parents and I think that rounds it up magnificently. Oh, and let's not forget about the text in the end credits that reveals that most of the depicted scenes are based on contemporary literature, actual events and that some parts of dialogue were taken directly from diaries, documents and papers from that time. That gave me the rest. All in all, this film profoundly surprised me and scared the hell out of me with its unnerving atmosphere and the merciless mind games it plays with the viewer. The ambiguity it builds up is ultimately destroyed and makes it even creepier afterwards. It is unconventional and not quite the fastest film in terms of narration, but it is intensively atmospheric, authentic and absolutely historically correct. It is an accurate portrait of a dark and moody time that knows to scare you with its source material and doesn't need to be graphic to achieve its goal. It is undeniably quiet but effective, with a magnificently supporting disturbing score and the fact that it is based on true tales and folklore makes it utterly terrifying. A special kind of horror film that I thoroughly liked. I think I am going to check out more A24 films now ...To be honest, it was very hard for me to find sleep after watching this ... especially with a dark forest nearby."

I love the story and the unique deaths, a man being stabbed by a goat who's actually something like Satan, or baby being made into PASTE it's horrifying but the gore is just everywhere to make the movie, no it builds up with tension and music, wow the sounds, so amazing.

"Shostakovich343","9","0","3","28 April 2020"," The Witch
","We see the witch in the second scene of the film. She cuts a baby into pieces and rubs its blood on her naked body. You can see this isn't one of those 'is there/isn't there? (yes, there always is)' kind of horror films. ""The Witch"" sacrifices faint surprise for the sake of drama, and is all the better for it.<br/><br/>The slaughtered victim was the youngest member of a puritan family in seventeenth century New England. Father William (Ralph Ineson) has been banished from the Plymouth Colony after a religious dispute, and settled in exile with his wife (Kate Dickie) and five children at the edge of a dark forest.<br/><br/>The film's focus is their oldest daughter, Tomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), who is entering a sinful puberty. The girl's position within the family is precarious. Her father loves her; her mother does not; her siblings are about split even. The fact that she was looking after the baby when it disappeared does not improve her standing. The more she is driven into a corner, the harder she struggles, slowly becoming the family's black sheep (or should I say 'black goat'?).<br/><br/>The key to ""The Witch""'s success lies in its characters. More specifically: in the fact that they are not bad people. They are flawed. William is proud; both he and his son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) are liars; Katherine is psychotic; and the young twins are monsters, as children of that age tend to be. But as a family, they do try to live as best they can. You are not dying for these people to meet their end. Instead, you gaze in despair as their world falls apart.<br/><br/>Much of the credit goes to Robert Eggers' work as writer and director. I am spoiled with choice for examples of the amazing skill he displays. One from the beginning: William is talking with his son, Caleb. He is sure a wolf took his baby. As he talks, he picks up a corncob, black with rot. 'We must catch our food if we cannot grow it.'<br/><br/>Amazing how much character, situation, and plot can be glanced from eleven syllables. And sometimes we don't even need the words. Pay attention to the cinematography, how Caleb's looks at Tomasin (in a POV shot) always run over her chest. One small camera movement illustrates the challenges of growing up in such strict circumstances better than any soliloquy.<br/><br/>As you may by now suspect, ""The Witch"" is more of a character drama than a horror film, its story bearing a closer resemblance to ""Through a Glass Darkly"" than to ""The Shining"". But this is the kind of drama that creeps under your skin -- indeed, very much like an Ingmar Bergman film. More and more, witchery begins to feel like a liberation rather than an expression of the darkness that lies within humans.<br/><br/>It just goes to show what careful context brings to a story. The little girl from ""The Exorcist"" can use all foul words known to man without being as disturbing as a puritan boy shouting 'Sin! Sin! Sin!' All because Robert Eggers took fifty witchless minutes to build his characters and their world.<br/><br/>That ""The Witch"" was his first feature film remains hard to believe. In both writing and directing he shows an understanding of his craft that many filmmakers can't hope to reach in a lifetime. One wonders whether he signed some black book himself."

","WHAT A DEBUT FOR EGGERS!!!!
This is a amazing and unusual horror movie. The movie doesn't have any jump scares, it isn't a horror movie for mainstream audiences. The performances are great, the directing and the cinematography are brilliant. It is a one of the best and one of the most beautiful movies of 2015. The writing is intelligent and the story is very interesting and captivating. I love the dialog and how Robert Eggers puts so much effort to be as similar as possible with the time period. I personally prefer The Lighthouse over this one but both are great I am sure Eggers will be a legend of cinema. Also the story is full of metaphors and similarities to the bible and Christianity"
"frankde-jong","7","0","1","13 March 2020"," An horror movie with gives much attention to period details
","When ""The lighthouse"" (2019, Robert Eggers) came out I intended to see also his debut film ""The witch"" (2015). When ""The lighthouse"" turned out to be a disappointment I began to doubt if I would still see ""The witch"". After all I am glad I have done it. ""The witch"", which has much in common with the Estonian film ""November"" (2017, Rainer Sarnet), is a more subdued and a better film than ""The lighthouse"".<br/><br/>""The witch"" has been carefully made. Much effort has been put in getting the period details right. One example of this is the use of antiquated language.<br/><br/>This attention for period details has made ""The witch"" into a multi layered film. Layer 1 has to do with the extent to which the events are shocking for the viewer. Layer 2 concerns the extent to which the events are shocking to the main characters. With respect to layer 2 one has to consider that the main characters are deeply religious people for whom there is no real difference between the natural world and the supernatural world.<br/><br/>The fear for the devil is for them very real. Because the devil can appear in various manifestations (including taking possession of a human being), this fear gives rise to a growing sense of distrust within the family. This fear and the resulting distrust in layer 2 makes the film more tense in layer 1. One can see the same effect in science fiction films in which an alien can take on a human form. See for example ""The invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel) or ""The thing"" (1982, John Carpenter)."

","So it took me 3 viewings of this film. I think the pacing had something to do with that. I wasn't in the right mindset for a horror film this atmospheric. The trailers made it seem like this film would be sheer terror. However, much of the uneasiness comes from the music and the shots. The blood and gore in this was somewhat minimal. Nudity, yes but necessary? Not sure. We have little screen time with the actual coven. But despite the twins trying to ""frame""
their older teenage sister, I guessed less than 1/2 way though the film that she would later become one, or was already one. The black goat was slightly predictable as the devil too. I appreciate this film's pacing, and most of the acting. At times I felt the performance was too restrained, but perhaps the filmmaker was trying to stay true to puritanical times. However, the mother was annoying to me and unfair. But I guess she was right in the end. Too bad she didn't live to see it."
"vangondour","8","0","1","4 December 2019"," A fantastic directorial debut from Robert Eggers
","So I recently watched Robert Eggers directorial debut, the 2015 horror film 'The VVitch' and it was pretty good. I've been excited to see this movie for a while due to the critical and financial success it garnered in it's opening week, I never had a proper chance to view it until now and I can say that I am satisfied.
The film centres around a small family in the 1780s living in a cottage just off the edge if the woods where strange occurrences begin to happen to them and they have no idea what's causing them as they slowly fall into madness pointing fingers at each other. The story is simple yet effective, the thing that helps seperate this film from others that came out in it's time was how it chose to focus on the characters and how they are coping with the situation they find themselves in rather than placing the focus on cheap jumpscares and monster effects. The script really makes you invested in the story and characters to the point where I wouldn't even really class it as a horror movie and more of a fantasy drama.
Like I said this was Robert Eggers first time helming a film and I'd say he did a good job, the directing is crisp and meaningful with a lot of thought clearly put into it. The cinematography by Jarin Blaschke was by far the best thing about the film with plenty of intricate shots and moments that were rather ambitious in scale and I don't believe could've been accomplished without the combined efforts of both the director and cinematographer. The acting was great for the most part although there are some lines and moments that in my opinion could've been done better from the child actors in the film, that being said a lot of the time child actors really suck but these ones actually delivered a convincing performance. The music was great and really helped add to the creepy atmosphere the film was going for.
The primary problem I encountered from having a fully immersive experience was that the characters speak in a very old dialect that I found incredibly hard to understand even at full volume, I eventually had to turn on subtitles to just understand what was actually happening in I had to keep them on for the duration of the movie. No idea if it was just my tv and if i could have had a more fulfilling experience in a theatre, regardless it hurt my enjoyment quite a bit.
Overall The VVitch is a very well crafted piece of cinema from a director who clearly cares about his art. Not sure if I'll ever rewatch it or not but none the less I'd recommend it for it's fantastic presentation."

","This is a creatively fresh entry into the all too frequently cliched horror genre. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting from the small main cast, the original storyline and the historical authenticity brought to the production. However this high regard doesn't extend to the supposedly seventeenth century English dialogue spoken by the characters. I've generally got a pretty good ear for English dialects, but have to confess in this film I only understood around about 25% of what was spoken onscreen. It wasn't just the dialogue itself. It was also the rapidity and pitch with which the words were enunciated which annoyed me. I really would have preferred to be reading sub-titles and since I wasn't watching a DVD, this wasn't possible. It's a pity, because apart from this and the somewhat over-the-top conclusion, which didn't really seem to fit with the ambiguous nature of the rest of the picture, this was a pretty interesting offering."

","Not the first time I've watched this slow burner, and quite controversially I did not enjoy it. A couple of years fly by (faster than an old hag on a broom, might I add) and the film community ever increase their adoration for this horror. Did I miss something on my original viewing? Turns out, I did. A separatist family are banished over a religious dispute and encounter evil forces in the woods that seclude their New England farm. Surreal imagery provokes the inevitable question of ""is it real or imagined?"", and Eggers' directorial debut opens an ominous window into a period horror that transcends its own art form. Accompanied by Blaschke's stunning cinematography, Eggers directs you gently through this New England folk tale that, whilst not genuinely scary, provides a thick layer of uneasy atmosphere. The biggest complaint that is commonly thrown around is how ""boring"" it is. I implore you to grant this beauty another viewing. The pace, particularly during the first and third act, was consistent and well constructed. Balancing a thematic narrative that perhaps hosts too many metaphors, with illusory imagery that enhances the chilling tension that is substantially more effective thanks to Korven's score. No, I suspect the largest hurdle to bypass is the dialogue. Utilising a more unconventional 17th century dialect that, whilst feels freshly authentic, hinders character investment. It's difficult to quantify this choice as a detriment or a blessing. It does visualise the hysteria that culminates from devout Christians, and the fear of sin or corruption if individuals stray too far from the word of God. But due to Ineson's deep voice and Dickie's heavy accent, it is more often than not difficult to fully comprehend the dialogue. Fantastic performances though, but it just somewhat loses its edge with the dialect. I'm still indifferent about the ending, doesn't feel satisfying enough with its ambiguity. Still, I have to say that this is a gorgeous supernatural period drama that perhaps is too unconventional for most audiences."

It is very intense, but its really stupid and by the end, just became goofy.<br/><br/>So as we all know, witches arent real, and the religious persecution of women believed to be witches is a result of cult-like think and fear and possibly mental illness of those who chose to claim they were witches. This movie, however, asserts that witches are 100% real. <br/><br/>Okay.. so lets suspend our disbelief. It is no longer the real world but a world where actual satanic witches who act through satan with magical evil powers exist. Even once you accept that, the behavior of Thomassin is still completely illogical. <br/><br/>It turns out she was right that the goat was satan. She sees her whole family possessed and killed and kills her own mother in self defense. <br/><br/>So she then decides to join the witches. <br/><br/>What??? <br/><br/>She wasn't a witch the whole movie. We saw that. We see it through Thomassin's own eyes. We saw that she didn't harm the baby - an actual witch did. She didn't harm Caleb - an actual witch did. She was an innocent party, not possessed, and instead was trying to help her family. Then suddenly at the recognition that her whole family was dead, she decides to join them and they all float in the air naked around a fire.<br/><br/>I dont think that this young girl who was very plainly asserted to us to be a loving, faithful daughter who was wrongly blamed for someone else's wrongdoings would suddenly join the witches at the end.<br/><br/>So if she actually was a witch throughout the whole movie, as it sometimes is suggested, then they shouldve made it more clear to Thomassin herself. If she noticed herself becoming evil, tried to fight it, but eventually embraced it, then thatd explain her actions. But that didnt happen. She felt innocent, she was innocent and knew it of herself, but she still became evil. Dumb.<br/><br/>Also i would've liked more backstory on the witches themselves and a deeper insight into who they are, where they came from, and why they followed this path. <br/><br/>Personally I think a movie with a similar tone but instead set in the real world wouldve been better. Instead of actual real witches, the family descends into madness and accuses each other of evil until they are all dead from paranoia and anger. Not some floating naked women and a goat. Or at LEAST if theyre going to choose the supernatural path, make it where Thomassin's actions fit within normal human behavior and not just random. It seemed like they didnt know how to end it any other way.<br/><br/>It just felt silly to me."

","I rarely ever write reviews anymore- refuse to rate films on a 1-10 scale- and NEVER watch trailers (you guys who watch them- do you also answer phone calls telling you you've been selected to go on a cruise for free?). I, however, felt the urge to write a little concerning Eggers' The Witch- since I watched (and enjoyed) it and, after reading such disparate reviews I felt like chiming in with my own take. 
I'll let you in on a little secret, if I hear about a film and want to decide if it's worth seeing, I come to IMDB and read the user reviews. If the film has many high AND low ratings from users-it's worth a try. The Witch was just such a film- horror films that are criticized for being ""slow"" and having ""like no plot"" in the low ratings are a slam dunk to be good. 
This is really a very nice little film- but it could have been so much better. I felt that the director was probably made to compromise his vision of the psychological breakup of a Puritan family due to various issues (religious fervor, isolation, jealousy, insecurity, and most importantly the onset of puberty). I find it hard to believe that Eggers ever really intended for the satanic forces to be made visible to the audience (at least not in the sensational way they are)- the viewing of the witch and the baby early in the film destroys the possibility that what is going on here isn't really supernatural at all- and that is the lens through which this film presents its best face. I'd like to think he merely caved to pressure from ""money guys"" to ""sex up his movie"" to please the lower level viewers (and, indeed, he didn't even sex it up enough for those Philistines- who wouldn't know a great film if the screen fell forward onto their laps)- sadly this really hurts the film. I will say, however, that i will be anxiously waiting for his next film with the hope that as he achieves enough success he will be able to present his true vision. Developing."

There's a sense of tension building in the background, though, and the off-kilter moments that stand-out are certainly quite unsettling in their own strange way.

","I just watched this Film and no way would I call it scary , maybe horror but not scary. . I enjoyed the story and actors and settings were good . I would call it a supernatural drama with some horror . As a story it's a bit depressing, as here is a innocent Family who are a good Family beset by Evil and the Devil , as a none believer I have to say where was God ? I would rather have seen a good versus Evil thing with Good beating Evil with a happy ending, as the message I got from this is if this can happen to them what chance have the rest of us got . Another thing that always gets me in these stories of someone selling their Soul to the Devil is what's the point if all you get is to skulk around naked in the Woods ."

","It's rare these days that we see the hysteria and fear that gripped 17th century New England captured on the big screen, but the low-budget 'The Witch' does so in a way that is simple yet chilling.<br/><br/>The story follows a devout family of seven who settle in the wilderness of Massachusetts just in time for things to fall apart. A series of unfortunate events ensue shortly after they take up residence, including the disappearance of the youngest family member (a baby boy), infighting among multiple family members and accusations of deceit and witchcraft. Of course, the latter is what drives the majority of the film, as the young children Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Granger and Lucas Dawson) accuse their eldest sister Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) of the act. Taylor-Joy dominates with her performance, which is not an easy feat considering the film is so depending on acting compared with other elements.<br/><br/>One way 'Witch' succeeds is it is not overt or over the top in what it shows (at least, for the most part). Most of what gives the audience chills is not seen on screen, but it instead implied. Although, the use of devices such as the family's black billy goat is a creative way to send shivers down spines. Another aspect that works well is the gray scale filming style that's used. The coolness of the color used conveys the damp, dark atmosphere and harshness of the environment in an effective way.<br/><br/>To be sure, there are a good deal of disturbing parts in 'Witch.' Some of the scenes are difficult to watch, but again, a lot more is hinted at than is actually shown. Near the film's finale, things unwind at a rapid rate, but this is the culmination of a slow build to the climax.<br/><br/>'The Witch' is not a masterpiece, nor is it one of the more memorable films of its kind to come out in the past few years. But it's a good example of how low-budget efforts can find an audience and rival their much more sophisticated, pricey peers."

","Robert Egger's 2015 film, The Witch, centers around a family in 1630s New England that begins turning on each other after the disappears of the youngest son, Samuel. This film falls into the genre of horror and mystery, and discusses supernatural phenomena of witchcraft. <br/><br/>After the family is banished from their religious plantation, they set out on their own and begin to cultivate a new farm. This leaves the family isolated and their only sense of reality is that which they can plainly see. With no outside witnesses to the horrors that occur, their only truth is based on past assumptions and leaps in logic. To find meaning behind these horrible events, the members of the family begin suspecting one another of witchcraft. For this reason, the film serves as a social commentary on fear and how it negates reason. It also brings up the importance of perception as all ""evidence"" points toward one character.<br/><br/>The scene leading to the infant, Samuel's, abduction shows Thomasin, the eldest daughter, playing peak-a-boo with Samuel. This innocent game foreshadows how Thomasin will be made the villain after Samuel's disappearance. She continually says ""boo"", and later the other members of the family begin to fear her. <br/><br/>While the main archetype shown in the boogeyman, the film also uses the archetype of light vs dark. Particularly, the woods act as the dark, in which mysterious events occur. No one truly knows what is happening, and therefore are literally ""in the dark"". The farm is in an open field and acts as the light. The environment of the farm then mirrors the situation of the characters, which is shown through cinematography. <br/><br/>At times, I found the plot to be unclear, particularly toward the end of the film. The resolution therefore did not seem complete. The left me, the audience member, dissatisfied, especially because this film is a mystery. For this reason, I would rate this film a 6/10."

","I chose this film based on seeing trailers on previous DVDs I had borrowed. The trailers were enticing and intriguing, and I must say, I was not disappointed in taking a chance on this movie. <br/><br/>Set in New England in 1630, The Witch is a period piece that evokes the ignorance, superstition and fear endemic to the culture and people of its time. Like Black Death (2010), its mysticism is couched in religion, in this case related to a Puritan family living on the frontier of New England. They leave a town to establish their own ""farm"", thereby creating a profound sense of isolation. Strange events and occurrences begin to take place, many of them explainable so that we as modern people would take them for granted. Each new incident heightens the tension not only for the family, but also the viewer. It's almost as if we're living with them, participating in their daily chores and life's struggles. And bit by bit, we feel the build-up of palpable distrust and suspicion.<br/><br/>However, what really makes this movie exceptional is the extreme attention to detail used in its creation. Robert Eggers pulled out all of the stops, starting with four years of exhaustive research. The buildings, structures and sets were built with trees felled in the area, using the same old fashioned tools from that era. The fabric and clothing was created using the same techniques that the Puritans used at that time. Mr. Eggers shot the film in natural light, which makes it appear gray and grainy, adding to its gloomy subtext. And he even imported British nationals to play the roles, believing that the accents would make the production even more authentic.<br/><br/>All this being said, this film will probably not appeal to the adrenaline or gore junkies who favor high action zombie and slasher flicks. It's simply not that kind of film. Rather, it is more of a thought provoking movie that explores the uncertainty and unpredictability of a family's journey to a new frontier in a new land."

","This movie is boring, but in a good way. It's about a Puritan family that turns on each other, after they think their daughter is a witch. It turns out a real witch, and the Devil himself were behind the whole ordeal in order to gain another member of their coven. I can see why some people have a problem with this movie, it is rather boring. If you went expecting to see a truly terrifying movie, than I wouldn't blame you if you were disappointed. I happen to find out that it was a slow-burn, and I think I was able to appreciate it much more. The biggest complaint I have with this movie is the dialogue from the dad. Grant it, it is historical to the time being. I had no problem when anybody besides the dad spoke. The dad was impossible to understand, not because of the words he uses, but because of the deep, grunting accent he speaks with. It honestly got frustrating, I had to rewind, and put subtitles on. What is fantastic about this movie, is the cinematography, atmosphere, and the acting is surprisingly good for dealing with so many kid actors. The main girl was excellent, and have a feeling she will be a household name. The movie has an extremely dark, gritty, and depressing feel. Which I think is what they were going for.

","A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.<br/><br/>There are not many films about witches (as opposed to other horror villains). There are even fewer that are actually rather good. And also very few set in the time when witches were still very much believed to exist in the real world. This film is not only very good, but crafts an entire world -- a Salem-ish environment where it is not hysteria but reality.<br/><br/>While there is not much that could be said bad about this film, there is one thing I would like to single out above all else fr praise. The sound design. Wow. The colors, the costumes, the acting and more are all good, but this film is very rich in sound in ways hat we very rarely hear.

","With language based on authentic early 17th century usage and a plot drawn from tales of that time it seems an unlikely film. It's fair to say that some of the dialogue does feel a little forced olde- worlde but that is forgivable. All the cast acted their Puritan smocks off: The youngest children, apparently carefree, exude a menace that only the seemingly innocent can do - there are few things as sinister as children's laughter. The older children are transitioning to early adulthood with pressures and stresses on them (far in excess of today's sheltered teens) contributing to the family's descent. The parents, Anya Taylor-Joy slightly hammy as the disturbed and grieving mother practically swept aside by Ralph (Finchy!!) Ineson's dominance as the father who has sinned - you get the feeling he was taking this VERY seriously. The scenery and lighting are relentlessly bleak and amplify the isolation the family must feel when they (and their livestock...) are expelled from their religious community - a family as dependent on prayers to meet their needs as they are the backbreaking toil they endure every day. The unsettling feeling that something is not quite right grows in the viewer inline with the increasing paranoia, tension and fever induced surrealism within the family. In hindsight the final denouement feels like a false memory or a drug induced hallucination, did that really happen? A 'horror' film that will remain with you on dark autumn days."

","P.S.: At the end the girl ascends, so what?.. First, I personally believe in magic. Second, That can mean that she sadly has bats in her belfry after what happened... Maybe all the family has been torn apart by wolves or bears... Diary is not a camera. <br/><br/>This film is not what it seems to be. First of all, its soundtracks work on building the story while keeping things as natural as possible. <br/><br/>Plus, the plot is not of ""a lick and a promise"" kind; not that fast unfurling anyway. And this is good. During the movie we come to feel that this is what living a castaway life must be / cost. <br/><br/>Robert Eggers saw to it that the actors act freely here and there whenever necessary. This is good too. <br/><br/>The dialogues between the kids themselves and the parents do really reflect the understanding of that era, of course by the help of the language spoken at that time in history there. I mean chasing up the questions in one's mind on life, and expectations, and the evil on Earth; and not going outside of the circle which the Church happens to redraw all the time... Even though the family is forsaken by the same circle... That was the real deal of this movie. <br/><br/>I strongly think that the idea touched on in the movie that everyone will pay for their actions in the afterlife as well as in this one is a real gain from this movie. We seem to forget about being a good person is all this movie about... A ""big"" good! <br/><br/>So, we encourage free thinking, but not to an absurd point. ""You cannot say if anyone can go to Paradise or that cannot go."" Yep. Very good. <br/><br/>Another point; Robert Eggers won't attach faces to the evil forces easily for we only see two faces of the witch coven, and that makes this look more authentic. Also good. <br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy did a good job in maintaining her part (innocent believer that won't at the end hesitate going to the dark side)! I hope you will improve your acting, Ms. Anya.<br/><br/>Ralph Ineson... Oh man, he lived there the whole thing is I can say!.. Such a neo-rural / believer in God / ex-devil dodger kind of guy!.. Keep up the good work Mr. Ralph! <br/><br/>I will give an overall 7.4 to this movie for not only it earned it, but also it did it by touching the very important questions on life... Not a scary- for-nothing kind of film. But a film that builds a strong relation with life and with God / Holy Being at the end. <br/><br/>Here is the 36th Verse of the 3th Chapter of the Gracious Koran on the matter: - When she was delivered, she said: <br/><br/>""O my Lord! Behold! I am delivered of a female child!""- and Allah knew best what she brought forth- ""And the male is not as the female.

","** This Review May Contain Spoilers ** The most impressive attribute that I can detail this film would be the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Looming shots of the woodworks, empty shots of the landmake, being held as tension develops, an ominous soundtrack rattling overhead.<br/><br/>The performances were all very good, especially the child actors which is very rare. I was especially impressed with the younger boy, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), who's looks of fears are still in my head.<br/><br/>The wardrobe design was very well done as well. One of my own gripes though, is the woman who they encounter in the film (A witch in a more, youthful endearing form), was a bit cliché. Black hair, black and red shawl. I'm not sure I entirely liked that.<br/><br/>The first time watching this film, I was completely sucked in and devout to the fears I had taken in.<br/><br/>The scene where they were praying over Caleb's body is perhaps the most climatic moment in the movie.<br/><br/>One other gripe I had, was perhaps, the ending. There are many questions left unanswered. I appreciate it, when they allow there to be the viewer's interpretation as to what happens next, but at the same time, there was so much misunderstanding of the characters as to what was happening, I can see why it would be fair to end there.<br/><br/>This film was excellent, and an impressive first time creation for director Robert Eggers. I look forward to seeing more from him."

","The Witch offers up an oppresively freaky folktale that still manages to go for broke with demented and disturbing stuff, whilst still keeping it moody and reined in in equal measure, walking an admirable tightrope with style on one side, substance on the other. The substance lies in the interpersonal relationships between a hapless New England pioneer family trying to hack it alone in the land, living next to a deep dark forest that serves home to the titular cretin, plaguing their existence at every turn. The style lies in that forest, as well as a musical score that will shake your bones up and then some, accenting a tale of religious dread, insidious distrust and primal paranoia in a time before reason had grasped humanity, it seems. Plus there's a big scary goat called Black Philip who seems sentient, which was enough to give me the creepin willies. The family is booted from a plantation for some vague religious politics involving the haughty patriarch (Ralph Ineson is excellently fervent and riled up). Tryon to start a homestead on their own proves to be one nightmare after another out there though, especially when virginal daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy, a striking beauty) loses the young baby during a split second game of peekaboo on the outskirts of the forest. Things go depressingly downhill from there as the collective sanity of this clan starts to evaporate into feverish mania, while the woods and the witch constantly loom over everything. The dialogue is all period specific which helps with authenticity, and as far as atmosphere goes, you practically drown in it, quite an achievement really. I took quite a long time in getting to see this, and I didn't quite expect then level of literal horror on display. I was thinking it'd be more unseen, metaphorical, slow paced. It really does mean witch though, as well as that nasty damn goat. You'll watch your back at the petting zoo after sitting through this one. Well done."

","""The Witch"" thrives on the suggestion of evil, which is truly the scariest evil of all. The film is based in 1630s New England during the early colonization of America. The characters are God-fearing and they are dedicated to their faith. It is what drove them to America, and it is implied that it is what got them banished from their town just at the start of the movie. The family moves out to the country to start their new home in isolation just outside the woods, and soon their infant child suddenly disappears.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a result of the witch living in the woods, as revealed to us near the start of the film during an incredibly disturbing scene, complete with very unsettling music. The music in this film contributes greatly to its success; it's frantic, upsetting, chaotic, and grating, and it works perfectly to compliment the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>As far as the setting goes, there is a striking attention to detail. The wardrobe, architecture, performances, and especially the dialogue, all done in old English, contribute to an incredibly accurate depiction that sucks the viewer right into that time period. This film heavily relies on its child actors for the majority of it, so thank God each and every one of them managed to have a convincing, realistic performance. The characters' dedication to their religion is ultimately what isolates each one, and causes their ultimate acceptance of evil. Since they follow all of these strict rules without question, it leads each of them to harbor repressed thoughts and hide their actions from each other, leading to a growing paranoia between all of them. It is a disturbing portrait of humanities' inclination towards evil.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the dark, muted color palette evokes a genuine sense of dread. Subtlety is the key here. Something as simple as a shot being held for a little too long can put a viewer on edge. The tall trees in the forest loom over the family at every moment and the dense collection of trees and branches in the shots within the forest give a sense of being trapped and overwhelmed.<br/><br/>The tension that is built in this film results from direction so confident you would never guess this is a debut. Horror movies need a real, universal fear in order to work, and in ""The Witch"" it is the fear that we are all naturally inclined to evil, and there is nothing we can do about it."

","Authenticity provides for a very realistic and satisfying product as is the case with Robert Eggers' inaugural cinematic effort The VVitch: A New England Folktale. Details of northern Colonial life, including Olde English dialect, clothing, buildings, and an overall sense of a primitive lifestyle, compounded with a score featuring a low-tech ensemble, validates Eggers' passion for accuracy and puts the viewer at ease with the realness of the content. Oblivious to the audience, Eggers describes in the special features material how the scent of manure on-set created a more natural atmosphere for the cast. For inspiration and legitimacy, Eggers drew from numerous accounts of historical records, college professors, and local mythology which left no room for scrutiny from subject matter experts.<br/><br/>Set in early 17th century New England, a family of ex-communicated Puritans with 5 young children departs the confines of their once- beloved community to pursue a better life in the name of God. However, an ominous vibe permeates the prospects of their prosperity almost immediately upon departure from civilization. Gradually the family's integrity crumbles as each member develops a suspicion of the other, not to mention Thomasin, the film's central character, whose apparent budding sexuality has made her a natural outcast.<br/><br/>Finally, deprived of suitable living conditions, Thomasin remains the surviving member and desolately gives in to her desires for a life of carnal pleasure at the proposal of the Devil himself. This was quite possibly the most chilling part of the movie--hearing the voice of Lucifer offscreen, in the form of the family billy goat, beckoning the hapless mortal toward salacious comfort.<br/><br/>A consistency of gore and violence was unnecessary for this masterpiece. Classy, clever, creative--this title fits perfectly into the genre that has too many times been a blight on the industry."

","Decided to watch this with a friend, as it had an interesting premise. The start of the film sets the tone and plot very well: we see early American Puritan settlers and a man on trial who gets banished, followed by the man and his family living on a farm in the woods. The film looks as if a slight grey filter has been applied over it, since all the colours look muted. The lone farm and the family's fear of wolves and the woods creates a sense of loneliness, and the film has a lot of long, lingering shots that help drive home the creepiness. The use of Middle English as in the time of Shakespeare served great to set the time of the film, what with the people in those days being more religious and superstitious than today (generally).<br/><br/>The following describes the flow of the film, which some may consider a spoiler, but doesn't outright state the events that happen. Proceed at your own volition.<br/><br/>The film kicks off its plot and tone very well and quickly. It meanders a bit in the middle, but not uselessly so, as each scene has a clear purpose, leading up to the higher points later in the film. The symbolism and reveals in the film are very transparent, with perhaps one exception. The finale is sort of two-part, which is why I feel this film isn't as strong as it could've been. The first part is very strong and tragic, the second part was sort of foreshadowed, but not a logical conclusion in any sense--it was antithesis to the way the character was presented all the rest of the film, in my opinion.<br/><br/>In the end, I enjoyed the film for its atmosphere, and would recommend it to people who enjoy films for that reason, enjoy a bit of horror, and like (or don't mind) historical settings. If atmosphere and a few great actors aren't enough, give it a pass."

They over-explain everything, and leave no room for mystery and genuine horror that comes from the unexplainable.<br/><br/>The Witch takes a completely different approach. It's a brave move, but I daresay the gamble paid off: this movie is a classic in the making. It's a slow-burner, but there is a sufficient amount of interesting things going on at all times.

","I had been anticipating the release of this film for quite a while, and when I seen it for the first time, it felt like the anticipation I had was misplaced. This is not a horror film. Nothing about this movie scared me in the ""conventional"" sense. I wasn't checking in my closet or under my bed for witches after I had seen it. However, this film profoundly disturbed me in its realism. It got under my skin, and I have been thinking about it ever since. This film's primary issue is its sluggish pace. This film felt about an hour longer than it was. I have to admit that I was deeply bored by about the halfway point. It's not like there was nothing going on either; a babe is kidnapped, and the family succumbs to religious hysteria before things start to get downright twisted. But, this film has the most oppressively bleak atmosphere I think I have ever experienced, and I have to say that it wore me out pretty quickly. So much so that I was exhausted and depressed after having finished it, and went and got wasted to pick my spirits up. This is a truly unique film with a very original ending and point of view. I don't know what to think of this film. It's less of a horror movie and more like a very old fashioned fairy tale or folk fable with some very twisted ideas. There are 4 or 5 truly brilliant scenes that provoked thought and got under my skin. There are also 2 scenes where I laughed at how stupid they were ( a crow pecking at a maniacal woman's breast and the face of the witch herself). The ending is bound to be studied in film classes for how thought provoking it is. The director seems to pull the veil from the audience to reveal that he was on evil's side all along. It's an interesting perspective for a director to take, and I can't wait to see what else this director can do. I have mixed feelings for this film. I didn't enjoy this film because of how depressing it is. I wasn't scared at all by it; as it was, quite simply, not scary. But I have to give credit where it's due; this film is well made and has great attention to detail. The acting is... good. A little forced at times, but it's serviceable. I like the ideas this film has more so than the actual film. This film was marketed very poorly. Lots of people will dislike this film because they probably have never seen an art film, and if they had seen one they probably disliked it. I may like this film more if I see it again, but first impressions matter too. Am I right? 6 out of 10 for the ideas being scarier than the film itself."

Then bring in a witch or two and we will be rolling, but no...<br/><br/>I reckon the film makers had the fantastic and sublime ending sorted and then messed about to stick something in front of it but possibly I'm being unfair, I wouldn't know.

","My quick rating - 6,5/10. A sound and great looking movie that plays at the mind more for the horror aspect than it does with gore and loud scare moments. More of a thinking persons horror/thriller that plays out well in the atmosphere created. Even with the moderately short running time of just over an hour and a half, though, this movie seems to drag on quite a bit and may turn off casual moviegoers. Don't let that stop you from seeing a well rounded film that comes at a time where the more gore the better is the norm.<br/><br/>Overall worth a watch but I am slightly unsure what all the media attention was all about. I believe if it were not for this, then many would not have even known about this flick. Being supported by the Satanic Church was odd but effective for the media to jump on."

","This movie is all about atmosphere. Fantastic cinematography, acting by the entire small cast, production, low key score. It's extremely slow, but worth watching for the excellent and unique atmosphere the director managed to create. The language and locations help that too. No stupid jump scares in this one, just a good old classic horror. The plot is based on folklore tales and for me it was secondary to the enjoyment of the film - just put your brains in neutral, don't try to find any sense in was is happening and you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>The cinematography, although rather ""static"", was simply breathtaking. It reminded me of BARRY LYNDON (1975) and COME AND SEE (1985). I don't know what equipment and techniques they used, but the result is excellent."
"derekpulliam","9","0","2","20 July 2016"," The Witch
","Making his directorial debut, Robert Eggers set out to create a horror film that evokes fear in the most bizarre and diabolical ways. The Witch does not resort to jump scares to put the ""scary"" in ""scary movie"". Instead, The Witch relies on a dark atmosphere, haunting imagery, the subject of religion and the consequences of sinning to pull emotions from the darkest depths of your soul. <br/><br/>The Witch starts as a seventeenth century family is thrown from their homes, leaving no choice but to make homestead distant from all civilization. When their newborn baby vanishes, madness begins to pin the family against each other all while something lurks in the very woods surrounding them.<br/><br/>This movie does just about everything right when it comes to a great horror film. Ominous visuals with very tense camera-work involving long shots and quick cuts helping the extremely unsettling aesthetic created. Impressive and convincing acting from all of the cast, especially all the children who actually out perform the adults involved. Mark Korven delivers a spectacularly chilling soundtrack which adds to the already eerie setting presented. The plot itself is like a scary tale you are told as a child around a campfire, and keeps you up that night leaving you thinking whether if something like this could really happen.<br/><br/>The Witch is certainly a distinct movie that might introduce you to elements you have never seen before. When it comes to horror films, The Witch has definitely taken the cake for best of 2016 yet, and I don't really see any upcoming major threats."
"siderite","8","0","3","1 July 2016"," Slow tale of the dissolution of a family
","The movie starts with the banishment of a guy from a colony in America because he was too religious. What an asshole he must have been. Therefore he leaves with his entire family of wife and three children and a babe - plus several goats - to make a life of his own in an isolated cabin. When children start dying in mysterious circumstances, the family starts to break apart, while accusations and fear of witchcraft fly uncontrolled.<br/><br/>I loved this part of the story and I liked that the pace is slow and uncomfortable. Nothing really happens other than see backward people do backward things and then suffering for it, but the acting is good, the pain is transmitted well and you kind of understand how they get to where they're getting.<br/><br/>The part that I didn't like is that with all the setup, they had to introduce a few scenes with ""the witch"", which was absolutely superfluous. If they would have shown no witches and kept the viewer guessing, the impact would have been greater, I believe. Also, with a supernatural cause for everything the writer/director denies the viewer the choice of believing in God's salvation, in the possibility of controlling the situation by ordinary folk or of any hope for the ending. It's just like ""Bambi meets Godzilla"", the outcome is pretty much set. Add a slow pace to this and I am sure people will be upset of how nothing happens and when it does is inconsequential. Other than this one - important - detail, I liked the movie.<br/><br/>Therefore I urge you to tweak the story in your heads when you watch the film. Consider all witchy things hallucinations of the people involved. Then you will find some meaning in the whole thing.<br/><br/>P.S. for some reason I couldn't stop thinking of the video for KillSonik - Slaughterhouse, so that may have thrown me off a bit, too :)"
"jamesaabdallah","6","0","1","1 July 2016"," The Witch sells itself on something it barely does
","The Witch is a movie that can be explained as ""alright"". The Witch can be quite immersive at times, but it became apparent that the director had an idea that he strayed away from at some points. It seemed like some scenes were literally added to show some imagery that added absolutely nothing to film at all. That being said, some of the scenes in this movie were disgusting and unnerving in the best way possible. Some scenes felt out of place and kind of pointless, like the siblings bickering for seemingly no reason other than to take up time. It almost felt like this should have been time used for character progression because honestly when the characters died I found myself not really caring. The film kind of went out of its way to explain everything to you and there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but when something isn't blatantly explained or shown to you when everything else was(specifically the scene when the dog died vs. when the two children were stolen by the witch at the end), it adds a disconnect in the story telling and makes me wonder why they would go out of their way to show a dead dog but not the two dead children which were the reason why the girl's parents thought she was a witch to begin with. These issues resonated with me enough to probably not give it another watch because I'll become irritated with the lack of attention to the story that this film relies on to stay remotely interesting. If more things were to happen in this movie I would probably give it a higher score but honestly not much happens and when things to happen it seems like they're just happening for the sake of happening, so I found myself not really caring about the sister scaring the little girl by the river for literally no reason. I found myself wondering why she did that the whole movie because it just screwed her over in the long run. Also, why was the goat decided to be the devil? It seemed like that was kind of random. They didn't mention that the entire movie but for some reason at the end it was the devil. When did the children talk to the goat? Like once or twice maybe. Overall, the movie sold itself on the aspect of imagery and I can say that the aspect that movie made itself so keen on showing you were one of the least prevalent things throughout the bulk of the movie. The awesome scenes only slightly outweighed the misguided story telling of literally nothing happening throughout this movie. 6/10"

","I hate Morden day audience when it comes to horror.<br/><br/>I saw ""The VVitch'' back in early March and I thought it was decent, but I didn't understand what all the fuss was all about. Yeah, it looked nice and it had a chilling atmosphere but that's the only thing I got from it. Well, to be fair, I think I was the only one that I liked this movie compared to my friends and family, as they thought the movie was terrible. I liked the movie but I thought it was kind of slow, I was a bit confused at times and the movie didn't stick with me after it was done. If I was reviewing this back in March, I would probably give this movie a 3/5.<br/><br/>But after re-watching the film, I actually liked it even more and there was a lot of things that I can't believe I missed on my first viewing. I don't know how to explain it, but I had this uncomfortable feeling from watching this that I never experience the first time. This is a horror movie that exceeds in film making, it's freaky score and it's gloomy atmosphere that really made this film a true horror.<br/><br/>This is a great psychological horror film that can really get under the your skin. I started to notice little details that really made this movie freaking scary when you understand the meaning of it. This doesn't have any stupid jump scars that deflates tension or just any horror movie tropes that we've seen million times already, but that's nowhere to be seen in the ''The VVitch''.<br/><br/>THANK GOODNESS!<br/><br/>Oh and the cinematography is this movie is just flawless. I'm starting to notice a trend in indie horror movies today - With the shots being perfectly set up and the very little use of light that really adds to the atmosphere to this film.<br/><br/>Thank you Robert Eggers for your brilliant direction and movie."

"paulsanchez-72946","7","0","3","6 June 2016"," A beautifully presented box full of nothing
","So last night I saw The VVitch: A New-England Folktale. I was very excited to see this movie, having been swept up by the hype that preceded it, and, in all fairness, the trailer looked honestly promising. But perhaps because of these high expectations I was a bit let down. The psychological horror is decent, but the film is never really terrifying. Based on script alone, the movie doesn't deserve much more than a pass. Beneath all the period costumes and baroque language is a rather plain – and sometimes even downright badly written – story. But because, thankfully, a movie is made of more than just script, I was able to enjoy the other things it had to offer. One has to praise Mark Korven's chilling score (I could swear the violin pizzicati on the track Caleb's Seduction imitate a witch's cackle), the animal acting (arguably better than the human acting), and Jarin Blaschke's clever cinematography, which doesn't only create a genuinely creepy atmosphere thanks to its consistent palate of grays and use of natural light, but also uses a rather unusual 1.66:1 aspect ratio, a very subtle change that makes the shots more claustrophobic and gives the audience the queasy feeling that something isn't quite right. The research behind the movie is also noteworthy; the dialogue is based on writings from the period, making it pretty close to what real 17th century New England dialogue must have sounded like (there was even some well-informed accent coaching going on), and the period clothes and settings are very convincing (although its nerve-wrecking how the protagonist's braid remains un-tussled through wind and rain). Even the witchery depicted is historically accurate: a shunning of society and convention to connect with a raw primeval force of nature, rather than with the supernatural Satan, which is Western filmmaking's usual take on devil-worship. Anyway, if you like unusual flicks, period films and psychological horror, you should check it out. If you're a fan of fast-paced blood and gore, not so much."

The film is going somewhat slow, filled with lies, hypocrisy. It is good to be mentioned that they used You and Your, not only Thee and Thy, BUT I personally like that the dialogue is spoken in the Old English rather than in the 'New' one. The VVitch is really wrapped in the veil of mystery, suspense and soft shock. The only character who irritated me is the one of Mercy. That little 'spoilt child' really jumped on my nerves like a crazy squirrel, but – all in all – the cast is very good and the acting as well. The VVitch herself is scary enough. And it has some scenes that made me react like Ew... I rated it with a score of 8, because of the time it was set, language used, acting, actors. Very well done, Robert!

","Witches have always been the source of myriad emotions - and that in this, our enlightened age, the 21st century. 'The Witch' (stylized as The VVitch) is more of a fable - almost a surreal catechism from the 17th century. It is not, of course, something that judders your bones and causes you to jump out of your seat. Rather, the atmosphere puts us back in the New England of the Puritans. Would you question God and if you do, well you have pledged your allegiance to the devil is the circumstance in which we find ourselves.<br/><br/>Robert Eggers remarks that the film was made to be a Puritans nightmare, something directly out of the mind of a 17th century New England-er. And such a nightmare, given its time would have to be purely inherited. We are treated to how this nightmare is inherited as well, with a father-son sequence that isn't about bees and birds but more about how humans are born and bred in sin and redemption is a distant dream. Never are we allowed to distance ourselves from the fact that the family who's life we are deposited into do not exactly have a happy life of living off their produce. William, the head of the family,banished from the plantation where he lived and farmed with his then pregnant wife, sons and daughters builds a modest farm at the edge of the woods. The rest of the story is designed to be and works as a beautiful bed time horror story.<br/><br/>Before we get to the actors, I would be remiss if I did not mention that Robert Eggers is first and foremost a production designer, someone who believes in and I quote 'if I got asked for dirty green curtains, I gave them the best dirty green curtains they'd get'. The proof of course is the clawing natural light photography, faithful production design, costumes and imagery. His sense of design extends and is shared by his team in researching New England Puritan history and most of the dialogue helps in the time travel we are subject to. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke and composer Mark Korven lend beautifully atmospheric imagery and background score so much so that at a certain point in the tension, silence has already etched a melody in our minds.<br/><br/>The cast in the meanwhile almost seem as committed to the movie as the Vatican was to killing off women of wisdom in the middle ages. Ralph Ineson, Anya Taylor-Joy, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson comprise the entire cast save a couple of supporting actors. Not only does keeping a small circle of actors the main cast pay off in terms of keeping us engrossed to their fate, it also shows us the darkness that descends on them. The actors are almost fiercely committed to the movie, mouthing their 'thou''s and 'thy''s with such casual conviction that we are sucked into the soul of their plight. Anya and Kate Dickie in particular, and it should come as no surprise, are brilliant in their characters.<br/><br/>Without going into too many details, 'The VVitch' if it were necessary to be described in comparison would be in the same coven as 'The Shining'. Moody, atmospheric, generative and degenerative, the images flicker across the retinas like out of a crystal ball that has told you the future, murky and realistic at the same time. When a cold dreary sky is offset by a thick brownish grey wood, when the wind blows across a reinforced barn roof and howls down the chimney, when the rising full moon is blurred by the cast of a shadowy fear - 'The Witch' wins you over in the chills it sends down your spine. It is not to be missed - a classic concocted in genius fashion in the masterful hands of Robert Eggers, Jarin Blaschke and Mark Korven."

","This is my first return to IMDb reviews in a while. I am doing my review on account of the message board thread entitled A Slow Burn Into Nothingness. That could be considered good or bad depending on the interpreter. I called my review Blair Witch Prequel? because it could almost work as such. Two films of a different camera style ultimately achieving the same goal. Minimalist entertainment through symbols and suspense. The end result is also equivalent. you've heard the hype, now see the movie! Either you love it at the end or you feel duped. Both films have that kind of story that make you wonder whether what you are seeing has any supernatural elements or if the people are just going mad of their own accord. I find myself hard pressed to say whether or not I truly liked either film. Each one has a quality and level of talent that I respect. The Witch probably more so. However the buck stops with the expectation factor, and what the audience wants from a so called Horror Movie. Both of these films fall somewhat flat in the scares department. In terms of disturbing imagery The Witch does a great job, but somehow it lacks purpose. Even old ghost stories of the early 1900s seem to have some particular point to them. I'll admit, I felt in terms of what this film offers in terms of cinematography, style, music, and acting it is damn near perfect. What's missing is the ability to care for the characters. Even the annoying kids of The Blair Witch Project managed to make me worry about them. <br/><br/>So I'm writing this in agreement to those who were disappointed by this movie, and at the same time defending it to those who outright hate it. It ending up making me think about it a little longer, and I certainly appreciated the quality of the atmosphere, and imagery, Therefore I retain A great feeling of respect, yet remain wishing it could've somehow been ""more"". <br/><br/>I have decided it would make sense as a good prequel to The Blair Witch Project, but in the end you'd have a double bill to provide that slow burn into Nothingness, and I'm not sure that's a good thing unless that's what you are looking for in a film. I myself prefer a little more intensity either in urgency of dialogue or in connection to the sequence of events unfolding. This film covers all the marks, but somehow lacks any emotional appeal.<br/><br/>I guess in terms of more recent Horror, only The Conjuring will remain at the top of my list awhile longer.. Even though it started out better than it finished, it's the first modern horror film that left me invigorated and excited about it afterwards. Kudos to The Witch for trying, and being unique enough to stand out above the crowd. Next time more cowbell!"

","Forgoing the jump scare and gore tactics that have inhabited and tarnished the horror genre over the last decade, first time filmmaker Robert Eggers has with his old English folktale The Witch (a film Jordan nominated as his most anticipated of the year) created an utterly unnerving and moody piece of horror filmmaking that whilst won't have audiences covering their eyes, will most certainly have them squirming in their seats and feeling incredibly uneasy during and after proceedings.<br/><br/>Tinged with the religious zealously and witch fearing pandemonium that infested the landscape in which The Witch is based in, Eggers has created something refreshingly unique with his picture, from the Ye Olde English dialogue which itself is based on writings of the day, through to the atmospheric capturing of its countryside and regardless of genre, The Witch is undoubtedly one of the most effective films in some time concerning its ability to draw the viewer into its particular mood, which in this case is pure palpable dread from its first frame through to its last horrific hoorah.<br/><br/>Centering this period tale almost exclusively within the confines of a Puritan Family's lowly farm, after their fatherly patriarch William (played effectively by Ralph Ineson) is excommunicated by a local plantation community and the family is banished to the edges of woods that are quite possibly haunted by a witch or witches, Eggers manages to draw out scene after scene of tension riddled family and spiritual dramas that are expertly crafted and effectively played out by its actors.<br/><br/>Showcasing skills as a writer and director, The Witch also signals Eggers ability with actors and in particular young performers with both Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw as well-meaning brother and sister Thomasin and Caleb respectively delivering above average turns for actors of their age and tasked with delivering hefty material, The Witch finds itself in safe hands whenever these two teenagers take center stage. It must also be noted that Eggers shows himself a deft hand with animals as well, Black Phillip the goat and a seemingly nefarious bunny rabbit hold their own in this not for the faint of heart experience.<br/><br/>Not a film for those that have become accustomed to their horror in the form of cheap Hollywood knockoffs and anthologies that have lasted long after their use by dates, The Witch may not be perfect horror but it's about as close as your likely to get in today's climate and based on this memorable and disquieting experience (who or what exactly is the titular witch?), Eggers is a filmmaker that could well be the savior of modern day horror, not a bad feat by a director on debut.<br/><br/>4 thirsty crows out of 5"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""The VVitch"" (2015) is kinda disappointing flick to start with. It has a very good premise, settings are good, and overall tone was nice, as well as acting by all involved. But the thing that disappointed me was not the very clear narrative. I love when horror movies plays with you straight, like ""The Conjuring"" or (my favorite ever) ""The Exorcist"", but ""The VVitch"" is another type of horror film. It doesn't show you things straight, and i'm not sure that i understood the ending well. I messes with you, but at the end it doesn't have this ""punch line"", it's more like a mystery movie then a really horror film.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The VVitch"" is OK movie, not a mainstream horror picture by any means, so if you like to watch some good creepy horror movie alone by in the late night, it will do it's job in terms of overall tone, but as a horror movie it's a miss. Still, OK movie but not a horror movie experience i was looking for."

","I went into this one with high expectations, I'd read various commentary suggesting how terrific it was.<br/><br/>Alas, it would seem I was mislead. This feels rather more like a rehash of one of the Salem Witch movies, but this time it's just one little family who are seemingly failures at farming, and seem equally inept at hanging onto their children or preventing them from going in religious rapture against each other.<br/><br/>Overall the best and most interesting (amusing really) part was the fathers reference to 'an unholy union with a black goat' directed at the twins who seem to be about six years of age. The goat will have his reckoning however which is one of the better parts of the entire movie. Of all the acting going on here, this goat is sure to get a follow-up job, perhaps in marketing for PETA?<br/><br/>Whilst dark and broody, there is little else here for the horror genre, the 'witch' who like all before her seems to live in a basic leaf covered lean-to in the forest is a little creepy for all of her very brief appearance if more so than her seeming interest in 11 year old boys, 1 year old boys, rabbits and goats. Ultimately the 'horror' comes not in the form of the witch, but in a place you probably don't anticipate early on, but it's not really horror, its more just gore for the purpose of having it.<br/><br/>The acting is actually very good, it is just the script that really lets this movie down, and the absence of any particularly good story or character development. There is, as one should expect, a lot of god squad praying and religious mania, I imagine the modern equivalent of this ignorant zealot nonsense would be a Donald Trump rally or an anti gay marriage meeting - there is just a little too much prayer and a little too much action going on, however I imagine that is fairly typical cause and effect as far as praying goes. The mother of all these children is as mad as a hatter, completely bonkers as again we all too often get with religious nut cases.<br/><br/>If you like dark and brooding, black goats, religious mania, crazy mothers and Paedophile witches then this is the film for you, if however your tastes verge more on the normal and sane, and you look for more than dark screens and suspect goats in your horror, I would look elsewhere."

","I've been looking forward to seeing this movie as I'm a huge horror fan but after watching it I'm a little bit disappointed by the lack of actual scares in the film. In all other aspects it's really well crafted; the cinematography is stunning, the acting is great and the authenticity of the time period is impressive. I liked the storyline but I found the execution a little bit confusing. The witch is shown at the start of the film dispelling any mystery and what follows is mostly a psychological drama following the family of the story as they question the bizarre occurrences that are unfolding due to the witch's magic. The dialogue is in old English but still easy to follow, the actors do a wonderful job of delivering the lines and getting into character. I thought the direction was good but I did wish it was actually scary rather than, in my opinion, mostly just being creepy and atmospheric. I wanted something more terrifying or bizarre but in the end it was, bar a couple of occasions, quite restrained even when depicting mystical goings-on. I thought the imagery could have been heightened but it's all very realistic which struck me as an odd choice, I just felt that it could have had a little bit more to it. I would definitely recommend checking this out as it has some good moments and a very rich moody atmosphere but don't expect to be blown away or particularly scared."

","I was expecting an ""artsy"" horror film. But this isn't really a horror film at all. It's a moody meditation on what happens when absolutist and unsustatinable thought meets the sustainability of chaos. <br/><br/>I've heard this film described as Satanic, but this rings true only if you define the Satanic as the intentionally chaotic, as the rejection of any form and order. It acknowledges only the limitation of the body, which is to say death, which is to say the limit of mortal knowledge. <br/><br/>The cinematography is magnificent, brilliantly capturing the lighting of the pre-electric world at least as well as did The Revenent. This is true wilderness, and its unknowability as such is thus much more believable on its own terms than was that of the woods of Von Trier's ""Antichrist"", a work, it must be said, to which this film owes much of its forest-as-cruelty imagery. <br/><br/>The person who can live with chaos is necessarily a by-product of a society that seeks to avert it, and the only person who can survive in this natural chaos is not inherently ""evil"", they are only thrown into a situation in which their natural strength reveals itself in relation to their peers. They are simply the only one with the strength to see the option of choosing the chaos of nature."

","The Witch is Robert Eggers' directorial debut, he also wrote the film. It tells the story of a family that is banned from New England and moves into a farm in the middle of nowhere in the 17th century. There, they start to experience weird things as there may or may not be a witch causing trouble nearby. I'll just start off by saying I really liked The Witch, but I think a lot of people will be disappointed in the movie because it's really not a conventional horror film. <br/><br/>In all honesty, parts of the first act kind of bored me. There were parts in the beginning of the film where the movie does slow down a lot and I actually nearly fell asleep. But that's where I realized this movie was more about the characters than the actual witch. It's a film about this struggling religious family and how they react to this certain type of situation. Even if the first act was pretty slow and I didn't know where it was all going, nearing the second act of the film, all of the third act and especially the ending was amazing. It is a movie filled with tension, every scene is filled with it. You feel like something could happen at any moment. <br/><br/>There are many things in the movie that just blew me away: the directing is brilliant, the cinematography is beautiful and surprisingly, the acting was spectacular, especially from Anya- Taylor Joy who plays Thomasin, the main character. Her performance is brilliant and I really hope to see her in more films in the future. The score is haunting and really fits the movie's tone and the editing is pretty unconventional and I loved it. The editing lets you in at take a peek at the horrific things happening, but it never gives away too much information and it really is a prime example that the things you don't see are more terrifying than the things you do see.<br/><br/>One of the things I really liked about the movie was that it felt pretty real and accurate. It's a very good depiction of the 17th century I believe and one thing in there that was great was the dialogue. Everyone speaks in old English. You know, like ""How art thou this morning?"" And things like that made the film feel real. The dialogue is kind of hard to follow but I can't really say that's a negative because it's built into the fabric of the film and how it wants to be more realistic.<br/><br/>The last act and the ending is some of the best horror I have seen in years, maybe even ever. It's so gripping and tense and I just felt dirty and disturbed after watching it. It got under my skin in the best way, I thought the Witch was terrifying. However, like I said I think most mainstream movie-goers will be disappointed in the film, because there are no unnecessary jump scares and the movie moves pretty slowly.<br/><br/>Besides from a few boring parts, I loved the Witch. It's a brilliantly crafted film, tonally perfect and scary as hell, too. One other thing I really liked is that this movie features some blood and gore at parts but it was never like violence for the sake of violence. The violent parts of the movie were there because the story needed it.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Just saw this at the theater. I think it is worth seeing because I just plain believed the drama playing out on screen. This is because the acting was very good. It looked beautiful (of course). And the writing was believable.<br/><br/>Basically there's a family patriarch in colonial America who pulls up stakes at his village and tries to resettle out in the wilderness over some kind of moral/religious disagreement with the town elders. The strain of living off the land all on their own, then, is naturally no good for the friction in the family. To top it off, their isolation makes them vulnerable to a coven of witches in the forest nearby who kidnap, murder, and/or craftily turn them on one another.<br/><br/>I'll get the flaws out of the way: the movie has an annoying, pretentious habit of lingering on certain shots for WAY too long. Yes the acting and writing is really good, I really do feel like I'm in the 1600s with this family to whom religion is the center of existence. But the camera freakin lingers on the boy Caleb getting a bandage around his chest for what feels like half an hour... On an agonizingly slow pan up to the treetops of the forest while loud and dissonant music brays like a wounded jackass... It distracts from the narrative and almost feels like a film student who's smitten with his own brilliance.<br/><br/>Also Caleb's death scene was really stupid and drawn out. It clubbed me over the head with ""CRAZY POSSESSED CHILD HIJINX"" so hard that I almost got a concussion. There's a strange feeling I got that the movie, like, makes you expect something cool to happen (like, I dunno, the mutation scenes in John Carpenter's ""The Thing""), but they never do... We just get actors acting crazy and fake blood and loud music. Kinda like a hamburger without the patty.<br/><br/>One exception was a scene involving a crow and a bloody boob. That was clever and a little creepy.<br/><br/>But still, the movie is interesting because it somehow rings true. It said it was based on true accounts of witches, and I believe it. Witches are not nice. They do not mean well. They are monsters who hate everything good, and Christianity is the only thing that really challenges them. There may have been a few good reasons behind the witch hunts."
"Ben_Cap","6","0","3","28 February 2016"," Something lost along the way
","I have always preferred horror movies based around tension rather than gore or jump scares. When I first saw a trailer for The Witch it seemed like the perfect horror movie for me. The time period and setting are even enough to bring chills just thinking about it but I am sad to say that these are probably among the best features of this movie. The Witch fails in so many ways that I am having trouble remembering the few things in which it succeeds, and those few things are not nearly enough to save this disaster.<br/><br/>I don't want to make this review a list of things I hated about the movie followed by praise for Anya Taylor-Joy so I will begin with her performance. Really the only highlight of the movie, Anya Taylor-Joy brought the fear out of not only the terrible things happening, but also the feeling of being trapped as she was. Her character was the only one who I really felt for through the movie as all of the other characters were dis likable for the most part.<br/><br/>I guess I will start with the story and whatnot since that is probably my biggest complaint. The story goes nowhere. The plot seems to be a series of boring farm chores and deep prayer scattered with a few moments of fear. There was no sort of effort to make the story circular, or to really even bring many of the things brought up in the beginning to a satisfying conclusion. The old saying of ""Don't show a gun in the first act if you aren't going to use it in the third"" is disturbingly broken here. The worst part about the story is that it is not even innovative. The normal worn out horror genre format is here with the first hour of the movie being a crawl with a brief moment is horror splashed in. Then the last half hour aims to shock and disturb leaving the last 15 minutes for the real scares. The Witch does all of this poorly as none of the moments of tension hit nearly as hard as they think and the overall payoff is not clever or satisfying.<br/><br/>The direction of the movie is filled with close up reaction shots that most of the time amount to nothing. The camera will show a character horrified and then when the viewer finally gets to see what is so interesting it always ends up disappointing. There were absolutely no shots in this movie that were really impressive. The look of the movie actually was also impressive, but when juxtaposed with basic camera placement and movement it just offsets each other.<br/><br/>Good horror movies are a dime a dozen these days, but The Witch seemed like it had a good understanding of how to make a good one. Again the time period and subject are a wealth of entertainment for this genre but the makers of this movie got lost somewhere along the way. I would not recommend this to anyone other than people who really like horror/thriller movies just to let them have an opinion. In my opinion this one is an easy pass."

","THE VVITCH (2016) A Review by JP February 27, 2016 9 Evil Goats (out of 10)<br/><br/>Since I've caught half-hate over my love of ""The Babadook"", bear in mind I enter each film (particularly horror), with a clean slate, an open mind, and a willingness to be scared. More often than not, I leave disappointed. That was not the case with this indie epic horror film that exudes with Kubrickesque qualities, most eloquently in the cinematography & music. I heard haunting hymns from ""The Shining"" while my partner heard ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". In every single frame, a composition by which a photography class could be taught. The lighting was exceptional and imbibed the overall mood of dread that amassed throughout an expertly-paced 90-minute runtime. Truly disturbing situations arise. Though tastefully done, the imagery is sure to sustain long after leaving the theater. I could feel the anxiety from the handful of others in the theater with us. I could not tell if they were impatient by the 10-15 extra seconds that would typically be cut from modern forms of horror or the unsettling images just out of sight but definitely not out of mind. Once the 10 distributor logos cleared the screen (which gave me a deeper appreciation from the get-go the many trials this gem had to traverse in order to craft success), much like my favorite Kubrick picks, my eyes would not dare leave the screen. This dark historical piece, genuinely creepy to the point of traumatizing, actually scary when the time was right, and acted with a maturity void from so many films nowadays, especially child actors. Summarized credit where it is duly-earned, in order of noteworthiness (cast first): Anya Taylor-Joy, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ralph Ineson, Katie Dickie, (& crew) composer Mark Korven, Jarin Blaschke's Oscar-worthy eye for the light, also kudos to the dozen+ producers, including Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potters 1 & 2), and writer/director Robert Eggers.

The desperation of trying to hold on to your family and way of life. The performances of the actors were tremendous and very believable. The mother/ daughter relationship was well done - the daughter looking for her mother's acceptance and approval, the Mother always at odds with her. The younger siblings that were as annoying as today's younger siblings. The bond between the siblings. The setting, so lonely and isolated.

The music - I liked parts, but hated how the music would rise and get louder only to simply end in literally nothing significant. It would simply change to a black screen and then a new setting. While the music was exotic, it failed to match the tempo of the scenes. The dialogue was hard to hear and at time I could not make out what was being said because of both the accent and the old style language.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend seeing this movie - but I do think that it could wait until it is available on demand."

","The VVitch is a movie written and directed by Robert Eggers. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, and Harvey Scrimshaw, along with Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson.<br/><br/>A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.<br/><br/>The VVitch is a 'horror movie' like no other. It manifests itself inside the viewer creating a genuine feeling of dread and anxiety as it becomes more and more apparent how inescapable the situation truly is. This dread and anxiety is reflected onto the silver screen as the characters understand their predicament slightly later than the audience.<br/><br/>Though I did thoroughly enjoy The VVitch, I can definitely a large number of people hate it as everything about it seems so damn impenetrable. This is mainly due to the quaint setting and the fact that this movie isn't a true horror movie or even thriller. What it is, is a rich period piece that finds its depth in its heady yet poignant themes.<br/><br/>Writer, Robert Eggers, understands the kind of movie he desires to make and does it with much gusto. He wanted to design a heated family drama under the masquerade of a supernatural thriller. This is no easy task as Eggers makes the active choice to keep the characters in the dark, while feeding the audience provocative twists on the age old story. This works quite well in constructing a tense and morbidly dark atmosphere that succeeds at making the viewer feel helpless with no real reason why. Emphasizing build up instead of cheap results and firm grasps on familial ties, paranoia, extremest mindset, the script of The VVitch is deeply disturbing yet pristine in its construction and subtext. Though tedious for some, and a joy for others, one thing is universal in both parties: the distaste seemingly tidy conclusion. For a movie that packs so much creative bite, an ending that boasts some interesting twist or an open ended yet arguably conclusive was definitely necessary. Eggers decides to go in a different, more definitive, end. This is frustrating since on first glance it seems too simplistic for a movie that is anything but. This is a complete fallacy as the straight forward, strict ending demonstrates the amount of nuance behind the main character in surprising and dour ways.<br/><br/>The main character, Thomasin, is brought to life with full autonomy by Anya Taylor-Joy, who as a first time actress, delivered a surprisingly seasoned performance. She is assisted by Ralph Ineson who gives an equally dedicated performance. Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was Harvey Scrimshaw progressively improving performance, that really stole a handful of crucial scenes almost seamlessly.<br/><br/>The direction in this movie was also surprisingly as Eggers makes some very smart calls as he uses exaggerated pans, wide shots, and moving shots as he truly brings out the setting while building the atmosphere, however this does drastically slow downs the pace which somewhat works against the progress made. He also uses an abundant compelling amount of imagery resembling fairy tales like Red Riding Hood and the Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, which in turn stimulates childhood fears and subverts them. This is matched by the dreary yet realized cinematography and the ominous score. <br/><br/>The VVitch is a Unsettling masterwork of horror cinema that's brilliance is realized by his great ambitions. The VVitch gets an A or a 9/10."

","William and his family have to find a place to live after they are banished by the elders, and find a spot in the New England wilderness at the edge of a forest. Little do they know that the forest is inhabited by a witch (what are the odds, huh?). Anyway, strange things happen in and around the farm. Since they are Puritans they can't figure out what could be wrong, since they are extremely religious and obey God's commandments. So they search for an answer.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is well acted and pays great attention to detail, and to outward appearances recreates life on an early 17th century farm. The family's speech is sprinkled with 'thee's' and 'thou's', and, although the film is in color, it is washed out to lend the feeling of austerity and adds to the bleakness of the landscape. I thought Kate Dickie, who plays the mother of the piece was outstanding. Not sure if they give Oscar noms to actors in indies of this type, but if so, she would qualify. I also wonder if life on a 17th century farm was as lethargic as depicted here.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" is more of a melodrama than a horror film but there are a few scary moments. Speaking for myself, I get tired of trying to connect the dots of this type of movie, where you must chalk up natural aberrations and illogical circumstances to The Supernatural. The picture contains the usual defiance of reason which has no explanation except whatever you assign to it. And so you make a colossal effort to suspend your disbelief to make it all work. This is the second horror movie in a row for me, having seen ""Southbound"" last week. ""The Witch"" has better production values but ""Southbound"" was more entertaining and moved at a quicker pace."

","I came into the theater expecting to see your typical horror movie- ya know with jump scares and an unnecessary amount of blood, but this movie was different. It actually had a great plot and great acting.<br/><br/>The movie has two elements of horror, the witchcraft and the family turning on each other. The things that are left unseen are actually the scariest.<br/><br/>It reminds me of the Shining in the way that the family slowly loses their minds AND there is some supernatural things going on. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie! It is genuinely disturbing and interesting. I give this movie an A!"

","I haven't been scared of witches sinceÂ…well, never. As I child, I was more frightened of creepy dolls and serial killers (probably the result of a premature viewing of Child's Play); witches just reminded me of Maggie Smith dressed up as Minerva McGonagall. While watching Robert Eggers's The Witch, I was genuinely creeped by witches for the first time in my life.<br/><br/>In early 17th century New England a puritanical pilgrim, William, (Ralph Ineson) is at odds with his plantation's church. In an act of religious pride he moves his family outside the plantation's walls and into the unsettled Northeastern wilderness. However, when William's daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), allows the newborn to suddenly vanish, the family begins to descend into chaos.<br/><br/>Going into the theater, I was anticipating reviewing The Witch as a genre film, but don't be fooled by the title; Eggers (the film's rookie writer and director) has far loftier aspirations. The script is thematically dense and every element of the film, from the lighting to the camera movement and placement, compliments those themes. The dialogue, too, is, at times, almost impenetrable and undeniably ambitious. Don't expect cheap jump scares or a threadbare plot.<br/><br/>This, alone, would keep The Witch firmly entrenched in the realm of pretentious art films, but in Eggers, and his entire team's execution of these ideas, the work is magnificently elevated. It is a tonal masterpiece. From the beginning montage, where we are introduced to the world of the supernatural, to the ending's chillingly satisfying final image, you can see the meticulous calculation that went into the making of this movie. The result is a slow burn that never feels boring, but instead leaves you waiting, in anxious anticipation, for a moment of terrifying climax. Moments like that are why we go out to the movies. There's nothing better than that sense of fulfillment, especially when it's tinged with a lingering psychological thrill.<br/><br/>My lone misgiving with the film, though, lays with the acting, Perhaps, in his concentrating on the stunning visuals, Eggers ignored his child actors, who periodically seem lost in the script's archaic diction. The adults are fine, and I was mesmerized by Ineson's gruff, haunting voice, but young Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) are occasionally grating, and distractingly so. Even Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), who nails his important exorcism scene, falls flat on a few of the lower-key scenes. Taylor-Joy is the lone exception. She is mesmerizing throughout, and I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes a breakout star as a result of her work here.<br/><br/>Those few hiccups won't ruin the film for a student looking for an interesting, new scary movie to occupy a study break, though, and for cinephiles searching for the next, modern horror classic, The Witch is your ticket."
"gkors","8","0","3","22 February 2016"," Don't Expect Jump Scares, Expect Real Scares
","I am very hesitant to go see horror films in the theaters because most of the time they only provide the cheap thrills of jump scares and do not really have any actual ""horror"" to them and I always leave the theater feeling cheated. I took a gamble with The Witch and boy oh boy I was not disappointed. The combination of the authentic feel of colonial New England, the devout God fearing family, the foreboding woods, the bone chilling musical score, the brief glimpses of the actual witch and chaos she creates, all of it works so perfectly together.<br/><br/>Now I would not recommend this movie to everyone. The tension and horror slowly builds for over an hour until the final act so if you are impatient and want a beginning to end nonstop horror ride then you will be disappointed. The movie starts out quickly with the abduction of the baby Samuel (along with a VERY disturbing scene that shows you the extreme evil the family is facing) but then kind of dials back as the family dismisses his disappearance as an act of a wolf. Even though it is pretty slow in the middle the cinematographic shots and music keep you gripping your armrests throughout the whole movie wondering when the next time something sinister might happen.<br/><br/>I wasn't 100% happy with the ending. It seemed pretty cool and different and might work for some people but it seemed a tad bit gimmicky to me which is a shame since the movie avoided such gimmicks for the ENTIRE movie until the last 5-10 minutes. That being said I don't know how else the movie could have ended but I guess that's why I'm not a screenwriter! Overall I was very pleased with the movie and will add this to my list of annual pre-Halloween movies to watch. A good horror flick will leave you feeling uneasy and replaying scenes in your head for the next few days. It will also leave you sitting in the movie theater thinking ""WHAT THE #%&@ DID I JUST WATCH?!"" The Witch did all of this for me and I will most likely be heading back to the theater to watch it again!"
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","0","3","20 February 2016"," Three Great Performances and One Director to Watch For
","One of the best aspects about horror movies is their unbridled creativity. Large studios have made it their business to corner the market on large tent-pole blockbusters, goofy comedies and stereotypical biographical dramas. There are only so many ways to make an audience laugh or manipulate them into tears; there are virtually unlimited ways to disturb them. For that reason horror lives largely in the realm of independent cinema where any young person with a dream and a vision can become the next Sam Raimi or Peter Jackson. Robert Eggers, director of The Witch seems to be aiming even higher.<br/><br/>The Witch opens with William (Ineson) and his family leaving a Puritan plantation in New World, New England. Banished from the safety of the plantation, the family builds a humble cottage near the woods and struggle to make an ample harvest for the winter. Katherine (Dickie), William's wife fears death while the children begin to fear something much more nefarious hiding in the woods. This fear is planted when the youngest of the children, the infant Samuel is taken while in the care of the eldest daughter Thomasin (Taylor-Joy). After a series of incidences and misfortunes, the family begins to suspect Thomasin has dabbled in witchcraft.<br/><br/>Robert Eggers drains the film of all of the predictable jump-scares and needing stock characters that populate most horror films, and instead loads his story with elaborate period detail and an overwhelming sense of dread. Each tableau masterfully evokes the stunning compositional techniques of Andrei Tarkovsky and to a lesser extent Carl Theodor Dreyer. His wide shots are alienating and contemplating while his closeups are symmetrical and solemn. Only the editing of Louise Ford and crew hints at a modern sensibility, everything else is remarkably old-school. Most audiences accustomed to the average schlock-horror may find this film far too pensive to endure. Especially given the fact everyone speaks appropriately for the time period.<br/><br/>This is a shame too, because when this slow-boiling fright reaches its climax the pace only adds to the horror and shock. The constrained William and his family become victims of hysteria constantly looking for the grace of God when there is only deceit, hypocrisy, fear and the woods. Every single cast member is uncommonly committed to this film. Every once in a while there comes a film that graces us with one singularly brilliant performance. The Witch rewards us with three stars in the making; Anya Taylor-Joy, Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw who plays Thomasin's younger brother.<br/><br/>The Witch joins the recent crop of decent horror films that seep into the mind, provide interesting characters and make monsters out of intricate details. The Conjuring (2013), The Babadook (2014), Oculus (2013) and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) all build their horror on a foundation of dread and suspense instead of butchery and chaos. This is not to say The Witch isn't bloody; it is. Yet the primary goal here is not to disgust but to disturb in a way that makes you leave the theater with an unnerving shiver. If you're feeling brave and are incensed by the eerie The Witch will certainly leave a strong impression."
"AESReeves","8","0","3","22 February 2016"," Not Your Typical Horror Film
","I think the reason some people didn't like this film is because they went in expecting it to be your typical suspense-laden, full of jump scares type of horror film and that is not this movie. The Witch focuses on the psychological decline of a family - how quickly it can happen and how it effects the dynamic of the household. The horror aspect comes from the creepiness which surrounds this film. It's a throwback to old Hitchcock films, and more recently, ""Goodnight Mommy,"" in that it makes you question what is real and what is not. The acting is superb. Every actor in this film will make you uneasy at one time or another, which, of course, is the point! The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 is because I didn't love the ending. Well, not really the ending itself, just how it played out on screen. But aside from that I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. Just don't go in expecting tons of jump scares and gore because you will be disappointed. Instead go in with an open mind and leave feeling a little better about the dysfunctions in your own family!"

","Set in the 1660's is the story about a family who after leaving their plantation goes out to live in the outskirts of New England. When their baby, Sam, is taken from their parish an unruly force takes over the family that begins to slowly tear them apart. The film is directed by Robert Eggers and stars Kate Dickie, Anya-Taylor Joy, and Ralph Ineson.<br/><br/>It's been a long while since watching a film that is genuinely unsettling but to also find it refreshing at the same time. This time around we're talking about 'The Witch' and having viewed the trailer this past month I was eagerly looking forward to seeing it. To describe this movie is nothing but unsettling and the credit goes out to the director who was able to hone in the suspense not knowing where the movie would go next. Now I have to warn everyone in saying that this isn't your typical horror film with big budget effects and cheap jump scares forced down your throats. Instead you are treated to a time piece that sets the tone with events that took place in old folklore and a time where witchcraft was believed to exist. So for some viewers this may not rub off so well and could turn them away if your not knowing what to expect. With that said, this is not one to be overlooked.<br/><br/>You can read more of my review here at: http://thecinemascore.com/2016/02/19/the-witch-2016-review/"
"cultfilmfan","9","0","4","20 February 2016"," The Witch
","Back in the year 2000, I had the pleasure of seeing the director's cut and re release of The Exorcist on the big screen at my local theatre. This was such a thrill for me as I was not around in 1973 to see the film when it was first released in theatres and now having a chance to see not only one of my favourite horror films, but one of my favourite films of all time on the big screen was an experience that I was to savour and that was a great all around film experience for me. Overall as I mentioned, seeing the film on the big screen in stereo sound and with additional unseen footage was great. I also thought that being able to see and experience the film with a then live audience full of people who perhaps had never seen the film before as well as fans of it probably who even saw it back in the 70's would be a real treat, but unfortunately seeing it with a live audience was one of the drawbacks of the film. All the then teenage viewers who were in the film audience amongst me, were instead of being in fear, or absolutely captivated by the film as they should have been, they were instead laughing and mocking the film as if what they saw on the screen was one of the funniest things they had ever seen. I was completely in disbelief and truly was despairing of this generation of moviegoers, even if I unfortunately fall into that same age group and demographic. I mention this in this review of the new film, The Witch, because the exact same thing happened to me while I was watching this film with a live audience who typically fell in the teenage age bracket as well. People were not only laughing and sneering at the film as if this was the funniest film to come along in quite awhile, but they also mocked it, were squirming in their chairs with boredom and countless times various people of the audience would leave and then come back into the theatre which each time caused the heavy theatre door to make a large slamming sound as they would enter and then exit the theatre and this happened frequently throughout the film. I think in both cases with The Exorcist, and now with The Witch, both films are very good, but the proof shows that they go beyond the typical maturity level of a teenage audience and those who attended my screening. The Witch, is a smart film with sparse and bare settings and backdrops that reminded me of the European films of Bergman, Tarkovsky and even Lars Von Trier's last few films in his depression type trilogy with Antichrist and Melancholia being the main examples. The acting was all by people who were relatively unknown to me as was the director and most of the crew if I have to be honest about it, but their dedication and craft on this film was excellent and this ended up being one of the most effective and interesting horror films of recent years. There certainly were moments in the film that were almost baffling, ludicrous and even hard to understand at times, but I at least was so compelled and interested by what was going on that even the more bizarre aspects of the film were intriguing to me as opposed to being something that bothered me about it. The film is getting rave reviews from critics and for good and appropriate reasons because technically it is one of the best made horror films from an artistic standpoint as well as any serious fan of the genre can tell you how effective and thought provoking this experience was. The people in my theatre like the people almost 16 years ago who laughed and mocked The Exorcist, are from a generation who like their horror films violent and with loud, annoying and sometimes just plain idiotic jump scares and stuff that most of us would just avoid, or roll our eyes at if we saw. Too bad that all these years later that today's teens are still enjoying the same old garbage and are totally aloof to anything of any artistic merit such as the two films in question. With time we will see how these films continue to fair, but I have a suspicion that critics and horror fans will be on my side and these teens will eventually grow up and their past tastes will be left in the dust. Time will certainly tell."
"jmoneyjohal","7","0","4","19 February 2016"," A well made art-house horror film, that wont be relished by fans of escapist cinema.
","Let me state on the onset that The Witch carries a beware tag, for most people going into this film excepting a full blown horror film, that offers cheap thrills like the regular released Hollywood horror films ex. Saw or Paranormal Activity you will be disappointed.The Witch offers more of an art-house film with the films setting being horrorish. The Witch is a niche film made for people who relish artistic cinema, its not really made for the regular cinema going audience who indulge in escapist cinema. The film has certain milieu, that caught my attention right away, I was sucked into 1600's New England. The clothing, the way the people talked with heavy accents, the houses made of wood/hay, the farms filled with animals, everything was genuine and authentic of those times. The films attention to detail was something to marvel at, the cinematography was impeccable, it helped create the eerie dark feeling the film had from the first frame. But the film has its flaws but more on that later.<br/><br/>Story wise in the 16th century, the deeply religious William leaves a New England plantation alongside his family (wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and twins Mercy and Jonas) due to a disagreement of beliefs. After a day's travel, the family finds a spot of land to start their new life. Several months later, the family has built a house and farm on the land and Katherine has given birth to her fifth child, Samuel. Thomasin looks after the infant Samuel one day but, while Thomasin is playing peek-a-boo with him, Samuel is abducted by a witch who lives in the surrounding forest. What happens next forms the crux of the film.<br/><br/>Acting wise the cast was full of newcomers/ newer(unknown actors) actors who performed exceeding well. Anya-Taylor Joy has a cute innocence about her which she conveys well on screen, but when the dust settles especially in the climax/pre climax she turns too the dark side and shows her devilish side well. Ralph Ineson shows a helpless side of himself as a father stuck between his family and religion, he is great. Katie Dickie is schizophrenic on screen as the mother who cant cope with the loss of her child and turns semi-crazy. The younger kids have more of a comical role, and provide some nice light moments.<br/><br/>The most important part of The Witch is the films whole aura, which is pitch perfect. Like I stated before the 1600s is perfectly depicted. The whole family being extremely religious is spot on for those times. The films director Robert Eggers makes sure that the audience has been encapsulated back in time. With the extraordinary camera-work the whole dark eerie, unsettling theme is fleshed out well. I must say I have never really seen a horror film like The Witch before, were most of horror comes through the silences, and from a artistic landscape, its a film that makes the mind think . There is no gimmicky fake cheap thrills, there is some gore, but its rather justified, and not overdone. The music creates a big impact on the film, and creates a tension filled screen. This film is more about creating a dark atmosphere, rather than trying to scare the audience. Which can be a bad thing or a good thing, here its a mix both. The films pace is very sluggish and a 1hr 30 min films feels more like 2hr + plus film. The Witch sometimes is to art-house for my liking, and more thrills were needed to keep the audience engaged, as I could see audience members getting tireless while watching this film. Finally The Witch is at its best in the films last 30 min when all hell breaks loose , and the scene when the brother has a exorcism of sorts, and when the sister heads to jungle with a black goat are the films highlight.<br/><br/>Overall as I could gauge from the audience I was watching The Witch with, this film is not everyones cup of tea. The Witch is for more of a niche audience, who enjoy all types of cinema, and hone films as a artistic form, more than just escapist entertainment. Its a Sundance winner, and I can see why, there's a lot to love here, and I throughly enjoyed myself, but I feel bad for the audience going in excepting a full blown horror film, the film is misleading. Watch at your on caution you have been warned.<br/><br/>3.5/5* or 7/10"
"paul-allaer","8","0","6","19 February 2016"," More a psychological family drama than a horror movie (not unlike ""The Shining"" was)
","""The Witch"" (2015 release; 93 min.) brings the story of a 17th century family in New England. As the movie opens, we see the husband of the family at trial, due to religious disagreements, and the man and his family (his wife and 4 kids) are forced to leave the plantation and start life anew. Some time (a year?) later, we see the family having built a house and working the land in a far off place. Thomasin, the oldest daughter, goes out near the woods and plays peekaboo with the newest addition to the family, a baby boy. Then after another peekaboo, when she opens her eyes, the baby is gone. She frantically goes looking for the baby in the woods. At this point we are about 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the debut film of writer-director Robert Eggers, and what a debut it is! In the opening credits, we see that the movie's full title is actually ""The Witch - A New England Folk Tale"". The movie is billed as a 'horror' film, but if you are expecting a slasher movie or something explicit like The Exorcist, you will surely be disappointed. Think of ""The Witch"" more in terms of the Stanley Kubrick film ""The Shining"", also termed a 'horror' movie but in reality more a psychological family drama. Even though they are completely different movies, the parallels are uncanny: the isolation, the gradual breakdown of the family, and the ultimate insanity of it all. Newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy is sensational as Thomasin, but truth be told, so are Kate Dickie as the mother and Ralph Ineson as the father. BEWARE: the movie is spoken in 17th century English (""thee"", ""thy mother"", etc.) and I must admit that quite a bit of the dialogue flew straight over my head, I just could not grasp it (English not being my native tongue may be a factor, although I have lived in the US for 30+ years--I'd be interested in anyone else's perspective on this). Even with that 'complaint', I found this to be quite an amazing movie, furthermore so considering this was made on a nickel and a dime.<br/><br/>""The Witch"" premiered at the 2015 Sundance Festival and made a huge splash. I've been waiting to see it since. Not sure why it's taken more than a year to finally get a release in theaters, but better late than never I suppose. The screening I saw this at on the Friday evening of the movie's opening weekend was attended okay but not nearly as well as I had anticipated. Couldn't help but notice that a group of about 4-5 people left the theater midway through, and didn't return. I'm afraid that there was a gap between their expectations of this movie and what the movie really is. Yes, it is a 'horror' movie, in the same way that ""The Shining"" is a 'horror' movie, but it is so much more than that. If you are in the mood for an outstanding original tale of one 17th century family's descent into insanity, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Witch"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
