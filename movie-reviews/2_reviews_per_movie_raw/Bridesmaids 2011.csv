"AntoNEO","9","232","414","21 April 2011"," A hilarious and surprisingly touching comedy
","My friends invited me to a preview screening of Bridesmaids last night, and I accepted the invitation with a sense of cautious optimism. The trailer for the film admittedly didn't do much for me, but I was intrigued by the concept of a female-driven Apatow film. Ultimately, I went into the theater with modest expectations, hoping to get a few good laughs out of it.<br/><br/>By the time we came out of the theater, my three friends and I had smiles plastered across our faces, and we couldn't stop talking about the film for the next couple hours. We all loved it. I think it easily ranks with the best of the Apatow productions, and it might even be my personal favorite. Like all of Apatow's productions, there are admittedly scenes that arguably go a little too far or a little too long, but that's a small criticism when the film successfully fires on so many other cylinders.<br/><br/>To start with, the film is hilarious, and I think the comedy far exceeds the standalone bits shown in the trailer. Scene after scene is filled with humorous and often sidesplitting moments, and they had the theater in an uproar during the screening. I can't say enough about Kristen Wiig. Prior to this, I've always liked her to some extent but never really loved her. I think she's good at what she does, but I wasn't sure her shtick could sustain an entire film. Would her passive aggressive wit get old? Is it the only note she can play? Can she handle anything more dramatic? Ultimately, she blew me away in this film. Not only is she consistently and uniquely funny, but her character is surprisingly well-developed, and Wiig brings the character to vibrant and dynamic life on-screen.<br/><br/>And this brings me to my next point about Bridesmaids: the film has a surprising amount of depth that completely caught me off guard. Bridesmaids isn't a quickie 80-minute gag fest by any stretch of the imagination; it's actually a leisurely paced 2-hour character-driven comedy that takes time to develop its characters and establish the various relationships and resultant conflicts between them. Ultimately, the film ends up being quite heartfelt and even rather sad in places. Despite the over-the-top antics shown in the trailer, the themes that the film explores are actually quite grounded. Kristen Wiig's character is someone who is feeling completely let down by life, which is a place we've all been, and the personal journey of her character resonated strongly for me. While her character is easily the most well-developed of the bunch, even the other bridesmaids ultimately show some three-dimensionality as well, despite the fact that they are sometimes initially introduced as two-dimensional caricatures.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Bridesmaids was one of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen in a long time. It's certainly not perfect: it could probably do with some editing, there might be a few too many subplots (some of which are left unexplored), and it arguably goes too over-the-top at times, but everything else about the film works so well that these complaints are little more than nitpicks. While I applaud everyone involved in the production, it is Kristen Wiig who deserves the most accolades. As co-writer and lead actress, she plays a huge part in the film's success, and I sincerely hope this film puts her on the Hollywood map, as I would love to see more from her in the future. Whatever the case may be, Bridesmaids certainly makes for a successful maiden voyage for her into the world of feature-film comedies."
"chicka91","3","495","922","15 May 2011"," I'm seriously confused.
","OK. After seeing the previews of this movie, it was added to the list of movies I did NOT have any intentions of seeing. However, I heard so many great things about it, I decided to give it a try. Let's just say, my gut feeling was correct. I have NO idea what so many people found so amazing about this movie.<br/><br/>It's not that funny. Yeah, there were a couple of scenes that I found humorous, and chuckled. However, most of the ""funny"" scenes were either involving sex, about sex, about poop/vomit/farting/burping, or a lame attempt at slapstick humor. Lots of predictable cheap shots. Seriously, no sophisticated or classy humor... the whole film made me feel trashy, honestly. I get that it's rated R, but still. I felt like I was in an adult version of an equivalent to Spongebob at times.<br/><br/>Small plot. This movie is slowly stretched out for over 2 hours, with a plot that could easily be explained entirely, with all important scenes, in about 30 minutes. There were SO many long scenes that seem to be thrown in just so Kristen Wiig can score another laugh, yet they don't progress the story. Quite a few plot holes, and there were many scenes where I caught myself rolling my eyes, thinking, ""really?"" <br/><br/>The greatest movies develop their characters so much that you literally feel for their outcomes. I left the theater with no regards to any of the characters in this movie, because they were all so distant and under-developed. The plot was so weak and rushed for the next pointless comedy spiel, that they didn't give the characters any depth, except maybe the lead of ""Annie."" I can think of 2 memorable scenes right now from this film, and I saw it last night. Yeah, there were some funny scenes, but nothing worth raving about in my opinion.<br/><br/>I do have to give ""Bridesmaids"" some credit. An all-female leading role movie is very new in show-business, especially in comedy. Sadly, these women made the ""Hangover"" equivalent instead of raising the bar, but they get Kudos for the efforts. There were some sweet moments in the movie, that for me, held the film from turning into a complete waste of money. I do like comedy, but I prefer classier, witty humor instead of the easy, thoughtless humor. I would much rather watch a movie that evolves a character so much that the cheap shots aren't needed for laughs. If you liked ""The Hangover,"" then you'll probably enjoy this movie.."
"randy4970-2","10","171","312","1 May 2011"," Kicks butt
","The most laugh-out-loud moments I've witnessed in a movie theater since There's Something About Mary. This should make Wiig a star -- and she deserves it (she has a Meg Ryan quality). The rest of the cast is hilarious also. <br/><br/>This isn't a formula film. The scenes are way longer but you won't notice (because you'll be laughing so hard). They're much richer and funnier because they're given time to unfold. <br/><br/>I'm a guy. I went in with no expectations and came out with a big smile. This is a female driven film (and women will love it) but guys, don't be afraid -- you'll love it too. You won't ""look away!"" (a joke you'll get after you see the film)."
"mdnobles19","9","165","301","14 May 2011"," Puts most modern comedies to shame
","This is like a big slap in the face to all the lame chick flicks out there as of now and a breakthrough, star making leading role for the brilliant and hilarious Kristen Wiig. I have never seen a comedy in a long time that was as consistently funny and I mean laugh on the ground with tears coming down your face funny as well as touching and for once genuine characters that you can relate to and have an instant, believable, bond and chemistry on screen that makes the ongoing crazy shenanigans all the more effective and hysterical. The showstopper, scene stealing, laugh riot Melissa McCarthy was fantastic and no wonder has her own sitcom and she should host or be apart of SNL or something she is so freaking funny I almost wet myself! Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig should make more comedies together and are much better than Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were in Baby Mama, they are a comedy dream team and the rest of the cast is the cherry on top. The movie goes through typical issues from the average chick flick like jealousy, insecurities, narcissism, cat fights, self-doubt, self-pity, self-destruction you name it but it deals with those is a more honest, realistic non sugar-coated way that was refreshing and smart from the norm and raises the bar so high for chick flicks (which is more anti of that anyways) and comedies in general that I personally can't see any comedy this year or in the future surpassing its comedy greatness, it's golden!!! Overall if you were waiting for a movie that will truly make you laugh harder than you ever laughed before in the theaters in a long time your wish has been granted, wear depends just in case because you might need them. Highly Recommended! The most satisfying comedy in the past decade that I never wanted it to end and forget about the overrated The Hangover and its unnecessary sequel and bring on Bridesmaids 2 already! 4.5 out of 5 stars."
"refocusedlarry","9","194","357","27 April 2011"," Judd Apatow meets Wedding Crashers meets The Hangover, with females!
","This movie is hilarious fun. My wife drags me to one chick flick a year in the theater, and I'm glad it's this one. Considering the talent involved, I expected something more than meets the eye after seeing the trailer. However, I was not expecting such a hysterical experience. This is a chick flick for dudes... the anti-chick flick ""chick flick"" if you will.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie is that although you get a sense of the heart and charm, it's not afraid to pull any punches just because the characters are female (the scene in the bridal shop will be the topic of much discussion, I assure you). I also loved the cast, lead by the always awesome Kristen Wiig. She was perfect in this role and I hope she does more work like this. She can make me pee my pants with laughter, and then straighten me right back up in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>I also loved the pacing of most of the film. Several scenes had just the right amount of awkwardness or pause or ""beat"" that really added an extra element of hilarity. There were several of those scenes where the audience was collectively cracking up, almost violently so. People were wiping tears from their eyes and still relaying jokes back and forth to one another as they filed out of the theater.<br/><br/>Anyway, guys, trust me.. make this the ""chick flick"" you surprise your girl with and take her to the theater. You won't regret it."
"Likes_Ninjas90","2","207","388","26 June 2011"," This movie is so desperate for a laugh that if it nudged you it would have broken a rib
","Annie (Kristen Wiig) is a lonely woman who works in a jewellery store and shares casual sex with Ted (Jon Hamm). She is still reeling after her bakery closed during the recession. Her best friend that she's known for years is Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Lillian announces that she's getting married and that she wants Annie to be her maid of honour. Annie is initially excited but then realises that she will be alone again. Worse still is that Lillian is using four other women to help organise the wedding, including the dominating Helen (Rose Byrne), who she met less than a year ago. Helen and Annie compete furiously to outdo each other on the wedding plans but its Annie and her relationship with Lillian which comes off worse. Adding a little bit of joy to Annie's life is patrol officer Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) as they start to slowly connect.<br/><br/>'Oh my God! You're getting married!' If you enjoy this kind of shrieking, along with references to various bodily functions and wedding parties so extreme they'd make royalty look mild, you will like Bridesmaids. As someone who does not have any interest in these things I found Bridesmaids to be a film of two halves: the first appalling and the second not much better. It's been directed by Paul Feig, under the watch of producer Judd Apatow and many have touted this as a female version of The Hangover (2009). Although the misdirection of the comedy could be pinned on Feig, the film was already on shaky ground because of the screenplay written by Wiig. She co-wrote the film with Annie Mumolo and was also one of the producers herself. Wiig has a background in variety programs like Saturday Night Live and for worse, it shows. Somewhere the rules of comedy have been forgotten. Comedy must exist in reality. Humour is funniest when we can imagine ourselves in similar, plausible, situations. There are very few scenes in Bridesmaids that feel honest or genuine. Too many moments play out like extended skits, stretching plausibility with unsophisticated humour and little concern for developing theme. This movie is so desperate for a laugh that if it nudged you it would have broken a rib. I took zero pleasure from watching women defecate over a sink, vomiting on top of each other, or becoming boozy on an aeroplane.<br/><br/>If these situations weren't distasteful enough, smaller moments are undone by dialogue that lacks subtlety. Some lines of dialogue, like when Annie talks to customers in the jewellery store, are ridiculously blunt when they should have been loaded. It weakens the credibility of the characters and flattens the humour because we know people don't talk like this. Though taste in humour is subjective it's difficult to ignore the image problems rising in modern comedies. A lot of rom-coms, including this one, are pushing a social view that if you are fat, single or unmarried, you are weird, low in confidence and a failure. Wedding parties in films are also now so extravagantly realised that they have become a measure of success and social approval. Bridesmaids continues many of these trends, taking every chance to deprive its characters of dignity. That is until Annie can find the ridiculously nice Irish bloke. In the second half, the film at least tries to give Annie a recovery after hitting rock bottom but its views of friendship and renewal are simplistic and predictable. Like a lot of the film, Wiig's comedic performance is so annoyingly exaggerated that it saps any chance of realism. But Chris O'Dowd, as one of the film's few likable characters, is mercifully restrained. A lot of women will see this because it gives them the rare centre of attention in a raunchy, mainstream comedy. But is this really the best Hollywood can offer? If there's a Bridesmaids: Part II I'm sending a non-acceptance card."
"Mccadoo","2","163","320","16 May 2011"," Not the movie the television ads set me up for....
","Let me begin by saying that I'm a man and that I went to see this movie with my wife, not under duress, I was looking forward to seeing it. Let me add here that in an almost full theater I counted four other men in the audience which would lead me to believe that I was definitely not the target audience for this movie. That being said, my wife didn't like it either, she actually disliked it even more than I did.<br/><br/>All of the television promos I saw led me to believe that this was going to be a female version of ""The Hangover"", it wasn't, not even close. Which leads to my first problem with this movie, the advertising campaign was very deceiving. Pretty much all the funny scenes in the movie were included in the advertisements. What they didn't show was a very formulatic, been done a dozen times, chick flick about BFF's and wedding's gone wrong.<br/><br/>I will say that the funny parts of this movie, and they were few, were very funny; the scenes on the airplane were good, and when Annie was trying to get the cop to help her find Lillian. And...that was pretty much it, except for most of Melissa McCarthy's scenes with the exception of the one during the credit roll which was just kind of sick. The rest of the scenes that were meant to be funny either went on for much too long, were bizarre or crude instead of funny or were just strained. A good example of strained was the bridal party all dancing at the end of the movie, it didn't look natural or funny or like anything but a bunch of actors having been told to dance around and try to look like they were having fun, some, like Rudolf and Wiig very badly at that. If you have zero rhythm and can't dance, don't put a dance scene in your movie. One example of bizarre was two of the bridesmaids just deciding to make out on an airplane, for no discernible reason. Did Ms. Wiig think the guys in the audience would just enjoy seeing woman kiss?<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was an overlong, strained attempt to make a funny and touching movie all in one that failed at both. Some other major problems I saw; The scene near the beginning of the film in which Annie and Helen try to top one another at the announcement party went on and on and on way past the point where it was funny and to the point were it became tedious and even uncomfortable to watch. In fact many of the scenes in the movie were like that, they just didn't know where to stop.<br/><br/>Kristin Wiig's character, Annie, progressed in the movie from being likable and funny to just being stupid and annoying. The scenes were she sabotaged the wedding plans, either intentionally or unintentionally, also ran way too long and were sad and annoying instead of funny. Ms. Wiig needs to learn that sometimes, especially when the material is weak to begin with, less is more.<br/><br/>And while this may sound mean and petty I have to mention it because I kept noticing it over and over during the movie; Maya Rudolph is just not an attractive woman and was just wrong for her role in this movie. She was not believable at all, either as the bride to be or as the main characters best friend or as anything else. She is probably a fair sketch artist but she does not having the looks or the acting chops to carry a movie.<br/><br/>All in all a disappointment, firstly because we were snookered in by a misleading advertising campaign and secondly, because the movie tried to be two things at once and failed miserably at both."
"rcoss2001","1","137","267","24 June 2011"," Uggh!
","I wish I had read the negative reviews posted here prior to seeing this waste of time and money. The plot was a muddy, hackneyed, meandering mess, the acting mostly so-so, and the subject matter includes graphic depictions of diarrhea and vomiting. If that's your thing you'll love it. All of the funny scenes were in the trailers. The protagonist was such a whiny loser I kept hoping that someone would bump her off.You know there's a problem when your ""bad"" girl comes off looking like a nicer and more sympathetic person overall. Anything that was supposed to be a joke or a funny situation was hammered home with a 15 pound sledge hammer- and then repeated! This movie took over two hours to get to a place it had no business ending up, I.E. a happy ending for Annie. Her ""redemption"" was way too little, way too late and was contrived as hell. This movie is now my new standard for really bad, bad waste of film. My wife wanted to see it based on trailers and the mostly good reviews. She had to cover her eyes during the bathroom scenes and found the whole movie to be one of the absolute worst she has ever seen. If you must waste $20 bucks(roughly two tickets) take a $20 bill, shred it in a food processor, then flush it down the toilet. Do this while eating popcorn and you'll have the same overall feeling of having seen this movie."

","Annie's life is a mess. But when she finds out her lifetime best friend is engaged, she simply must serve as Lillian's maid of honor. Though lovelorn and broke, Annie bluffs her way through the expensive and bizarre rituals. With one chance to get it perfect, she'll show Lillian and her bridesmaids just how far you'll go for someone you love. (C) Universal<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer for BRIDESMAIDS, I didn't see anything special with it. There were maybe a couple of good jokes in there but nothing really hilarious to make me wanna see it right away. However, after the end credits rolled from a prescreening I went to, I have to admit it: It's freaking hilarious! To put this into perspective, I don't like many modern comedies, so this is saying a lot. There was one sequence in the film that was so funny and so shocking that I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in a film EVER! To say that the trailer doesn't do the film justice is an understatement. However, on the up side, the trailer doesn't show the funniest jokes in the film like most trailers for comedies do these days (don't you hate it when that happens?).<br/><br/>And no. BRIDESMAIDS is not a chick flick. There are some raunchy scenes in here that you have NEVER seen in any other film before. Let's remember, this is a hard R-rated Judd Apatow production, so this film shouldn't be taken very lightly. It's not to say that BRIDESMAIDS is one of the best comedies of the decade. In fact, as much as I laughed throughout the film, it does slow down after the first hour with the second hour not being nearly as funny as the first. Still, I laughed out loud pretty frequently, which is a feat hard to pull off on someone like me.<br/><br/>BRIDESMAIDS is also pretty heartfelt. This is mostly due to the wonderful ensemble cast, who are all fantastic in their own way. Kristen Wiig FINALLY gets the chance to shine in a starring role! Honestly, this girl can carry a film on her own. Maya Rudolph was also great. Seeing the dialogue exchange between her and Wiig made their chemistry feel very authentic which is no surprise since they were in SNL together. It's also fun to see Rose Byrne in more comedic roles, who was also in GET HIM TO THE Greek and this year's sleeper hit, INSIDIOUS(!!).<br/><br/>I think an obvious audience favorite from the group of girls would be Melissa McCarthy. She provides some of the films biggest laughs and for a good reason. Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey are the remainders from the group and they were pretty good, but they aren't as prominent as the other girls. There are also some guys in the cast, most notably Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm. O'Dowd did a good job playing Wiig's love interest (and you can pretty much see where this is going...), and Hamm did well for the limited amount of screen time he had.<br/><br/>Sure, BRIDESMAIDS is predictable as hell but so are 99.9% of other modern comedies. However, it's strong proof that one can make a comedy about women without it ever being stupid, sexist, or mean-spirited. Overall, it's just plain old entertaining, hilarious, and heartwarming. Who knew? Also, with the ""HANGOVER with girls"" comparison, BRIDESMAIDS is a much funnier, insightful, and honest film than THE HANGOVER ever was."
"peace5491","10","84","161","14 April 2011"," Great comedy!
","My husband and I went to a screening with few expectations because lately the comedies have been awful. We were very pleasantly surprised! The three main characters were developed very well and their relationships were portrayed very believably. Maya and Kristen grew up together and Maya is getting married. A new friend has taken over, which upsets Kristen. She is not in a good place at the time and needs Maya, who is not available like she had been in the past. We haven't laughed out loud so much in a long time, but you do feel Kristen's pain throughout the movie. The bridal salon scene is absolutely hysterical and people were still talking about it on the way out of the movie. Don't miss this one!"
"nhershfield","1","137","273","28 May 2011"," This movie really stinks!
","I don't know what you folks and the reviewers have been smoking! This was the most embarrassing movie my wife and I have ever seen. ""Dumb and Dumber"" was a 10 compared to this fiasco. Let me count the ways it sucked. 1. The stomach flu scenes in the bathroom and on the street were an absolute embarrassment. 2. Everything about the flight to Las Vegas was stupid. 3. The first boyfriend was an imitation in and out of bed. 4. The bride who let everyone make the decisions for her. 5. The deal with the giant cookie. Have I said enough? If I could have, I'd have asked for my money back. I cannot remember when I last saw such a bad excuse for humor. My wife agrees 100% with me.<br/><br/>This wouldn't even qualify as a B Grade movie in our opinion. The only actors who did any good were the main character, the cop, and the fat lady. The bride had no depth to her character at all. She simply sat there like a bump on a log.<br/><br/>We generously give this movie a 1 out of 10."
"MasterChiefrei","Null","8","11","10 October 2011"," If you enjoyed this there's obviously something wrong
","Alright, I am a woman and based on the ads I was excited to see this movie. Not only did it look like a decent cast but normally you don't see a mostly female based movie bent on being funny. After finally getting to see it on DVD I'm practically thanking God I didn't waste my money to see it in the theater. My comedy ranges quite a bit from Jackass, Idiocracy, Hot Fuzz, The Bird Cage, and so on. I don't really have a specific genre of comedy that I'm limited to. Granted I don't laugh at everything but I still keep an open mind and surely didn't think this movie would be so bad. To be honest I wasn't able to watch the whole movie and neither could my mom and step dad. Thirty minutes into it I said, ""We'll give it another ten minutes and if it doesn't take a better turn we're taking it out."" My step dad replied, ""End it now!"" Needless to say this movie didn't own up to the ads nor was it funny. I didn't connect with any of the characters and couldn't feel sorry for Annie since she made everything uncomfortable. A lot of scenes dragged on and any attempts at being sentimental or sweet came off cheap and shallow. Once I saw Tim Heidecker as the bride's future husband I knew something was up. The only reason I'd see this movie again is if the Rifftrax crew got up the courage to actually watch it. I can only hope this isn't where our future comedy movies are headed but if so I'm sticking to what we've got and going to hope for the best. I can't say I'm surprised some people actually thought this movie was funny since there are the less than intelligent people who enjoy Tim and Eric. Bad writing. Bad acting. Toilet movie. And I'm being nice."
"stephen-wp88","Null","14","22","17 July 2011"," Not very funny
","For this film to work it has to be funny - and it isn't. I'll pretty much laugh at anything - I even thought Tropic Thunder was hilarious, Satan's Alley, now thats funny. But I sat through this and didn't laugh, smirk or smile once. Its not that i don't get Kristen Wiig, in fact I think she steals her scenes in Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, where she is fantastic (""Its not a competition, but you're best""). She's also probably the best thing in Paul as a god bothering hillbilly.<br/><br/>But why doesn't this film work for me? Well it just isn't funny - there's no genuine humour in someone being drugged up and doing bad things on a plane, or people getting food poisoning and needing to defecate on the street. You would expect a lot from the people who put together this movie but they don't deliver."
"cadillac20","9","44","83","13 May 2011"," Absolutely Hilarious
","I'm going to tell you now that the advertising for this movie is weak. It comes off as some kind of chick flick, it's trailer gets a few chuckles out, but it really does not do the film justice. Bridesmaids will be the surprising film of the year and could very well even be the comedy of the year, topping films like The Hangover II and 30 Minutes Or Less. Yes, it's that funny. And I will tell you now, this is not the film you think it is.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is a fairly simple film that sees one unlucky lady being the maid of honor for her best friend while attempting to plan the wedding. All of this as her own life falls apart at her feet. Suffice to say, hilarity ensues. And it really does ensue. Surprisingly, despite what you might think, this is not a chick flick. It's got romcom elements to it, but it's like any other comedy, but with that rare all female cast. I can't remember the last time laughing this much during a movie. It helps that everything falls into place so well. Kristen Wiig is hilarious and this should be her star making film. She carries this with great talent and is at her most hilarious here, while still playing the emotional parts very well. There wasn't a single moment that brought me out of the film, and that is the sign of a film well done. Her surrounding cast does as great a job, with Melissa McCarthy being the standout as the token obnoxious groupie. Nearly all the scenes featuring her are laugh out loud funny.<br/><br/>The writing also shines here as it's Apatowian comedy comes through. This is reminiscent of the early Apatow films, like 30 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. The comedy lingers at some moments, and even shoots for being uncomfortable. The dress scene in particular is gross, but probably got the biggest laughs, as I could hear people in the theater barely containing themselves. But again, the film is a constant laugh riot. It certainly does have a very nice emotional backbone and that comes across well with a very relatable story that isn't so much about any kind of romance but rather someone who is losing their mind. You feel bad for Wiig's character, but not in a way that makes her sappy or over the top. Rather, it's a down to earth kind of falling apart that anyone could relate to. Much in the way that Knocked Up and Superbad worked for their relative stories, Bridesmaids is a rare comedy that has an all female cast, yet can appeal to anyone.<br/><br/>I guess that's the biggest surprise here, that this is a film that can work for everyone. My audience was mostly female, but everyone was cracking up the entire time. So, don't let that fool you. Nor should you let the advertising fool you either. This is one hilarious film that you would be sorry to have missed."
"KathND","3","71","142","19 May 2011"," sad not funny
","I am a bit surprised at the other reviews for this movie, my college aged daughters were eager to see it and our family found it more tragic than anything else, especially for the lead character. Both daughters said they felt more like crying than laughing and wanted to see something else to ""cleanse the palate"" before calling it a night. Kristin Wiig is very talented and will likely follow up with more movies, but we found her character too sad, in an age where lots of young people are unemployed, underemployed or going bankrupt. A lot of the humor was gross - I guess we don't find mass diarrhea in wedding clothing that funny. We found Melissa McCarthy particularly unfunny and almost painful to watch."
"potterj","1","68","139","29 May 2011"," House Bunny, Step Aside.....
","I never thought it possible, but ""Bridesmaids"" proves you can create a worse, more cringe-inducing film than the ""House Bunny"" (it may even compete with the Jackass franchise, and oddly, on a major portion of its own turf). I left before it was over, and only stayed long enough to see if some nearby, later scene could possibly be any worse than those I had endured already (a thought that was most vivid as we concluded the scene at the dress shop and I tried to imagine something worse than the fat bridesmaid's performance at the sink). Mission accomplished in the very next scene (as the bride made it to the curb). I had the distinct impression, observing my fellow theater goers in stitches, that I was participating in some deleted scenes from ""Idiocracy"". No such luck, as this actually happened."
"pearberr","1","64","131","2 July 2011"," Why do people like this?
","This movie had reputable and well-liked actresses and staff (I am a big fan of both Wigg and Apatow). This movie had a good budget for a film with no action sequences.<br/><br/>However, I will list, for as long as possible, the reasons why this movie sucked Air Marshall cock sandwich. <br/><br/>1) Expectations: Don't make a movie and advertise it as Hangover with girls unless you are ready to deliver. Hangover was fast-paced and crazy with unexpected plot-twists and turns around every corner. This was a leisurely comedy. The movie was like a chick flick, but with jokes and poop. I should note that I came into this movie excited and with good expectations.<br/><br/>2) The Lack of Characters: Who was the focus of this Hangover with women movie? The maid of honor, who's life just got worse and worse throughout the film. The bride, who was a cardboard cutout placed into random scenes and referred to by a name. An actress would have been nice in that role. There was also the super-rich and fake girl. None of those were original. The other three characters, the ones who could have made the movie interesting and who I looked forward to seeing more of when they were introduced, but then they did nothing at all. In Hangover, the husband (The boring one in the group) wasn't even around (Because he was boring), and the movie was constantly doing gags and jokes with the three remaining characters. This made it good. In Bridesmaids, the funny characters remained on the side and played no role in the movie (This made the movie bad...).<br/><br/>3) Comic Relief in a Comedy? Why were the British siblings there? There is NO need for Comic Relief in a Comedy unless it really, really sucks. In which case, any comic relief you attempt to add is most likely also going to suck. Even if you liked the movie, this was stoopid.<br/><br/>4) The Formula. In a pity-fest funny movie, things need to start hitting the upswing between 1/2 and 2/3 of the movie. This movie went 100 minutes before the main character turned her life around, and then ended 25 minutes later. The best movies break from the formula... for instance, Groundhog Day follows this same formula. However, this movie was already breaking the script when it decided to have 6 women make a funny movie. It should have stuck to the script the rest of the way through or else it risked sucking, which it did. <br/><br/>5) The Pace. Here is another case where they did not follow the formula. Comedies don't have to have a great story... however, let's not pound the audience in with a chick-flick. Try to cover up the fact that this is a standard chick-flick with jokes and fast-paced humor and do not let the pace drop bellow that of a High-School Prom Queen speech. This will make the audience think about the story... which was a standard chick- flick script. <br/><br/>6) Feel-Good Ending. The jokes do not end in a comedy until the credits roll. Just because the main character is happy again, doesn't mean you take the humor from slow to stop. Oh, and flirting, dancing and a stupidly over-the-top wedding do not count as funny. <br/><br/>I guess this movie could be funny for some people. Stupid women who have never seen stupid-man-comedy before may have liked it. Stupid men who didn't realize this was stupid-man-comedy because there were some hot chicks in it (Some...). And even stupider men who like the stupid-man- comedy probably liked it. Otherwise, this movie sucked. I really can't describe it any other way. It just sucked. Badly."

When was the last time a ""comedy"" was produced in Hollywood that wasn't based exclusively on potty humor and hapless males getting hit in the crotch? <br/><br/>Lorne Michaels should be ashamed of himself, for forcing all these monumental no-talents on America. Kristen Wiig is merely the latest in a long series of thoroughly unfunny, untalented, obnoxious ""actors"" like Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, David Spade, Rob Schneider, etc. Big screen comedies basically have been taken over by the pathetic alumni from SNL and the just as sordidly horrific ""talent"" emanating from the stable of Judd Apatow.<br/><br/>I wonder if Maya Rudolph-yet another ex-SNL cast member-can appreciate the irony of her appearing in a work of ""art"" like this, considering that she was one of the stars of Idiocracy. Probably not, considering that none of the SNL people seem to have the slightest appreciation of the brilliant satire Mike Judge employed in that film. Instead, they continue to collect hefty paychecks for contributing ever more filth to our decaying cultural landscape."

","The title 'Bridesmaids' was a little misleading at first, me and probably everyone else who only heard the title was instantly thinking 'chick flick'. I'd like to make it clear right now, just because a movie has a female cast, that doesn't automatically make it a chick flick (not bashing that sub genre, just clarifying). It was a bit on the rom-com side, but most comedies are. Anyway, once the trailer started and i saw that the brilliance of Apatow and Feig were collaborating, i had to see it. From beginning to end i couldn't stop laughing, the cast was perfect, especially Kristen Wiig. It's as if the jokes were tailored to her comedic style, which is probably due to her involvement in the writing process. What was really great about this movie, which is a large part of any comedy movie being successful, Bridesmaids is infinitely quotable!! (supposed to be all caps, but IMDb told me i couldn't shout hahah but i love shouting!!!!).

"piratecannon","8","25","47","26 December 2012"," Love Hurts
","Let's be honest: when we saw the first trailer for Bridesmaids, who among us didn't think it looked like a dismal rehash of The Hangover (only this one, of course, features a ""ratpack"" of women)? Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Bridesmaids is better than The Hangover. I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist. But one thing is for sure: Kristen Wiig has proved her worth as a female lead with a serious amount of comedic clout.<br/><br/>The story isn't revolutionary: one of two best friends is getting married, and everything involved with said nuptials is threatening to tear their lifelong friendship apart. At the center of this battle is Helen, a newly acquired ""friend""—via the merging of two exclusive social circles—who begins taking over the wedding plans for Lillian (Rudolph). Annie (Wiig) makes it her mission to take out this she-devil, and what follows is the setup for one of the more memorable meltdowns (among a plethora of other things) to come along in quite some time. Bridesmaids is also peppered with the sort of humor that made movies like Superbad and Knocked Up so funny—it's observant and kitschy in that it rightly jabs several other films that have braved similar issues. In fact, the previously mentioned Hangover is, in at least a very minute way, one of these movies. In what initially appears to be a sad ""bow"" to The Hangover as king of the pre-wedding funnies, the girls decide to go to Vegas for Lillian's bachelorette party. This ends up being a perfectly welcome curve ball, though, as screenwriters Wiig and Mumolo brilliantly utilize the length of the plane trip to said destination to further flesh out their characters and create an impressively humorous string of in-flight mishaps.<br/><br/>There are a number of other contributors who make Bridesmaids work extraordinarily well, but, as is the case with any solid piece of cinema, it's best if you set aside some time to take in the whole thing in one fell swoop and let it unravel of its own volition. Sure, it's extraordinarily raunchy from time to time, but the nuanced, perfectly- timed moments of comedic genius make it a very worthwhile trip."

I felt no sympathy at all for any of the characters. If I enjoyed slapstick and gutter humour I might have liked it better. Every ""joke"" was stretched out beyond its limits.

"ajudki20","4","9","14","19 September 2012"," Trite Drama Saps Comedy
","Bridesmaids is a great example of how words have lost their meaning in how we describe and interpret our films these days. This film is described as a comedy, but, only perhaps a third of the films is even meant to be humorous. That's probably generous. This isn't just false advertising to the alert movie-goer. It is a sort of self lie that the makers of this film are telling themselves without even knowing it. <br/><br/>Here's what I mean: If only a third of this film is funny, than what is the rest? The rest is light and very shallow drama about a woman who is down on her luck, but also fond of wallowing in her problems. Not the best comedy wellspring. A small part of that is romantic in nature— we see this woman, Annie is her name, be used as a third romantic option by a shallow, rich jerk played by Jon Hamm (as though he just ran on set for a day to do it between projects) and an underdeveloped and unrealistic positive relationship develops between Annie and a European sounding Wisconsin State Trooper. The end result is a minority of scenes devoted to comedy. But the problem is deeper because the film is working so many angles—romantic comedy elements with Annie's relationships, straight romance with her State Trooper love interest, a story about female jealousy, female friendship and wedding procedure as well as an almost non existent attempt to show us a bit of all the bridesmaids (who have almost never even heard of each other for some reason). All this, plus Annie's life falls apart to a pathetic and perhaps gratuitous extent, only to rise in the last five minutes like a phoenix. It is too much—in two senses. One, it makes the film too long. Two hours and fifteen minutes is a long film to endure if it isn't inspired. This film isn't. Lauded as a female response to the male oriented Judd Apatow type comedies of our age, this film is simply that formula with more mope and competitive insecurity. If you like Apatow you'll find this film middling. If you think comedy should be moving beyond that type of film now, you'll be disappointed. <br/><br/>The second way this film is too much is that it stretches the writers and actors too far. The dramatic moments feel contrived, shallow, and generic, yet the comedy is not developed nearly enough. Few jokes are innovative or risky in any way. The performances are dull except Melissa McCarthy, who amazingly scores as the only funny and only touching actor in the whole film. In this sense, despite limited screen time, this is her movie. <br/><br/>I think the headline here is opportunity lost. A comedy with mostly female characters from a female perspective is a good idea. Some of the actors have good comedy ability, used here in the wrong way or not enough. Kristen Wiig may have a good comedy lead in her, but this isn't quite it, Melissa McCarthy needs more screen time to stretch out her talents, and Tim Heidecker (who plays a cameo as the groom) should be allowed to at least take a swing at some jokes. His type of comedy riffing is what American comedy needs more of. It seems symbolic that he played a role that allowed him no chance to add to the undernourished comedy."

","Lillian (Maya Rudolph) picks Annie (Kristen Wiig) as her Maid of Honor, but Helen (Rose Byrne) vies for the job anyway and things get way out of control.<br/><br/>This could have been a nice movie regarding friendships if the inappropriate and disgusting parts were eliminated. And, there were many. Let's start with the inappropriate and almost x-rated sex act in the opening scenes to the disgusting parts: a woman in a wedding gown defecating in the street ; a woman defecating in a sink of all places; a woman throwing up on the head of another woman also throwing up in a toilet; and language, language, language throughout. Do women really talk this way when by themselves? <br/><br/>Billed as a comedy, there was nothing funny in here unless the disgusting parts mentioned row your boat. Women wrote this screenplay and when that happens, they seem to have a tendency to outdo the men to come up with Super-Raunchy stuff and that they did. <br/><br/>The only thing that would change these disgusting acts is that they be shown as promos on network TV during prime time. Now, you know that will never happen. The promos only show you the tame stuff and off you go to what you think will be a nice movie regarding friendships and then get the shock of your life. <br/><br/>However, there is a nice boy meets girl scenario when Annie meets Officer Nathan (Chris O'Dowd). These scenes are pleasant. And, later when Annie needs Officer Nathan to help find Lillian and she does crazy things in her car toward that end, Nathan won't budge because he was jilted earlier by Annie. These scenes are somewhat comical. Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't like this. <br/><br/>Ready for more shocks? It seems that if your character behaves outrageously in a raunchy manner you get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. <br/><br/>And, one more: there is also an Oscar nomination for Best Writing for Original Screenplay. Give me a break. (1/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex act: Yes. Nudity: No. Public Defecation: Yes. Children spewing F-bombs: Yes. Language: F-bombs throughout."
"deathiscoming-1","1","55","116","26 July 2011"," Poor acting, filthy, predicable and boring – basically a poorly made female hangover
","Last week I was blackmailed into sitting through this chick flick which I'd heard (from guys and girls I thought I trusted) was ""hilarious"", but the fact that the opening scene almost made me hurl my face off, paved the way for yet another predictably awful cinema experience. I sat through the movie secretly making notes on my Android, got home, sat down to write this review and thought ""where do I start?"" and that's when I realised, ""when suddenly it becomes difficult to write a review on a movie I hated, I know I've hit an all time favourite"" (or not, as it may seem).<br/><br/>The story basically follows a bride and her bridesmaids as they try and make it from engagement to marriage and for one reason or another ""things don't pan out the way you'd expect"" (but actually they do). Refreshingly though, the bride is not protagonist of this movie its one of her bridesmaids; personally I'm bored to death of watching bridezillas! The trailers do a good job making this squashed bike wreck look funny – I smile even now as I watch it again – oops – but believe me when I say those are the only funny moments in the movie.<br/><br/>There's an uncomfortable silent-but-violent odour of ""the hangover"" all the way through the movie, the character profiles are roughly the same (the frustrated married one, the sensible one, the crazy one and the weird permed one) but throw in rich-lonely-bimbo and closet lesbian and you basically have 99% of womanhood represented in the movie. The other hangover whiffs are: the (wannabe) Vegas hen do, stolen puppies' v stolen baby, missing bride v missing groom.<br/><br/>The acting came across more forced and scripted than an apology from Bart Simpson; most of the humour (ironically) is toilet humour and why oh why is there some limp, flaccid love story in mix? (Oh yeah, it's a chick flick). Again, maybe this is a girl thing, but I didn't understand anything the women said, I felt like I was watching a schizophrenic have a conversation with a pinball machine (maybe my man-brain just switched off as soon as I heard what I thought were women nagging). Why did Matt Lucas humiliate himself doing this gibberish? What was wrong with Chris O'Dowd's American/Irish accent? Was he meant to sound like bipolar, devil possessed Emily Rose with a speech impediment? By far the worst scene in the movie was the speech scene, I was cringing so hard I think I think my Buccinator (the muscle that makes you smile) went into spasm. The best scene in the movie was the street poo scene – again, ironic how toilet humour (ie man humour) got the theatre erupting.<br/><br/>Finally, Melissa McCarthy was brilliant! Although her character was obviously a rip off of Alan from ""the Hangover"" she played it convincingly and naturally, it's no wonder she is doing great professionally (check out Mike & Molly and we all know she's in Gilmore Girls too). I personally prefer classy, sweet women, so the filthy innuendoes didn't impress me but all in all she's the only thing that makes the movie bearable. Ultimately, I'm an open minded guy ergo most chick flicks I wouldn't actively avoid watching, but this is the clear exception.<br/><br/>p.s.

"jonnyhavey","9","14","25","15 May 2011"," Matrimony: Unbelievably Believable
","""Matrimony: Unbelievably Believable"" Director Paul Feig and Producer Judd Apatow have successfully created a romantic comedy that breaks through the usual limitations and rules of the genre. Bridesmaids proves that women can be as raunchy as men releasing the ridiculous upon audiences in original fashion backed by heart. Kristen Wiig has finally proved that she is much more than the goof seen on Saturday Night Live jumping to the top of the comedy genre brining the buddy comedy to the feminine arena. Wiig stars as a thirty-something year old women named Annie whose life is headed on a downward spiral. Her roommates are impossible to live with, her job sucks and her love life is nonexistent except for meaningless sexual escapades with a man named Ted (Jon Hamm, The Town). To top it off her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph, Away We Go) puts things into perspective when telling Annie she is getting married. On the bright side, Lillian has chosen Annie to be her Maid of Honor giving Annie something worth working for. Annie's excitement doesn't last long as she meets Lillian's diverse bridesmaids choices, Megan (Melissa McCarthy, CBS's Mike and Molly ), Becca (Ellie Kemper, NBC's The Office), and Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey, Reno 911!: Miami) along with Helen (Rose Byrne, Get Him to the Greek) who uses her wealth and power to takeover as Maif of Honor. Annie has hit bottom and with the support of a police officer named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd, Gulliver's Travels) and the antics of female relationships, she embarks on a hilarious yet meaningful journey to rediscover herself. <br/><br/>Bridesmaids differentiates itself from the rom-com stereotype with the clever cliché-free scriptwriting of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo. No matter how outrageous the jokes become, they are smart, fun and unbelievably believable. Consequently, the film controls the outrage allowing the humor to improve the story and support the almost perfect Apatow cast. For example, Melissa McCarthy acts like a complete idiot racking up the laughs giving male raunch a run for its money. However, the stand out performance and the best performance of an actress this year so far comes from Kristen Wiig's multidimensional melding of comedy and drama.<br/><br/>How do you complain about a movie as unique as Bridesmaids? Well first audiences expecting to see a chick flick have no idea what they are getting themselves into and if they cannot take the raunch it is going to be a painful two hours. Also, while the film is titled Bridesmaids, viewers may expect a story based around more than one woman, when in actuality it is not. Even so, the only real problem with the film is its song and dance happy ending, undermining what could have been a great finale.<br/><br/>Comedies bordering the two-hour mark usually have a hard time engrossing the audience as the jokes run thin and the drama ensues, however, Bridesmaids' comedy becomes smarter and smarter giving each of the bridesmaids a matrimonial purpose in Wiig's fasttrack to the A-List."

But as it's marketed as a comedy for and about women and as that it is a massive failure. Does anyone in this generation have the ability to tell a story without attempting to make jokes out of masturbation and bodily functions? This was supposed to be a comedy for women, not 12 year old boys. It takes real skill and a real story to make those things truly funny and not just lame and sad.

But when Apatow and Paul Feig tries to save this genre, it's still has its chick flickness but it has a realistic and full of heart storyline. The film has its raunchiness. It's hilarious throughout. Bridesmaids must be the best comedy movie of the year so far, and one of the funniest chick flick comedies ever.<br/><br/>First goes to the actors. Kristen Wiig's is a brilliant comedian. Her craziness and charisma really made the show aside from the humor. Maya Rudolph gives a lot of heart to her role. Melissa McCarthy has the best parts and she nearly steals the show. The rest of the cast did a great job to this film.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is not as generic as the other female comedies existing. The story isn't really that original but it portrays in a realistic way. Not quite realistic but it's not an escapist love story where the main girl is perfect human being but a loser. Aside from the love story plot, the parts when she is being jealous to her best friend's new friend. There's mixed emotions and comedy to those scenes. Paul Feig knows how to put humor plus heart perfectly in a comedy film.<br/><br/>The humor is written by clever writers even the star of this film. What we expect to this film, it's hilarious throughout. The raunchy humor and some toilet humor mixed with heartfelt emotions and awkwardness. It's (obviously) one of the merits of this film.<br/><br/>Most people say this film is like The Hangover but with female cast. The Hangover is more clever but this one is more hilarious and more heart than you expect. The performances plus the hilarious humor, this film is easily one of the funniest female comedies ever although it's unnecessarily long but it's undeniably enjoyable(even if you're a guy)."

","In Milwaukee, the bitter Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is a complete loser with a messy life: she is the sex toy of the womanizer Ted; she has a lousy job of seller in jewelry; she drives a junk car; she shares her apartment with two morons and siblings; she bankrupted her bakery business. When her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) invites her to be the maid of honor with four bridesmaids, Annie feels jealous and envious of the gorgeous and wealthy Helen Harris (Rose Byrne) and they compete to be Lillian's best friend. Meanwhile the police officer Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) feels attracted to Annie.<br/><br/>""Bridesmaid"" is an overrated comedy with a terrible story, scatological jokes and an envious lead character that takes the most despicable attitudes in the party of her best friend due to her envy. I really did not like this awful story but I laughed with some bizarre situations. The joke with the Brazilian food is ridiculous. My vote is four.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Missão Madrinha de Casamento"" (""Mission Maid of Honor"")"

There were a lot of hilarious and disgustingly awesome jokes. Wiig plays Annie, best friend to Lillian who is about to get married. Annie is asked to be the Maid of Honor and becomes jealous of Lillian's new rich friend, Helen. Throughout the movie, Annie slowly goes crazy and constantly competes against Helen.

","I was listening to NPR (YES, the highly cultured NPR) and two of the movie reviewers on the air had this turkey in their top ten list. Now, this might say more about how bad the other films of 2011 were, so I will be generous and not attribute the entire blame to the reviewers. After hearing how funny and ""unique"" this film supposedly is, I went out and rented it for a good laugh. No laughs. Lots of cringing embarrassment at how these women humiliate themselves. Awful stereotypes. Bad writing. Really unattractive protagonist. I mean that both in terms of personality and in terms of appearance. Wiig looks anorexic in this film, nearly getting lost in the bridesmaid dress she wears, AND what about her hair? (Sorry to be so superficial, but it bugged me throughout. I mean, COMB it already.) I found Chris O'Dowd charming, but it is as if he wandered into the wrong movie. And this was written by women? It is so insulting to women -- to the heavyset ""closet lesbian"" (as another reviewer called her) to the poor poor little rich girl Helen to the wacky mother who goes to AA for the social aspect etc etc. Please spend your precious viewing time on something else if you haven't already been hooked into watching this catastrophe by misguided critics or friends..."

","I should have known. After seeing Ms. Wiig's appearance on ""The Daily Show,"" during which she admitted having to buy and consult a book on ""how to write a screenplay"" prior to creating ""Bridesmaids,"" I still went ahead and shelled out the money for a ticket. And, as I suspected, the movie came off as a less than sure collection of scenes trying desperately to inflate a plot.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong, some of those scenes are hysterical. But this movie doesn't know what it wants to be, and so suffers from the same malaise that afflicts the lead character, Annie: drift.<br/><br/>I believe Kristen Wiig has better material in her future. But she's got to move from the neat form of sketch comedy to the more challenging, and longer, form of feature film with her storytelling talents intact."

","When I saw the previews, I wasn't interested in this movie. My husband was planning on taking me to this movie for our 5th and I am so pleased didn't. It's been about 5 months since this came to theaters and I finally sucked it up and watched it, only to realize I was right about how awful it would be.<br/><br/>I assumed it would be one of those movies where the only funny parts are the ones you see in the previews and I was right.<br/><br/>The first thing that I found cheap, tacky and unoriginal was the overweight woman was disgusting. Melissa McCarthy played an adorable and beautiful Sookie on Gilmore Girls, so to be reduced to a farting blob that can't be sure if she's farting or burping, is pathetic. And i couldn't tell if she was a masculine lesbian or not. She acted like a man, but was attracted to men which made no sense.<br/><br/>This movie is full of disgusting scenes trying to be funny rather than actual humor, much like the ""Scary Movies"".<br/><br/>Neither Paul Feig, Kristen Wiig, nor Annie Mumolo had a creative bone in their bodies or an original thought in their heads. The bridesmaids dresses are hideous, even though these days most brides choose nice dresses to make the whole wedding look nicer; bad dresses aren't so common anymore. They all get food poisoning, and the entire bridal shop scene is vomit worthy. The maid of honor, surprise-surprise, is upset about still being single so she shrugs her duties as MOH. And as always, if you don't have anything worth while, win over the audience with sex and profanity.<br/><br/>The movie was the most unsophisticated you can get, so far, but lets give people a chance to beat it. It's not funny is disgusting and so implausible that you'd have to be an idiot or drunk to find it to be a quality comedy.<br/><br/>The only funny part was... In conclusion, I'm sure this movie is hilarious to its target audience of teenagers, adults with lower than average IQs or viewers that are high or drunk. It may be for viewers of Jersey Shore and Jackass, not viewers of Jeopardy."

There are a lot of American comedies that I find less than amusing nowadays and which seem to be focused on teenage boys and their bodily functions, but this female version really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. (Thank God for the Coen brothers! And for writers who understand that good comedy uses humour, subtlety, satire and wit rather than a sledgehammer to get a point across!) This film sets out to shock and that is, in fact, the only area in which it succeeds.<br/><br/>The women in it are (mostly) so awful that if you were a guy you'd choose to be gay, and as a woman you would choose to elope!

And yet...by some perverted reasoning we have reached this stage where women are applauded (mostly I must say by other women)for exhibiting the worst traits of their opposite numbers. If you want to see women swearing,vomiting,defecating and fxcking then here's your chance. All the women in the audience were hooting with laughter.

","What do Bridesmaids and the Passion of the Christ have in common? Actually, quite a lot:<br/><br/>They are both wildly successful. They are both extremely painful to watch. And finally, neither is really a movie, for different reasons. Passion is a slow-motion torture of Jesus Christ, filmed from every possible angle, as the basis and justification for why you should believe in Christianity. Which to my mind misses the whole point of Jesus' message, as does Mel Gibson apparently, based on his behavior.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids really can't be described as a film either, at least in the sense of structure, plot, and acting. I am not being facetious. Watching this film, I started getting the very depressed feeling that I had seen its style before. And then it hit me that I had; in every Will Ferrell movie. Ferrell's movies aren't written; they're improvised. And Ferrell doesn't act; he improvises. Which is why I can never see another of his films until he changes. I wasn't surprised when I saw the outtakes of Bridesmaids: Outtake after outtake of unused improvised scenes, exactly like every Will Ferrell movie. Why should I sit down and write out a screenplay with characters, plot and dialog, and then to create a believable character, when I can improvise it in five minutes? Unfortunately this trend is spreading. Watching this film, I recognized many ""improv exercise"" scenes I used to see and perform in theaters: especially the ""top this"" exercise, which makes up the majority of scenes in this movie, which go on and on until it becomes torture. When you see them live at a theater, they can be funny if forgettable. In a movie, it falls flat and is painful. I felt relieved at the end of the film, not anything else. I had to go do something fun after-wards. I have seen Kristen Wiig do some very funny things live, so I know she can perform. Whether she can create a complex and believable character based on an actual script, and not an improvisation, is yet to be seen. I hope I do see it, because I think she can.<br/><br/>But I hope I never, ever see another ""improvised movie"" again. Unfortunately, since audiences to go see them and they are much easier to make than an actual scripted film that is acted, there will be more of them. Too bad..."

The scene at the engagement party where Annie and another bridesmaid try to outdo each other with memories of their relationship with Lillian went on way too long. I almost turned off the movie at that point, but I continued to watch it and kept hoping it would get better. It never did.

"Robert_duder","Null","6","9","22 October 2011"," Over-hyped, and mis-represented excuse for female comedy
","I know exactly why Bridesmaids was so successful. Women wanted a dirty, raunchy, fun, slapstick, laugh out loud comedy for them, just like guys got The Hangover. Making a film like this would have to be instant gold at the box office and it was!! Why did I dislike it? Well first of all it was completely misrepresented. People that call this the female Hangover are just desperately trying to make themselves believe that. There was no wild and crazy adventure in this film. They get on the airplane for what like five minutes and then the rest is surrounding the wedding and the fancy homes and the city they reside in. The entire film focuses on the Maid of Honors mental break down and barely even touches the other 'Bridesmaids' which again misrepresents the film. Everything that people say about this movie I just don't see. The script for this film is some of the most awkward dialogue I've ever seen on the big screen. It felt like a two hour SNL skit that wasn't funny. I think I would have scored this less than five if even just a little of the hype didn't rub off on me and I didn't completely want to cut my wrists watching it.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig is Bridemaids. The whole film revolves around her and her breakdown leading up the wedding. Wiig is really the same as she is when she's playing her awkward SNL characters. I suppose some are big fans of that but to me it was just way too much over and over and over again. She has no chemistry on screen. I could say almost the exact same thing about Maya Rudolph only graciously she is almost underused in the film and she is definitely toned down from her SNL performances or her recent turn on the sitcom Up All Night (a good show by the way.) Rose Byrne is the snooty rich friend who becomes an instant nemesis to Wiig's character. Their rivalry is the basis of the entire film, and is focused on about an hour too much of the entire film. Receiving a ton of accolade for this film is Melissa McCarthy as the raunchy cousin. She is funny and she might be the only strong performer in the film. I think she is typecast in her comedy because of her size but it works for her. The other Bridesmaids gals Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper are barely noticeable and get buried under the rest of the cast. I'm not sure why they are even there. Chris O'Dowd is the love interest for Wiig and he's good but he exudes the same awkwardness that clouds the entire film.<br/><br/>If there is one scene that boils down how I feel about this film it's the toasting scene with Wiig and Byrne. It feels like it's improvised and it also feels like its never going to end and the awkward angle is not funny because its already been done throughout the entire film...again extended SNL skit. No funnier than MacGruber (I've never seen it but I can imagine.) Director Paul Feig has had a long successful career in acting and directing. A lot of his direction is from off-beat comedies like Arrested Development, Freaks and Geeks, and The Office and it shows. Shows like that also thrive on an awkward comedy and this is really right up his alley. I think he's lucky that Bridesmaids hit all the right chords for people, came around at the right time and the right place but I'm sure I'm not the only one that thought it was over hyped and just not very funny. Sorry ladies...this one is a dud. 5/10"
"pjmalarkey","Null","6","9","11 October 2011"," Worst movie I've seen this summer
","Bridesmaids: A Review Bridesmaids is an over-hyped, underdeveloped idea, ripping off a successful and hilarious male comedy trying to skew to the concept to the female demographic, however, it was terribly implemented and an overall failure.<br/><br/>The concept from which this movie arose was very sound. From the hype around the movie I understand that the movie was to be a female version of the movie The Hangover. The Hangover became an almost overnight classic, but it was the first of a type of movie, and where popularity is, others will follow.<br/><br/>I only watched this movie because I was told that it was a female version of The Hangover, and I, therefore, had very high expectations of this movie. From the beginning, I quickly became disinterested in the movie as there was little action to keep it moving along. Sure there are going to be differences between females and males and their planning of a wedding and of the bachelorette or bachelor party that goes along with it. Bridesmaids could have been better, in my opinion, if, rather than focusing on all the events that go along with the path to marriage, such as the engagement dinner with all the ladies and the dress shopping, if it would have skipped some of the filler material and focused on what everyone was expecting from the movie, which was a wild and crazy night. There wasn't even a wild and crazy night, as the plane was forced to land before the destination and the ladies had to return by bus, due to an in-air incident. Now, had the bus continued onto Las Vegas, or if they had stopped in some smaller town, and had an amazingly crazy night, the movie would have at least gotten close to the hype. Unfortunately, this movie tried way too hard to be something that it just couldn't be. The initial comparisons between the movies set the expectations almost unrealistically high, and then after seeing the movie, I was left disappointedly shaking my head, almost in embarrassment for it. The ladies in this movie acted well, and there were several memorable moments, such as running out of the dress shop and stopping in the middle of the street due to a bad meal at a local restaurant. Overall, there were several ups and downs of the movie, but due to the high expectations that I had for the movie, it will be sitting on my shelf, not to be viewed very often, and I will not be recommending this movie for any others to watch."

Yes there were bits that I did find very amusing, however it was only certain parts and not enough to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>I don't have high expectations for films usually but this really disappointed me :/ I think the storyline was a good idea and I can see were the potential is for it.

","I certainly waited for this film to come out on DVD and that was the right decision. This film seems split between wanting to be a comedy (the only scene that actually made my wife laugh out loud was the bit where the bridesmaids were trying on gowns and got an attack of food poisoning) and a coming of age drama as we wait to see how long it will take Annie Walker (Kristin Wiig) to become an adult. It was OK as a DVD flic but who would pay eight bucks for a ticket? And the cast listing on the IMDb seems odd. Chris O'Dowd who has a pretty pivotal role gets short shrift in billing while Terry Crews whose 60 seconds gets top billing. Explain that one to me. I have to infer women made this a hit as it was pretty much an ensemble female cast but so was The Help which actually had real actors actually acting. I believe the four rating is generous."
"Lejink","3","7","11","27 December 2011"," Bridesmaids revisited
","In my defence I didn't get ""The Hangover"" either, the brother to the sister here. This, for me, was an overlong, only occasionally amusing modern comedy peopled with that contrasting combination of weird and supposedly normal people, put into supposed comedic situations by a bachelorette party staged for a prospective bride. Thus we get the creepily strange fat couple that rooms with Kristen Wiig's Annie and the even more overweight (the bigger the waistline, the stranger the persona appears to be the rule here) groom's sister with a penchant for puppy dogs and a flair for picking-out air-marshals on plane-flights who attempts to bond with Wiig at her lowest ebb. The story, if I can call it that, is told from Wiig's point of view and starts immediately with her engaging in casual sex with a guy who kicks her out of bed by morning and to whom she's no better than his number three shag. Some humour does emerge as she gets into a bidding competition at the engagement party of her best friend's Maya Randolph's new best-friend, the super-rich, super beautiful Helen, well-played by Rose Byrne but after that the humour gets scatological at a posh bridal-wear shop, drunken on board an aborted plane flight to Vegas and finally kooky and at times surreal encounter with an off-beat cop with whom she makes an unlikely connection. Of course it all ends up happily at the wedding, her best-friend credentials to the bride re- established as they belt out Wilson Phillips' feminist anthem ""Hold On"" and she gets reunited with her cop but by then the laugh count had dropped even more. I'm vaguely aware that this strain of humour mixing gross, crazy people with so-called normals is all the rage - I've not even mentioned Jill Clayburgh as Wiig's, yes you guessed it, wigged-out mother, or some of the other bridesmaids who drop out of the picture after an hour or so, but this slacker humour just doesn't float my boat, especially when it runs way beyond 2 hours in the telling."

","I had not expected this movie to be one of the worst I saw this year. After all, it has a decent rating on IMDb, it's produced by Judd Apatow, and it was lauded as the ""female hangover"". What could go wrong here? As it turns out, pretty much everything. This movie managed to literally hit all, and I really mean all, the wrong buttons for me.<br/><br/>I guess that at least something could be said for the premise, which basically is combining a fart comedy with a romantic drama. Somehow, though, it manages to take the very worst aspects of a drama and the very worst part of a fart comedy.<br/><br/>First of all, save for one or two instances, the humor totally misses the mark. I think I smiled maybe twice during the entire two hour running time, which must be a new low on the jokes per minute scale. The jokes just don't work..the physical humor is just plain vulgar in a bad way, and the verbal humor, while probably supposed to be sharp, just comes across as pointless angry ranting. Also, just about every scene goes on for way too long, ruining any potential there might have been.<br/><br/>For a drama, it also fails badly. First of all, just about every character with the possible exception of the police officer love interest, is self-obsessed, unsympathetic, shallow and just plain boring. It's impossible to care about these characters as they go through the horribly overlong (the movie is slow to a fault, as well) motions and end up at the horribly predictable conclusion.<br/><br/>I suppose some will pass of this movie as ""clever"" or ""original"" but in the end it's just the same old romcom template which has been done hundreds of time before..only this time with no humor, no chemistry and a lot of poorly executed ""serious"" take on the subject."

The whole movie is one bad scene after another and seems only to rely on gross out toilet jokes and other disgusting humor that makes me want to wretch at the thought. It seems a lot of Hollywood movies lately are getting more and more daring on the things they get their actors to say and do. I'm all for realism in movies and I don't object to cursing or natural bodily functions being used in a humorous way but when whole movies seem to be based on these jokes it really starts to wear thin and just seems to be a desperate way to get audiences to laugh out loud. When you take away all the gross out jokes from this movie all we are left with is a nonsensical plot that goes nowhere, characters that seem unrealistic and one dimensional and a feeling that Hollywood has dropped yet another bomb into an already overflowing toilet bowl."

I think both of them are hilarious and they played their parts perfectly. The rest of the cast barely existed. I was very disappointed that Wendy McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper both had very minor roles (they made the poster but had about 3 lines a piece).<br/><br/>I am sure a group of girls will love this movie, it has some sappy ""BFF"" moments and a lot of anti-feminism tones that female moviegoers eat up (e.g. Kristen Wigg is a baker who feels worthless because she can't find a man to take care of her). However, guys beware. This is not a comedy for all sexes, this is a comedy that is focused on women and presents many issues that guys will not find funny or relatable.<br/><br/>While I see nothing wrong at all with a movie by women for women (and a good movie at that); I do have issues with a movie that states it is for everyone, and it clearly isn't.<br/><br/>The Hangover was a helluva lot better (not because it had men in it, because it was just funnier)."
"The-Sarkologist","3","20","40","23 September 2011"," Don't bother wasting your time.
","This movie was rubbish. I absolutely hated it, and since it was the last movie that I watched on the plane as I returned from Europe before I arrived home in Adelaide, so it was a rather disappointing end. Anyway, somebody told me that it was like the feminine version of 'The Hangover' and thus my expectations were that it would be a group of women getting up to all sorts of trouble in Las Vegas. However, that was not the case.<br/><br/>I am simply going to say that this is a chick flick with a few fart jokes thrown in to keep the guys amused. Now, I don't mind chick flicks, however they have to be of a very high quality. This movie is not. Basically it is the story of a woman (Annie) that goes through the movie feeling sorry for herself. She has a pointless job (her business had gone bankrupt), is not married (and the only guy that she sees is what one would call a friend with benefits), and basically has no money. However, her best friend (Lillian) is getting married, and she is introduced to her other friends, and suddenly decides that she must compete with another woman for Lillian's approval. However, it is clear that the other woman is not even trying and it is simply because Annie has a very low self esteem.<br/><br/>This movie begins with sex, and that is something that is going to put me off, and it is casual sex at that. Now, a clever movie would open (like this film) with grunts making people think of sex, and then it turns out to be something completely different. That is clever. This movie is far from clever (though that are a couple of amusing moments, though for a two hour long movie, it is a long time to wait for something funny to happen). I personally have no sympathy for the main character, though I guess this is the point of this film, that is for her to come to realise that she is the cause of all her problems.<br/><br/>However that is another American concept that I don't like (not to say that the Australians are any different) and that is that we are responsible for all our problems, and if our life is bad then it is our own fault. Okay, for those of us living in a middle class lifestyle, that may be the case, but it is not always. Take for instance the child born into a poor family in a poor neighbourhood who has no choice but to go to a school that is little more than a glorified day care centre, I would hardly say that this child's problems is entirely his/her fault. However that does not mean that we should not examine our own lives. As Plato once said 'the unexamined life is not worth living'."

","I had to brace myself to sit through this Film, as I had read some reviews that actually had praised it, and it was a very long two hours to endure what has to be described as one of the most sleazy movies I have yet seen. The attempts at humor mostly concerned pooping/farting/belching and vomiting, so if that is anyone's idea of a comedy then this is for you! The Wedding shop bathroom scene was the most distasteful of a bad lot, while the Airplane sequence was so unbelievable and overlong, and the other so-called ""highlight"" was the ""hens' do"" that was so badly staged and overacted that the most predictable ending could not come quick enough! I was so sad to see such a great actress as Jill Clayburgh having to lower her standards to take a role in this disaster."

All. in this movie (unless you happen to laugh at girls farting, belching, throwing up). One-dimensional characters that lead lives that are so far from reality it's amazing. Take for instance Annie (Wiig) and her job at the jewelery store... I assume talking to the customers like she does is supposed to generate laughter. It doesn't, believe me.<br/><br/>Drop your tickets/rentals and take two steps back! <br/><br/>And yes, my wife hated it as well."

","In my entire life I haven't been so much annoyed and irritated by a movie! Needless to say, my girlfriend and I walked out after 1 hour (the whole movie is about 2 hours long!) This movie is literally fart-poop-vomit ''comedy"" with no plot, poor acting, and no point at all. After one hour (with constantly getting worse over time) this movie reached the point in which bridesmaids are vomiting in close shots all over the place and over each other in the fancy bridal shop!! What can I say? At that point I took it as an insult to the audience, who has been so shamefully cheated by the trailers and false marketing to buy the tickets for a ''romantic comedy"". Instead, we got this disgusting and terrible movie which is a total waste of money and time and an insult to the common sense, after all.

Do we even want to keep watching it? Does it eventually get better?"" We continued on and we kept waiting for that ""scene/point"" of the movie when it suddenly hit its' stride but that never came.<br/><br/>The sole focus is not about a group of girls partying before a wedding but really about how much the main character's life sucks. I feel like we were supposed to be laughing at her misfortunes but it all came across as pathetic and made me feel depressed more than anything else.<br/><br/>The only highlight was Melissa McCarthy's character; but,as I already stated, it was hardly an ensemble cast movie about the group of ""Bridesmaids"". I would have loved to have seen more McCarthy, Kemper and McLendon-Covey. They are all fantastic comedic actresses that stroll in and out through the movie; but, (aside from McCarthy) are characters with no real substance.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't even get me started on the incredibly bizarre sub-plot with the roommates."

Just the feeling that it was a steaming pile,a waste of time, an affront to script writers and movie-goers. That's it. No scene or chuckle or line comes to mind. This movie was so bad, I doubt it can make it into a cult classic selection for horrible films.<br/><br/>I've seen comparisons to other films, like Wedding Crashers, Dumb and Dumber, and the Hangover. Each of those films had some redeeming qualities. Two of them are in my collection. This film may have been trying to be like those films, but it failed miserably, regardless of the impression I have that the actors did their best. Don't blame them - one may polish a turd forever and just have a shiny turd.<br/><br/>I wouldn't use this film's DVD as a coaster. Seriously. Avoid it. I don't know if some people sincerely like this, or if there is a concerted campaign to keep the ratings up. The metacritic score of 39 is much more accurate, but still generous. The young lady who viewed the film with me agreed."

Instead of being happy for her new life and doing everything she can to make her wedding wonderful, she spends the whole time being jealous that other girls are prettier, richer and throw better parties than her. She only warms up to her ""rival"" when the rival looks uglier than her. Wow, how shallow can you get? <br/><br/>To top it all off, the humor is not outstanding.

I wanted to go out long before that but I felt bad i spent all that money on that sack of potato of a movie.<br/><br/>Guys.. is this what you find attractive in women?

Then I was in the mood for going out Monday eve (tonight), so I decided to check out this website. Somebody on here (don't let me catch you anytime soon whomsoever you are) wrote that this is the comedy of the year and it's ten time better than the trailer. Not sure if he was talking about THE trailer, or he was referring than going to the movies is better than staying in the trailer.

"gregeichelberger","4","14","27","15 May 2011"," The ladies try to get a hangover, but fall short
","While trying to walk the tightrope between raucous comedy and tender love story, ""Bridesmaids"" presents an almost exasperating movie-going experience.<br/><br/>Directed by Paul Feig (veteran helmer of several episodes of ""The Office,"" ""30 Rock"" and ""Nurse Jackie"" television series) and written by SNL alum Kristen Wiig - who also stars - the film tries to be the distaff version of ""The Hangover,"" but substitutes that picture's hilarious stupidity with a schmaltzy romcom theme.<br/><br/>Plot has lifelong best friends Annie (Wiig) and Lillian (Maya Rudolph, SNL) planning Lillian's wedding to a dullard. Chosen as the maid of honor, Annie - whose personal and professional life is already in shambles - completely falls apart under the stress.<br/><br/>Her situation is not helped by the presence of Helen (Rose Byrne, ""28 Weeks Later,"" ""Get Him To the Greek""), a rich snob who is trying to become Lillian's new BFF. Add to this an eclectic collection of bridesmaids, including Becca (Ellie Kemper, ""The Office""), Rita (Wendy McLendon-Covey, ""Reno: 911"") and Megan (Melissa McCarthy, ""The Backup Plan,"" ""Mike and Molly"" TV series) and the cast is set for some really funny situations.<br/><br/>The problem is, however, comedus interruptus. Just when we're on the brink of some gut-splitting laughs, the film veers off into unnecessary serious moments. The biggest of which involves a supposed trip to Las Vegas that - literally - goes nowhere. It would have been a great opportunity to have the girls let it all hang out, but all we get is some lame projectile vomit scenes and an explosive diarrhea sequence. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the constantly beat-down Annie's (Annette Benning in ""Running With Scissors"" only WISHED she could be this depressing) life is spiraling out of control. She loses her job, is treated like dirt by her love interest (Jon Hamm, ""Mad Men""), gets kicked out of her own apartment (by a pair of slobby Australian roommates) and is forced to live with her mother (the late Jill Clayburg).<br/><br/>She does meet a sweet Irish cop, Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd, ""Gulliver's Travels,"" ""Dinner For Schmucks""), though, but, of course, she tries to poison that relationship, as well. In fact, Wiig is all over the map here and seems to be trying to play every inmate character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Plus, she's not really very funny, despite being on screen over 90 percent of the time. <br/><br/>The only humorous character is Megan and that's probably because she plays a plus-size semi-lesbian nympho truck driver type. Annie, on the other hand, despite the movie's attempt to justify her violent mood swings, is still someone few people in real life would even want to get close to.<br/><br/>Certainly not the worst film for the ""Girls Go Crazy"" genre - it's light years ahead of the ""Sex and the City"" franchise, for example - but needs to focus on just what kind of movie it really wants to be.<br/><br/>At least after 20 years, however, Wilson Phillips still looks and sounds great"

This movie fell into the ever growing group of movies that claimed to be "" as funny as the hangover!"", and what a surprise, like all the others, its not. This movie did have a few funny moments, I can't lie. Also a cast of great actors who played their various characters really well. But the story line seemed sorely lacking material and dimension, which they seemed to try and make up for/cover up with really long scenes. They would consist of a couple jokes that stretched on and on, It constantly got to the point where if a scene started and I was laughing or interested by the end I was just left wondering how long this movie was and when somethings going to happen. I don't know what everyone else finds so hilarious, but I'm passed drawing on magazines or books making the cartoons and models poop like I did when I was seven, and I graduated high school a few years ago, so I feel like I've heard all these sex jokes before. So all in all this movie just wasn't for me."

","So I was pretty interested in seeing this movie, in the past I've been a big Judd Apatow fan and I like the idea of a female-centered comedy. I was excited when I saw the great reviews, which made it watching the movie especially disappointing.<br/><br/>The movie was a pretty painful experience. It is filled with uncomfortable/awkward moments from jokes being dragged on too long, for example the toast at the engagement party (which I fast forwarded through when I couldn't take it any more)as well as fart/vomit jokes which I can't believe continues to appear in so many movies. Overall, the movie seems to paint a negative picture of women. I was surprised that this was written by a woman, it basically portrays women as sad, unable to function with out a man, catty and superficial. Anyway, can't speak for the whole movie given that I turned it off half way through, but I felt the need to write to save others the time."

","While it's good to see a female-driven comedy written by women (though produced and directed by men), it would be nice if the movie had some actual humor in it. Most of the characters are consistently petty, shallow, dishonest, selfish, and have rather ridiculous motivations for nearly everything they do. The pace is slow, the jokes fall flat, and the dramatic conflicts are oversimplified to the point of making the characters look incredibly stupid for not easily avoiding them. It is beyond my understanding how someone might consider any part of this movie to be a realistic or recognizable representation of ""real"" women, or of anyone."

","This film has multiple personality disorder. There are some genius moments and scenes, but they are drowned out by extreme, crass, predictable, over-the-top scenes full of stale gags. Many honest, well-written, amazing conversations and lines just float ungrounded in the wacky framework, or is the wackiness ungrounded in the dramedy framework??? . . . the honesty and closeness of the main relationship becomes unbelievable and subsequently the ""realness"" base of the film loses all credibility. <br/><br/>In spite of not enjoying the move overall that much, I think Wiig is a genius on screen and I hope to see her in something great with a different writing/directing/producing team.<br/><br/>Lastly, I cannot believe Paul Feig directed this!

But the similarity ends there. Whig & Rudolf are from SNL and this feels like one very very long SNL skit. Ms. Whig is on her way to becoming the next Adam Sandler. I can't believe this movie received Academy Award nominations and a movie like Drive didn't (well maybe one for sound). Melissa McCarthy is very strange and because she is so different from most of the comedy actors working today she is very watchable. You never know what she might do next. I get the impression she will do anything for a laugh. A good example is the sink scene in the upscale wedding shop. When she hosted SNL she also took a lot of chances. I hope she starts to get better material in the future."

There is no comparison AT ALL.If you think it is as funny as ""The Hangover"", then you are an idiot. There were only like 3 scenes that could only make me chuckle, and the rest of the time I felt like I was watching a drama. Aside from the lack of comedy aspect of the movie, another reason why it wasn't very good was because there were so many plot holes left in the end. I was waiting to see if they would tie everything together, but they didn't.<br/><br/>There was only one character in the movie that was remotely funny, and that was Melissa McCarthy's character, Megan.

There were a few funny scenes and lines (all of them in the trailer), and the rest was BORING. Watched with my wife this past weekend and we both were very disappointed as we had been wanting to see this movie for months. I'm certainly glad we didn't spend $25 on it, and even free (on the video player they provided on our United Airlines flight) it was still a waste of time. There were other movies to choose from and we feel duped into watching this one. We even stopped watching the lame Cars 2 to watch this, and I kind of wish I had watched the end of that one instead. Considering how bad Cars 2 was, that really says something.

","This might have been a decent film, had the people behind it had ANY sense of pacing and character development. Or a firm idea of what movie they were out to make: heartfelt chick flick or gross-out farce. That's all there is to it, really - a little talent not compensating for big talent missing. For instance: Annie is just too dense to be sympathetic. From the start, we see her screwing a loser because -hang on - she has esteem issues. But it's too, too contrived because the guy is so repulsive. Then, we're given no reason why she abandoned her love of baking, except that the trauma of losing her store (maybe) killed her passion. Too, too textbook. Worst of all, the adorable, caring cop is dismissed BECAUSE the writer and director expect you to accept that this is what self-destructive gals do. Not because of some interesting revelation of her character, or anything. I did enjoy the gross farce, and the jewelry store humor. Over-the-top, but fun. Again, though, it comes down to creative staff actually not knowing HOW TO CONSTRUCT a solid, well-made film.

"Irie212","3","5","8","17 March 2012"," Top 5 Things Wrong with ""Bridesmaids""
","5. Formula chick-flick, but with the frat-boy flourishes that women like Kristin Wiig and Amy Schumer have latched onto, apparently because they think feminism means imitating men. By the time all the gossiping and self-pitying and puking and, yes, diarrhea scenes are over, every one of the six female characters gets, or already has, her man. Happy endings go with comedies, of course, but writer Wiig seems incapable of adding anything surprising or original. The movie is a series of skits. <br/><br/>4. Cheap laughs, and not many of them. Insult humor goes after Lesbians, the fat, the aging, and-- in a movie about women-- ordinary women (""You look like an old mop,"" ""You're an old, single loser""). Instead of laughs, expect stammering à la Woody Allen, cursing à la Judd Apatow (he's a producer on this), and one-liners that depend mostly on four-letter body functions. Attempts at physical comedy fail-- e.g., Annie attacking a giant cookie-- because director Feig, cinematographer Yeoman, and editors Kerr and Sale don't know how to capture or control motion on camera for comic effect. <br/><br/>3. Oldest plot in Hollywood, which is, of course, de rigueur for romantic comedies: Girl meets boy, they flirt, fall in love/hit the sack (depending on the era), and then she storms out on him in a trumped-up fit so that we get a few mad-at-each-other scenes before the inevitable reunion can be staged with the inevitable sentiment and wisecracks. The familiarity and predictability of the plot isn't a problem if the details are fresh. There is nothing fresh here. In fact, the same old plot even applies to Annie's relationship with the mandatory rich bitch Helen (Rose Byrne): they hug at the end.<br/><br/>2. Comedies don't need fully realized characters the way dramas do, but they still need characters. These women are ideas, and thin ones at that. Their mascara has more depth than their roles. Only Melissa McCarthy stands out, and not just for playing the butch girl. With her exceptional timing and bold presence, she is so much better than her fellow actresses that she actually becomes the comic relief in a comedy-- which says all you need to know about this movie, as a matter of fact. In spite of her grotesque role, McCarthy is enjoyable, except during her big pull- yourself-together scene with Annie, which bears similarities to, but is less plausible than, The Exorcist. <br/><br/>1. In a movie about women, the most interesting character, and the only charming one, the only one I'd care to meet in real life, is a man, Officer Rhodes (Chris O'Doud).<br/><br/>It's pitiful, really, Wiig's lack of originality, let alone ambition. There were scenes that, if they had been tweaked with any wit or thoughtful insight, could have turned this into a satire. A statement about rampant consumerism was waiting to be made when the women were defecating in and vomiting over the $800 dresses they're expected to buy. The shallow understanding of foreign cultures could have been exploited in the ridiculous French-themed bridal shower. Megan's intervention with Annie could have exposed the idiocy of instant cures for personality disorders. But satire requires sophistication and distance and these filmmakers have neither. They are not about to make any trenchant observations about the culture they're exploiting for skit-level comedy. To Apatow et. al.'s credit, they do seem to know they're still at the potty-mouth level of maturity, so they stay close to the toilet, where they're obviously comfortable and so, it would seem, is a lot of their audience. As I write, the box office gross is closing in on $300 million worldwide."
"oldyfan","4","5","8","19 February 2012"," very disappointing and insulting
","I had heard a lot about how great this movie was. After watching it I am totally disappointed and it irritated me how horrible these women where portrayed. The maid of honor is a whiny ""poor me"" who can't bring herself to any level of self respect. The best part was when the one bridesmaid slapped her out of feeling sorry for herself. The ""beautiful"" bridesmaid was just a self centered b***h. The competition between the two brings women down to such a low level that it made me sick!! Yes, it is supposed to be a comedy and not a lesson on how to be a good person but this went so overboard that I felt little redeeming qualities in any of the women. There were a few good laughs in the movie but I would not recommend it at all."
"angie_l","2","5","8","6 February 2012"," Should NOT have been called Bridesmaids and was NOT funny.
","When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it was going to be bad but then the movie got so much hype and some nominations. When I saw the movie, it was worse than what my first impressions were. The movie didn't know if it wanted to be a somewhat serious comedy or just ridiculous shenanigans. <br/><br/>First problem, it forgot to be funny. There were parts that were mildly funny but the humor felt forced. The movie spent too much time on crude fart, vomit, diarrhea, and sex jokes - this is a bridal party we are talking about? Was the point just to prove that the girls can be as disgusting as the guys? Some scenes were quite serious about Annie's (Kristen Wiig) life and those made scenes like her stabbing the cookie and ruining the chocolate fountain unnecessary and over the top. The scene where Wiig and Byrne are trying to get the cops attention felt like a bad SNL skit that just didn't end and you're feeling embarrassed for the comedians acting it out. She could've drove by twice and had it actually be funny, we didn't need ten times. The length of each scene killed all potential humor.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig's character draws little sympathy. She hit her low but we didn't see her before she falls so we are only left with someone rather snarky and unlikable. She wasn't even a good friend, she couldn't sacrifice a little to make her friends wedding go smoothly. It could have been funny if Wiig was biting her tongue until she explodes. <br/><br/>Lastly, the plot just didn't bring much around. I was invested in all of the bridesmaids not just Wiig, though I didn't like any of them, not even Megan (Meliss McCarthy). The beginning of the movie spent time setting up the other bridesmaids such as the newly wed and the miserable wife and their story lines go nowhere. Annie could have been the main character working through her crisis and we could have seen growth in the other bridesmaids around her and a sense of comradery and bonding ensues. I thought it was bridesmaids and not 'maid of honor.' Also why does Megan show up to help Annie? Then Wiig does little to atone but all is forgiven anyway.<br/><br/>This movie is just bad on all levels. It tried way too hard to be funny and missed. This movie and its acting should never be nominated for anything, ever! By the way, in a Brazilian restaurant, they should have been greeted as senhorinhas not senoritas.<br/><br/>On a personal note: The hype combined with Golden Globe and Oscar nominations got me really excited about Bridesmaids. I was secretly hoping it would be Spinal Tap for bridesmaids. I have been a bridesmaid five times so far and the experience is ripe for comedy and I am sure many others can relate. There are bridal showers (playing inane games for prizes, not to mention how long and boring they are as someone opens predetermined gifts), buying gifts, bachelorette party (Hello!! Women adorning themselves with phallus covered crowns and some dirty games), rehearsal dinner, engagement party, wedding, picking a wedding gown, picking and ordering bridesmaids gowns and pretending you like taffeta, fittings!! (a bridal salon literally made me order a dress three sizes too big because of the size chart and my measurements even though the size in the store fit. Then when the dress came in, it was three sizes too big and I had to pay an extra $100 to get it fitted and it never fits/looks quite right after that), shoes, hair, nails, make-up, and jewelry - now start totaling up the cost of all that. Take these somewhat ridiculous situations and turn the volume up to 11 and you get the potential for a comedic gold mine, the whole custom is dying to be made fun of. I also have to say that being a bridesmaid is all worth it in the end. As much as is can be a hassle at times, it is also a lot of fun. You enjoy being their for your friend or family member on one of the most important days of their lives and are so honored that they chose you to be part it. The joy and the pain of the whole experience wasn't just not captured but completely ignored and this was a big disappointment. It could have been forgiven if the movie was good."

","I had high hopes for this movie, it being touted as a female friendly Hangover movie. I was disappointed with Hangover II, and thought this would be more fresh. How wrong i was.... What really really annoyed me in the movie was the part in the engagement party where the two women were gushing over each other to speak, they changed places like a gazillion times, and kept talking, and talking, until the slightest humor of the occasion was completely gone. As far as I was concerned a lot of the other jokes just fell flat. I couldn't even tell if it was women writing these awful lines or men, giggling insanely as they attempted to make women just seem dumb, stupid, manipulative, bitchy, and so so. I haven't finished the movie yet, I got to half way. That is how bad and poor it was, perhaps the second half is better hence all these good reviews out there.

A talented cast bring to life a hilarious script and I lost count of the laugh-out-loud funny moments. The worst part of the film is the title. I ignored this film every time I saw it listed because I had confused its title with Bride Wars with Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway which I found irritating rather than funny, but when I eventually decided to give Bridesmaids a go because there was nothing else on TV, I got such a fantastic surprise. I can only think that the viewers who gave this film such scathing reviews had been expecting a rom com, and this is nothing of the sort. Think of The 40 Year Old Virgin or even Two and Half Men and that is the kind of humour you get from Bridemaids, but with superbly funny women in the lead roles.

Plus, the way she treats the guy who likes her like crap, but he still wants her at the end. I don't buy it.

","I have seen funny comedy based films centered around women and this is not one of them. I might be the odd ball in the bunch, but this movie is not as funny or entertaining like people have been putting it to be.I can count only one scene that grabbed a few jiggles out of me, but the film as a whole, it does not deliver enough comedy to keep me entertained. There are too many dry un funny moments that made me not want to watch this any more. They created this film to become the female version of the Hangover and it never quite accomplishes its goal. I just not a firm believer that woman are not funny enough to carry a whole film by their self and to appeal to every person out there. Yes a few films will grab the attention of most females and some men, but appealing to the masses, I just don't think women comedy movies can do that. Chesley Handler and Ellen are about the only women I have seen enough of that can trigger laughter out of me and neither one of them were in this movie, so I wasn't laughin much during the film. This movie lost me in the first 30 minutes and I just punished myself to sit through the rest. It took forever for the movie to stir up some drama to actually punchier my brain for some entertainment. There spare ha ha moments, but nothing that causes great laughter. The women in this film try to hard be funny instead of being naturally funny and it shows on camera. They just become annoying instead of funny. This movie plays out like a two hour long SNL skit presented by Kristen Wiig and her bunch of humorousness friends. Kristen Wiig is funny to watch in some films, but never quite holds her own in a film centered around her. The plot of the movie was a good one, but the lack there of comedy and running time are the downfall and really kills the vibe of the movie. I guess I'm not the intended demographic for this movie, but I just felt like there was nothing worthwhile going on. I have seen a female wedding themed movie before , Bride Wars, and enjoyed it a lot more than this film and they sold the concept better than this movie. A lot of the jokes go on tremendously long and get annoyingly awkward. This is one of the only films that has been positively review during this summer and I for one feel the complete opposite of the critics and feel this is a huge let down."

I have always enjoyed Ms. Wiig as an actress. She's no screenwriter. (If she is then I'm a hidden genius.) A horrible boorish, dopey waste of everyone's time. Middle aged actors playing parts that should have been better tailored to B grade 20 somethings. It isn't funny even in a slapstick way. It isn't interesting. I was constantly holding back from pressing the fast forward button.<br/><br/>Admittedly I am not a fan of Jon Hamm. He's mediocre in my book as a talent--at best. They tried to push 2.5 minutes of him in a bedroom scene with Wiig as graphic in order ell more tickets I suppose. It is neither graphic (who would want that anyway?) nor is it funny.

People spending thousands upon thousands to look good, and thinking everyone should not mind spending a ton on dressing up, on attending or throwing multiple parties and then on at least two gifts.

","Marketed as a female version of "" The Hangover,"" ""Bridesmaids"" is far in comparison. ON the one hand you have a movie about four friends who drink themselves into the most elaborate, dangerous, and hilarious situations; all while completely unaware of what is occurring. Then you have ""Bridesmaids."" <br/><br/>Where do we begin? From the beginning of the film you just feel bad for the main character. You watch her daily routine and social interactions like a fly in the wall and just feel... awkward. It's awkward, because you almost feel embarrassed for her. Kristen Wiig's character is bitter and unpleasant and never lends herself to be liked. Even when you feel bad for her, it's hard to sympathize because her problems stem off of her simply unlikable personality. She finds herself in awkward situations that are simply the result of her own bitterness.<br/><br/>Thefilm does lend itself to some isolated laughs, with several ""caricature"" characters that lighten up the awkward, distilled, feeling that is the rest of the film. THe most likable role is played by actor Chris O'Dowd, and you honestly feel bad for him. He's a genuinely nice guy who once again falls victim to the main character's bitter nature. The isolated comedy, comedic characters, and O'Dowd's character are the only things that saved this film from being completely terrible. <br/><br/>If you like ""The Hangover"" and ""Wedding Crashers"" do not expect the same out of ""Bridesmaides."""

Annie Walker(Kristen Wiig)is not satisfied with her life; easy to see it is a big mess. When her lifetime best friend Lillian(Maya Rudolph)accepts a marriage proposal, Annie's focus on the world narrows and begins to unravel when she becomes the maid of honor. Annie is cash strapped and down-on-her-luck in the love department; but she puts on a brave face and bluffs her way through the expense and rituals of a grand wedding. Annie gets herself into a competition with another bridesmaid, Helen(Rose Byrne), who would be just happy to ruin all of Annie's efforts. Miss Walker tries to show the other bridesmaids that money isn't everything and prove to Lillian the limits to what a person will do in the name of love. A very crowded cast includes: Rebel Wilson, Ellie Kemper, Jill Clayburgh, Terry Crews, Steve Bannos, Kali Hawk and Melissa McCarthy, who I found to be the highlight of the whole movie.

However, as they say, too much of a good thing starts to become not so good. although I liked the character, it just was too much too often. The movie also has some parts that start off funny, but wear on you because of how long the scenes are stretched out (i.e.. the speech at the first party). Too repetitive a shtick in too lengthy of intervals. Also, Maya Rudolph is under utilized considering her comedic presence.<br/><br/>As far as the overall comedy in the movie, it's a real stretch. I like funny gross stuff just as much as anyone else, but when you crutch the majority of the movie just on that element of humor it loses its appeal. It seemed like every other scene had a gross sexual overtone. Using some real comedy (situational, wit, dialog...etc) as opposed to relying on puke and crap would have helped balance the movie better."
"Bravesfan17","9","9","20","13 May 2011"," A great comedy for girls and guys
","I had been hoping that this would be another great comedy to add to the Apatow group, and my hopes were fulfilled. This time around, producer Judd Apatow has called on director Paul Feig to do a movie with the main characters being women.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig from Saturday Night Live plays Annie, a former baker who has been out of business for a while. Maya Rudolph plays Lillian, Annie's best friend who announces that she is engaged and wants Annie to be her maid of honor. Starting with the engagement party, we are introduced to the other bridesmaids. The one bridesmaid that is mostly focused on is Helen, played by Rose Byrne. The story shifts to Helen trying and succeeding at stealing Annie's power as maid of honor. Every time Annie comes up with an idea on something to do related to the wedding or bridesmaids, Helen tries to outdo her.<br/><br/>Most of the focus is on Annie and the fact that she feels like Helen is trying to replace her and be better than her. I think what Wiig does so well in this role is how she makes us feel sympathy for her and want her to find a way out of her slump. I felt like cheering for her and wanted her to fix her life and stand up for herself. One scene I thought Wiig did really well was an outburst scene because she did great at showing her rage without going over the top. This film was a great starring vehicle for Kristen Wiig.<br/><br/>Byrne is great at being the snobby, over-achieving Helen. What Byrne does well is being the prissy snob that makes us want to hate her for what she is doing to Annie. At the same time, she is cool because of the strings she is able to pull to get what she wants.<br/><br/>Rudolph does some fine work in her part. She is likable at first because she is a good friend. Eventually, she is not there for Annie, and ends up turning on her.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the other bridesmaids in their parts. Ellie Kemper, who plays Erin on The Office, has some great scenes. She plays a young wife who says some stupid things and realizes she hasn't lived. Melissa McCarthy is a riot as Megan, who is smart, crazy, and ends up helping Annie in her time of need. Wendi McLendon-Covey is the other one, who does a fine job. Most of her screen time is her complaining about her home life.<br/><br/>The story is a hilarious one. Even though most of the ensemble is women, there are plenty of laughs for the guys as well. Most of the situations in the films are funny for everyone. Don't let the makeup of the main cast fool you. This movie is plenty of funny and is very entertaining."
"iheart_ny","10","6","12","13 June 2011"," Bridesmaids: A real, honest, hilarious celebration.
","I know I'm a little late on reviewing this one, I was going to just axe my review altogether. However, Bridesmaids is a film that is simply too good to be ignored. The reason for this is because it so easily could have been a bad movie. It could have been fake, and unrealistic, it could have featured paper-thin characters with no depth. It could have had a lousy script, with PG-13-friendly antics and adventures. It could've featured ridiculous product placement, and could have involved no realistic conflict, with an even more unrealistic conclusion. <br/><br/>However, it really doesn't do any of these things.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids has a great line of actresses that make the cut, in every possible way, and proves that women can truly be funny, instead of portraying them, as they easily could have, as whiny bitches. Kristen Wiig is a comedic genius. She co-writes the script, alongside Annie Mumolo (who appears in the film as a jittery passenger on a plane, look for her), and these two ladies bring a hell of a lot to the table. <br/><br/>Kristen Wiig, while having written a beautifully nuanced script that's funny, yet relatable, and therefore, a bit sad, is the star of the show here. She plays Annie, a lovelorn, broke, and generally unhappy woman whose best friend is getting married, and asks her to be the maid of honor. Whilst dealing with the bizarre and expensive rituals that come with that duty, her life begins to unravel. Friends, love, work, and life, in general begin to blur, and the mistakes of her past become full circle. She's a genuine character, she's not a cliché. As are the rest of the woman in this terrific film.<br/><br/>Maya Rudolph (another SNL favourite) plays Wiig's best friend Lillian, who's in the middle of planning a wedding, and begins to drift from her lifelong best friend, Annie. Rose Byrne (who I love in Damages) has a surprisingly apparent comedic side, playing Helen, a member of the bridal party, who is Lillian's fiancée's boss's wife (or something like that), and she is essentially the woman who's (possibly inadvertently) trying to destroy Annie and Lillian's friendship.<br/><br/>Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911! fame), gives a hilariously deadpan performance as Rita, a relative who is sarcastic, embittered, and generally dissatisfied in her marriage and resents her three sons. She clicks with Becca (Ellie Kemper, of The Office), a newlywed, who is extremely enthusiastic about becoming a wife and mother, who claims to have been ""so distraught"" when she was single. <br/><br/>Rounding out the bridal party is Melissa McCarthy (of Gilmore Girls, and now Mike & Molly) as Megan, the groom's sister. She's the oddball of the group, being decidedly more rough-around-the-edges as the rest of the ladies. While she appears to be for this movie, what Zach Gilifinakis was in The Hangover, she is given room, as are the rest of the ladies, to make exciting, complex, and rewarding characters. But McCarthy is probably the funniest one of the bunch. <br/><br/>It's already being referred to as the woman's answer to ""The Hangover"", or ""Hangover in Heels"", which I don't agree with. First of all, I didn't really like ""The Hangover"". For me, it was impossible to root for those four jackasses who weren't genuine, and felt clichéd and ridiculous. While this film certainly has its crude sequences, it's more about friendship, and how to react to things that happen in life that are not ideal. It's about how a friendship can survive whatever punches that are thrown at it.<br/><br/>The fact that each of these ladies are given room to make great characters makes this film as good as it is. Given that they don't really whine, and they prove that women ARE funny, and can be hilarious, sets it apart from any other film like this, that has been made in the last decade.

","For awhile I thought I'd lost my bearings on knowing what makes a film popular. I'm relieved to say it was just temporary. The film which made me question my ability was ""Bridesmaids"". An outstandingly tacky and outrageously badly acted piece of work if there ever was one.<br/><br/>Guided by all the positive reviews from the usual media suspects, I watched this film with others. Quite early on we were throwing popcorn and booing: We must have got the wrong movie, but no this was it! <br/><br/>The first inkling that reviewers had acted like lemmings in gushing all over this movie was the IMDb score. It is low for a highly acclaimed, mass audience film. The next and more telling indicator is the review in Variety which rated it pretty bad! <br/><br/>Lastly, in a film festival forum (now a YouTube video) the director of Bridesmaids was asked what his formula for success was? He said not following the script! Hey! It had a script, could have fooled me! You can't knock its success though, Bridesmaids has grossed over $250m! <br/><br/>Here's the insight. When the lady who gets over 50,000 viewers on YouTube watching her dog fart was asked what she would do for an encore, she replied add another farting dog on her show!<br/><br/>There's a market for this type of entertainment.

","First, I admit that I didn't watch this entire film. Actually, I COULDN'T watch the whole thing; I was giving myself a headache from rolling my eyes. According to the Scene Index, I saw half of the movie before I gave up. My wife gave up after the opening scene, and could watch no more.<br/><br/>I'd read that Melissa McCarthy's performance was the highlight of the film, but even she did not provide enough laughs to keep me watching. In its essence this is a guy movie with a female cast. Actually, it's a ""Dude,"" or maybe ""DOOD!"" movie. It is one disgusting scene after another, with very, very, very (very, very) few actual laughs interspersed. The opening scene of simulated sex was the first thing to raise my doubts as to the film's value. Not much later there was a protracted scene wherein the bride's old friend and new friend have a verbal duel as to which is the closest friend. The scene might have worked if it had been about 20% as long as it was. This boring, bitchy debate was followed by projectile vomiting and acute diarrhea while the gang of women is shopping for dresses. That was the final straw for me. <br/><br/>I'm beyond astounded at the number of award nominations that this film received. I am appalled and nauseated that it actually won AFI film of the year. I suppose it's possible that the second half of the film evolved into the worthwhile entity that some reviews say it is, but I think it's the worst piece of crap I've endured since Doctor T and the Women. <br/><br/>Stay away.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","7","22 October 2011"," I Must Have Missed Something
","Bridesmaids (2011) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Annie (Fristen Wiig) finds her life falling apart all around her once her business goes down the drain. Not only that but she's stuck with two horrible roommates, has no money, a crummy job and is in a relationship with a guy who wants one thing only. Annie thinks everything is about to change when her lifelong friend announces she's getting married and wants her to be the maid of honor but soon Annie finds herself battling with one of the bridesmaids. I'll have to admit right now that I'm really not sure what all the hype was about. I'm sure some might say that the humor just escaped me because I'm a male but I think that would be tad bit unfair. I mean, I'm sure plenty of women enjoy male-buddy movies so I really don't think ones sex should matter. I had really high hopes for this comedy but throughout the movie it just seemed like I kept waiting for something funny to happen. There were a few scenes that had a smile on my face but there wasn't a single time where I really laughed out loud. I think the biggest problem I had with the comedy was that it was just so forced and so fake that not for a second could I find it funny. Just take a look at a sequence where the women are shopping for dresses after eating at a restaurant. They end up getting food poisoning and need to rush the bathroom but there's only one toilet with three women fighting over it. This is the gross-out scene that all R-rated comedies must have these days but it doesn't work. Also, there's a scene later in the movie where the group is on a plane and Annie, the only one stuck in coach, ends up getting the plane landed because of her actions. I won't spoil what she does exactly but once again it's just so over-the-top that you can't take it serious or laugh at it. I found the entire story to have wannabe touching scenes but none of them worked because they were just so corny and by the numbers. I mean, is there anyone alive whose not going to see the ending coming? The one spark in the film came from Chris O'Dowd who plays an officer who starts a relationship with Annie. I thought the quieter moments between the two were the best parts of the film and it's a shame they didn't have more of it. With all of that said, BRIDESMAIDS is still an easy film to sit back and watch. It's certainly not horrible but I just think it should have been better. Considering it was a huge hit obviously many people loved it but I'm just not one of them."

","This movie is long, far far too long. Every 20mins or so there is some problem that the main character faces which you know will take at least another 20mins for her to overcome. This happens roughly 6 times, which makes the film the wrong side of two hours long.<br/><br/>I found myself truly engrossed in the main characters happiness, hoping beyond hope that she makes something of her life and finds the guy of her dreams. This was mainly because it would mean the film could be over.<br/><br/>If you're looking to go somewhere dark for a couple of hours to get some sleep I suggest going to see this film as nobody is likely to be laughing so it will be very quiet, and there will be plenty of room to stretch out too as many people will have left in the first 10-15mins."

","I'm so, so disappointed. I wasn't that fussed about watching this but all my friends said it was hilarious, so many great reviews etc that in the end I couldn't wait to see it and was really looking forward to it. After renting it on iTunes at the bargain price of £3.49(!), I settled down expecting to enjoy a humorous couple of hours. This didn't happen and I feel cheated. <br/><br/>I've given the film 4/10, three of these points are for Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan and provides all of the decent comedy moments and is possibly the only likable character in the entire film. <br/><br/>The thing with films like this is that you need to like the characters, you need to want to see the downtrodden, unlucky in life and love underdog get their day in the sun and the happy ending. Unfortunately, Annie (Kristen Wiig) was such a bitter, twisted, jealous, vindictive cow that I was hoping more that she'd get hit by a truck. I didn't want to see her get a happy ending, she didn't deserve one. She was vile. I'd usually be laughing my head off in a scene like the one at the bridal shower but because the tone of the film is so nasty (struggling to find a better word but that's just what it is) I was completely stone faced. <br/><br/>I didn't find the bathroom scenes offensive but I don't think they worked well at all and again, failed to make me laugh - I think it was a poor attempt to get a giggle and, again, where I'd be laughing in another film, this just didn't work. <br/><br/>The writing is pretty bad, the dialogue is rubbish. Looks like a lot is improvised which can be brilliant with some actors, not with these. It just drew out an already boring scene and made me realise how damn irritating Kristen Wiig is.<br/><br/>Just a shoddy, hackneyed, poor film. Don't believe the hype!"

The only bright spots that Annie had going for her was looking good in her sexy colored bras(I love the scenes of Kristen in the light blue bra and the pink bra scene rocks!)and having no stings attached sex with any guy! Still all may not be lost she has the chance to be maid of honor at her best friend Lillian's(Maya Rudolph) wedding. Along the way getting to the big day is an emotional and funny ride for Annie and the ladies. A different and unique performance that is eye catching is Melissa McCarthy's turn as a tough and gritty outspoken gal who's just a big lovable squeeze of a bridesmaid.<br/><br/>Overall pretty good film to watch plenty of laughs and sex appeal the film is outspoken and emotional with real life drama type of situations and it proves be happy with who you are as in the end you will reach your journey even if it is somewhat of a struggle."

","It is astonishing to think that this piece of shallow silliness got two Oscar nominations. However, it works very well as an indicator of the sorry state of contemporary society. The story revolves around Annie Walker, a most annoying woman who would be a perfect character for a cheap sitcom.<br/><br/>Annie alleged best friend Lillian is getting married and that horrendously stressing event that is an American wedding must be organized. Countless chick flicks have been there, only to underline how the true meaning of getting married and any shred of happiness are lost in the process of having so much ""organized"" fun.<br/><br/>In this case, wedding planning is complicated by the presence of new BFF Helen, a rich, good looking woman who is stealing Annie's thunder. Not that Annie has much thunder. She works as a shop assistant, lives with a grotesque couple (in the movie for no reason whatsoever) and is sabotaging her relationships. Despite all this, some sort of happy ending is on sight.<br/><br/>The whole movie is peppered with overlong scenes (Annie on the plane, Annie with flatmates...) scatological language, poop, vomit and vulgarity. Even the late Jill Clayburgh, actress of a certain class, is not spared.<br/><br/>This cringe-worthy movie was produced by Apatow and co-written by Kristen Wiig, who is also starring – and appearing in every scene - as main character Annie Walker.<br/><br/>If you know a bit about movies, this can explain why it is so bad. Apatow is the king of crass, vulgar, unfunny comedies. Wiig wanted to make clear she is the star. Unfortunately, like most female comedians, she seems to think that the only way to make women ""funny"" is to degrade them. Surely they get plenty of humiliations in this movie, but this does not make the movie funny in any way."
"bowmanblue","7","3","5","15 July 2014"," Funny enough for a GUY to enjoy!
","It's amazing that no one has thought of this before. After countless years of watching groups of men behaving like idiots on the big screen, we finally meet a gaggle of women who will put any stag party to shame. A lot of people have called 'Bridesmaids' the 'female version of The Hangover' and there certainly are similarities in the set-up, but they're both different enough to be enjoyed separately without too much comparison.<br/><br/>There's a preconception (possibly among men!) that 'women aren't funny,' or at least women aren't AS funny as men. I won't attempt to guess at either of those statements' validity, but I will say that 'Bridesmaids' goes some way to prove that women can be pretty amusing when the setting is right.<br/><br/>The 'plot' is pretty simple: a woman is getting married and invites her various friends to the various pre-wedding preparations. Mayhem follows.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a strong element of 'rom-com' in there, but it never overshadows the general humour. There are six central (female) characters and not all are as 'fleshed-out' character-wise as they possibly could be. However, the film plays to its strengths and gives more screen time to the funnier of those among them.<br/><br/>Basically, you have a light-hearted comedy/romance that should appeal to men and women. I should point out that the humour is pretty 'adult' in nature and anyone easily offended by bad language may be in need of earplugs (and that's just from the women!).<br/><br/>Of course it's not for everyone. I'm guessing its primary audience will be women. My (male) friend warned me from ever watching this film, telling me how awful it was (I haven't admitted I've seen – and enjoyed – it to him yet).<br/><br/>Special mention to Melissa McCarthy, who steals every scene (and every puppy).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

They didn't win the awards but I'm wondering how this film got nominations in the first place. Wiig wrote and played the main role of Annie, a failed baker, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her best friend played by Maya Rudolph is getting married and she's maid of honor too. The previews made the film look funny but it is actually sad and awkward at times. Annie feels and acts like a failure because she had low self esteem. McCarthy is always a hoot but I didn't understand her character as the groom's sister. Wiig is talented in her character's self- deprecating sense of humor. I just wished the film had more funny moments. This is first rate cast including the late great actress Jill Clayburgh as Annie's mother in probably one of her last film performances. The trip to Las Vegas was a total waste in actuality."
"tieman64","Null","3","5","23 June 2012"," Gals poop in sinks, feminists applaud
","""They're closing up girl land, some say its a shame. It used to be busy, then nobody came."" - Shirley Jones <br/><br/>Written by and starring Kristen Wiig, ""Bridesmaids"" is a supposedly ""ground-breaking"" and ""revolutionary"" comedy which ""charts new territory"" by being simultaneously ""feminist"", ""funny"" and ""raunchy"". The film was produced by Judd Apatow, who specialises in R-rated, sex-obsessed ""bromance"" movies.<br/><br/>The film is mostly generic. Wiig plays Lillian, a woman stuck in a formulaic plot in which she is desperate to ""find mister right"", ""get married"" and be her best friend's best bridesmaid. The film also sports a weird sub-plot about ""baking""; Lilian's cake store falls apart and goes bust when her partner leaves her, but things go well for her again when she meets a new man who likes her cakes and likes her baking. It's a new type of feminism, see. Being a woman sucks, unless your in the kitchen and cooking for your man.<br/><br/>The film's characters are mostly stock, either bickering women, jewellers, cooks, butch chicks, frigid ladies, workaholic moms or sex obsessed gals who are desperate to get married to rich men and live happy lives. Penises and nuptial hyper-consumption are the epitome of fulfilment.<br/><br/>The film is praised for ""being about women just hanging out"", but that is itself the point of the whole romantic comedy, chick-flick genre (the plot here is your typical Kate Hudson, Jennifer Aniston, Sandra Bullock ""girl meets boy"", ""girl loses boy"", ""girl reclaims boy"" formula). The late 1970s and 80s were themselves dedicated to the ""woman's picture"", most of the best ones of which raised the flag for ovaries and sisterhood without seeming idiotic. Nevermind the screen sirens of the 1940s and 50s (Hepburn, Stanwyck, Bacall et all), trail blazing rock-chicks and comediennes of decades past, or current work by Almodovar, Holofcener, Champion and Claire Dennis, just four contemporary filmmakers who deal well with women.<br/><br/>So why exactly is ""Bridesmaids"" ground-breaking? Perhaps because the film – like ""Sex and the City"", the previous highest grossing R rated ""female comedy"", and ""Bad Teacher"", a total flop - makes it okay for women and girls of all ages to act like foul-mouthed jocks at a frat party, which is ironic, because your typical bromance buddy movies makes it okay for rowdy guys to act like sensitive women. That, supposedly, is progress: everyone can be anything any time. Total equality. Gals can be both raunchy poop-joke making princesses, and guys can be macho beer chugging momma's boys. This is a very postmodern take on gender; if all gender is performance, if all gender is programmed by externals, then there is nothing intrinsically ""feminine"" and ""female"". It is all an act, gender endlessly mutable and malleable.<br/><br/>This kind of thinking goes back, at least in the mainstream, to Judith Butler's ""Gender Trouble"", an influential book. For Butler, the mistake of feminism was in asserting that ""women"" were a solid group with fixed, common characterises and interests. This notion, she said, ""performed an unwitting regulation and reification of gender relations"" which ""reinforced a binary view of gender relations in which humans are divided into two clear cut groups"". Feminism therefore closed options down. Feminists rejected the idea that biology is destiny (""women are not intrinsically inferior to men""), but then developed an account of patriarchy which conveyed, either consciously or unconsciously, that masculine and feminine genders were either biologically coded or that masculine and feminine genders would inevitably be built by culture upon ""male"" and ""female"" bodies. Butler opposed this. For her, gender isn't a fixed attribute, but should be seen as a fluid variable which shifts and changes in different contexts and at different times. As she famously said, ""gender is a performance, it's what you do at particular times, rather than a universal who you are."" From here on, gender began to be thought of as a kind of reiterated acting, one that simulates the effect of a static or ""normal"" gender while obscuring the contradiction and instability of any single person's gender ""act"". This effect produces what we can consider to be ""true gender"". ""True gender"" is thus a ""fake"" narrative that is sustained by the implied, collective agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar genders. Today this ""social agreement"" simply offers more leeway such that everyone's essentially ""pansexual"", gals just one of the guys and vice versa.<br/><br/>This kind of stance, according to biological essentialists, is total crap. One just has to look at transsexuals and homosexuals – for whom sexual preference (but not necessarily gender behaviour) is not a choice, for whom Butler's stance is an insult – to see that gender (not sex) has biological foundations. Whatever the truth (gender identity is most-likely somewhere between the hard-lined stance of essentialists and the nuances of Butler, though leaning heavier in Butler's direction) both stances are pessimistic. In both cases identity is built on the invasion of the ""self"" by the gestures of others, who, by referring to other others, are already social beings. The individual's will, and the individual performance, is always subject to the dominant discourse of an Other(s). Meanwhile, it is precisely because men and women think of ""themselves"" as independent, fully autonomous, individual subjects, that the Other is created and therefor conflict arises. ""Bridesmaids"" is feminist insofar as it rejects a certain type of essentialism, but hardly liberative insofar as it ignores larger forces working on bodies.<br/><br/>Beyond this the film sports funny and touching performances by Melissa McCarthy and Chris O'Dowd, and works whenever they're on screen. Everything else is handled ineptly by director Paul Feig. For all its raunchiness, what the film conveys to modern women regarding expectations toward friendship, courtship and marriage is mostly conservative and depressing.<br/><br/>5/10 – Worth one viewing. See ""2 Days in Paris"", the romances of Linklater and Holofcener, ""In Search of a Midnight Kiss"" and Antonioni's ""Beyond the Clouds""."

The setups are actually good, and almost every scene ends up being funny. I have to mention that this isn't a romantic comedy though there is some romance on the side. Apart from the bridesmaids I thought that the characters weren't well developed. The film is often raunchy but it has a sense of realism that's believable. Bridesmaids is similar to The Hangover (2009) and other films that followed. The difference is that this film stays true to life with scenes conveying different emotions that are very believable. In this sense the characterization is some of the best that I've seen in comedies. The film mirrors modern society very well, and it doesn't hide from weird and harsh realities. Kristen Wiig is fantastic in the lead role. Like I mentioned before, however, the supporting characters aren't the film's strength and scenes between Wiig and Chris O'Dowd were not something that I enjoyed. The scenes with the bridesmaids on the other hand were very enjoyable. To sum up Bridesmaids is an original, touching and enjoyable film. I definitely recommend seeing it."

","Some people claim that this film is the ""female version of 'The Hangover.'"" Well as far as I'm concerned it has never been farther off. The movie itself was severely lacking. Prepare yourself to basically witness a back-and-forth between two women who don't know each other, an un-needed storyline, and dreadful comedy. The movie is supposed to be about the Bridesmaids...why do we need to know about this love interest on the side with one of the main characters? Why does it matter that she used to have her own bakery that tanked? It doesn't. All the funny parts you saw in the trailer, were the only funny parts in the movie. The rest was slow-paced and just tried to get a few cheap laughs. Take out the sex scene in the beginning...and you got yourself a ""PG Rated flick that seems to have been made over a drunken weekend by a bunch of women who thought they were funny."""

","I love Kristen Wiig. She's one of my favorite performers on SNL and has been very funny in previous movies. Therefore, I was very excited to see this movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I literally hated this movie. Not only was it not funny, but the scenes were uncomfortably awkward and hard to watch. I've never left the theater in the middle of a movie, but this was the closest I came. I only stayed because the movie had such great reviews, and that made me think it was going to get better. Instead, it got worse as it went along, and the ending was terrible. The movie did make me chuckle a couple of times, but the awkward and boring parts far outweighed any laughter or enjoyment. I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie."
"iReviewFilms","7","5","11","2 July 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Bridesmaids
","Many people have been describing this as the female version of The Hangover. Those people however forgot to do one tiny thing- watch both films! Yes both films revolve around the preparation for a wedding and contain their fair share of low brow comedy but that is where the similarities end.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids follows Annie (Kristen Wiig), the maid of honour for her best friend Lillian's (Maya Rudolph) wedding. While she is preparing for the big day though, the rest of her life is falling apart around her. Her love life is in tatters and she is struggling to keep on top of the bills. All the while she has to set up the wedding, organise the bride and compete with the other eccentric bridesmaids to keep things on track.<br/><br/>The main thorn in her side comes from Helen (Rose Byrne), one of Lillian's new friends and bridesmaids who Annie feels is taking her friend away from her just when she needs her the most. Add to that the other colourful Bridesmaids of Megan (Melissa McCarthy), Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey) and Becca (Ellie Kemper) with the continual flow of jokes and situations and you get one decent comedy.<br/><br/>What I liked about Bridesmaids was the fact that it did not shy away from all the gruesome details just because the characters were female. Usually women in films are depicted more prim and proper so it was refreshing to have this change. Some might consider some of the scenes to go a little too far or continue for just a bit too long (one scene in particular did start to drag for me) but I felt overall it just about hit the nail on the head.<br/><br/>Wiig, along with her co-stars, impresses throughout the film showing us that she has a place as a comic actress and the addition of Chris O'Dowd as the love interest worked well.<br/><br/>If I were to pick fault with the movie then I would have to say that some of the characters didn't make me want to care that much about what happened to them (but then again this is primarily a comedy not a drama) especially the bride who I never felt had that was enjoying her wedding at any point. Also there were probably a few too many sub-plots and side stories that could have been shaved of to drag the time under 2 hours. Apart from that, I was pretty impressed.<br/><br/>This may be one set out for the females in the audience but it is very much a guys film as well. There is a bit of a romcom element but it takes a backseat to the main female character driven comedy. Some will find the jokes distasteful and not rate the movie because of this but I was chuckling away on more than one occasion. Guys, if your going to be dragged along to one 'chick flick' this year then make sure it's this one.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

","Saw this movie with a cinema full of females due to a Chick Flick night at the local movie theatre. This movie was hilariously funny. It made me (and the rest of the theatre) laugh, cry and ""awww"". There were no parts where you wanted to skip forward a chapter (like in some books)to get to see what happened. There was no waiting for the next interesting bit to start! Just continuous laughter throughout the theatre. Best movie I've seen in... as long as I can remember! The SNL girls were all amazing. Full of a cast that I hardly knew (besides Rose Byrne), I was extremely impressed with the turnout! The shorts for the film definitely don't do the movie justice!

","OK, I gotta admit that when I saw a preview for this movie I thought it looked lame. However after hearing many good reviews about it, I decided to give it a go. Hooray - this movie is actually funny! Matter of fact, I look forward to seeing it again and might even buy it when it comes out on DVD. Kristen Wiig is hilarious. This was the first time that I've actually watched her act, never really saw any of her stuff before this movie. <br/><br/>Also, I consider myself pretty picky when it comes to movies. It takes a lot to make me actually laugh out loud and I was doing a lot of that in this movie. I think that any female could relate to Kristen's character and some of her experiences. She doesn't quite feel up to par with where she's at in her life but fortunately there is a lot of humor that comes from this. I'm sure even some guys would enjoy this movie. <br/><br/>Overall - Enjoyable, cute and hilarious!"
"eric262003","8","2","3","24 June 2019"," Fun Film Even When Some Scenes Don't Work
","Through most of their life, Annie (Kristen Wiig) and Lillian (Maya Rudolph) have been the best of friends almost closer than sisters from another mother. So when Lillian ties the knot, it's only naturally that she asks Annie to be her Maid of Honour. Things start to get a bit steamy when the insecure Annie starts to feel some tensions when Lillian's posh new friend Helen (Rose Bryne) starts to steal her thunder. Annie's life is really falling apart at the seams right now. Her boyfriend Ted (Jon Hamm) is being a jerk, her roommates are giving her grief and a kindly Officer Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) is getting rejected by his passion for her because she's not sure about him, even though he let her go without a ticket in spite of her car having a broken tail-light. Will Annie rectify herself from her problems and will she and Lillian reunite their friendship?<br/><br/>It's a tale about true friendship, resentment, romance, humour, and everything from fashionable trendiness to toilet jokes. For the most part it's mostly played for satire largely in part due to Wiig's sharp comic timing and and the brilliant script she co-wrote wrote with Amy Mumolo. Like her alum from ""Saturday Night Live"" Tina Fey, Wiig succeeds in staying oblivious in situations she shouldn't and gets kudos for remaining that way throughout.<br/><br/>Like any good comedy, ""Bridesmaids"" has serious undertones where stakes are at the most quite surmountable. The quirks of the film further explore the angst and the insecurities these women face and the girl-talk is not complete overkill.<br/><br/>The opening scenes has Annie and Ted having intercourse and looks like they're having fun, until we realize it's anything but as Ted reveals to the viewers he's no charmer ans kicks her out of his place. Then we see Annie friend Lillian showing off a beautiful diamond ring, Annie was happy for Lillian, that is until her fiance's boss' wife Helen enters the fray (Byrne was perfect here) and then things start to get quite heated. This makes Annie worried that her best friend isn't all that best as she thought. A funny scene where they engage in musical speeches where one tries to usurp one another and they end up singing That's What Friends Are For.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes where the jokes did not work like for instance the scene where the bridesmaids were invited to a Brazilian steak restaurant before entering the boutique bridal shop under Helen's financial advantage and every one of them ends up getting food poisoning. There is a totally grossed out scene where they used a washbasin as a toilet. The mastermind behind this evil scheme is the groom's rotund sister Megan (played with some scene-stealing perfection by Melissa McCarthy). Another scene has Megan literally grinding her teeth into Annie to unravel some home truths while the ladies were on route to Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Although there are men in this movie as well, they are pretty much in the background, though we are welcomed to by the warmly character of Officer Rhodes who has a thing for cupcakes while she eats carrots on the sunrise of his car bonnet. And the funniest scene where purposely commits mischief just to get his attention like speeding, drinking and texting and so on. What makes this script work is that the scenes just flow organically. It never feels staged or just branched out skits from ""Saturday Night Live"".<br/><br/>We like to participate on the madcap misadventures that Annie takes pursuit in as her life has hit rockier times and it takes this journey ahead to get herself back together again. And granted there are scenes that work most of the time, there are some that don't and just tend to drag, but that few and far between. ""Bridesmaids"" has high energy and shows that even women can also engage in physical comedy just as effectively as the men, but the journey ahead keeps us invested into the world of friendship and marriage and regaining the will to live."

"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","3","27 February 2018"," Bridesmaids is the pinnacle of modern comedy.
","Comedy not being my genre (at all!) I always go into one with extremely low expectations. I remember watching this for the first time and was blown away at how much it entertained me. I may have only laughed once or twice, which in itself is an achievement for a cold soulless individual like myself, alas I couldn't help but smile throughout its runtime. Now approximately on my tenth viewing, I still can't wipe that grin off my face. The story is pretty formulaic, a group of bridesmaids trying to outdo each other in order to be the greatest friend to the bride. What sets this apart is the smart writing. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo outdid themselves. The dialogue is on point. Not once, not twice, all the time. There isn't a single line here that made me think ""ohhh actually that didn't work"". Sure the narrative is filled with scenarios that's just asking for slapstick comedy, but that's a given in any film of the genre. Whether it be the airplane fiasco, driving recklessly to get the attention of a police officer or the food poisoning bridesmaids outfit fitting scene (which, can I just say, is one the funniest moments ever). It all works! The genius writing makes for some memorable characters. Each bridesmaid has a different personality and are able to bounce off each other beautifully in order to create the laughs. All of the actresses were perfect, like honestly the best casting choices available. Kristen Wiig was painfully good. Rose Byrne is always a favourite of mine. Maya Rudolph was surprisingly funny. Even our very own Chris O'Dowd was spot on! Melissa McCarthy obviously was the standout. Director Paul Feig owns modern comedy, and Bridesmaids proves this. Some of the scenarios are stretched out for slightly too long in an attempt to force some more laughs. And apart from the formulaic plot, I defy anyone to say they didn't enjoy this...even on the smallest of scales! It's just fun to watch and has reinvigorated comedy. Perfect if you're feeling down or want a good laugh with friends."

I watched with some friends and we all had high hopes for a gross out humor movie like ""Bad Santa"" or ""Bad Teacher"" which both featured crude, yet likeable characters. Nothing was funny about this. Nothing at all. No one was laughing. The scenes that were suppose to be funny were so gross and predictable it ranks up with the reprehensible ""Freddy Got Fingered."" Avoid this movie. It is a 5 minute unfunny SNL skit stretched out to two embarrassing and unbearable hours."
"michaelberanek275","10","2","3","12 July 2017"," Sweetest confection, a comedy binge
","Wow, I'm left having to seriously question my gender after I so much enjoyed watching this comedic tour de force. On a second viewing too I was again crying tears of joy and empathy for the company of girls who pull this off so well. The writing is perfect, and the gross-out slapstick and wisecracks traditionally given to a bunch of dudes are doubly enhanced delivered by this feminine ensemble. Men are very peripheral here - the only more fully-drawn featured fella has to mostly remain on the stage margins. However Chris O'Dowd is perfect as the chatty, selfless but not creepy match for poor Annie. They have such a lovely no frills off-beat romance. This contrasts with the elaborate wedding the movie might appear to be about but of course is not. One cant but wonder if Annie has learned never even to entertain the idea of wedding in the future i.e. on the day she she bags her knight in shining armor. Is this movie devaluing weddings? A bit. Pehaps it's just life events challenge us all and we find ourselves viewing the wedding from Annie's perspective: essentially a loss of a friend with one's youthful hopes & dreams given away to a bland indefinite future. The downward spiraling situation of Annie's played by the waifish Kirsten Wiig serves as the central comedy fulcrum. Her friends are unable to pull her out as she stumbles around and observes so recklessly various absurd truths. She fights a lonely battle trying to stop her friend's wedding becoming a charade masterminded by loathsome Helen Harris the Third. But there's a naive lack of cynicism and mutual high regard in the air so that by the end, miraculously the value of the titular wedding has not been completely undermined, just a little though, quietly upstaged by Annie's unconventional romance. There's numerous mad and funny characters throughout like weird lodger Brynn played by Rebel Wilson. Ultimately it's the cogent story that has the touch of Jane Austin about it, the great bits of dialogue and the star-quality acting that distinguishes this film as top class."

But they were needed.<br/><br/>Positives<br/><br/>First of all Melissa McCarthy is great, her best performance, obviously. She deserved the Oscar nomination and maybe deserved to win. Wiig is good, her best performance. Her writing in this movie is also Oscar-worthy. The rest of the cast is phenomenal with Rose Byrne, Maya Rudolph, Ellie Kemper, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Rebel Wilson who steals every scene she is in. <br/><br/>Just look at all the great scenes; Engagement party, dress scene, airplane scene, car scene and my favorite the giant cookie scene.

During the whole movie I had a feeling of running away. In few occasions where a joke was presented, it was of such bad taste that makes you cringe. Horror: Sharknado is much better that this. Imagine ""The Hangover"" with ""The Inbetweeners"" characters transformed into female characters and bitching right left and centre, having rows with each other. There is not a single line, scene or emotion you could extract from this movie. I am always appalled by what goes in the producers minds when they decide to spend millions of dollar in such rubbish! Couldn't they see that it is a bunch of garbage with some not so bad looking actresses and scenery! Runaway! I mean, The runaway bride is much better (even though I'd score it 6)."
"freemantle_uk","5","2","3","18 October 2015"," Very underwhelming
","Back in 2011 Bridesmaids was hailed as the comedy of the year, a raunchy R-rated female affair that earned Academy Awards nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Melissa McCarthy, turning her into a huge comedy star. But despite this Bridesmaids is really a mediocre comedy which is not as funny or heartfelt as it thinks it is.<br/><br/>Annie (Kristen Wiig) is a singleton in Milwaukee and a failed business owner. Her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) gets engaged and asks Annie to be her maid-of-honour; but Annie has to deal with her limited budget when the rest of the bridal party wanting something more extravaganza and Annie developing a rivalry with the yuppyish Helen (Rose Byrne).<br/><br/>Bridesmaids does have some funny moments and set-pieces, such as a violent tennis match, the visit to the bridal shop and some of Annie's dodgy motoring skills. They do raise a laugh and McCarthy and Irish comedian Chris O'Dowd were the best members of cast, McCarthy for her vulgarity and O'Dowd just having a sweet quality to him. For fans of The IT Crowd it is great to see he is getting Hollywood. The rest of the cast are fine, Wiig getting some laughs and Byrne always being strong, but Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper do not get much in the way character development. McLendon-Covey does have a few fun lines due the stresses of being a mum to three boys.<br/><br/>Despite the few moments of humour Bridesmaids is very lacking throughout its run time. The famous bridal shop scene is a gross out scene which could have been in a film like American Pie, just aiming to show that women are also capable of gross out jokes, even thought gross out is very puerile. The inclusion of Matt Lucas and Rebel Wilson as a weird British brother and sister were painfully unfunny and there were many moments based just on Annie's humiliation which is more sad to watch then funny. Hell Annie could solution could have been to say I love to be your maid of honour but I haven't got much money at the moment and I'm sure people would have helped her.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is meant to be a film set in the real world due to its setting and scenario. You would expect some comic exaggeration which is part of the course, but that gets thrown with gag that at the bridal shower people are given puppies as a gift: it is too stupid and over the top. There needed to be some internal logic.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids was produced by Judd Apatow, a filmmaker who has praised for his work on films like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. But Apatow is an overrated writer and director and his comedies are neither as groundbreaking or funny that they are made out to be and Bridesmaids follows some of his worst aspects. The film ran at over two hours which is long for a comedy, like other Apatow film and Bridesmaids does nothing dramatically or comedically to justify itself. Also like Apatow films, Bridesmaids takes itself too seriously and tries to show Annie's lonely lifestyle and seeing her life full apart, but it is just too depressing.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids does have some funny moments, its lacks any consistent in jokes or drama. There are too few jokes and its dramatic parts are too low. The IMDb score of 6.8 is much more reflective of the films quality then its 90% Rotten Tomatoes rating."

"Buddy-51","8","2","3","3 December 2012"," Less than groundbreaking but fun overall
","Given the reviews and the comments by many of those who'd already seen the movie, I was expecting ""Bridesmaids"" to be a bit more of a raucous affair than it ultimately turned out to be. Yet, while it isn't exactly the ""groundbreaking"" film so many people had described it as being, there's enough you-go-girl sassiness and charm to make it a pleasant enough comedic experience.<br/><br/>SNL alums, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig (who co-wrote the screenplay with Annie Mumolo), play best friends from childhood, Lillian and Annie, the former a career-woman who's getting ready to tie the knot with a wealthy banker, and the latter, an insecure bundle of neuroses with commitment issues whom Lillian has asked to be her bridesmaid. Into the breach steps Rose Byrne (Glenn Close's bete noire from TV's ""Damages""), as Lillian's snooty new friend whom Annie sees as a rival for Lillian's affections. The focus of the screenplay is mainly on Annie, as she goes about subconsciously sabotaging many of the traditional pre-wedding festivities, as well as her own chances at happiness.<br/><br/>Though the women here are occasionally foul-mouthed and uninhibited in their behavior and topics of conversation, they really aren't as crude and vulgar as the media - looking for a look-even-women-can-be-as-bad as-men storyline - has made them out to be. In fact, the tone of much of the movie is sweet and thoughtful, as Annie copes with her very recognizably human feelings of inferiority and jealousy.<br/><br/>Directed by Paul Feig, the movie alternates between broad slapstick and sophisticated satire without skipping a beat, though there is the occasional dry-spot to slow down the proceedings. And Melissa McCarthy (""Mike and Molly"") steals every scene she's in as a straight-talking tomboy who obviously flunked out of the Miss Manners School of Social Etiquette.<br/><br/>It's not a great comedy by any stretch, but it's hard not to be won over by it in the end."

","I can hardly find something interesting in one of the few movie I stopped watching after some 80 minutes. Good comedies know that you can't have the right rhythm with a total length far beyond the 90-minute mark. OK I knew it was a bad idea to get the 'Unrated version', i.e. some marketing ploy to make you feel you'll get an exclusive product when buying the DVD while it's only the original professional cut inflated by dozens of minutes that were originally thought useless (and most probably counter-productive).<br/><br/>Still, at over 2 hours Bridesmaids is clearly overlong and you can tell it from the very start. Scenes lead to other scenes without the rhythm ever picking up. The lead is mostly pathetic, and it's rarely pathetic-funny, and even then the hurtfully pathetic annihilates the good jokes. With such a slow rhythm you also have plenty of time to see the ensemble cast is only made of one-dimensional characters."

"aidanratesmovies","7","1","1","5 April 2020"," A Mixed Bag, but More Good than Not
","At times ridiculously funny, but other times severally frustrating, Bridesmaids suffers most from trying to do to many things at once. In my experience watching this film, I had truly never seen a comedy that confused my emotions so much like this one. It's as if 2 people took turns writing every other scene and put it all together into one mesh of a film. At times, Bridesmaids can be a brilliant dramedy, providing some very sweet and touching moments, and some truly outrageously funny gags. At other times, the film can be extremely painful to watch, whether it's from the awkward funny gags, cliched writing, or it trying to force it all at once, the film can't ever seem to truly find its footing. However, in the grand scheme of things, I would say there is more positive than negative in the film, and though there was certainly many steps in making it, Bridesmaids at times can be a pretty good film. As for the acting, Melissa McCarthy steals the show in every scene she takes a part of, truly deserving the best supporting actress nomination at the actors, and showing how to write a character as eccentric as herself. Other good performances include Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd, and at times Kristen Wiig. In the end, Bridesmaids is a bit of a mixed bag. Its tonal shifts are unappreciated, and its humor, when it isn't trying too hard, can be brilliant. It may be confusing to the senses to sit all the way through, but there are plenty of good gags to bring you to the end of the film, even if the journey makes you frustrated as Wiig's character throughout.
My Rating: 6.5/10"
"allbyaccident","10","1","1","15 February 2020"," Funniest film you'll probably ever watch
","This is such a well-writen comedy and I do not have words enough to describe how clever and funny the scenes and the lines are. How do you even come up with some of the stuff? I have seen this movie at least 5-7 times over the years and it still never gets old. To me, it's one of the best, if not THE best, comedy films of all time. Watch it - you won't regret it."
"jeffbabies","10","1","1","19 January 2020"," The award nominations speak for themselves
","Contrary to all the negative flack that this movie received on this site, it garnered quite a following a quite a number of award nominations, Oscars and Golden Globes included. The bad reviews use words like ""class"" - and overly uptight terms like ""bathroom scenes"" or ""pooh scenes"" which caused audience members to ""cover their eyes"". This leads me to the natural conclusion that those who disliked the movie are somewhat of a conservative crowd who want women to behave a certain way and dislike ballsy humor. Perhaps they expected something fluffier because it starred women in pink dresses. Perhaps they feel that women shouldn't be this crass or sarcastic; that only men should be allowed to behave this way. Well, for once, women in film stopped acting like Hollywood caricatures and started acting like real women who I know and love. THAT'S why people react so favorably and appreciate this movie. For once, men weren't the raucous, offensive ones in the spotlight while women were relegated to being clumsy or having their skirts blown up. Aren't you tired of female comedies in which the lead protagonist is funny because she falls? I am. I stopped counting the number of trailers that feature women falling for laughs, while men get to be real and raw. Now, look, everyone appreciates a different kind of humor. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I tend to appreciate more sarcastic and often offensive material that challenges the norm. For that reason, this movie is right up my alley. If you want a feel-good tampon commercial, this isn't it. This movie is for people who are tired of seeing women act prim and proper. It's for people who know that real women can be proper if they choose, but some are also just like this and they're finally being depicted in the movies. If men made this movie, we wouldn't be having a debate about it. Their behavior would be totally acceptable. I knew what to expect from this movie and I got it - and then some. They went above and beyond my expectation. If you didn't realize that a comedy starring this particular cast would be offensive, then you've been living under a rock. That's like going to see Kathy Griffin or Margaret Cho and expecting a church sermon. That's YOUR bad. And to the person who thought it was unrealistically annoying that someone would lose control of the decision-making for their own wedding... have you ever actually been involved in a wedding? I have. Many of them. And that really does happen. Stress, pressure from family, it gets away from you faster than you know and takes on a life of its own."

"maxastree","8","1","1","23 July 2016"," Effortlessly hilarious, great characterization
","Bridesmaids is a hilarious piece of social realist comedy; behind the dull patina of day-to-day suburban life for a group of Midwestern women is a constant stream of fearless, hilarious one liners. Mainstream critics largely applauded the film also, for building up it's sense of character arc and having a bit of comedic depth, the film celebrates the diverse identities of modern American women, and the casting is excellent.<br/><br/>As with most funny comedies, Bridesmaids riffs on a relatable theme. Central character Annie Walker is in her late thirties, driving a bombed-out second hand car, depressed, incapable of finding a decent relationship, and already has a few age wrinkles. Her lifelong friend is getting married and Annie's stricken with jealousy because her lifelong (read: former high- school) friend is basically being stolen by an American socialite trophy wife; a young, attractive second partner to an anonymous businessman who's away from home most of the time.<br/><br/>BE AWARE: virtually ALL Hollywood films feature a male protagonist, with female cast members appearing only to react to or enable a plot point in relation to the central male ego that the narrative serves. In Bridesmaids, the leads are all female, and the male characters mostly exist unseen or somewhere else in the story. <br/><br/>The film goes a tad sentimental in the closing scenes, ending as all such films do, with a romantic conclusion - Bridesmaids isn't really about romance though, more the idea of life's failures and a type of crass, caustic humor that's very funny because of it's disarming honesty."
"ginocox-206-336968","4","1","1","6 April 2016"," Not enough truth and pain to be consistently funny
","I feel I should hate ""Bridesmaids"" much more than I do. It has a few good laughs, so I am prepared to forgive a lot of faults. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with caricatures, rather than characters, and they epitomize the worst stereotypes of women. They are obsessively insipid, banal and superficial. They talk trashy, but one manages to maintain her modesty through several sex scenes, then flashes another character with her hands covering her breasts. This makes sense for an actress who does a lot of work on television and in children's cartoons, but seems so awkward, contrived and unrealistic for the character as to shatter the audience's willful suspension of disbelief. Melissa McCarthy, who is probably my least favorite comic of all time, presents her usual mishmash of wildly inappropriate, brash and uncouth behavior which quickly degenerates from shocking to mildly amusing to tedious. The dialogue is saturated with exposition. The plot is contrived. One character who claims to have no female friends is nevertheless able to obtain preferential treatment through her close relationships. The actions and reactions of the characters might make sense in a cartoon, but seem exaggerated in live action. Much of the plot involves relying upon conspicuous consumption to alleviate feelings of insecurity. The expenditures seem so grotesquely unrealistic that one character even stands in a crowded room and asks the other characters if any of it makes sense. Some of the gags seemed unfinished. There needed to be more resolution and consequences to two trips, one out-of-state and the other out-of-country. <br/><br/>John Vorhaus defines comedy as truth and pain. Much of the humor fell flat because the characters and situations seem too exaggerated and forced to be real. But there were enough attempts at humor that other jokes and gags made me laugh. <br/><br/>Many of the supporting cast provided strong performances, particularly Chris O'Dowd and Jill Clayburgh, including some in very small roles, such as Franklyn Ajaye, Terry Crews and Tom Yi. The main characters generally delivered their lines well, but were weaker with physical comedy, which often seemed poorly choreographed."
"pennyelenabooks","2","1","1","9 September 2015"," not good enough
","Annie is preparing to become a maid of Honor at her best friend's wedding, while watching her life scrabble apart and her friend being taken from her by Helen, an other bridesmaid. The movie supposed to be funny and romantic, but it wasn't. Really, it wasn't. The jokes were overplayed and the romance was sooo typical, you could actually make out what will happen from the first scene of them together. Annie is messed up, a time bomb ready to explode, which she eventually does in the end in the most tragic way. You might have been able to understand her, if the script made an effort to give more depth to the character other than their superficial background stories. So 2 out of 10."

","As a middle-aged Englishman I admit that I may have come to this late and am highly unlikely to have formed the target demographic. I will also admit to finding Kristen Wiig very attractive and genuinely funny .... in other things.<br/><br/>Having said that, this is overlong and pointless. The humour is as subtle as a sledgehammer and, at points, just unpleasant. The characters lack charm to say the least and the whole concept of 'showering' this, that and the other is lost on me.<br/><br/>The largely female cast are a disparate variety of ludicrous characters and I felt unable to feel empathy or interest in any of them. The male characters are largely there to make up the numbers and are similarly limp and creepy.<br/><br/>Without any meaningful storyline, it came across as a series of unfunny sketches concerning a pathetic, sad single woman approaching a certain age feeling sorry for herself and being nasty to her 'friends'.<br/><br/>It drags on and on - lots of self-examination and navel-gazing, tears and the predictable making-up and clichéd ending.<br/><br/>Charmless, graceless and such a waste."

","""Bridesmaids"" is uneven at times but there are a lot of laughs and a lot of heart present too. My problems with it are that some of the gross out humor feels out of place and most of the jokes that don't work are related to some kind of body function. There are times where movie feels like it's being something else instead of just being itself. Thankfully, most of the gross-out jokes are dropped (along with some of the excess characters) a third into the film and it starts to focus more on the leads, their relationships between each other and the humor that is generated when everything starts to go wrong right before the wedding. It isn't perfect but once it gets going you'll appreciate the genuine relationships on the screen. You'll laugh a lot and it will amuse both men and women. (On DVD, March 30, 2012)"

My friend liked the story, but didn't like some of the crude parts. The 2 hours flew by - you know that's a great movie. The acting was great and there were some surprise band appearances. While some of the actions were a bit on the dramatic side, they were still extremely funny. Great acting by everyone in the movie. Gotta love the airplane scene.

"DICK STEEL","7","4","9","21 July 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Bridesmaids
","Help! I may be losing my sense of humour, which I fear. While many have found The Hangover and its Part 2 really funny, somehow I'd hardly classify them as really being comedies of their respective years since there are padded moments that doesn't do the story any good, while at times having scenes which were really engineered and came across quite artificially. The same goes for Bridesmaids, widely touted to be the female version of that Todd Philips directed series, and in the same vein, suffered a similar fate in having the expected play out as they should, and nothing more.<br/><br/>Not that I'm expecting rocket science, but the story does indeed take a leaf out of The Hangover, borrowing its basic setting of an impending wedding, coupled with a celebrity finale that is as formulaic as how most wedding dinners here are conducted - you get the fanfare introduction of the appetizers, before a rather bland main course topped off by noodles or rice, followed by desserts before everyone forms a beeline for the doors.<br/><br/>Written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig, the latter /who also stars as the leading character Annie, this film could have been labelled as a singular rather than a plural entity, given varying degrees of screen time granted to the rest of the entourage. Annie is that neurotic woman who cannot seem to get her act together, being a flop in her confectionery business, a flop at her sales work, in total disarray for having entered into a f*ck buddy relationship with a rich playboy, and in arrears with her apartment rental. We only know that she's best friends forever with the bride to be Lillian (Maya Rudolph) and has been tasked as the maid of honour, which is where the whole film revolves around.<br/><br/>Not. Despite its wedding theme, there is only a handful of scenes related to the run up to a wedding, such as the fitting out for gowns in an expensive shop which provided some of the best scenes in the film, a bridal shower and of course the expected finale for a film like this. The rest of the scenes felt like glue, being there piece the disparate scenes together so that it can flow from joke to joke. On the jokes front, there's a good mix of verbal jousting and slapstick, which came complete with the obligatory toilet humour, and plenty of potty mouthed characters who think that swearing equates to funny. Obviously some worked while others tanked, with brilliant ideas all utilized in a single setting, leaving mediocre ones to prop up the rest, which was a pity.<br/><br/>The real crux of the film, one which actually made me appreciate and enjoy this a lot more, is its theme of the rich and poor divide given the presence of Helen (Rose Byrne) as the antagonist, being extremely loaded, and for reasons to be unveiled which had nothing to do with Lillian's wedding, if at all, having set up to be Annie's chief rival to be well received, and recognized as Lillian's BFF. It addresses how sometimes money can be used to buy emotions, affections, friendships and all things superficial, but when it comes to the crunch, nothing beats sincerity and a keen interest without having baggage such as ulterior motives. Sure there were a couple of engineered scenes to bring this up in not so subtle terms, but I guess when used in the context of weddings from the female perspective, meaningful things can be built without the need to always resort to material wealth, though of course the latter, together with personal connections, sometimes help, and that's the ugly truth.<br/><br/>Surprisingly the story was allowed to wander all over the place, to allow Annie to get involved romantically with a cop (Chris O'Dowd) naturally in contrast to her f*ck buddy, but also to provide some comic relief no matter how brief those moments actually became. I suppose no flick chick can entirely omit this aspect in a film with the absence of that proverbial Prince Charming type, so O'Dowd served the purpose complete with his Irish accent used to sound exotic and to provide a very small talking point in the film. A trip to Las Vegas got set up as well but for all the fanfare expectation, everything got centered around the airplane journey which was included in the trailer, and somehow overstayed its welcome.<br/><br/>If only the film had avenues to bring in the other bridesmaids, especially Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey into the picture, it would have been more inclusive since they won't fade away as unimportant, disposable caricatures. Even Melissa McCarthy had it lucky to have a jarring, comeback moment of sorts to engage the audience directly, being the equivalent of Zach Galifianakis in his turn in The Hangover though less annoying, to literally slap some sense to the protagonist and preach ideals and values to the audience out there. It's a pep talk alright about self confidence and self pity, mildly amusing though not contributing much to the story anyhow.<br/><br/>Still, the film lived up to its marketing billing of The Hangover equivalent for the female crowd, and it shows, despite venturing into gross out territory centered in and around a bridal shop, which personally contained the best moments of the film. Call me crass but at least my laughter was sustained in that setting alone. Recommended."
"neil-476","10","4","9","24 June 2011"," First rate
","Bridesmaids is ostensibly a comedy about the mishaps of a group of bridesmaids aiming for a hen party outing to Las Vegas and, as a result, it invites direct comparison with the unexpected hit The Hangover of a couple of years ago. It even features a moderate amount of crude and scatological humour, and an outrageous exaggerated group member, thus making the leaning towards comparison even stronger.<br/><br/>In fact, the areas of comparison are fairly superficial. Bridesmaids is a much better film, and I say this as someone who thoroughly enjoyed The Hangover.<br/><br/>As a male viewer of mature years, I watched Bridesmaids in a cinema where the audience was predominantly women of an age where they have met a) various of life's disappointments and b) the selfishnesses which men can sometimes demonstrate. This film made them laugh a lot, and I enjoyed the experience of seeing it in the company of such an audience. It made me laugh, too, perhaps not with the outrageous belly laughs of The Hangover, but with knowing laughter almost all the way through. There is a scatological sequence which rivals Dumb and Dumber for funniest diarrhoea sequence ever (I can't believe I just typed that) but, for me, this was outdone by a sequence on a plane which was beautifully judged and hilarious.<br/><br/>Bad language is an area I often complain about - there was a moderate amount of swearing here, some of it particularly ripe, but I have no complaints because - take note, screenwriters - it was all dramatically justified and served a purpose: none of it was gratuitously inserted simply because it is trendy to fill a film with bad language.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent, with Rose Byrne brilliantly playing - but not overplaying - a character who is far from easy to like. And kudos to Melissa McCarthy for creating a character who is funny and fat, not funny because she is fat. And, notwithstanding the exaggerated nature of her character, she is believable (I am contrasting this with Zack Galifianakis in The Hangover - funny, but I didn't believe he was a real person for a second).<br/><br/>That's at the heart of why I liked Bridesmaids so much - it is an honest film. The characters are real, their motivations and feelings are real, and even though the events may be tipped slightly over the edge, I could believe in these people and feel for them.<br/><br/>Finally, I must single out Kristen Wiig, playing the central character and co-writing. I'm not familiar with her US TV work, but I've seen her in a number of films (most recently Paul) and quite liked her. Let me say this about her performance in Bridesmaids: if this performance had taken 15 minutes of screen time and had been in a serious movie, she would be looking at a Best Supporting Actress nomination: she is that good here. However, she is on screen all the way through, in a broad and sometimes coarse comedy, so she doesn't stand a chance of a nomination, and it is a great pity. Her performance is subtle, full of light and shade, emotional, real - oh, and very, very funny."
"FilmRap","6","4","9","3 June 2011"," This is not just a chic flick
","First of all, this is not just a ""chic flick."" Certainly, the out loud laughter in the movie theater seemed to more weighted from the young men in the audience. It is an hour and half of good comedy in the genre of Saturday Night Live. Not surprising since the screen writer and the star of the movie is Kristen Wiig. She is Annie, the bests friend of Lillian (Maya Rudolph),the bride to be. Annie's own life is not quite on track especially guy wise and job wise . She is asked to be the maid of honor but encounters Helen (Rose Bryne) who is a recent friend of the bride and seems to have things together including great ideas for the wedding party, wedding dress and just about everything else. There are some great physical comedy bits and lots of clever lines with some very fine comedic acting especially by Ms. Wiig and Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan, the bridesmaid who is as tough as nails but with a heart of gold. There is also an amusing sex scene and a wild escapade on an airplane. Perhaps some things are a little too far fetched as we are asked to believe that a state trooper albeit one from Wisconsin, (Chris O'Dowd)-the true love interest of Annie- would drive around in his patrol car with a girl in whom he was interested. Although you are seeing the movie for its comedy, you are also given a sharp satire that also raises questions about the extremes people go to in planning the wedding event (picking the dress, the batchelorette party and how the girls support or don't support each other.) Of course the ending is predictable and there are additional comedy pieces interspersed during the titles at the end. After all it is that kind of film. (2011)Filmrap.net"

","It's not easy to have a movie that appeals to both genders of audience. A couple films have successfully done it this year-The Adjustment Bureau, No Strings Attached, Win/Win, ETC, but Bridesmaids is the tip of the iceberg. As written by star Kristen Wiig and directed by Paul Fieg whose only other 2 movies include the flops I Am David and Unaccompanied Minors, Bridesmaids is a movie whose excellence I simply am having trouble translating to words, even as I sit here typing right now. The film stars Kristen Wiig as Annie, an unsuccessful bakery owner who is asked to be the maid of honor at her best, and only friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph)'s wedding. There she meets the bridesmaids, rich and snobby Helen (Rose Byrne), married Becca (Ellie Kemper), unhappy mother Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), and sex-crazed, wacky Megan (Melissa McCarthy, who walks away with every scene she's in.) One of my favorite things about Bridesmaids is that there's not a bad apple in the bunch. By that I mean everyone, from the bridesmaids to the supporting cast, adds their own little special touch to the movie. Not a lot of movies have made me wish they were longer, especially at 2 hours, but Bridesmaids falls right into that short list. Bridesmaids may not be the best film of the year so far (Win/Win and Bill Cunningham: New York top that category,) but it's the funniest film of the year so far, and even, in years, and one you absolutely need to check out."

Even Xanadu and Can't Stop the Music were better than this film. I was expecting a raucous girls' night out complete with behavior no woman will admit to, but this was not as it appeared in the TV commercials.

I never liked the TV version of Sex in the City, but it looks like King Lear compared to this dreck. The only funny part of the film involved raccoons eating a discarded cake. P.T.

I don't like silly movies generally but I do like rom coms, and I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Also surprising is how well Chris O'Dowd fits in to the movie and his believable performance having only seen him in quirky British TV shows like IT Crowd.

"chaos-rampant","Null","3","6","3 December 2011"," Together alone
","The Judd Apatow formula has worked well so far: lay out a moment of personal crisis that we know should be despairing for the microcosm of the protagonist but isn't because we're not yet aware of the full implications, at the outset posit this to be a kind of charm then allow him or her to swim to the edges of that microcosm with increasing awkwardness. Offset each new low with as much crudeness possible so that it sinks in a little later that we were laughing with pain. Finally express the life-altering realization with as much organic drama the specific world allows.<br/><br/>So it is always the balance of the pie in the face with some emotional maturity in handling the aftermath that makes these work. And the transitions need to be smooth, from disastrous fun to self- examination. In the best of cases anyway, because he's also produced a slew of crap.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that this is a notch or two above The Hangover, even though it's a similar scenario except with women having to handle the rite of passage. So we have a person who needs to pull together all her resources to stage an important event, she needs to plan, to lead, to be creative but responsible; of course her life is an emotionally disheveled mess, so it's a resounding failure that reflects on her. It reflects on the sex she chooses to have.<br/><br/>But she is an artist we learn, a very talent baker dismayed by financial failure. We know that she will bake again before it's over, so it's all a matter of realizing her life is that pliant dough she needs to shape. And she needs to be slapped hard enough to discover the courage to begin to.<br/><br/>There is an antagonist who makes every step of the way more miserable, but she is only the pretty picture that we first meet, a façade as fragile as she is. They become friends in the end. She discovers sex that is not self-reproach. Joy that is not ego.<br/><br/>The only downside is that for all the slaps she has been dealt, she only wakes up when the fat, unattractive bridesmaid lays it out for her.<br/><br/>Story-wise it's as poignant as Adventureland strained to be, but even funnier than Superbad because the passage is already from a mature world. So every mishap is a laugh that wounds deeper and vice versa. It's a world where polite appearances must be kept, and the smile be fresh and social in company.<br/><br/>Being what it is, the film can only support so much talk; the bottom-line for me is that I am given preposterous stuff to laugh, without feeling I'm being condescended to like a total moron by the wrap-around into actual life."

"vthompson2","Null","3","6","22 May 2011"," Question- Maya Rudolph as the bride
","There is something I don't quite understand. If Maya Rudolph is the bride, and she is a woman of color, why aren't there any other women of color as her bridesmaids? This seems to be such a deliberate oversight on the part of the Hollywood producers ad a negative view of the actress about her own race. I haven't seen the movie, but if she is passing for white then she has allowed Hollywood to use her as a pawn for benign racism. It is beyond belief that any African American even partly has never had any dealings with their own people unless they are in denial and totally identify with being white. Even if it is true, why capitalize on it. It shows great disrespect and embarrassment towards her mother, Minnie Ripperton, one of the greatest singers of all time. If I am wrong in this issue I stand corrected and apologize profusely. This reminds me the racist eras of when Elizabeth Taylor portrayed the role of Cleopatra instead of the likes of a Dorothy Dandridge or Eartha Kitt. Shame on you, Hollywood once again!!"

","A movie for women, about women, and by women. Well, make that last one written by women but directed and produced with the Paul Feig and Judd Apatow touch. This means that we get comedy and emotion in equal parts. But it also means that we get perverted humour, cliché cat-fights, and sweet romance.<br/><br/>Some of the requisite inclusions like trying on bridesmaids dresses, which incorporates the perverted humour, are absolutely hilarious. While some of the requisite girl fights are stupid, ridiculous, and completely unrealistic. Realism may not be something they're aiming for here, but it's funnier when it's true.<br/><br/>""Bridesmaids"" is more about Annie (Kristen Wiig) than the other bridesmaids. A better title would have been ""Kristin Wiig Before the Wedding"". Wiig is best known for ""Saturday Night Live"", and they do take a lot traits from SNL, live over-using Wiig, having scenes last longer than they should, but at least the majority of them are funny. Thankfully the other featured bridesmaid is played by Melissa McCarthy. She is given the best character, the funniest lines, and proves how good of a comedic actress she is.<br/><br/>Undeniably, ""Bridesmaids"" is hilarious, but the ridiculously high critics' rating really just suggests that men love it when women swear. It's funny but it's not brilliant."
"StevePulaski","8","4","10","21 May 2011"," Women rule in 2011
","When it comes to comedies, anyone can be the star. Women rule in Bridesmaids, and boy do they make some movie characters, like the wolf pack in The Hangover seem well behaved. Judd Apatow, the comedy wizard he is in the 2000's, has made realistic teen films like Superbad and dramas with comedic relief like Funny People. He is a multi-talented screenwriter, director, and producer, and his charm is shown off in Bridesmaids.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids proves that women aren't as calm and collective as some other comedies make them out to be. They are not always waiting to pay the guys' bail when they do something that gets them thrown in the brig. They sometimes debate how they will get out of the brig. Hall Pass showed women can have more fun than the males, and Bridesmaids shows women can have fun doing the men's job. 2011 is definitely the year of the women.<br/><br/>The plot: Annie (Wiig) is a failed bakery owner who's best friend Lillian (Rudolph) is getting married. Annie anticipates she will be the maid of honor, but feels shoved to the side when Helen (Byrne), the groom's boss, begins to takeover and plan the wedding the way she sees it.<br/><br/>Annie, Lillian, and Helen are accompanied by Rita (McLendon-Covey), the foul-mouthed mother of three, and the hilarious Megan (McCarthy), the chubby and outspoken hilarity of the group which derives from her quick-witted remarks and very relatable attitude to some women.<br/><br/>Knowing a lot of my mom's friends, I could pretty much play ""who's who"" and put them in the roles of the cast. I had everyone with a secondary part and an extra laugh at every joke beside everyone in the theater.<br/><br/>If cut appropriately, Bridesmaids cut fit on Saturday Night Live, the show Kristen Wiig is currently cast on, called something like Revenge of the Bride Buffoons. Wiig is extremely talented, and seeing her in Adventureland, Extract, and Paul I can say I've never seen a bad movie with her in it. We can all forget MacGruber ever happened.<br/><br/>Even with Apatow only producing the film, it still delivers the charm and relatable characters seen in every one of his films. Besides having tons of comedy, there always is some sort of human-being essence to these characters showing them as more than just actors with lines, but pre-existing characters that are three dimensional. It is almost more than a movie.<br/><br/>Apatow is currently working on an HBO show, which is looking interesting, called Girls about a group of twenty something females and their separate lives. It seems like a younger Sex and the City, and if it keeps the format like Bridemaids, odds are it will be funny and clever.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids proves women can be just a vulgar, obscene, hilarious, and dirty as men. It is by no means a chick flick, more like a raunchy comedy with a heart. It lovable even at its most disgusting scenes. Even the dress fitting scene is hilarious as well as disgusting. It is one big mix of fun.<br/><br/>Starring: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, Chris O'Dowd, and Terry Crews. Directed by: Paul Feig."
"alexart-1","8","4","10","17 May 2011"," Having the Wedding Cake and Eating it Too. It's a Women's World, After All.
","Maybe gross-out comedy and chick flicks aren't usually connected, but that should all change with Paul Feig's Bridesmaids. The Judd Apatow-backed comedy boldly bucks that trend by carefully balancing emotional elements and hilarious jokes. What many comedies are incapable of doing these days is getting dramatic points across while simultaneously making the audience laugh. And that is just where Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig's screenplay succeeds so brilliantly. There is, of course, a brilliant group of actresses that puts her writing to work as well. This cliché-busting doesn't last the entire movie, however--it regresses into typical romantic comedy territory in the final third--but no matter, Bridesmaids is one of the only funny comedies in recent memory.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids' wonderful central character is Annie, played by Kristen Wiig. Annie's life hasn't been every woman's dream. Her venture as a baker has failed completely, she can't afford her rent, she has occasional sexual romps with a man (Jon Hamm) who refuses to be her boyfriend, and she simply has no friends. Even worse is the fact that her best friend (Maya Rudolph) is getting married and has asked her to be the maid of honor. And to complete it all, she has to deal with a troop of other women helping with the wedding. The ensemble cast is rounded out by Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLoven-Corey, and Ellie Kemper.<br/><br/>But just why does Bridesmaids rise above other female-driven rom-coms? The simple answer is Kristen Wiig. Her writing breathes life into normally one-dimensional misguided women. The more complicated answer is all of the actresses' ability to make each character seem normal. More often than not, women with waists the size of toothpicks prance across the screen in search of a male counterpart that they hoped to marry. This is not the case with the women of Bridesmaids. Those who have married or placed themselves in other traditional roles have found themselves to be stuck in harmful situations. Characters like Annie who haven't still have their own problems. It's not easy being a woman, apparently (please note that I'm male), and Bridesmaids certainly glorifies living the life of a ""real"" woman who actually faces problems.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids was nicknamed ""the female Hangover"" when the trailer came out. That's not a horrible comparison at times, but most often, Bridesmaids is an original movie. None of the jokes are borrowed and while some of the characters feel like Apatow archetypes now, each woman seems new and enriched. Even the method in which punchlines are told is original. There are two sequences, one on a plane involving a drugged out Annie stumbling through first class and one in a fitting shop involving food poisoning and a white dress, in particular that are notable for being especially hilarious. The delivery is important: in both scenes, five jokes come together in one big punchline that caused the audience to roar with laughter. It's a grand but all too normal affair and it works for almost all of the movie.<br/><br/>If Bridesmaids is the future of comedy, I look forward to going to the movies more often. Women are just as hilarious as men. It's a simple fact of life that writers often ignore. And all it took was Mumolo and Wiig to show us this. Equally emotional and sexual, Bridesmaids is a smart comedy that only comes once a year. Say ""I do"" to Bridesmaids. It's $11 that's actually worth spending at the movies."
"SloberDon","Null","4","10","17 May 2011"," chick flick concentrate = NOT funny in the least
","This movie is being advertised as ""the Hangover for women"" and not your typical chick flick but I find that to be the most false advertising of all-time. Not only is this thing a typical chick flick, it's like chick flick concentrate. I honestly can't imagine many men laughing or enjoying this film if they're being totally honest. How this qualifies being called a comedy almost beyond belief. It's an average story about a ""relatable"" woman with issues that grows and discovers herself and true love over the course of a film. YAWN. Very little is funny in even the remotest of ways. Maybe the ending could be considered heartwarming but any praise this film generates has got to be from people desperately wanting it to be good or wanting it to be funny because, quite frankly, it's neither.<br/><br/>It is, however, a strong contender for most overrated movie of the year. If you're a guy, do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague even on DVD. Many of us will get persuaded to see it like I did but don't say you weren't warned.<br/><br/>I'd say the critics don't want to tell the truth about this film because they either don't want to anger the women in their lives or their female patrons.

","The Hollywood summer has dawned upon us and the first set of movies has been predictably thrust upon us with loads of sequels along with the much anticipated sequel of Hangover 2. Hangover 2 will be a subject of discussion in next week's review. But currently among the crop of movies released is an apparent chick flick called 'Bridesmaid', which by the title itself should be a turn off for men. <br/><br/>But contrary to the repeated studio chick flick cliché, this one deserves to be called the sequel to 2008 blockbuster The Hangover, rather than the rehashed turkey that is to be presented to the paying audience next week.<br/><br/>The wedding scenario that is done to death gets a fresh look and this one does not hide behind the curtains of sugar coated humor. Co-written by SNL veteran Kristen Wiig and produced by guy flicks veteran Judd Apatow, Bridemaid produces some shock inducing laughter's in sequences that generally would require the viewing men to grow a vagina to go through the entire wedding season. Kristen stops at nothing from a hilarious food poisoning emergency during the wedding dress shopping to virtual breakdown of one the bridesmaid during the pre-wedding all ladies social gathering, the movie just turns the entire wedding episode upside down.<br/><br/>The ever miserable love life of Annie (Kristen Wiig) becomes to a virtual breakdown of her life during the wedding of her 'since childhood' best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Her unprofessional work ethic at jewelry store left aside; Annie is pretty much miserable in everything. Jon Hamm is the latest of her boyfriends that she has been dealing with; who uses her as 'f**k-buddies' in his own words. She is sharing an apartment with British siblings who are outrageous in their own rights. Finally, for her the bottom point in her life would if she moves in with her mother, no prizes for guessing that whether it happens after all.<br/><br/>Things really start to unravel when the wedding festivities begins with Lillian aligning Annie with a blockbuster team of Bridesmaids for her wedding. Special mention for Melissa McCarthy who steals the show during the movie characters every comic turn. Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon- Covey provide enough support to deserve their place in the movie. But it is rivalry between ultra-suave & rich Helen (Rose Byrne) and Annie to be the Maid of Honor that provides the background for crazy wedding rides. The sequences of their rivalry are some of the best cat fight you would witness without reaching to an actual physical fight. The movie manages to pull off a genuine romantic angle to Annie's story with a budding romance with a highway patrol police officer who more than obliges to pull over Annie for her various driving offences.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids provokes enough laughter from its audience to make them forget about the Hangover they are or would receive while watching Hangover part II; which is if not funny and original then is at least a cautionary tale for the makers of Bridesmaids to tread the waters of franchising the movie only after a few after thoughts about not slaying the chicken that lay golden eggs. A final mention to Kristen Wiig and her brand of comedy; it deserves to be mentioned among the likes Tina Fey and Julie- Louis Dreyfus."

","""Bridesmaids are like matrimonial interns."" Conversations with other Women (2005)<br/><br/>Is Bridesmaids a Hangover for chicks? In a small way, yes, but Bridesmaids is better, even in the scatological scene where a dress fitting turns into a hilarious disaster as the girls head for the nearest head. I remember a cruder attempt at fundament fun in Hangover.<br/><br/>It's all about best friends Annie (Kristen Whig) and Lillian (Maya Rudolph) preparing for Lillian's wedding with Annie as a maid of honor who is clueless about arranging a wedding. The conflict arises when another maiden challenges her for best-friend status and maid of honor honors.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids has its share of stereotypes: cute but amorously lost Annie (Kristin Wiig), plain but lovable affianced Lillian (Maya Rudolph), fat and randy Megan (Melissa McCarthy), perfectly pretty, wealthy snob Helen (Rose Byrne), et al. Yet amidst these types we've seen before is a story of loss and redemption not so heavily attended to in other Judd-Apatow produced romcoms.<br/><br/>Director Paul Feig lets the pathos in when the comedy needs a rest, and writers Wiig and Annie Mumolo infuse the dialogue with an unusual intelligence. Unfortunately the off-beat wit ends as the film sags midway with Annie's emotional and amorous problems struggling with jealousy over Helen's high-end bridal arrangements and combat with selfish lover Ted (Jon Hamm) and blue collar cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd).<br/><br/>The film revives when the requisite going-to-Vegas breakout happens even before the girls get there—on the plane in some set pieces about drugs and booze and flight attendants that sure beat Snakes on a Plane and Airport for a smart mix of slapstick and satire.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is a leap forward for intelligent comedy where characters overcome stereotypes to be memorable and insightful about the challenges 30-something women face in a society where their voices are more frequently heard above the din of dim-witted boy men. <br/><br/>But the best was at the beginning when the girls are overcome with bad food that poisons their dress fitting and provides the best potty shenanigans ever, spilling over, so to speak, into sink and street."

The film centers on the comedic absurdity of women, however men and women can both get a kick out of this movie. I think I enjoyed this film so much because this was one of the first films I've seen where most of the characters are funny women. We see films like ""The Hangover"" and ""Step Brothers"" where the focus is on comical males. In my opinion, Bridesmaids switched up the style of the usually expected comedy. Although I find this film to be awesome, the box office seems to disagree. The movie itself still made a killing but compared to other high ranking films, Bridesmaids didn't come close. There are some inappropriate scenes for children, which takes away a large audience. On the other hand, there's nothing too crazy in this film where you would feel the need to turn it off.

Bridesmaids is essentially 2 hours of Kristen Wiig's sense of humour, which is good in small doses where I enjoyed her in her bit parts of Apatow films, but this film is hit and miss gags (the bleached asshole gag had me on the floor though). I wonder if the nomination is just for all the ""gross- out"" comedies of late because this one wasn't anything special.<br/><br/>It has some sharp moments and it does do a great job of making Wiig's character hit rock bottom, but there were a few moments I felt were out of character just for laughs. Melissa McCarthy was actually pretty good, but not Oscar calibre, not even up to Robert Downey Jr. tongue-in-cheek Tropic Thunder calibre, but good for the package she's in. I love The IT Crowd but the misuse of Chris O'Dowd really sucked. His character was written embarrassingly bad. His first scene is what made me turn off the film the first time. This second attempt was more entertaining this time round but the film's biggest problem is the awful pacing. It's ridiculously slow and lacks all story drive.

"Turfseer","3","2","4","12 August 2012"," Passive-aggressive character types inhabit inconsistently funny and often crude comic spectacle
","Many people compared 'Bridesmaids' to 'The Hangover' but in terms of the comic tone of its characters, I found it much more similar to a recent indie film, 'Cyrus'. Both films attempt to get laughs by introducing a series of passive-aggressive types. The passive-aggressive credentials of the film's protagonist, Annie Walker, is established very early on when she sleeps with a boyfriend who also is afflicted with a passive-aggressive personality. When the boyfriend aggressively declares he has a rule about not sleeping over, instead of acting angrily, Annie lamely declares, ""you're funny in the morning.""<br/><br/>The interesting thing about the passive-aggressive type is that the passivity masks a deeply repressed reservoir of anger. When the anger finally rises to the surface, it often comes out as a challenge, marked by a hurried retreat. We see this when Annie and her best friend Lillian (the bride to be) attempt to take an exercise class in the park without paying. When they're found out by the instructor, they run off with the excuse that they can no longer afford the high price of admission (despite actually costing $12).<br/><br/>Annie's lack of self-esteem is on display when she turns off her customers by telling them that you can't trust anybody, while working as a salesperson at the jewelry store. As is often the case with a lot of the characters here, there's a thin line between the unsavoriness of their blatant aggression and viewing that aggression as humorous.<br/><br/>Often the language of the passive-aggressive character is cloaked in overly diplomatic terms; the underlying sub-text of course, is an insult. For example, when Annie's mother (played by Jill Clayburgh in her last film role) tries to put a positive spin on Annie's negative life situation, she relates a story of a floundering gay prostitute she met at an AA meeting, concluding that ""hitting bottom is a good thing.""<br/><br/>Screenwriters Wiig and co-writer Annie Mumulo try to mine as many laughs as possible from Lillian's assorted bridesmaids with mixed results. Lillian's cousin Rita can't stand her ""disgusting"" three teenagers and the joke about semen being all over the house is too crude to be funny. Becca, Lillian's friend from work and Megan, the groom's sister, ineptly conclude that Annie isn't single when they spot her next to two successive creepy guys who they should have known she would have no interest in. Little is done with newly married Becca character throughout the film but Megan (Melissa McCarthy from the 'Mike & Molly' TV series) proves to be one of the more amusing aggressive characters in the passive-aggressive pantheon. Megan not only can bond with a dolphin while on vacation but isn't afraid to make her sexual wants known (in spying one particular tall guy at the wedding, she proclaims, ""I'm going to climb that like a tree"").<br/><br/>It's Helen, the snippy Trophy wife of the groom's boss, who turns out to be Bridesmaid's central antagonist. Again, the dialectic between her passive and aggressive side is evident when we first meet her. Helen aggressively attempts to steal Annie's thunder as they lock horns with their back and forth toasts to Lillian at the engagement party (the joke becomes tiresome as it goes on for much too long). There's more silly shenanigans during the tennis game, when we view Helen and Annie blasting one another with tennis balls in slow motion. Only Helen's completely lame, passive remark to the stepson's expletive (""put a quarter in the smear jar"") hits the mark! <br/><br/>Annie begins to lose Lillian's affections when she brings the bridesmaids to the Brazilian restaurant and most of them end up with food poisoning later on at the fitting room. It's a scene that doesn't work at all as it's too divorced from any kind of recognizable reality (both Megan and Lillian end up defecating in inappropriate places including a sink and outside in the middle of the street). Annie's meltdown on the plane to Vegas proves to be only slightly more amusing. Most of it relies on Annie's face-off with the flight attendant while she's intoxicated. The bit with Annie in sunglasses pretending to be a first-class passenger is something a real drunk would do—but when Annie exclaims that there's a 'colonial woman' churning butter out on the wing—that is truly a line of inspired lunacy! Meanwhile we do take some pleasure in Megan's vindication over her insistence that the man sitting next to her on the plane indeed turns out to be an air marshal.<br/><br/>There's one more truly amusing moment before 'Bridesmaids' devolves into sentimental romantic comedy—that's Annie's confrontation with the young woman back at the jewelry store, resulting in her being fired (in substance: Young lady: Did you take your Xanax? Annie: You have four boyfriends—have fun having a baby at your prom).<br/><br/>Once Annie has her final meltdown at Lillian's shower, Lillian expresses her true feelings toward Annie (how she's truly screwed up the pre-wedding preparations). Events are now set in motion where whatever comedy remains in this very spotty laugh-fest, is lost. Megan drops her animosity toward Annie and conscripts her to help find Lillian who's gotten cold feet about going through with the wedding. I haven't mentioned Officer Rhodes as he's the least interesting character in the film. After Rhodes reluctantly agrees to help locate Lillian (he traces through her cell phone messages), it's only inevitable that he and Annie will end up together after Annie's initial sabotage of their relationship.<br/><br/>'Bridesmaids' probably has gotten more accolades than it deserves as it's one of the few films today that features an ensemble of women in comic roles. Unfortunately those roles are formulaic, as the passive-aggressive types proffered up here, could probably fit into any situation featuring contemporary mores. Occasionally there's a clever line or two but the humor quickly devolves into silly slapstick or outright crudity. Perhaps with some tighter editing, 'Bridesmaids' might have proved more palatable in the end."

","Let's cut to the chase.<br/><br/>The main character just kills what could've been a good movie. The side characters (i.e. the other bridesmaids) are actually pretty funny. They have interesting personalities and the ridiculousness of it all made me laugh.<br/><br/>However, the story revolves around a bitter, pessimistic woman whose actions and speech I just can't comprehend! She sleeps with a man who uses her for sex and makes her feel horrible about herself, yet keeps coming back to him. But when she meets a man who actually loves her for who she is, she tells him that their night ""was a mistake"". The hell?<br/><br/>I can't understand her thought process, I absolutely cannot empathise with her, and I just feel plain embarrassed for her best friend, who she lauds her problems on during her friend's happiest time of her life.

","First of all, I've never felt more compelled to write a review for a movie. I'm in the middle of re-watching this film for the first time since I saw it in theaters, and was appalled to find its IMDb rating only at 6.9/10.<br/><br/>It seems to me that most people have a problem with the sad undertones of this movie, which were 'unexpected' because of the movie's comedic label. Unfortunately, you all missed the point, not to mention the genius of this comedy. The team of actors who wrote and starred in this movie are incredibly talented, seeing as they were able to pull more than one strong emotion out of the audience during a 'funny' movie.<br/><br/>They are simply making light of Kristin Wiig's horrible rut with infinite well-placed gags: from thoughtful humor to bathroom/bedroom humor. By taking a potentially dreadful situation and making fun of it, the hope is only that the audience be able to do the same in their own life. If we can't laugh, or at least attempt to laugh, during hard times...how would we ever get through them? <br/><br/>Are the best films not the ones that bring us great joy (aka comedy) and sadness (the over-empathy some felt for Kristin Wiig's character)? <br/><br/>Sure it is sad. If I do remember correctly, I teared up while seeing it in theaters. I am a guy, and it's not like I over-empathize with female life issues. Some parts of the movie may seem 'devastating', but the genius of this comedy is their ability to come back from tragic moments with killer/smart/crass jokes and sequences.<br/><br/>Hats off to Maya Rudolph and Kristin Wiig (come back to SNL!) for this stellar comedy that had me (and is currently having me, wink) giggling in unnatural amounts. Also, many thanks to Jon Hamm for being awesome. As always. And Mr. Ireland was pretty good too.<br/><br/>Whatever your take, this movie is and will always be hilarious."

","The Hangover with women instead? The answer is both yes and no. I seem to be one of few who were kind of cool towards the Hangover, sure it was good entertainment but nothing special and there are much better recent comedies out there. Or maybe it is because comedy is no longer any of my favourite movie types.<br/><br/>But now for the somewhat surprise after this gray introduction: I really liked Bridesmaids. It was great fun all the way through and to my positive surprise it isn't just a bunch of jokes strung together by a simple plot that serves no other purpose. Bridesmaids also has a story that feels worth following. I would categorise Bridesmaids as a drama comedy. That is I think one of the main reasons I liked it. There are both parts of laughter and wanting to see what happens next. OK so the story is good but it's not great. At the time of writing this review the movie has been nominated for best original screenplay. According to me it is not that good but I don't know all the competition. At the start I stated that it still is somewhat like The Hangover and that would be the funny parts. The humor feel the same kind with awkward situations and serious acting in pretty absurd happenings. Works mostly great. And so the acting? It is most of the time good. It is the kind of forced dialogue and over the top behavior. But I don't mean it in a bad way it is how it should be for this kind of comedy. Kristen Wiig fits well in the lead and manages well to create the character the viewers care for even if you don't entirely sympathize with. Rose Byrne is just as good as the rival. But the performance that stands out enough to take the spotlight ever time she appears on screen is Melissa McCarthy. The audience laughed at every thing she said, well almost. Her character and her acting was perfectly humorous. Still does she deserve a best supporting actress nomination? I'm not sure but it is true that funny movies seldom get the attention of the big ceremonies like the academy awards so maybe it just feels strange. I don't think I have that much more to say about Bridesmaids.<br/><br/>It is a very good comedy, not great but it might be the funniest I saw the previous year. The fun stuff is great and it still doesn't get stuck and start going on routine. Thankfully the movie also has some emotional substance coming from a well written story. Bridesmaids is a movie that absolutely deserves to be seen and then one will want to see it again. My grade 7/10."
"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","9","2","4","31 January 2012"," Instant classic!!! LOVED ITT!! Utterly hysterical!
","I watched this great comedy today with my sister! We both enjoyed it immensely!! This is the first new comedy I have watched since Friends with Benefits which I never finished because I found it to have too much sex in it. <br/><br/>The plot follows Annie (Kristen Wiig), a lonely woman whose best friend since childhood Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is getting married and she invites Annie to be the maid of honor. Annie reluctantly accepts, a little sad because she isn't getting married and has a boyfriend who makes her feel like sh%t. At Lil's engagement party she meets the rest of the bridesmaids, including Helen (Rose Byrne), a competitive woman and Annie's rival throughout the film, who she always tries to best in giving Lil the best gifts and forming the best bridal shower. There is also Megan (a very different-looking, but excellent, Melissa McCarthy), who is a wack-job but is really likable. The rest are not important to the plot, and are just there to provide more laughs and fill the rest of the bridesmaids slots.<br/><br/>This movie is hysterical!! There are all kinds of jokes: sex jokes (most prominent form of humor in this film), random comedy, gross comedy, etc. Almost every joke is funny (except for the tattoo scene and the food poisoning scene, which I felt were both unnecessary, but the latter is a little bit funny), and you'll be laughing your a$% off at many of the jokes in this brilliantly-scripted film.<br/><br/>There is also heart in this movie, with the first half-hour being very emotional. Friendship, heartwarming scenes, sex, and random comedy are the most prominent factors in the movie, and you might want to consider the last two before you go in. However, there are only 2 sex scenes in the movie. The rest of the sex material is implied. <br/><br/>The acting is stellar, with Kristen and Melissa both being perfect for their roles. They really bring the soul into this movie. Rose Byrne is hateful as Helen, but her character becomes more than just Annie's rival later on. Speaking of which, the characters in ''Bridesmaids'' are very well created, and all have varied, likable, and sometimes hateful personalities. There is nothing really negative I can say about the characters and acting in this one.<br/><br/>The music doesn't really matter in this one, as I found it to be hardly noticeable except for 2 occasions, maybe...<br/><br/>Overall, ''Bridesmaids'' ROCKSSSS!!!! Except for a few unnecessary sex scenes (but really only 2), some gross-out humor which I really didn't find funny, and some hitches with the food-poisoning scene, I really don't have anything negative to say about this movie. Go see it! You won't regret it, I SWEARRR!!! ;)<br/><br/>P.S: Check out the scene where Annie and Helen are trying to get Officer Rhodes' (Wiig's love interest in ''Bridesmaids'', who has a prominent role in this) attention. The line ''Hey, look!! I'm topless!!!!'' and the facial expressions and hand gestures on both of them are priceless! I really enjoyed that scene! :DD<br/><br/>-Josué"

","While not up to the level of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" as what I thought was the best comedy of 2011, ""Bridesmaids"" comes in 2nd. I enjoyed the poking fun at the absurdity of weddings more from a woman's perspective - needy and superficial. The gags are hit-and-miss as was the dialog. On the whole, there are quite a few snickers, but would've liked a few more belly laughs. Kristin Wig puts herself on full display and is billed as one of the writers in this satire. Melissa McCarthy fills in for a female ""Chris Farley"" type performance replete with ample physical humor. The ending petered out a little bit as is often the case in the genre, but the film supplied some good entertainment. Recommended"

","It's not as funny as it's made out to be. It's not amazing, it's not like the female version of The Hangover and it most certainly is not 10 out of 10. It's just like any other romantic comedy out there and it is girly, more girly than expected.<br/><br/>Personally I wanted to throttle the main character for half the movie because all she did was throw a pity party for herself and that's just irritating. It shouldn't even have been called 'Bridesmaids', the movie was focused entirely on the Maid of Honour, but I suppose that's too similar a title to the already existing 'Made of Honour'.<br/><br/>The movie was a let down, but this is due largely to the amount of hype it got when it went through the cinemas. It's a decent chick flick, just don't expect to be rolling on your floor in fits of laughter. And the worst part of it? They didn't even go to Vegas!"

Every time I turn around, it's another comic book hero or Science Fiction or droopy no commitment, ""hey we're best friends let's have sex"" movie. Hurray! Bridesmaids to the rescue! Being a woman of some years, I've seen all my friends walk down the plank into matrimonial bliss. I've done it twice, now, myself...what can I say, I'm a statistic. Just the same, there were bits and pieces of Bridesmaids that hit home. I've been in five bridal parties in my life, and along with my first marriage (kind of skipped it the second time around), it makes a half dozen moments of memories. I really enjoyed the movie. I recommend it to any woman who has been a part of the ritual. It's alleged as the female version of Hangover, but from what I saw of that, it is totally different. Hangover just seemed like someone pushing the shock value button while Bridesmaids was a lot deeper. What do you expect? Women have more substance than men."

","Definitely, people nowadays are growing more and more different and apart; otherwise I couldn't explain why this movie has so contrasting reviews on IMDb whilst other movies tend to polarise the opinions. I found myself wondering how do those who hated it look or feel or think - maybe it would have been useful if they had offered examples of what they consider good comedies... Or maybe it's just the people involved in the movie that provoked the rebellious reactions? I did not know who directed the movie or that Kristen Wii is a SNL regular. And I enjoyed the movie as it was, not very elaborated but alive, kind in a surprising way. A zillion kudos to Kristen Wiig - I for one loved her character! Brought a lot of optimism and compassion in a world obsessed with perfection, rules, the right look, relationship, job...the right everything. The gross moments did not seem artificial, one could laugh at them shamelessly because the action slowly build up to them. And they were decent, I've seen comedies with out of order icky situations and it did not feel that bad way here. The character is great: we have a loser who cannot stop herself from saying the most daring truths in the face of strangers or friends and who can accept herself and go on with her life as it is, even when things go from bad to worse. Oh, I miss the times when people like this roamed free, and they were not relaxed only if they were stupid enough not to realise how inadequate they were!The others are also good, kinda cooky but still plausible. I know: in a particular way, the movie manages to be innocent, fresh, childish. Which is rare nowadays.

You feel bad for her but she's just so funny that you can't help but laugh between her troubles.<br/><br/>Another standout was Melissa McCarthy who delivered her low brow humor with enthusiasm and absolutely no shame. Wait till you get to the plane scene. Wigg is overshadowed by McCarthy's banter with her seatmate.<br/><br/>You believed in each character and they were all unique and had depth. Even minor characters had motivation and dimension. And there were some funny scenes...

I really don't know how these critics and movie goers would consider this is a good movie, maybe hearing women's ""wise crackings"" are so exciting, because usually wisecracking is the words from the male? Not long ago we have a very boring movie, ""The Romantics"", also got the similar scenario and storyline, a bunch of male and female alumni as best friends all invited to participate a wedding and it turned out to be a vicious back-stabbing debacle. That amateurish and so-called best friends' wedding is no different from this ""Bridemaids"", but this one also sucks big time in my opinion; I might have to bang my head on the wall to turn myself into a moron to watch this pathetic movie. After viewed it about 30 minutes my wife finally lost her patience, pushed me with her elbow and suggested: ""This movie looks so pretentious and shallow, could we just leave now?""

Wiig is the central character to this story, and alongside Melissa McCarthy in her first major role, have the biggest laughs. There are too many strong moments, but if I had to pick two, one would be a scene involving a battle of emotions during an engagement party speech, and the other is Wiig trying to catch the attention of police officer Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who's the only real male representative in Bridesmaids. The shoe's on the other foot with Wiig's love-interest O'Dowd, like a gender-swap needed to happen in the big, bad Hollywood. It'll all make sense when you watch this alarming comedy."

"armbritt","Null","0","0","4 October 2015"," Bridesmaids
","""It's coming out of me like lava"" is just one of the many hilarious quotes that is said throughout this film. The 2011 comedy, ""Bridesmaids"", directed by Paul Feig is a one of a kind. This motion picture comes alive with the outstanding writers of the movie, and because of the strong, relatable characters. ""Bridesmaids"" is not a ""chick flick"". It is created and filled with humor for both genders. But while most raunchy comedies are made for men, this film is about women, made by women, and fills a much needed genre for women. If you want to a good laugh this is the movie to watch. <br/><br/>What is there not to love about a wedding and dealing with bridesmaids? This comedy stars Kristen Wigg (Annie) who is a single women living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Annie's bakery just took a dive and she does not have much left besides her mom (Jill Clayburgh) and her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). But then things get even more strenuous for Annie when Lillian becomes engaged to a very wealthy banker and asks Annie to be the maid of honor. With this role, Annie is introduced to her fellow bridesmaids. She meets Lillian's cousin Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), her friend Becca (Ellie Kemper), entertaining future sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy), and the one and only Helen Harris (Rose Byrne). Annie and Helen create tension with one another the first second they meet which creates drama with humor tied in to the whole movie. <br/><br/>The writing of this film is very original and brings the whole show to life. To start, Bridesmaids is written by two creative females which is very rare for this genre of film. These females are Kristen Wigg (who plays Annie) and Annie Mumolo. These two talented ladies have expanded the range of female-driven comedy and have set a new standard for all female writers. It proves that females can indeed be raunchy in the mainstream too. Female film writers are not too common in today's pop culture, but these two create a new female empowerment movement, and have broken down barriers for female writers in Hollywood. What makes this movie so well written is the balance it has between honest romance, realistic tension, and entertaining comedy. <br/><br/>""Bridesmaids"" comes alive because of the strong characters that display extraordinary performances. Melissa McCarthy nails it in this motion picture. McCarthy keeps the jokes coming throughout the entire film and her humor is something that both genders can enjoy. From her saying ""I'm glad he's single because I'm going to climb that like a tree"" to as previously stated ""It's coming out of me like lava!"". McCarthy's character comes alive because she puts her whole self into the character, and is not afraid to let loose. The physical comedy that she exudes is constant, but never over the top. <br/><br/>Should it be seen? Of course. If you are looking for a good laugh, this is the right movie to watch. Director Paul Feig, and writers Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo have created an amusing film that most females cannot do. They found actresses like Melissa McCarthy to make this movie come to life with her personal touches and creative humor. Due to the raunchy jokes and outstanding characters, ""Bridesmaids"" is a hilarious, must see movie."

","From the amazing producers of The 40-Year Old Virgin (2005), Knocked Up (2006), and Superbad (2007) comes a hilarious and clever romantic comedy about love and friendship. Kristin Wiig plays Anna, who thirty-something year old woman living in unhappy life after breaking up with her boyfriend. When her best friend Lillian (played by Maya Rudolph) announces she is getting married and asks her to be her maid of honor, Anna is determined to make it the best days of her life before her wedding. Things however, don't quite go planned as Anna leads Lillian and her friends in a series of wild misfortunes. Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph's co-stars include Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Ellie Kemper, Rebel Wilson, and Wendi McLendon-Covey.<br/><br/>Like many Judd Apatow's comedies, Bridesmaids is a comedy filled with both heart and hilarity, but plenty of crude humor. While most of his films feature primarily male characters and focus on the friendship between them, this one features a large female cast and centers on the misadventures these women face while trying to prepare for a special day for their friend; and the cast is nothing short of fantastic. Melissa McCarthy brings the life to the party with her witty one- liners and insane hilarity. Unlike in the typical Apatow-fare, this film takes advantage of scatological humor aside from the vulgar sex-fueled gags. Normally this type of humor is a recipe for disaster in comedies, this film however, uses it in a way that it clever and funny without being overly gross or appalling; which is quite surprising mainly due to the fact this deals with female characters. A great example would be the scene in the bathroom at the dress store, a scene when you would react in disgust but laugh hysterically at the same time. Aside from the humor, the film also carries a heart-filling message about friendship and what it means to love someone. So the film does have its dramatic moments, but ultimately it meant to be funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is so far one of the best comedies of this decade, and I am confident that this will go down as a classic in the next ten years. While this film is targeted towards women, guys will very likely get as much fun out of this as women."

","Well I finally caught Bridesmaids and it was as hilarious as promised. Just a great movie; totally infectious, laugh-out-loud humour from a genius all female cast. This is one of those guy comedies (Bachelor Party, Hall Pass, The Hangover) but with these girls and storyline it transforms into a bit of a chick-flick while also leaving free reign for the gross out gags, hilarious humiliation and crazy situations.<br/><br/>The characters are diverse, well developed and although the story's not all that unique I did find myself engrossed and even kinda moved watching Kristen Wiig's downward spiral of shame -mostly by her own making. She plays a devoted maid of honour here who struggles to put her financial and romantic woes aside as she attempts to plan the perfect wedding for her best friend. And she's awesome.<br/><br/>No need for me to mention any of the fantastic and hilarious scenes as everyone knows them already (wedding dress shopping). One of my personal favourites though would have to be Wiig trying to get Officer Rhodes attention in a series of drive-by's (speeding, drinking, rapping, flashing). Hilarious.<br/><br/>Chris O'Dowd was such a great addition to this cast, I really enjoyed his character and the whole love interest storyline he had with Wiig. Shout out to Jon Hamm's opening love scene too. 5/10/15"

","Bridesmaids is a silly and watchable 2011 comedy that provides relatively consistent laughs throughout but suffers from the same disease that is afflicting a lot of contemporary comedies these days: The nucleus of a very funny movie is here, but attempts to pad the screenplay with unnecessary subplot and exposition really slow down the proceedings.<br/><br/>The film stars Kristen Wiig (who also co-wrote the screenplay) as Annie Walker, a woman thrilled that her BFF Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is engaged and that Lillian has asked Annie to be her maid of honor. Things get complicated when Annie meets another bridesmaid named Helen (Rose Byrne), a snooty socialite who is marred to Lillian's fiancée's father, who Annie believes is trying to replace her as maid of honor. This part of the movie totally works and the scene where Annie and Helen are trying to get the last word during the wedding toasts is probably the funniest scene in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie suffers when it moves to a romantic triangle between Annie, her current boyfriend (Jon Hamm), a slimeball who treats her like dirt and the cop she meets cute with (Chris O'Dowd). This subplot just brings the movie down because Wiig had way more chemistry with Hamm than she did with O'Dowd. I never bought the relationship with O'Dowd and maybe this is why it was felt necessary to show us how lonely Annie really is. We actually got a 10 minute scene of Annie baking a very elaborate cupcake, which seemed like a gift for a boyfriend but she eats it herself, easily the film's most pointless scene.<br/><br/>The movie suffers when it moves to a romantic triangle between Annie, her current boyfriend (Jon Hamm), a slimeball who treats her like dirt and the cop she meets cute with (Chris O'Dowd).

At first I was mildly interested but as the movie progressed the obvious animosity between the brides best friend and an almost new acquaintance created a comedic situation that increased exponentially with each scene. Instead of your Willy wonkas, Jaws and Pretty woman's - the average free TV network should screen this movie on a Saturday night for ratings and give all those Adam Sandler and Fokker movies a rest for a change. The cast is full of characters from every sitcom you have ever watched and brilliantly executed. Nine out of ten (do yourself a favour) stars."

","It is by definition a chick flick, no one can deny that. Movies can't be made just for rednecks, nerds, adrenaline junkies or even romantics, women are a demographic producers would stupid to ignore, hence chick flicks. If I left out Bollywood and Euro-Trash clichés, it's only because I'd hate to offend the entire movie-going crowd. I watch all kinds of movies; it's a hobby and one that has broadened my perspective, except for horror movies that I usually see only to punctuate days otherwise boring. All this to get to my point: It's okay to like this movie if you're a guy; you can even pretend you're pretending to like itshe'll know.<br/><br/>I give credit to Kristen Wiig for her work on Saturday Night Live and for her performance in ""Paul"" (loved it), so I watched her in this movie. I'll watch her again, I have no doubt; like an itch I need to scratch, I can't help it. Guys will all like Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series (2011) Melissa McCarthy, guaranteed; she may be the only performance many guys will like. And by the way, if your better half wants to see this movie, don't think of dissuading her; it would be equivalent to attempting to convince you to pass on 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' or something."

","This film is about a woman who is asked to be the maid of honor at her friend's wedding. Her life spirals downwards from then on.<br/><br/>""Bridesmaids"" is said to be the female version of ""The Hangover"", because apparently it is outrageously funny. With that expectation in my head, I found ""Bridesmaids"" a little disappointing. ""Bridesmaids"" does have laugh out loud moments, which consists of very crude toilet humour.<br/><br/>Some say that comedies do not need character development, but in this film you really need some character development, as it is about the interaction of a group of newly met friends. Unfortunately, there is little character development, so I don't really know who the bridesmaids really are. Helen is the only bridesmaid that stands out, all the others are just to fill up the screen space or to make Kristen Wiig pretty. The story is quite slow for a comedy, and a joke is repeated over and over for minutes. It appears to me that ""Bridesmaids"" is just a vessel for a high profile one man band comedy for Kristen Wiig. I think ""Bridesmaids"" is overrated, but still enjoyable."
"DKosty123","Null","0","0","29 September 2011"," Not Quite The Movie I Expected
","I'd like to say I am totally thrilled with this movie simply because it tries to be funny. Along with that I like Kristen Wiig who is not just obviously the star and one of the main writers here, but pretty much the center of the film. In that way, the title makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>There is a whole wedding party here but in this one, the bride takes second to the maid of honor Wiig. The story seems to center more around Wiig's character being totally unhappy and failing in everything she does for more than half the movie. While much of the film is very predictable, the humor in it sometimes comes off well, and sometimes falls flat.<br/><br/>Still with Kristen and the other ladies to look at, it is not all bad. Wiig gets in physical comedy starting early with the first romp with a guy. From there are several attempts at sight comedy. What to me is lacking to make the movie great is some sharp verbal comedy. While I like looking at Wiig being physical, it takes more than that to make me happy.<br/><br/>So I come away from this one with mixed feelings. I think the ladies might like this somewhat better as a chick flick but I feel even they might be a little disappointed. There is some pretty decent music here.<br/><br/>From what I see, this is Jill Clayburgh's last movie being released. Sadly she died in 2010 and in this one she is clearly in support. She only has a few scenes and is not a real factor in the film much.<br/><br/>The Unrated Version has some more gags in it that make it a little different a flavor than the theater including a little boy swallowing a Birth Control Pill. That actually comes off a little better than some of the theater release gags."

","I heard of positive things about this movie and the reviews seemed to be pretty good. So I had slightly high expectations for this movie, but it just didn't meet it. This is basically a overrated comedy that annoyed me than it actually being fun and entertaining. It just seemed all the characters were being obnoxious without even being funny, they are constantly wacky and not believable at all and it just doesn't work very well. It just didn't seem to know what direction this movie wanted to go so it was like all over the place at times. After a few minutes in I thought this was gonna be something similar to ""Bride Wars"" which is another crappy movie but it goes in a different direction later on. Most of the characters are abnormal in this, maybe to make it comical but they really aren't all that likable. So they are not believable and yet it reminded me of one of those comedy TV shows like ""The Office"" for example, except your not attached to the characters. Also sort of reminded me of those comedic movies that is cheap and not believable what so ever and tries way too hard to be funny at first. This isn't a charming comedy either and everything was just over the top without being effective. The constant bickering and arguing between one another gets annoying than actually funny, it's goofy but not funny. The movie is mostly about one of the bridesmaid falling down and feeling sorry for herself and even that wasn't done well. This isn't a terrible comedy but it's overrated for sure. Also felt the movie was way longer than it had to be.<br/><br/>5.6/10"

","The high expectations of Bridesmaids really lets it down. Don't get me wrong, the film is genuinely quite funny, but knowing when those funny bits are from the trailers and reviews just lessens their impact. It's almost as if you're thinking ""Ok I know I have to laugh in a minute"". <br/><br/>The characters are introduced well at the start and they make you more interested in the plot, but some of them disappear halfway through the film when they could be used a lot more; they're definitely needed. Chris O'Dowd is one of the best actors in the movie though the acting throughout is quite good for a comedy. <br/><br/>One other thing that makes the film slightly less powerful, is that the main character isn't really introduced very well at the start so you don't sympathise with her later on in the plot. <br/><br/>Altogether Bridesmaids is a good watch for anyone who likes comedy, just don't expect too much from it."
"Karl Self","Null","0","0","7 August 2011"," Rom-Com alert!
","My problem with this movie is that in my parts it was touted as a breakthrough female comedy, where women lead a raucous comedic existence of their own. Which is pretty far off the mark for a good but conventional rom-com (half romance, half comedy) that was designed to evoke chuckles, and the occasional tender sob, without offending anyone. Probably one positive aspect of the movie's hybrid nature is that it's never at risk of becoming the female version of ""The Hangover"", on the other hand the romance between wayward Anne and that Irish State Trooper is very bland and sickly. There is lots of comedic talent on board, but it's used very ineffectively. Indeed, the hilarious movie trailer consists mostly of scenes that never made it into the final cut -- why they wasted great scenes must remain the producers' filthy little secret."
"kbaker85","Null","0","0","20 July 2011"," It's a movie premise that's been used several times before
","Bridesmaids is another comedy about a woman with terribly low self-esteem mainly because she's over 30, not married and doesn't have a boyfriend. A man comes along, sweeps her off her feet and then she feels good about herself and her life. It's like 27 dresses, Baby Mama, He's Just Not That Into You, The Holiday, Bridget Jones's Diary, Valentine's Day, etc.. They use clichés and stereotypes of women's insecurities as comic material, which isn't always a bad thing. Some of them work well and are funny (eg. Bridget Jones's Diary) but others are cringe-inducing and not funny at all.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids was in the cringe-inducing category for me. I didn't find it funny; I just felt sorry for the main character. As the movie went on she became more and more depressed and as she became more depressed she dug herself deeper and deeper into a hole. The movie's premise is one that's just gotten well worn. Here's an idea: a movie about or including a female character who's over 30 and single but nevertheless loves her life, has high self-esteem and as a character is funny because she has attitude.

"D_Burke","9","3","8","6 June 2011"," Finally! A Female-Centric Wedding Comedy Done Right After So Long!
","""Bridesmaids"" is a huge breath of fresh air after the atrocious, forgettable messes of romantic comedies that were ""Bride Wars"" (2009) and ""You Again"" (2010) to name a few. After sitting through those movies, which despite their bad reviews were actually modest box office hits, I truly assumed the wedding movie was dead. Wedding movies of late were either overly- sentimental fluff that could be used as wedding planners' promotional videos, or uninspired slapstick comedy where attractive women pull mean pranks on one another.<br/><br/>""Bridesmaids"" is already being toted as an alternative wedding movie because it's co- produced by Judd Apatow, and has gross-out humor that decidedly appeals to guys. There is toilet humor in only one section of the movie, and it is funny, but it's not solely what makes the film great.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph are two of the funniest and most talented women to ever come out of ""Saturday Night Live"". I always thought they deserved the successful post-SNL careers that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are currently experiencing, and this movie may ensure they get it.<br/><br/>Wiig, as the star and the co-writer of this film, turns in a great, poignant performance here as Annie, a woman who is down on her luck in love and her career. She once owned a bake shop that closed due to the recession, and she's in a hapless, artificial relationship with a cad played by Jon Hamm.<br/><br/>Her best friend Lillian (Rudolph), on the other hand, is getting married and wants Annie to be her maid of honor. The trouble is, Annie is not quite as experienced in planning wedding festivities as another bridesmaid, Helen (Rose Byrne), who is a more recent friend of Lillian. Helen is quite a bit wealthier than Annie, and much more ostentatious and bombastic about her position in life, although more subtly.<br/><br/>It's really funny how Wiig plays up how enraged Annie is over Helen, and Helen is indeed a character who is easy to dislike. Many other Hollywood writers would have staged a big fight between the two bridesmaids involving throwing food and scratching. The problem with a scene like that is it's childish. You really wouldn't see women in their 30's acting such a way, unless perhaps they're on ""Bridezilla"".<br/><br/>More to the point though, the movie works because it really centers on how preparation for a happy event like a wedding can be really stressful on different involved parties for different reasons. Such planning also rekindles hard feelings in some people over where they are in life, and why they are not where they want to be. For that reason, you really empathize with Wiig in her performance. Fortunately, it also helps that her comic timing is spot on.<br/><br/>There are also great supporting performances all around. Melissa McCarthy (TV's ""Mike and Molly"") steals a lot of scenes with some gut-bustingly hilarious lines, not to mention a gross- out moment involving a bathroom sink. Chris O'Dowd also turns in a memorable performance as Officer Nathan Rhodes, and has many genuinely sweet moments alongside Wiig. The late Jill Clayburgh was the perfect casting choice for Annie's Mom, and has some great lines that keep the movie down to earth. It's hard to think of a better final performance on her part.<br/><br/>""Bridesmaids"" did occasionally fall victim to a few wedding movie clichés, such as one of the bridal party members getting cold feet the day of the wedding, and a big name musical act actually performing at the end of the film. However, there is so much this movie did correctly that many wedding comedies have done wrong, especially ""Brides Wars"".<br/><br/>I should note, however, that ""Bride Wars"" was also co-written by a female former SNL-cast member, Casey Wilson, so it's not entirely fair to rip on that movie. Plus, Wilson is a very talented performer who happened to be fired from SNL before she really got to shine. Considering how well Wiig has done on and outside of SNL, it probably wouldn't hurt for her to give Wilson some writing tips."

","World, meet Kristen Wiig. Kristen Wiig, meet world. This is one uncommonly hilarious actress delivering a performance (of a script that she co-wrote with Annie Mumolo) that should endear her to audiences from here to Jupiter. In Bridesmaids, she elevates an otherwise formulaic comedy to heights of unqualified enjoyability.<br/><br/>Wiig plays Annie, a failed baker who is slouching away behind the counter of a jewelry store and having occasional romps with a self-obsessed hunk (the ever-dashing Jon Hamm) who would sooner perform an underwater shark-flossing than commit to a relationship. She had hoped for more, but she has resigned herself to taking what she can get. She agrees to be the maid-of-honor in the wedding of her childhood bestie Lillian (played by Maya Rodulph), accepting all the rights, duties, and catty craziness implied therein. Her fellow bridesmaids make up a colorful assortment of amusing personalities. Not the least of these is Megan (played by the scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy) who suggests enthusiastically that the bridal shower be fight club themed. Annie is immediately upstaged by Helen (Rose Byrne), Lillian's sickly-sweet and effortlessly gorgeous friend from her fiancé's job. She's fashionable, rich, and endlessly capable of making Annie feel hopelessly inadequate.<br/><br/>The group embarks on a journey towards matrimony that is filled with that winning combination of raunchy gags and tenderness that has become synonymous with the Apatow brand (Judd Apatow, the writer and director of The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, worked as a producer on this film). Bridesmaids takes the Hollywood assumption that female characters in comedies must be sweet, supportive of, and secondary to their male counterparts and drops a deuce on it. Jokes about explosive diarrhea and projectile puking aren't just for the men anymore. Wiig and her fellow funny-women embrace the sorts of gross-out gags that would make the Farrely brothers blush and the results are side-splitting.<br/><br/>But the movie never loses sight of the relational heart at its core. Director Paul Feig cultivates a sensitive balance between situational antics and the emotional center of the story. In less attentive hands, McCarthy's Megan could have been nothing more than another punch-line but she is instead allowed unexpected depth. Wigg imbues Annie with an air of magnetic unselfconsciousness that makes her sympathetic as she struggles to overcome one failure after another. Her jerky relationship with a charmingly affable Irish cop (Chris O'Dowd) develops naturally and is thoroughly satisfying as a result. These are well drawn characters being played by more-than-capable actors.<br/><br/>Of these it is Wiig's star that shines brightest. Her comic energy combined with surprising dramatic chops result in a performance and a film that is irresistibly likable. Take your bow, Kristen Wiig, those cheers are for you."

""Bridesmaids"" is a film that meets this challenge head on and pulls it off admirably.<br/><br/>Annie (Kristen Wiig) is a down-on-her-luck 30 something who is barely scraping by after her bakery failed. Her lifelong best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), gets engaged and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Although honored she is chosen, Annie feels as if her life is on a rapid decline and Lillian's is on the path to success.<br/><br/>Determined to do the very best job at planning all of the pre-wedding activities she arrives at the engagement party and is introduced to the rest of the bridesmaids. She finds a rival ""Lillian best friend"" in Helen (Rose Byrne) and the no holds barred competition for Lillian's approval leads to laugh-out-loud antics and situations until Lillian disappears on the morning of the actual wedding day. Annie and Helen need to bury the hatchet to find Lillian and hopefully get Lillian ""to the church on time."" The remaining bridesmaids, Becca (Ellie Kemper), Rita (Wendy McLendon-Covey) and especially Megan (Melissa McCarthy) are all funny in their own right and without their contribution the film would not be as worthwhile. John Hamm, of ""Mad Men"" fame plays Ted, Annie's on again - mostly off again relationship.<br/><br/>The film works well and although there are some pretty silly scenes the overall experience is enjoyable and the whole audience seemed to enjoy as well.<br/><br/>I recommend this film."

The beginning of the movie was alright, but after about 10 minutes in, it already had me laughing pretty hard. It of course has a little bit of a romance thing going on, but it's tolerable. I don't want to give away any spoilers or anything so I'm not really going to give any specific parts, but the movie is absolutely hilarious. The advertisements had some funny things but I found that with most movies all the funny parts are the scenes from commercials, but this movie completely proved me wrong. It made me laugh so hard at points that I had tears coming out of my eyes but it was consistent throughout the whole movie. I thought this film was magnificent and it's worth the 10 to 11 bucks it costs for a movie ticket now a days. You have to see the movie for yourself because you'll understand what I'm saying. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Worth the money and time and you'll walk out of the movie theater thinking that was actually really funny!........SEE IT!"

","Bridesmaids will probably be the funniest movie this year. That is a huge statement.<br/><br/>Annie (Wiig) plays a character going through tough times. In fact, you would think it's a drama based on how depressed she is. But she is tasked with planning her best friend's (Rudolph) wedding. There, we meet the antagonist along with some of the other bridesmaids.<br/><br/>Melissa McCarthy was unbelievably hilarious in this movie. Every single scene she was in was funny. Some of the other bridesmaids were excellent like Rose Byrne and Ellie Kemper.<br/><br/>Every situation Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo (the co-writers) put the bridesmaids in allowed the women to do what they do best--be funny.<br/><br/>For people comparing this movie to the Hangover, they are completely different premises with a few similarities. But there is no doubt that the Hangover Part 2 will have to be extremely funny to top this one.<br/><br/>Kudos to Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy for making some of the most classic scenes that people will still be laughing to years from now."
"zetes","8","3","8","15 May 2011"," Hilarious
","Kristen Wiig stars and co-writes this Judd Apatow-produced film. It's billed as a raunchy, female-centric comedy, sort of a girly Hangover (which I'm sure was the original pitch), but it's far better than one might expect from that description. There's a real story here, with very well written characters. And, while it's absolutely hilarious when it wants to be, the pathos Wiig wants you to feel for the characters works. Wiig plays a hopeless woman in her mid-thirties. She has recently lost her bakery, as well as her boyfriend. The only attention she gets from men now is from a heartless prick (John Hamm) who just wants her as a friend with benefits. She's further hurt when her best friend (Maya Rudolph) announces that she's engaged.<br/><br/>Wiig is chosen as the maid of honor, but she finds that she's in direct competition with Rudolph's other close friend, Rose Byrne, who is wealthy and can provide Rudolph with a lot of things that Wiig (who works as a saleswoman in a jewelry store) could not. The other bridesmaids are played by Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911), Ellie Kemper (of The Office) and Melissa McCarthy (of Mike and Molly). Their pre-wedding adventures generally end with Wiig screwing everything up. Chris O'Dowd (of The IT Crowd) has a nice role as a police officer who gets involved with Wiig. Yeah, it's a predictable romance, but O'Dowd's character is well written and he's very funny and charming. The romance actually develops quite naturally. Jill Clayburgh's final role is as Wiig's goofy but understanding mother. McCarthy, a very large and confident woman, is probably the breakout performer of the film. Everything she says and does in the movie is a riot.<br/><br/>Wiig may be playing a character that she's played before on Saturday Night Live and in many of her film appearances, but it's still perfectly funny. And with the great writing backing the character, I'd say the performance is quite excellent. Byrne, who could easily have become a harpy, is given several small details that give us an insight into her character (most notably her two step-kids, who hate her). The film is almost cursed with too many great characters. McLendon-Covey and Kemper pretty much disappear at a certain point of the film, which is unfortunate. McLendon-Covey, in particular, is hilarious when describing her three foul-mouthed, chronically masturbating sons. There are also several non-speaking roles played by people comedy buffs will recognize, like Tim Heidecker (of Tim & Eric fame) as Rudolph's husband-to-be, Lynne Marie Stewart (who plays Charlie Day's mom on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) as Rudolph's mother, and Nancy Carell (née Walls, Stephen Carell's wife and former Daily Show correspondent) and Melanie Hutsell (whom I haven't seen since the mid-90s when she was on SNL) play Byrne's and Wiig's tennis partners in one great sequence.<br/><br/>About the only thing I didn't like in the film was John Hamm's role, which is far too two-dimensional compared to everyone else. He feels like he's in a much broader comedy (I think Wiig just wanted to share a goofy sex sequence with him; by the way, between this movie and MacGruber, Wiig is the queen of the awkward sex sequence). Director Paul Feig is best known as the creator of the classic dramedy series Freaks and Geeks, and he's directed for pretty much every great comedy series of the past decade and a half, including Arrested Development, 30 Rock, The Office and Parks & Recreation, so you should know you're in great hands there."

","I saw the trailer and previews of this movie and thought it might be kinda cute. My girlfriend FINALLY had a night off so I suggested we go see Bridesmaids so we did.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure how Kristen Wiig would do as a lead in a movie. I saw her in Whip It and she was very good in that movie (enjoyed that movie a lot too!) so I was hoping she could pull it off. Guess what? She did. The entire cast was very cool. Complimenting each other as far as what they brought to the group of friends.<br/><br/>But the scene stealer of the movie has to be Melissa McCarthy.

"bababear","5","4","13","14 May 2011"," An Earnest Try by Talented Amateurs
","This is a perfect example of a script that needed a couple more rewrites before they started to roll the cameras. There are several hilarious short sketches here: Annie's bizarre interaction with customers in the jewelry store where she briefly works, a group of young women becoming ill with food poisoning in an awesomely pretentious bridal boutique where they try on overpriced and awesomely hideous dresses, and a falling out between friends that disrupts a vulgarly overdone bridal shower. Plus, this should push the issue of making Casting a category at the Oscars: the young women are all delightful in their own ways, and casting Jill Clayburgh as Annie's mother is an act of genius.<br/><br/>The director should have watched some of the Marx Brothers movies, or those directed by Howard Hawks. They took off like racehorses and trusted the audience's intelligence to keep up. This needs at least thirty minutes cut out.<br/><br/>There seems to have been directed to be watched on TV. There are numerous spots where viewers could fold laundry, get a snack, go to the bathroom, whatever, and it's easy to see where the dead spots are coming. It's as if the director ran out of breath. And when you know when a pop song comes on the soundtrack the action is going to screech to a halt.<br/><br/>Also, this is proof of how unnecessary profanity is in films. At first there's the mild amusement, but too soon the ladies are turning the air blue: this has the unfortunate effect of making them sound as if they are women pushing forty who are still in the sixth grade.<br/><br/>Still, I'd recommend BRIDESMAIDS to anyone because the parts that do work are greatness. And the wedding dress the bride wears to the tastelessly overdone wedding- which she mentions to Annie in passing her father can't afford- is a hilarious sight gag, looking like canned whip cream which has been sprayed on the unfortunate bride and somehow turned to fabric. Bridesmaids' dresses are supposed to be hideous- it's traditional- but her outfit is something no woman would wear to a dog fight."

She constantly ruins movies.<br/><br/>The plot isn't very unique and creative and the movie is so very much predictable. I am seriously confused as to why the f**k this has such a high rating. This is one of the worst movies made of all time, it shouldn't have even been made, the retarded writers who wrote this garbage should get fired (if they already didn't).

And that's what it seemed to be - an amateur attempt at humour.<br/><br/>I'm the last person in the world to be thought straightlaced, but the constant use of asshole, bum, c*nt and the like doesn't of itself make a comedy.

"kevfannc","6","2","5","25 September 2011"," Good..not great
","All I've heard all year is ""Bridesmaids"" is THE comedy to see, and it has been compared to ""The Hangover"" as the female companion.<br/><br/>This is a good comedy with some laugh out loud moments, but it's not the female version of ""The Hangover"". It's not even in the same arena. ""Bridesmaids"" is the combination of ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", elements of ""The Hangover"", some of Wiig's past skits from SNL, and Judd Apatow's(producer) willingness to bring gross out humor and insert it at the right moments. <br/><br/>Kristen Wiig gives an admirable performance as Annie, a down-on-her- luck friend of Lillian (Maya Rudolph) who is asked to be her maid of honor. Having very little resources and her life quite disorganized (she lives with an English brother and sister who bathe together), she is quickly upstaged by Lillian's upper-class friend Helen (Rose Byrne). Most of the early comedy lies within the battle of whom is the ""true"" friend to Lillian.<br/><br/>After eating bad food at a restaurant suggested by Annie, it is decided within the group of bridesmaids that Vegas will be the bachelorette party, which we don't get to see. I can't decide if the film avoided this because of ""The Hangover"", but the way this film has been discussed and promoted through several blogs you would have thought that Vegas was definitely in the screenplay for at least a couple of scenes. Anyhow, because of what happens we get to see the very best of the film's saving grace, the throw down in your face humor of Melissa McCarthy. <br/><br/>The film then drags unnecessarily through Annie staring at her failed business, her indecision to keep sleeping with an acquaintance and then a local police officer. This is where while trying to be sweet, the film becomes somewhat disjointed in its definition. Is this an all out laugh fest with the bridesmaids or is it the story of Annie getting her life together? I might add that we don't GET all the bridesmaids for a lot of screen time together, and I can't think of why focusing on all 6 for some sort of comedic adventure couldn't have been a funnier film. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film's heart is in the right place as Annie struggles to remain in the wedding at all (after a meltdown) and her life falls, as her mother (played by Jill Clayburgh) would say, to the absolute bottom. Again, we have a film titled ""Bridesmaids"" but it turns into the story of Annie. Thank goodness again for Melissa McCarthy, who offers herself as Annie's new close friend and with some coaching Annie finally gets ""off the couch"". <br/><br/>I give this movie favorable marks mainly due to McCarthy and Wiig's performances.While most audiences will enjoy the gross humor and the satisfying end, some of us are left wondering what this movie could have been. This film will stand on its own as a type of female ""buddy"" comedy with a wedding as a welcome distraction."
"nickmesafilms","8","2","5","21 September 2011"," Bridesmaids (2011) - What a Raunchy Wedding Group!
","Judd Apatow and Kristen Wiig bring their hilarious minds to the test, and they have accomplished to make the first ever 'rated-R' chick flick comedy. ""Bridesmaids"" is an example of ""The Hangover"" with female actors, and it's what I would call it: ""Wedding Crashers"" meets ""Superbad"". Saturday Night Live's Kristen Wiig, plays her first feature film role, as Annie, a thirty-something who recently failed to make her bakery, is living in an apartment with lazy siblings, and has a sexual relationship with Jon Hamm. But anyways, her best friend Lillian, portrayed by Maya Rudolph, is getting engaged and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. Then, it afterward leads into hilarious situations, where Annie and bridesmaid Helen, portrayed by Rose Byrne, are jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian. So, the whole movie just talks about the misadventures of bridesmaids, until the big wedding day. ""Bridesmaids"" happens to be one of the best Judd Apatow comedies ever, and it sure has its moments. From an unexpected food poisoning, to Kristen Wiig drunk on an airplane, and some good old-fashioned raunchy humor. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo provided a well-written script filled with raunchiness, which is a good idea for a chick flick. The cast is so perfect, that I have to explain each one personally. Wiig and Rudolph have their most hilarious and touching moments in the film, Rose Byrne is a beautiful actress that portrayed the role perfectly, Jon Hamm was a little annoying, Chris O' Dowd makes clever optimism in his portrayal, but it's Melissa McCarthy that stole the entire show with such raunchy humor, and a performance filled with deserving laughs. Now, in mixed thoughts, the movie is such a long 2-hour comedy, the entire second act took to long to develop, and some characters were too annoying. But even though ""Bridesmaids"" is so long, and has hilarious material that makes people gag, it's worth watching this excellent comedy for the unique script, and clever cast. Seriously, watching this movie over and over, can still make you laugh every single time. ""Bridesmaids"", in my review, ""a hilarious, and deserving chick flick""."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","5","21 September 2011"," Proof that an all-women ensemble can deliver mainstream laughs
","To use a completely irrelevant but title-appropriate expression, when it comes to comedy, women tend to be the bridesmaids and never the bride. Prior to ""Bridesmaids,"" the only mainstream comedy driven by females that I can recall (at least in the Judd Apatow era) is Tina Fey's ""Baby Mama"" back in 2008. Comedies preceded by a ""romantic-"" given the nature of their intended demographic, don't count, at least not in the eyes of the general public. Fittingly produced by Apatow, ""Bridesmaids"" fights all these assumptions and historical tendencies better than you'd expect.<br/><br/>Star and writer Kristen Wiig and co-writer Annie Mumolo pick a fight with the biggest and most relentless rom-com formula at the party: the wedding story. It's not exactly the easiest way to challenge the general perspective on women-centered comedies, but if successfully avant-garde enough, has the greatest potential for turning the genre on its head a bit while still appealing to the women who still prefer to indulge in these repetitive story lines.<br/><br/>Some of ""Bridesmaids"" most effective marketing came from a critic who called it ""'The Hangover' for women."" The only things the two films have in common is that a wedding sets in the events in motion and they both expressed a desire to push R-rated boundaries. ""Bridesmaids"" has a much more traditional comedy structure and heavy doses of romance.<br/><br/>Annie (Wiig) has hit a mid-30s crisis: her dream of opening a bakery came true but got cut down thanks to the recession, she has a crappy living situation and she keeps going back to a guy (Jon Hamm) who's rich and good-looking but doesn't care about her. Her one rock has been her life-long best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). When Lillian gets engaged, Annie assumes the duty of Maid of Honor, but the tremendously pretty and rich Helen, another bridesmaid, seems intent to steal that out from under her, which pushes Annie over the edge.<br/><br/>The script puts a particular emphasis on developing Annie's character to the fullest, which hurts the comedic rhythm of the film a bit, but ultimately makes ""Bridesmaids"" a stronger film. The movie doesn't quite live up to being billed as hysterical with exception of a few boundary-pushing scenes and takes awhile to get going, but the emotional parts don't set off a chain reaction of eye-rolling, which alone puts ""Bridesmaids"" in a higher tier as far as rom-coms go. A montage scene toward the beginning when Annie bakes herself a singular ornate cupcake and then eats it for lack of a better idea drastically slows the film down, but might contain more intelligence in those two minutes than most romantic comedies can fit in two hours. <br/><br/>Most of the heart comes from a terrific and believable relationship between Annie and Lillian. Their scenes drag on a bit as these are two talented improvisers volleying the humor back and forth. They carry on like any two best girlfriends but with a touch only true comedians can offer. ""Bridesmaids"" mostly showcases Wiig's off-beat awkward humor. Annie comes across as a lady-like Larry David character, someone you pity to death and care about but who can be completely nuts and usually causes all her own problems by reacting poorly to adversity.<br/><br/>Outside of the cat-fighting between Annie and Helen, the rest of the bridesmaids get short- changed (another reason to separate this from ""The Hangover"") except for Melissa McCarthy as Megan, a character so multi-dimensional that you never know just what to expect from her. As much as this will feel like speaking poison, she could warrant her own spin-off.<br/><br/>""Bridesmaids"" doesn't break the mold and completely usurp female comedy conventions, but some of the film's best characteristics do offer proof that women can be funny in a mainstream way, at least when the characters receive thoughtful treatment. The R-rated gross-out humor could have backfired, but it was treated in such a way that it effectively enhanced the story and fit the characters, something most rom-coms that try similar tactics fail to achieve.<br/><br/>Hopefully Wiig keeps churning out films and can train some other hopeful lady comics to follow in her footsteps so that romantic comedies can truly be enjoyed by everyone again.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Check out my site, moviemusereviews.com!"

","Hailed as the female answer to crude comedies such as The Hangover and Knocked Up, the latest from Judd Apatow (here working as producer) doesn't quite reach those lofty heights. Star comedienne Kristen Wiig (getting her first lead role after a thriving run of supporting gigs in Paul, Whip It, Adventureland and Walk Hard) is marvellous as Annie, the worst Maid of Honour ever, and Melissa McCarthy and Australia's own Rose Byrne offer noteworthy support as the chick version of Allan (short fat guy from The Hangover) and the bitchy frenemy respectively. However, for every hilarious ""I can't believe they just did/said that moment"" there is a lengthy run of humourless scenes that stall the momentum. At 125 minutes Bridesmaids goes for way too long, and Maya Rudolph is achingly dull as the wife-to-be Lillian, but there are enough laugh-out-loud moments to ensure both sexes walk away with a grin on their face."

Annie and Helen's 'showdown' at the bridal shower was a well-scripted high spot, creating the momentum for the turnaround moment and an irony-rich happy-ever-after ending.<br/><br/>The characters really are not hugely different from Carrie Bradshaw and Co but well-rounded with everyone given good lines and comic moments. All the performances are outstanding except for Matt Lucas's cameo as Annie's house-mate; he's NOT given any good lines.

More funny laughs follow when the rivals play tennis and hit tennis balls at each other's breasts - hilarious. Bridal store digestion problems follow later on, then Kristen Wiig as Annie eats candied almonds - her facial expressions were to die for. Even the nervous woman on the plane, Annie Mumolo was terrific. Then Kristen Wiig can't hide her anger problems at work and has a really heated and funny exchange with a young teenage shopper. Of course Jill Clayburgh was irreplaceable. Then the ""I took two dogs they're in the back of my van (but Megan took 9)!"" moment was so funny.

"Hellmant","7","2","5","19 May 2011"," 'Dick and Fart Jokes' Chick Flick Style!
","'BRIDESMAIDS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Judd Apatow tries his style of raunchy yet emotional comedy/drama with a chick flick by producing this Kristen Wiig vehicle (an 'SNL' and supporting film player vet). Wiig stars in the film as well as co-wrote it with comedian Annie Mumolo. Apatow's buddy Paul Feig (who created the popular short run TV series 'FREAKS AND GEEKS', which Apatow also produced) directed the film. It co-stars Maya Rudolph (a fellow 'SNL' vet), Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Ellie Kemper, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Chris O'Dowd. The film tells the story of a woman going through a midlife crisis at the same time that her best friend is getting married. Most of the film's big laughs come from the type of vulgar and crude humor you usually only see in guy movies, which is a nice change of pace and ballsy. The film isn't quite as consistently hilarious as Apatow's best films but for the most part it works and it does have the touching emotional aspect that Apatow films are known for as well (which it actually does a better job of delivering).<br/><br/>Wiig plays Annie, a down on her luck jewelery store clerk who had recently attempted to follow her dreams and open a bakery. Despite Annie's great cooking talents the bakery failed due to the recession (she says). She's also had a lot of poor luck with men and is constantly treated like merely a f--- buddy by the pretty boy she wishes was her boyfriend (Jon Hamm). When her best friend Lillian (Rudolph) tells her she's getting married and asks her to be her maid of honor she falls deeper into depression and despair. Things are complicated further when a rivalry grows for Lillian's affection between Annie and Lillian's new good friend Helen (Byrne, looking more stunning than ever), who's also the rich beautiful wife of Lillian's fiancé's boss.<br/><br/>The movie has plenty of hilarious moments, including some of the raunchiest and most vulgar dick and fart jokes of any comedy recently, but at times the jokes tend to stretch on too much and lose a lot of their momentum. The movie is way too long for a slapstick romantic comedy (at a whopping 2 hours and 5 minutes!) and some of the vulgar jokes are almost too grotesque to even sit through (at least for me, I had an extremely hard time stomaching this movie). When it is funny it works though and Wiig is very impressive in the lead. The rest of the cast is more than adequate as well (especially Byrne, McCarthy and O'Dowd). The emotional drama of the film is surprisingly what works best about it, it really feels true and heartfelt (especially the relationship between Annie and a friendly police officer (O'Dowd). While the movie isn't quite as good as Apatow's best it's still an impressive achievement and hopefully will help pave the way for more female driven crude comedies to set new ground in the future.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj550csrEQk"
"tavm","8","2","5","19 May 2011"," Bridesmaids was a nice showcase for Kristen Wiig who co-wrote this
","Just watched this hilarious and touching comedy with my movie theatre-working friend which stars current SNLer Kristen Wiig today. She also co-wrote and co-produced it. She plays Annie, a failed bakery chef who currently works at a jewelry shop whose best friend-played by her former SNL castmate Maya Rudolph-is getting married. This friend is now chums with someone in her new circle who has a little friction with Annie. I'll just stop there and just say that any comparisons with The Hangover are fine as there are some gross-out humor that can be both funny and maybe a little too much for some tastes. Still, the characterizations and relationships between are real enough that one does care for them. And besides Wiig and Rudolph, there's plenty of funny stuff from the supporting cast with the likes of Ellie Kemper of ""The Office"", Melissa McCarthy currently of ""Mike & Molly"", and Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"" as a jerk of a boyfriend of Annie. In addition, a couple of former SNLers in Nancy Walls (Mrs. Steve Carell) and Melanie Hutsell also appear in a screamingly funny tennis match (though I only recognized the latter in the movie). So on that note, I highly recommend Bridesmaids. P.S. There's an appearance by the Maya character's favorite group that was a nice surprise especially with the song they sang. And this was the late Jill Clayburgh's last film role as Annie's mother. Incidentally, she hosted SNL twice during the '70s."

A lot of scenes don't work. Not a great movie. Final scene was nice. Melissa McCarty is funny. Chris O'Dowd is good. Sad to see the late Jill Clayburgh in her final role.

"med77_99","7","2","5","17 May 2011"," A cute Comedy movie that could have been a little a better
","Let me start by saying that I adore Rose Byrne, I just think she has grown into a really talented actress, and in Bridesmaid here, she played her role to perfection. I loved her in the Horror movie Insidious released just few months ago, and always been a fan in Damages.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids tells the story of Annie, a single middle aged woman struggling with her own life when her best friend Lillian gets engaged and assigns Annie as her maid of honor. Worried about losing her best friend and pressured by leading the bridesmaid, things start to spiral out of control. And to make things worse, she has to compete with Lillian's new friend, the rich and always competitive Helen ( played by none other than Rose Byrne ) who seems to be trying to steal Lillian's friendship. <br/><br/>The movie has plenty of laugh out loud moments, very hilarious, funny and at times disgusting scenes. It came out as a real fresh Comedy that I enjoyed most parts of. The characters were lovable, funny and interesting to follow, and the actresses playing them were very good. The problem I found with Bridesmaid was in the editing, it seems it was done in a rush and so appeared choppy and inappropriate. For example, in an early scene when Annie was making a speech, she was holding a wine glass, and in that same scene, the glass is quickly shifted from the right hand to the left hand then back to the right hand. And there were many other editing problems I noticed that I won't go through here, but it was obvious. Also I thought some scenes were a bit ridiculous and too long. The whole movie running time was a bit too long for me as they could have easily cut some unnecessary scenes.<br/><br/>In summary, a pretty decent and fresh Comedy with laugh out loud moments and funny characters that falls just short from being great with some ridiculous scenes, it drags a bit and was a bit too long in my opinion."

","It's clear ""Bridesmaids"" got greenlit as ""'The Hangover' for chicks,"" but to condemn it as such would be a disservice. The latest Judd Apatow Family Production is a savvy, character-driven comedy worthy of commendation in its own right. SNL's Kristen Wiig stars, having co-wrote the screenplay with actress Annie Mumolo. In a culture with great reverence for the pomp and circumstance of marriage, the pair dispenses a generous allocation of banana peels along the length of the aisle.<br/><br/>It may not make for the most intellectual humor, but ""Bridesmaids"" thrives on broad comedy by way of endearing characters and vibrant performances. Wiig plays Annie, the broke proprietor of a failed bakery whose best friend (Maya Rudolph) is engaged. Named maid of honor at the upcoming wedding, Annie is soon overwhelmed with all the inherited responsibility. She spars with bitchy perfectionist Helen (Rose Byrne) over bridal shower themes, bachelorette party locales, and naturally, bridesmaid dresses.<br/><br/>Though the cast is rounded out by Wendi McLendon-Covey of ""Reno 911"" fame and Ellie Kemper from the American ""Office,"" the real standout is ""Gilmore Girls'"" Melissa McCarthy as Megan, the 180-degree antithesis of class. Heavyset, hilarious, and not the least bit demure, she easily walks away with the movie. Whether she's accusing a seatmate of being an air marshal incognito, or bent over a sink in a compromising situation, the funniest moments in ""Bridesmaids"" are almost exclusively hers.<br/><br/>Not that ""Bridesmaids"" has any shortage of funny moments. Some scenarios work better than others however, and at two plus hours, it's hard not to notice where it could use a trim. For all the positives Apatow doubtless brings to the production, he is a poor role model when it comes to maintaining an appropriate run time. Director Paul Feig is more directly to blame for not axing the most superfluous and least funny bits; Annie's portly English roommates spring to mind as characters whose absence might make the film leaner in more ways than one.<br/><br/>The lack of focus keeps ""Bridesmaids"" from achieving real staying power. Subplots like Annie's relationship with an Irish cop (Chris O'Dowd) — amusing though they may be —consume too great a slice of our time, and dilute what makes the simple premise so strong. Feig and Wiig are firing on all cylinders during the ensemble scenes, and I'm confident a better 90-minute cut exists somewhere in the folds of this wedding comedy, which has as many frills and puffs as even the gaudiest bride to be.<br/><br/>""Bridesmaids"" may not be one to have and to hold until death do you part, but it's still a saucy affair. Wiig plays a lovable loser and surrounds herself with some seriously funny ladies. Their performances alone carry most scenes. Coupled with a refreshing refusal to cater exclusively to the sense of humor of teenage boys, the film suffers only in setting itself too high a standard and failing to continually exceed it.<br/><br/>Though the output is sadly less than the sum of its parts, there is enough great, boisterous energy on hand to make ""Bridesmaids"" worth checking out, gender regardless. It's leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to personality, and its savvy, character-driven comedy could actually teach a thing of two to those clowns behind the ""'Bridesmaids' for bros."""
"EUyeshima","8","2","5","16 May 2011"," Wiig and Company Deliver Honest Laughs in a Freewheeling, Character-Driven Farce
","What I appreciate most about Kristen Wiig's comedy style on SNL is her refusal to pander to an audience. Portraying her gallery of solipsistic eccentrics week after week, she's never afraid to be unsympathetic because she exposes a truth that is smart and funny. Translating her gift to the big screen proves to be surprisingly fortuitous with her breakout 2011 comedy, which has already been dubbed the distaff version of the alpha-male mega-hit, 2009's ""The Hangover"". They share an ensemble approach, a sometimes raunchy sense of humor, and the context of an upcoming wedding but little else. What you won't mistake this movie for is one of those dreary rom-coms starring invariably Katherine Heigl, Kate Hudson, or Jennifer Aniston.<br/><br/>Co-written by Wiig and fellow Groundlings alumnus Annie Mumolo and breezily directed by Paul Feig (""The Office""), this is a sharp, character-driven farce freed from chick-flick predictability and showing the unmistakable fingerprints of co-producer Judd Apatow all over it. The plot centers on thirtysomething Annie Walker who is not in the best place in her life. Deep into debt after losing the cake shop she owned with a boyfriend who subsequently abandoned her, she is already a bit unstrung when her childhood best friend Lillian gets engaged. She names Annie her maid of honor, but there's competition for the coveted role from Lillian's new bestie, the wealthy and pretentious Helen. Much of the storyline focuses on the tension between Annie and Helen over Lillian's preferential attention until the wedding day. Within this context, much of the humor comes from the preposterous excesses that come from the ""wedding industrial complex"" with Helen obviously having the resources to fund them including a ludicrously over-the-top Paris-themed shower.<br/><br/>Along for the ride are the three other bridesmaids - Lillian's cousin Rita, a sex-starved mother of three; Becca, a newlywed who pities Annie for her single state; and Megan, the groom's unfiltered, adventure-seeking sister. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan (the diuretic bridal shop scene is a hoot), and the shenanigans are underlined by the obvious rift occurring between two best friends when one moves on with her life. Beyond her comedy set pieces (e.g., her increasingly hilarious efforts in attempting to get a traffic citation), Wiig turns out to be a resourceful actress as Annie and dials back her trademark neurotic lunacy just enough to make Annie's dilemmas humanly relatable. As Lillian, SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph (""Away We Go"") has less to do but does it with warmth and wit. Rose Byrne, who showed deft comic chops in ""Get Him to the Greek"", captures the haughtiness and insecurity in Helen with élan.<br/><br/>However, stealing scenes with sheer abandon is a makeup-free Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan with such balls-to-the-wall force that it's hard not to respond to her uncompromised honesty. Her character is arguably the most mentally stable of the bunch. Wendy McLendon-Covey (""Reno 911"") and Ellie Kemper (""The Office"") have their moments as sarcastic Rita and naive Becca, but they aren't given much screen time to flesh out their funnier bits. Jon Hamm (""Mad Men"") really nails the blistering albeit charming indifference that his character Ted shows toward Annie's romantic longings, while Irish actor Chris O'Dowd proves likeably puppyish as her burgeoning love interest, a traffic cop constantly reprimanding her for not fixing her brake lights. In her final film appearance, the wonderful Jill Clayburgh is sweetly amusing as Annie's whimsically off-kilter mother. It all runs a bit too long at 125 minutes with the resolutions a bit pat, but still, this is one of the funniest movies of the year."

","You know what makes a movie like this so good? It is that the movie is funny. Not funny in a ha ha, that was good way but you look at the person next to you and you are both equally shocked at how good the movie really is. Do the actors do their job? is the script funny? is the direction good? The answer to all of these questions is yes.<br/><br/>We have seen over the last 10 or so years some really funny movies, and all of them feature women as secondary characters who might be a little funny but the focus is never on them for too long. Here the movie takes what could be another piece of garbage about girls doing the things they do before they get married and elevates it to a level of greatness that only the best of comedies can achieve.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig wrote and stars as Annie, a down on her luck 30-something woman in Milwaukee, WI who is looking for stability after her bakery shut down. She has a job she hates working at a jewelery store selling wedding rings to people in love. She lives with the most vile brother and sister possibly ever and her best friend who she has known from childhood Lillian is getting married in Chicago to a rich guy with a great job. Lillian is still the same great friend that she has always been and no matter how much money or influence her new social circle affords her it doesn't change how she treats Annie and that is commendable and a nice change.<br/><br/>The movie is great, it isn't afraid to be dirty and raunchy and it loves the weird stuff that the women all do. It makes the women here equals with anything you might see in other Judd Apatow/frat pack movies and it gets the tone right. It could be done wrong on so many levels but it doesn't go for the cheap way out and it makes the movie fun and inventive and very good.<br/><br/>Cons: It is too damned long, I don't know why this is the case with all Apatow movies her either directs or produces but damn, cut it down please. The subplots are a bit much in a couple of places and could be tightened up but this is a minor flaw in comparison.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, it will make you laugh and it will do it often. Great flick!"
"sabretooth91","7","2","5","16 May 2011"," It was OK, it wasn't THAT good
","I want to start off by saying this is a good movie and I would recommend it to others. I just read all of these glowing reviews and I must have had some really high expectations. I wasn't blown away like all of these other people were. I saw it with my girlfriend. We both laughed and had a great time. After it was over, we moved on though. We weren't quoting the movie or talking about it for hours.<br/><br/>The character development was great. I enjoyed the originality of the jokes and situations the characters were placed in. For the most part, it wasn't stupidly predictable, although there were parts where I knew what would happen later in the movie.<br/><br/>This is a fun, witty comedy. I think it was geared toward the female audience. (I'm male) While I did get some really good laughs, I could tell some jokes were just not meant for me. I just sat there, rolling my eyes, like I was sitting at some sort of girl slumber party that I wasn't invited to. The older, female audience was practically wetting its pants, however. Maybe they're just not used to the crude, in-your-face humor, reminiscent of so many ""guy"" movies just like this.<br/><br/>There were some scenes that went wayyy too long. OK, I get it, it is an awkward moment, lets move on..... There's no reason to waste 10 minutes of a movie to stress how awkward a moment is. And of course, there HAD to be a musical moment where everyone breaks into song and dance together, as if they all got together the day before and rehearsed. This single moment turned this movie into a ""chick-flick"" for me, sorry.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, the acting was great! My favorite character/actress was the groom's sister! By far! Kudos! Sorry, I don't know anyone's real name. Seriously, its far too much to keep track of.<br/><br/>If you're a female, go see this movie. If you're a guy who wants to see a movie with a girl, you could do much much worse than Bridesmaids. I did enjoy myself, and left with a smile on my face. The completely packed theater was justified. I just didn't think it was quite as good as the other reviews are saying. I was expecting to see a movie that we'll be watching and re-watching for years, judging by what others said. If my girlfriend gets it on Blue-ray, and its a rainy day outside, I'd gladly watch it with her again. I just won't go out of my way.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I'd recommend this movie. I think most people should see it, and you can judge for yourself what you think of it. I don't want to scare anyone away because it was good. Just not THAT good (in my opinion)."
"jboothmillard","8","2","6","9 July 2011"," Bridesmaids
","I saw the trailer for this film on TV and in the cinema, I didn't think much of it, I thought it would be rated terribly, but I was surprised to see it rated five stars out of five by critics, so I had to know if it was deserved. Basically single mid-thirties woman Annie (Golden Globe nominated Kristen Wiig, also writing) who lives in Milwaukee had her bakery business fail, losing her boyfriend and savings, and is now selling engagement rings at a jewellers. Her Mother (Jill Clayburgh) asks her to come home, but she sticks with renting a bedroom from English siblings Gil (Matt Lucas) and Brynn (Rebel Wilson), having a sexual relationship with self-absorbed Ted (Jon Hamm), and being best friends with Lillian (Grown Ups' Maya Rudolph). Lillian becomes engaged a wealthy Chicago banker, and she wants Annie to be her maid of honour, and at the engagement party she meets her fellow bridesmaids, cynical cousin Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), optimistic friend Becca (Ellie Kemper), overweight raunchy future sister-in-law Megan (Oscar, BAFTA nominated Melissa McCarthy) and Helen (Rose Byrne), the beautiful but vain husband to the groom's boss. It is obvious that Annie does immediately like Helen, she is jealous of her friendship to Lillian and hates that she is so perfect and snooty, and as they get to know each other this irritation grows. All the bridesmaids go to a Brazilian restaurant, and while Lillian is gone they discuss ideas for the hen party, Paris is suggested by Annie, but Helen talks everyone out of it. Next thing you see is everyone, but Helen who does not eat meat, gaining food poisoning and becoming ill, needing to be sick or use the bathroom desperately, while at the bridal gown studio. Annie does suggest the beach house, but Helen being the big influence drags them all to Las Vegas, but Annie being afraid of flying causes them all to be thrown off the plane after taking sedatives and alcohol. With this Lillian appoints Helen to make all the plans for the shower and wedding, and the only comfort Annie can get is continuing her recent relationship with friendly Irish traffic cop Officer Nathan Rhodes (The IT Crowd's Chris O'Dowd). This though also goes to ruins after she is offended by him about opening her bakery again, she is told by Gil and Brynn to move out, and she goes to live with her Mother, but she still turns up for the bridal shower in Chicago. Annie finally goes bonkers when she finds out Helen is planning to have a trip to Paris, which she originally suggested, she rants and raves about her opinions of the up-herself new friend of Lillian's, and she is told not to come to the wedding. With Nathan ignoring her, and officially breaking any contact with Ted, Annie spends her time doing nothing much but watching television, but Megan comes to find her and help her stop feeling miserable for herself. After baking an apology cake for Nathan, which he appears not to eat, Helen also comes to find Annie, because Lillian has gone missing, and eventually they get the help of Nathan to help find her. Lillian consoles in Annie that Helen does indeed take over pretty much everything, but Annie helps her come round, the bride and groom do get married in an evening with neon lights and fireworks, and an appearance by Wilson Phillips, Annie and Helen put their differences aside, and Nathan comes for Annie saying that he did eat her cake and they make up. Also starring Franklyn Ajaye as Lillian's Dad, Michael Hitchcock as Don Cholodecki, Jessica St. Clair as Whitney and Terry Crews as Boot Camp Instructor. Wiig is really good as the one suffering and enjoying through all the situations, Byrne does really convince that she is an irritating woman who is so nice and can get practically anything, Rudolph makes a nice bride-to-be, McCarthy gets many great moments being the swearing, fat and over the top weirdo, and the other supporting cast members do well also. Wiig has created a very witty script which is not only very funny in many moments, but it is also quite a touching story with the romantic element, and some drama included, they were calling it the female equivalent of The Hangover, I can sort of see what they mean, a great comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!"

","As a British guy I am glad to report that this 'chick-flick' made me laugh out loud several times in the normally reserved arena that is the London film circuit. Understated performances by the ensemble cast really bring out the humour and largely avoid the in-your-face obvious gags which can be a let down to a sophisticated audience. Not that this film is without elements of quite medieval grossness, but these are played straight which actually adds to the comedic element and furthermore they do not dominate the film. Wisely they have avoided stereotyping the characters and you actually come to care for them warts and all, this has the added bonus of sustaining interest during the 'serious' moments also. Bridesmaids has a multi layered comedic approach which will appeal on many levels. There are a few weak scenes but these are more than compensated for by the overall work. In conclusion this film manages to wrap up a meditation on the nature of friendship and love whilst ladling out the laughs, go see!"

Previous reviews I have read raved about it, dubbing it as the female Hangover, so I am very happy that it was as good as I had hoped it would be.<br/><br/>The characters were all brilliant, the script was entertaining and best of all this film proved that girls can be just as bad as boys. Not only this, but actress Melissa McCarthy also deserves credit for her fantastic role as Megan, who will have you in stitches with her brilliantly funny mishaps and disasters during the film.

"pturner1010","8","2","6","16 June 2011"," Women being very funny, very sweet and very rude! You got to love it!
","Synopsis: Down-on-her-luck Annie becomes maid of honour for her best friend Lillian's wedding. Fighting and bonding with the other bridesmaids, Annie attempts to deliver the best wedding she can.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig is officially a comedy Goddess. The co-writer and star of Bridesmaids takes centre stage after years on American television's Saturday Night Live and being sidelined with smaller roles in recent comedies like Paul and Date Night. Here she is barely off screen and is a hysterical joy to watch throughout. Funnier than the entire cast of The Hangover (either of them), she would be enough to single-handedly split your sides, but with an ensemble this brave and funny and writing this hilarious, Bridesmaids is a laugh-out-loud comedy that deserves to rule this summer. The sisters are doing it for themselves!<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is very rude, occasionally very sweet and often ass-clenchingly awkward. If you think gross-out comedy belongs to boys, wait till you see these girls at their dress fitting. If you think men being mean to women is funny, wait till you see it as written by a couple of women. If you think the writer/producers of films like The Hangover push the boundaries of taste, wait till you see these girls get angry. But most of all if for some reason you think women, can't be funny, give yourself a slap and go see this film!<br/><br/>The story might follow a fairly conventional path with the romantic-comedy trimmings resulting in an ending that lacks much surprise. However the narrative is tightly constructed and Annie really 'hits bottom' (allowing for countless awkward and self-deprecating moments) before the film delivers its predictable resolution. The script is brilliantly written with a touching and believable relationship between the two best friends, Annie and Lillian. The comic set-pieces escalate in a consistently hysterical fashion, standouts being the dress fitting and a plane journey that allows Wiig to show off what a gifted comedy performer she is. The script crackles with witty and memorable dialogue, much of it delivered by Wiig, but the supporting cast all get their own moments to shine as realistic and funny characters.<br/><br/>The best reason to see this film is Wiig. There is nothing she won't do in this film for a laugh. Whether it's flailing her legs in the air in the opening sex scene, toilet humour, acting drunk, selfishly ruining parties, or swearing at a young woman, all vanity is left behind. Wiig's performance is consistently hilarious. As writer she has rightly put herself up-front, giving her a vehicle to finally show off her comedic prowess. The supporting cast are excellent with particular standouts being Melissa McCarthy as Megan (in another unflinchingly funny/awkward performance) and Chris O'Dowd as a sweet cop. However despite the presence of a couple of male British TV stars (O'Dowd and Matt Lucas), the women get all the best lines and even Matt Lucas is totally outshone by his look-a-like 'sister' in the film. All give solid, believable and occasionally completely over the top performances, but they are anchored by a sweet script that (like so many other Judd Apatow produced/directed movies) isn't afraid to poke and prod at the state of people trapped in unhappy marriages.<br/><br/>Paul Feig directs effectively, drawing riotous performances from the cast and keeping the pace brusque throughout. Like many recent comedies that are produced, directed or executive produced by Apatow, the film is over two hours, but unlike some others, Bridesmaids does not drag or sag after the half way mark and its story feels full and not overburdened by an abundance of improvisation.<br/><br/>The film is a sweet look at female friendships, the madness that surrounds wedding preparation and could be seen to deal with the pressures put on modern women to conform, succeed (in both love and career) and above all get married! Wiig's lovable loser clearly does not have enough respect for herself and the audience will find themselves rooting for her to make big changes in her life. However Bridesmaids is a comedy; there's no message of self-empowerment and marriage and heterosexual romance are still held as the aspiration for modern women.<br/><br/>Aside from the overly familiar romantic comedy elements the film should be enjoyed for the hilarious script and the performance of a brilliant ensemble of very funny, very entertaining women. It is hugely refreshing to see a film with female performers totally lacking in vanity that is this rude, this vulgar and this amusing. Written by women, starring mostly women but aimed squarely at both men and women, Bridesmaids deserves to be a huge comedy hit."

But, this movie was a breath of fresh air! Bridesmaids was jam packed full of sight gags and slap stick comedy! Almost every line was joke and it kept you laughing right through to the end.<br/><br/>Usually in every movie you have an actor that either doesn't fit their part or they just plain suck. The casting director for this movie has done their job and done it well! I didn't notice a single actor that didn't fit their part.

","First lets get this out of the way...this isn't some lezbo, ""chick flick"" meant to be a response to ""The Hangover Part II"", as some moronic comments and reviews seem to imply! Actually, ""Bridesmaids"" works an all levels and succeeds where ""The Hangover Part II"" fails to. Whereas ""Bridesmaids"" delivers a funny script, a great story, a fabulous cast, ""The Hangover Part II"" feels forced, shallow and stilted.<br/><br/>Kristin Wiig is great and did a fantastic job both in her role and as the writer of the movie. It soo good to see female comics and writers score a success for a change, to shut all critics up who for some insane reason think that women cannot write or direct ""raunchy"" comedies!!! Ever since ""Away We Go"", Maya Rudolph has been a revelation (not that she wasn't impressive before). I want to see more of her in movies, but good smart ones, like ""Bridesmaids"", not some crappy run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Then there is Rose Byrne...I have a soft spot for her and I have loved her in ""Damages"", great acting, just like in ""Adam"" and ""Get Him To The Greek"" and now ""X-Men: First Class"". Besides being talented and smart there is a smouldering sensuality and sexuality just below the surface if you look carefully and really take her in...ahem OK this is supposed to be a review not a Danielle Steele novel!

","I had heard rave reviews about this film, and was genuinely excited to see it. The trailers were great, and the premise seemed to be very funny; the anti-chick-flick, but done in a way that both sexes could enjoy. <br/><br/>It was NOT, however, the film that the trailers made it out to be-- which is to say, 'The Hangover', except with a female cast. You know; a motley crew of misfit bridesmaids get increasingly deeper into raunchy and improbable situations, and hilarity ensues. <br/><br/>While these were some of the elements, it's NOT what the film was about at all. This most definitely IS a chick flick, no two ways about it. So don't go into the film expecting anything else. The plot is firmly grounded in well-trodden chick territory (bitchy and undermining BFFs, nice guy vs. bad boy, picking a wedding dress, female depression and self-sabotage, etc.)... its all there, and a far more prominent part of the movie than the heavily-advertised slapstick elements. <br/><br/>Now, with that having been said, it is still a damn funny movie. There were a ton of truly hilarious scenes, and really well developed and relatable characters. It's not entirely the film that the trailers want you to think it is, but worthwhile nonetheless. <br/><br/>Instead of 'The Hangover' with women, a more apt comparison might be 'Mean Girls' with grownups... of some combination of the two. Which really isn't a bad thing at all."

It works brilliantly. This is a very funny movie. The scene with the food poisoning in the bridal shop had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe.<br/><br/>While effectively incorporating crude humor, the film is also a touching look at how relationships evolve as we grow and mature. The friendship between the two main characters was very believable, and I am sure most people will identify with the feelings and conflicts experienced by the two.<br/><br/>I don't want to review Bridesmaids in great detail, just to give it two thumbs up and recommend you see it.

"seaview1","8","2","6","6 June 2011"," A BRIDESMAIDS To Celebrate
","TV's Saturday Night Live has long been a proving ground for some of the top comedians who have often gone on to greater fame. Witness John Belushi (Animal House), Eddie Murphy (Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places), Bill Murray (Ghostbusters, Stripes), Will Ferrell (Anchorman), and Tina Fey (30 Rock) among many. Certainly a few have failed in films like Deuce Bigelow, The Ladies Man, and MacGruber. Current female SNL player, Kristen Wiig, joins the ranks of the former with Bridesmaids, an occasionally gross, yet heartfelt tale of self worth and ultimately love. After numerous supporting roles in popular films like Adventureland and Whip It, she has made the big leap into stardom, and she co-wrote the screenplay too! Annie (Wiig) is an insecure, single woman working a miserable job at a jewelry store and whose love life consists of impersonal sexual romps with a narcissistic playboy (Jon Hamm). Her dreams of a bakery having failed recently, she has horrible roommates and a doting mother (Jill Clayburgh) nearby. When her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and asks her to be her bridesmaid, Annie prepares the female bridal party for gowns, showers, and the reception. When Lillian's wealthy, 'perfect' friend, Helen (Rose Byrne), elbows her way for attention and begins to take over the wedding preparations, Annie becomes jealous and overdoes things in a display of one-upsmanship (or rather womanship). In a series of confrontational events, Annie sinks further into verbal ineptitude and embarrassment in front of her best friend. Along the way she gets pulled over by an Irish cop, Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who takes a fancy to her; what puzzles her is why any man would be nice to her? It all culminates at a pre-wedding reception where Annie unleashes her anger and frustration. Things get worse for her at work and her apartment, and as her world comes crashing down and she becomes an outsider to her best friend's wedding, Annie's fate takes a dramatic turn amid friendship and love.<br/><br/>Audiences have been well aware of Wiig's physical and whimsical skills as a skit comedienne. What this film does is show an entirely different spectrum of her abilities as an actress and writer (with Annie Mumolo directed by Paul Feig). By playing a sympathetic character with flaws and yearnings and surrounding herself with a roster of talented actresses, Wiig has positioned herself as an every woman who has had life's ups and downs, but mostly downs and creating such pathos that the payoff at the end is more satisfying. The scenes between Wiig and O'Dowd, who make a terrific couple, are genuine and really hold the story on a firm emotional footing. As one of Lillian's friends, Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly) steals every scene she is in and provides the film with some of its funniest moments in support. Even Byrne shines as the manipulative, scheming friend while Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey round out the wedding party. As Annie's mom, Clayburgh performs a sweet, final career note; this was her last film. Jon Hamm is only in a few scenes but is quite effective as a chauvinist jerk.<br/><br/>There are numerous funny moments. A toast to Lillian and her fiancé by Annie and Helen develops into dueling testimonials that become silly and outrageous. When Annie gets stopped by a policeman, she displays her talent for physical comedy in conducting a drunk test. A scene where she sits at her mom's home alone watching a video of Castaway's scene of Tom Hanks losing his 'best friend' Wilson is a hoot. On the plane when Annie mixes prescription medication and alcohol, she becomes obnoxiously and amusingly uninhibited, and there is a running gag with McCarthy who thinks her seat companion is really an air marshal. Bridesmaids a film that is honest and direct about its subject matter and its consenting adults, and it has moments that are crude such as the food poisoning scene at the wedding boutique and some sexual gymnastics between Wiig and Hamm.<br/><br/>The film is a bit uneven in places but when it hits the right notes especially towards the end, when a major character like Annie undergoes a transformation, it feels genuine and at times heartfelt, and we are the beneficiaries of something more than a pedestrian comedy. When her relationship with Lillian is threatened, Annie reacts in exaggerated, desperate behavior. She even has trouble accepting true intimacy from a good man because she has never been treated so nice. It's really about Annie being able to connect in a meaningful way with another human being. In fact, Annie's plight and desperation shares its DNA with Bridget Jones's Diary.<br/><br/>With its predominantly female cast, this Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up) co-produced film delivers the laughs with feeling. Don't think of this as just a 'chick flick' but rather an entertaining, contemporary comedy that contains just a bit more estrogen. And do stay for the closing credits if you want a bit of raunchy fun."

","Kristen Wiig, you deserve and Oscar, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks that. Maya Rudolph, you shat in the middle of a busy street. That takes some serious balls. In general I really liked this movie, and that ""like"" would be love were it not for the fact it sometimes dragged and let the air out. Could have been a crisp 90-100 min film, but for some reason that's verboten nowadays unless you're a small indie. Judd Apatow, I blame you. You're clearly great at what you do but you make us sit though epic comedies and it does the films a disservice. Overall though, I laughed, I felt for the main character, and I thought the film was surprisingly soulful. A generous 8/10."

","I admit, I only went to see this film because of Kristin Wiig and Maya Rudolph. I'm a HUGE SNL fan. But after watching the movie, I really enjoyed it. It wasn't overly funny because they managed to balance the film out with a serious tone. I thought that Kristin and Maya compliment each other's comedic talents perfectly. I loved how it was witty funny. The improvisation brought the film together. I also really liked the message and the focus of the film. That friends always stick together no matter where in life they are, a true friend is always there for you. So if you have a best friend go take them to see it! I also loved how it's not just a chick movie. I saw a couple fellas in the theatre (not with any girls!) and they were laughing just as much as we were. Its classic slapstick comedy done right. I would definitely watch it again."

","Starting the first scene right off into the a vulgar mood, Bridesmaids proves to be more than just another hilarious comedy: it becomes an actual story. Sleeping buddies, best friends that more than understand each other, and competing rivals for the direction of an important wedding are only the beginning of the aspects that this film offers in a swell manner. With dark, dirty humor filling every scene, there is no way not to say that this film helps heighten the mood of anyone. As her best friend gets engaged, Annie is appointed as the maid of honor, of course accepting the dutie-filled task immediately. Being maid of honor causes more feelings than it should for Annie as it goes to her head that she must compete with the other bridesmaid, who is seemingly out to get her from the second they meet. Annie begins to believe that she needs to prove herself as better than the other bridesmaid in anything and everything. Topping each others toasts one after another, choosing competing dresses for the bridesmaids, and even giving drugs to each other that are believed to be one thing and turn out to be another and result in air Marshal's and security escorting the group off of a plane are just a few of the competitive undertakings for then two crazed women. After awhile of her job being taken from her as maid of honor, Annie attends the bridal shower in which she was supposed to plan until the other one took over, and all goes smooth besides the breakdown that quickly occurs due to the loss of her life long friend. Hurt, confused, and beyond angry, Annie loses it, throwing decorations, screaming out her troubles towards her best friend and more. All comes crashing down. Nothing becomes fixed, it goes the opposite way and does not end until the wedding day. The new maid of honor, Annies enemy finally comes to a halt as she cannot find the bride. Knowing right where to go, Annie finds her friend and saves the wedding, causing it to proceed better than it would have without her; fulfilling her dutie as maid of honor."
"LaurieMann","6","2","6","31 May 2011"," Who Spoiled Bridesmaids?
","I've had very mixed feelings about this movie from the first time I saw a poster for it in my local theater. On the one hand, I love Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig and I like raunch (like the scenes with John Hamm). OTOH, I hate scenes like the food poisoning scene. So, I wasn't going to go, but one of my husband's cousins (female) said it wasn't that disgusting so my daughter and I went.<br/><br/>We liked it, though the disgusting stuff was too much, there was enough funny stuff that the movie almost came together. My daughter tells me that Hangover 1 was less gross than Bridesmaids. I wish people would pay less attention to Judd Apatow.<br/><br/>The interesting thing was that most of the audience when we went to see it was women between the ages of 40 and 60 and a few men of about the same age. I figured the audience would have skewed much younger.<br/><br/>What made the movie work for me were the scenes like the brilliant staredown between Kristen Wiig and Rose Byrne, the generally sweet scenes between Kristen Wiig and Chris O'Dowd (what a cutie!), the scene where Wiig knows she must dump Hamm, and even the scene when she makes the incredible cupcake for herself, during a time when she's swearing to other people that she's no longer baking. And the scenes in the jewelry store - hysterical!<br/><br/>I was also happy to see Jill Clayburgh, even if I didn't recognize her at first (she died not long after the film was done).<br/><br/>Now, about Meghan - what bugged me about her was that she was written and performed like Rosie O'Donnell. Not all fat women, even not all Irish fat women, act like Rosie. But, I like that Meghan was quite successful and smart on her own, even if she was socially very awkward. I just wish every time someone decides it's OK to show fat people having sex, that food wasn't instantly involved.<br/><br/>As a writer and an actress, Kristen Wiig has huge potential. I just hope some guy doesn't ruin her next script. Bridesmaids wasn't ruined, but it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been."

","Movie critics are supposed to be the ultimate arbiters of cinematic taste. The stereotypical image of critic is one of a dead-eyed, cynical intellectual, looking down his nose at the mere trifles before him. This is the image I have to live up to: high-minded, snooty, and highfalutin. So, what can I do with something like Bridesmaids, a film so decidedly low class, brimming with fart jokes, innuendo, and other aberrations? Well, if the experience of seeing it proves anything, all I can do is laugh breathlessly and wonder when the barrage of laughter will stop. In the case of Bridesmaids, it never stops. Here is a movie you watch twice â€“ first because it's good, and then again to hear all the lines you missed because you were laughing breathlessly at the previous exchange. <br/><br/>The film begins with Annie (Kristen Wiig), a failed baker who is drifting aimlessly through her life. She's continuously late with her rent; she habitually hooks up with a man who treats her like an appliance, and (to make matters even worse) her best friend is about to get married. Bride-to-be Lillian (Maya Rudolph) enlists Annie as her maid of honor. The inevitable hi-jinks ensue as we meet the rest of the bridesmaids: repressed Rita, innocent Becca, perfectionist Helen, and the sturdy Megan. Take this rag-tag group, a churrascaria, and a posh bridal salon, and you'll get one of the most revolting, hysterical scenes in any comedy. <br/><br/>At its base, Bridesmaids is a comedy of embarrassment, rooted in the steady decline of Annie as she descends into jealousy. The script (written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo) is incredibly knowledgeable about the dynamics of female relationships, culling out every possible chuckle and guffaw. The film is Kristen Wiig's bed for comedy stardom, and she succeeds without reservation, effortlessly toggling between the comedic and dramatic notes. Yet to say the film belongs solely to Wiig does the rest of the cast and crew a major disservice. The ensemble is flawless, and the direction unobtrusive. Timing is everything in comedy, and Bridesmaids ticks like a clock. <br/><br/>I'll be shocked if there's a better mainstream comedy released this year. Is Bridesmaids derivative of The Hangover? Yes. But on a character to character level it surpasses that film, presenting likable, three- dimensional characters played by outstanding actresses. What makes Bridesmaids so refreshing is the fact that every one of its gross-out gags is rooted in the truth of central friendship between the main characters. High or low brow, that's worth celebrating."

Terry Crews, Michael Hitchcock, Rebel Wilson, Matt Lucas, Jill Clayburgh, Franklyn Ajaye, Ben Falcone (Cameos as themselves: Wilson Phillips â€“ Carnie Wilson, Chynna Phillips, Wendy Wilson). Hysterically funny comedy that is so much more than ""THE HANGOVER"" with vaginas! Sadsack Wiig (who co-scripted the brilliantly comical screenplay with Annie Mumolo) stars as Annie a sweet-natured but constantly put-upon ne'er-do-well whose well-meant intentions are put through the wringer when BFF Rudolph (equally wonderful) announces her engagement and forthcoming nuptials entailing Annie to arrange all the ceremonial events much to her chagrin. Although a game trooper her patience is put to the test when Byrne (channeling Jane Seymour and STEPFORD WIVES) â€“ Rudolph's new friend â€“ challenges her to everything set out by Annie. What follows is nearly 2 hours of laugh-out-loud cringe-worthy and sharply skewed comedy that will have you howling for its mix of raunch (witness the food poisoning bachelorette dinner) and heart (pretty much everywhere else) that has been executive producer Judd Apatow's touch. But wait, don't get me wrong it's all about the ladies and what a fine comic ensemble of gifted comediennes assembled: McLendon-Covey as a desperate housewife looking for fun in any shape or form; mild-mannered newlywed Kemper; and finally scene stealer (hell, lock her up for grand larceny!) McCarthy as Rudolph's future sis-in-law who speaks her mind and is in touch with her inner Chris Farley. To say anymore would ruin the experience but I truly say this comedy is the funniest I've seen in years to the point of stomping my feet on the floor in the theater to keep the oxygen flowing from lack thereof from laughing so hard, for so long! The year's best comedy ; hand's down. And seriously I think Oscar-worthy of Wiig (for her funny/sad turn â€“ she has chops!) and her screenplay as well as Best Supporting Actress trifecta of Rudolph/Byrne/McCarthy. Kudos to veteran TV director Paul Feig for balancing the comic strides so skillfully. Seriously funny!"

"disinterested_spectator","7","1","2","16 January 2017"," The Irony of Marriage
","""Bridesmaids"" is a comedy about a bunch of women that are getting ready to be bridesmaids for one of their friends who is getting married. I thought this movie was funny and I enjoyed it, so there is no criticism coming from me in that regard. What struck me about the movie, however, was the irony of marriage that was obvious to the audience but seemed to escape the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>On the one hand, the women in the movie that are single want to get married and look forward to being married as something wonderful. There is, of course, Lilian (Maya Rudolph), the woman who is about to be married. Then there is Annie (Kristen Wiig), who is going to be her maid of honor, at least initially. Annie is single and wants to get married. Unfortunately, she is having a succession of one-night-stands with the same man over and over again. That man is Ted, played by Jon Hamm, whose good looks are almost painful to behold, especially if you are a man who has had to compete for women with the likes of him. Ted will never marry her, of course, for he doesn't even like her to spend the night, but wants her out of his place as soon as they are through having sex. When she finally breaks up with him (if you can call it that), he utters a classic line as he drives away: ""You are no longer my number three."" Finally, there is Megan (Melissa McCarthy), who is in the movie strictly for laughs.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the women in the movie that are married (or had been married) find marriage to be either sexually frustrating, sexually repulsive, disappointing, or just plain miserable. Annie's mother (Jill Clayburgh) is divorced and still resentful over being left for another woman over twelve years ago. Helen (Rose Byrne), Annie's nemesis, admits that her husband travels a lot and she is lonely. Rita (Wendy McLendon-Covey), who is stepmother to children that despise her, dreads having sex with her husband. And Becca (Ellie Kemper) is sexually frustrated because she is married to a neurotic man for whom sex has to be done under specified conditions so exacting that they often end up not having sex at all.<br/><br/>But the women that are single are oblivious to the unhappy situations of the women that are or were married. Unfortunately, that only means the movie is true to life.<br/><br/>While the women are getting ready for the wedding, Annie meets Nathan (Chris O'Dowd), a police officer. They seem to be suited to each other. They have sex over at his house, and he has no qualms about letting her spend the night. He even wants to spend the day with her when they get up. But she gets cold feet, saying, ""Last night was a mistake."" Then she refuses to return his phone calls. Annie feels bad about the whole thing, but no matter what she does, he refuses to accept her apology.<br/><br/>Life is full of misunderstandings and hurt feelings, but I have never rebuffed an apology in my life. The minute someone indicates that he or she is genuinely sorry about something that happened, I find it impossible not to be forgiving. That does not mean I will let that person back into my life, for that is another thing entirely.<br/><br/>In other words, Nathan could have accepted her apology and then said that, indeed, the night they made love was a mistake, but they could still be friends. And ""being friends"" need not mean socializing together on a regular basis, but only that they smile at each other and exchange a few pleasantries when they meet. The way he held a grudge against Annie for so long was a warning sign against having a relationship with him. And for what? She really did not do anything so terribly wrong. In fact, it was not even the sort of thing for which I would have expected an apology. Our search for love is full of false starts and blind alleys, and we don't know how things will end up when we start them. But then, I guess the way Annie refused to accept Helen's apologies means she is not much better than Nathan. Maybe they deserve each other. But it's going to be a rough marriage."

","Written by men, obviously. But the part that is sickening is seeing these actresses, a group of intellectually funny women, absorb and accept this script and regurgitate it for the men who wrote it - they may have just bent over for the male writers and the same effect would have been achieved. It makes me sad to see women so subservient to men this way - undignified, brainless. There's a trend going on lately where women are being made to go along with dick and fart humor and act like ""one of the guys."" This is a manipulation of women by men to further men's various appetites and it's disgusting. The writers seemed to think they had some kind of understanding of women and how women relate to each other when all it resulted in was sounding like what a perverted man wants to hear a group of women talking about. Whatever. You know now that I think of it I don't even know if only men wrote this movie, but that just furthers my point, in my opinion. If women wrote this it is the same as if they took direction and acted in the film. Either way it is male-oriented sick humor and females are not generally involved in this nor do they behave this way unless prompted by someone who is mentally manipulative. This has bothered me since I saw this one so I had to say something."
"krissyafite1979","10","1","2","27 October 2014"," great movie
","Warning this review has spoilers.I loved this this movie. Even though like most chick flicks its not all realistic, I feel the characters are familiar to most of us. Annie is attractive and smart but at a lower point in her life. She has no boyfriend or career as her business she owned as a pastry chef failed and she worked at a low paying sales job. After shes asked to be bridesmaid, she meets her friends glamorous wealthy friend Helen who married well but has bratty spoiled step children, no kids of her own. I think she met her through her fiances job.You also meet a wealthy glamorous group of friends I think she met through Helen. Helens personality might be familiar to most of us, maybe not the wealth, but the glamorous model figure type. At first i didn't like her cop boyfriend but he seemed to show a nice side and wasn't like the losers she dated. The part where everybody including Annie gets sick because Annie suggested a cheap run down looking restaurant that she could afford to eat lunch at with the girls seemed dumb as restaurants do not have to be pricey to be clean, but perhaps the point was just that it was one wrong thing after another and just bad luck. Helen takes over with planning everything and shot down every idea she has from the shower, the brides maids dresses. Some of Annies ideas are nice and reasonable. Hellens ideas were nice too and she seemed well intentioned but she was insensitive to then Annies feelings and didn't see her perspective. She also didn't seem to realize a wedding stuff such as brides dresses and bachelorett parties involve all the brides maids who may not be wiling and able to pay a lot. Bachalorett parties usually aren't expensive vacation as usually you plan something everybody can afford. Hellen planned nice things and had great taste but she was insensitive to the fact that not everyone can afford what she can. She may have always had money and might not have realized that. I felt bad when Annie had the melt down at the shower. Of course it wasn't the time and place, but her fiend was being insensitive and her extravagant wedding plans and rich group of friends got to her head so she got fed up. Its great that she had bigger and better things but she kind of lost who she was.Towards the end you find out those over the top wedding stuff Helen planned, the bride and her parents couldn't afford and it seemed some of it, including the dress Helen got her just wasn't her style, which was part of what angered Annie to begin with, she knew all that stuff wasn't her but she wanted to fit in with her new rich friends. Annie and her make up but her friend i feel doesn't really appologize the way she should as she did take Annie for granted. However Annie seemed happy she was back to the friend she knew since childhood. Melissa MC Carthys character was funny, she seemed goofy but you later realize she was confident and successful and just didn't care what anybody thought, might seem arrogant to some but possibly familiar to some of us."
"vvbasketball","8","1","2","25 September 2014"," Are chick flicks good movies?
","First of all, I know Kristen Wiig was in her late 30's in this one. But she was absolutely adorable. Her age and attraction actually fit the story really well. Everyone around her getting married - she being left behind. Losing an already low-paying job. Only has a guy who likes her for sex. Any girl would be depressed in her situation especially at her age. <br/><br/>I may be stretching this movie and giving it much more credit than it deserves, but this movie relates to how people grow up with such lofty expectations and ambitions, only to slapped in the face by life. Kristen Wiig's character - Annie - is beautiful, bubbly, spectacular at baking, etc. She probably had a life goal of becoming a world-famous baker and finding a beautiful and rich husband. But she ends up losing her business and having no one besides a rich playboy. <br/><br/>Even when she does end up with the Scottish (or Irish, I can't tell the difference), does anyone in the audience sincerely believe that he deserves to end up with him? He's clumsy and slightly a fool at times. He easily falls in love, because he probably does not get any action either. And he does not even eat the carrot cake when she bakes for him! Eat the cake, policeman! I know it's not donuts, but it looks so, so good! <br/><br/>Anyway, the gist of the story is a story of two girls who have a mutual best friend. One is rich, beautiful, and seems to have her life together. The other is poor, is nowhere close to the husband, and will probably break up with her new policeman boyfriend soon. They become jealous of each other, both trying to one-up each other. They both want to be the singular best friend of the bride, and it's actually quite pathetic to see this social battle take course. <br/><br/>But, it is a decently enjoyable film. Society will probably force you to watch this one day. There are funny moments for sure. But sometimes, you just look at the screen and ask yourself, 'What the f am I watching?' In any case, watch it, try ignoring the absolute ludicrous nature of the events, and just come with zero expectations. <br/><br/>After all. It's only a chick flick."

","Well, what a prudish lot some of these reviewers are! Gloriously uninhibited, consistently hilarious, splendidly tasteless (the staid Financial Times strongly recommended it as ""rude"" and funny), beautifully acted by the entire talented cast but especially by the leading lady and her copper boyfriend, and often oddly moving. Kristen Wiig has a rare cinematic gift for conveying scepticism, disgust, secret amusement or plain healthy lust with the twitch of an eyebrow, the merest roll of the eyes or the curl of a lip -- acting that would be lost on the theatre stage but is a constant joy on the silver screen, and which contrasts effectively with the extremely well choreographed slapstick scenes. Melissa McCarthy, playing the, er, well-built Megan, initially invites us to dismiss her character as an embarrassing slob and then skilfully brings us round to understand the brave fighter and lonely young woman within: a memorable and courageous performance.<br/><br/>Admittedly not a movie for the easily shocked, but everyone else needs to loosen up a little, sit back, and enjoy it.

","I may well be in the minority here but I thought this movie was mediocre. It's full of crude toilet humour which is sometimes funny but often not. The love story is so-so and basically just forms a bit of background noise for the jokes.<br/><br/>It also paints female friendships in a horribly stereotypical light, i.e., women are bitchy but will ultimately stand up for each other and have a hug.<br/><br/>The main merit of the movie is it's fast pace and the fact it keeps itself ticking along with a few gags. It was an easy watch and I guess if you've got the right sense of humour you'll enjoy it."

","I'm totally not the target audience, but that hasn't stopped me in the past. This movie is long and drawn out, and extremely more awkward than it needed to be. I don't need ten scenes showing Kristen Wiig being awkward to know that she's awkward, just one or two will do. A lot of things happened in the movie and I can't really point out any favorite moments, but I think that Melissa McCarthy's puppy stealing was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. In fact, I might as well say that this was a stellar cast. Kristen Wiig, Rose Bryne, Maya Rudolph, Ellie Kemper, and Chris O'Dowd were fantastic. I was rooting for Rhodes and Annie all the way.<br/><br/>Also, I did like how this movie had a moral, which was be true to yourself and don't try to impress everyone. (And to stay away from Vegas.)"

"cat_ranchero","7","1","2","16 June 2012"," Good without being great... But it DID pass my 'Six Laughs Test'...
","Very well made and yes, it did pass the 'six laugh test' – If a comedy doesn't get more than six laughs from me it ain't no comedy! As for performances, well, everyone was very good; Kristen Wiig as Annie Walker, Maya Rudolph as Lillian and Rose Byrne as Helen all did great jobs. I loved Melissa McCarthy as Megan, she really made me laugh and (of course) Chris O'Dowd as Rhodes; I know him from the TV show 'The IT Crowd' here in the UK. Also worthy of note were; Rebel Wilson as Brynn, Matt Lucas as Gil, Wendi McLendon-Covey as Rita and Ellie Kemper as Becca. Oh, and look out for Jon Hamm (uncredited) as Ted.<br/><br/>A story about popularity, friendship, love, relationships all kinds of stuff really; I was kind of struggling to keep up by the end! There is a trend in comedies (of late) of putting people in awkward, uncomfortable, often embarrassing situations and I must say I'm afraid don't find it funny. You are made to care about a particular character and then laugh at them as they squirm in an uncomfortable situation. Sorry people, it just doesn't do anything for me. As far as this film goes, yes there were some of those moments, but there were also some truly comic moments, mostly supplied by the wonderful Melissa McCarthy, it has to be said; although Kristen Wiig and Chris O'Dowd did raise a titter or two. The surprise for me though, was the performance of Rose Byrne, she did really well in a genre I wouldn't particularly associate with her. Over all, I must say, despite a couple of misgivings, I did enjoy this film a lot more than I expected to Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.1/10<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 93,096 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>MetaScore: 75/100: (Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 90/100 (based on 232 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 73/100 'Liked It' (based on 87,373 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

He was the most likable character in this mess and deserved better. The most intelligent character was Ted who seemed to realize that all an immature loser like Annie was good for was sex; not surprising that he wanted her to leave after the act.<br/><br/>As for ""comedy"", I laughed once and that was at the little boy dancing.

","Date: 10 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- Yes, this is definitely the perfect girl movie that provides laughs, sarcasm, and a touching story. The story focuses around Annie, a woman living in Milwaukee who discovers that her best friend, Lillian, is getting married. While Annie is happy for Lillian, she can't help but be sad too especially when she is introduced by Lillian's new friend, wedding planner expert Helen. Thus beginning a power struggle between Annie and Helen as they both try to impress Lillian and give her the wedding of her dreams. While I thought Kirsten Wiig did an amazing job playing Annie, I couldn't help but love Melissa McCarthy's portrayal as Megan, who makes a joke or gesture that makes you laugh every time she's on screen.

The casts' acting skills were good but it was more the events in the story that made us cringe and feel sorry for the characters than laugh out loud.<br/><br/>There was some funny parts but not nearly enough to call this a genre of humor.

"jollyygreengina","3","1","2","19 April 2012"," Just an Honest Review
","Bridesmaids was pretty much exactly what I was expecting it to be. If you've heard that ""it's the female version of 'The Hangover,' it's true, there's not much more to it than that. I'm not going to rate it one star to ""even out the hype"" or anything, just give my honest opinions.<br/><br/>Now maybe I'm unfair because I'm not a fan of ""rom-coms,"" I'd take a Tarantino film any day over any kind of chick flick (and I'm a girl), and while this movie doesn't fit that exactly, the ugliness in it, however, was something I just couldn't look past. I don't find it entertaining to sit through women being just absolutely vile and catty to one another. <br/><br/>Take some of the situations out of their context, and they might have been funny. I kept sitting through the movie thinking to myself that if some of these things were to happen to me in real life, it would have been hilarious. Like a friend of mine getting smashed on a plane or a person attacking a giant cookie. These things sound like they would make for great laughs but put them in the context in which they were delivered, and I couldn't even giggle.<br/><br/>And not that someone should act in that way at any age, but these women looked to be about at least 40. The fact that they would carry themselves the way they did was just unbelievable and (hopefully) unrealistic. In general, the characters were either unlikable or unremarkable. The fact that I sat through the entire movie getting more and more annoyed at the way Annie acted definitely score the movie no points.<br/><br/>And as for the humor, no surprise that it's crass. Kinda have to take it or leave it. I'm not too mature to the point where some cheap jokes can't make me laugh, but if that's all you've got, stretched out over two hours, delivered by these women, then no thanks. <br/><br/>All that aside, there's warm, best-friends-forever love moments, the girls work out all their kinks and Annie gets her guy. She bakes again, it's touching. Melissa McCarthy's character made the entire movie. It wan't all bad, truthfully, but for me, was just a one time watch."

","This movie is most definitely worth watching. The story is cliché, yes, yet the makes have created something out of it I could laugh at. It caught my attention since the situations are so weird, but created with an eye for details. <br/><br/>I most absolutely loved the actresses,they managed to really be the persons the should be. <br/><br/>This is a movie I would be proud of if I'd created it. I think the makes should definitely be proud, as this is one of the better movies containing the bridal theme.

","After we are finished talking about the gross moments, the riotous laughter, and a few knockout performances, there is going to need to be a fair evaluation of this movie. I think it is going to be a good one. <br/><br/>There were numerous LOLian moments. The fitting room. The airplane. Air Marshall John. John Hamm. ""Hold On."" And McCarthy and Wiig turn in some magnificent acting and substance. Wiig does a good job harnessing the propulsion of the movie, even when it becomes a flaw. There are large pieces of material that could be edited out, but Wiig still manages to fill the screen with the same lovable awkwardness that audiences have started to appreciate. One of BRIDESMAIDS' best qualities is the ensemble energy. The women work well together (and the unnecessary material should have been swapped for more time with them) and every character has unique energy. This is exactly what makes BRIDESMAIDS crucial as genre evolution. This level of female ensemble acting in contemporary comedy has not been produced to this extent. It's a marvelous group performance and a big step forward. <br/><br/>The script is owed a certain due. The use of repetition and stop-start dialogue is commendable, but the silence is what drives BRIDESMAIDS. They seem to know every smart-ass retort, but nothing can stand up to silence when they just have nothing to say. It's used very well. The scene where Ms. Wiig makes and eats a cupcake is one of the most arresting examples of loneliness, loneliness amongst everything, that has been recently seen. In fact, Ms. Wiig crafts herself as a repugnant character, wasteful and constantly waiting for pity. Her jealousy towards the enigmatic Helen is taken much too far (even in the film) and, like Woody Allen writing his own flaws into his own characters, here we see an embarrassing character in need of a Rosebud (baking shop). <br/><br/>As the main themes are clearly lined out as ""change v. same,"" we never end up seeing a title bout. There are some apologies and everybody gets to the wedding. But will they be any better off when the sequel comes out? Will Helen still be the clueless self-righteous turd that she is? Will Annie be baking? and not being the most subtly evil twirp that she was here? Maybe we will find out. <br/><br/>Until then, enjoy something very close to Judd Apatow. Enjoy some truly unique comedy coming from a great gaggle of females. And Enjoy seeing girls be girls, cycling through dismay and distaste.<br/><br/>63.232"

Now i do not know if this was due to the cast being basically newbies or what the problem was here all i know is that i was sadly misled on the laughter part. The storyline is where i actually decided to be nice and give some points for. It's original, thank god they didn't have the maids so to speak heading for Vegas or i would've walked out after the credits rolled. Apatow also didn't direct this, which is the next big mistake, don't get me wrong i like him in the producing role as well but this would've completely rocked if it were in his vision.

(I've watched 27 dresses more than once... granted I think it's cheesy - but familiar cheese.) <br/><br/>Bridesmaids is a film that tries too hard to be a juvenile, gross-out comedy with heart that it forgets to string out a plot that makes sense or develop characters that I either care about or in the very least am entertained by. To punch up the ""comedy"" and make it more ""Hangover- like"" was merely to add the gross-out humor. (Oh look she's pooping in her wedding dress... haha).<br/><br/>Specific plot and characters issues have been pointed out in previous reviews. <br/><br/>But make no mistake, put any other cast in this film and it would most certainly have been universally panned.

","I saw odd clips of this movie and thought ""that looks quite entertaining"" How wrong was I? VERY wrong. It lacked wit, charm, a decent script and a cast that one could warm to.Only Melissa McCarthy(?) acquitted herself fairly well. Rose Byrne was a real disappointment after having seen her in Damages. Miss Wiig was just annoying and really not very funny at all. It seems that the SNL participants only travel well in the States as I have rarely found any of them funny enough to drag me into a movie. The whole movie lacked wit and any kind of intelligent humour. After the hype about it Bridesmaids could not help but be a huge disappointment. It was just another gross out movie but made by women. The fact that the main cast were women was about the only thing to recommend it. A great pity that it was just not up to it for me. It's now August 2015 and I thought I would give it another go in case it was me and not the movie. It is actually worse than I remember - not even a smile was raised and I consider myself to have a good sense of humour. Not a single person in the movie was likable and seemed to have any comedic talent at all. It is almost a guarantee of dire results if Matt Lucas is in it and Chris O'Dowd is just chronic. If I could give this ordure a minus score then I would. Where are the comedies with the quality and wit of Some Like It Hot? Where are the scriptwriters who can really sharpen up a screenplay and make it work? Utter utter shite is the only description I can give to rubbish like this.

The protagonist is sympathetic but I don't enjoy watching her struggle the way she is.<br/><br/>It does not judge its own tone well and although there was potential to be a poignant story of the desperation of adults to preserve the older relationship as they get ripped apart by adulthood and the institution of marriage, it's not.<br/><br/>With a script that relies on excellent comic actors to bring the jokes to life for it, too much time is devoted to bodily functions and trying to convince men that women have no conciseness beyond weddings and showing each other up.

While the entire engagement to marriage episode is panning out, she meets a lonely patrol officer Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) who guides her to sanctity. <br/><br/>It is Kirsten Wiig's show from start to end. I became an instant admirer from her role in Paul and she shot through to the top with this. Few women possess the comic timing like hers and an ability to be cute and awkward at the same time which is so required for these roles. Apart from Wiig and a little from Byrne, by the end I cannot say I have enjoyed it as much as other Apatow's treats. <br/><br/>Watch it for Wiig, I didn't find anything else excellent here."

I managed about 15 minutes of excruciatingly painful, cringe inducing, embarrassingly pathetic characters, beyond banal scenes and unrealistic dialogues before giving up on this ""funniest comedy of the year"". This film couldn't be less funny if it tried. What happened to comedy I wonder? Since when disgusting dialogue and gross slapstick is so universally funny? Comedy is supposed to feel good - not grossed out, uncomfortable and cringing. The suits seemed to have completely taken over film making and it is truly unfortunate for those of us who like a good story and a laugh. I sincerely hope that the corporate bores will hit a wall one day and will be forced to loosen up the grip of their greedy paws on film makers a little - and that we will see the likes of Live Nude Girls and Bridget Jones Diary again."

All the low ratings for this are a real head scratcher and I can't stand the people who blame the previews for giving away the funny parts of the movie, which is entirely the fault of advertisement and not the movie itself.

"lesleyharris30","9","1","3","11 March 2014"," Hilarious with a Positive Cast,
","Bridesmaids is a fantastic movie with a very well written plot, a ton of very funny scenes and an outstanding comedic cast. The films storyline is certainly nothing original, but a cast that were clearly very interested in this script and very likeable, dysfunctional characters make this movie very enjoyable. Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rosa Byrne and Chris O'Dowd, among many others, offer great performances in this film. However, the breakthrough character of this movie, for me, is without a doubt Melissa McCarthy, her character is simply hilarious, and is certainly the most quotable, everything she says or does is simply gold. Bridesmaids is a hilarious movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.<br/><br/>After her best friend gets engaged, Annie is given the difficult task of being Lillian's maid of honour, but the other bridesmaids prove to be her biggest concern in organising the wedding. <br/><br/>
Best Performance: Melissa McCarthy"
"amber_maishment","Null","1","3","8 March 2014"," Hilarious.
","Summing up 2011's hit Bridesmaid's in one word would be difficult but if I had to choose it'd behysterical. With a perfect balance between romance and comedy, this is the funniest straight-up comedy that I have seen on the big screen in a very long time. Kristen Wiig, having written the script and also starring as the lead protagonist has achieved the unflawed trick of being brutal and gentle in the same moment. <br/><br/>Wiig is a comedic genius who has written a side-splitting, yet highly relatable script. Starring as Annie, who has found herself a failure during a mid-life crisis, Wiig does an impeccable job. She is a broken and unhappy woman whose bakery has gone bust and to make matters worse, her best friend is leaving her all alone in the single life to become married. Being a made-of-honour would usually be something to take pride in, however for Annie who is dealing with the bizarre rituals for the duty, her life begins to unravel.<br/><br/>Based on a group of women who become bridesmaids for their friend Lillian and her upcoming wedding, Bridesmaids is made up of an almost entire female cast which reveal to the men of the world the unknown of how ladies can drink, swear and vomit as freely and as funnily as they can. Although the plot may sound pleasant, you must be warned. This is far from the typical rom-com you may expect. It dives deep into presenting the true and full horrors of being an important part of your best friends big day – especially when it is making you more resentful and lonely everyday. <br/><br/>An equally as fantastic and hilarious line of actress's ensemble around Wiig. Maya Rudolph plays Lillian, Annie's best friend who because of the wedding, is beginning to drift away from her lifelong friend. Rose Byrne is comical as Helen, who is trying her hardest to destroy Annie and Lillian's friendship and be the best bridal member. This is a very amusing relationship as realistically, you would never see two women in their thirties acting in the childish and jealous ways they do. However resulting to food throwing, you cannot help but laugh yourself breathless at the complete immaturity.<br/><br/>Wendi McLendon-Covey is hilarious as Rita, a sarcastic relative who is unhappily married and resents her three sons. Rita and Becca (Ellie Kemper), a newlywed who is very excited about being a wife and mother, start to become close also. Melissa McCarthy as Megan is the groom's sister and the rough-around-the-edges oddball of all the ladies. She is most definitely the funniest of the bunch and completely makes the film. Timing is the most important aspect of comedy and the bridesmaids most certainly have this down to a fine art. Being so brilliant together, you miss half of the dialogue trying to recover from laughing at the previous gag.<br/><br/>The complete terror of being a bridesmaid is explored in the film, however Wiig still persuades the audience that there is something genuine and loving to be found at the bottom of this ordeal. This is the best comedy of the past few years, with far more spirit and hilarity than Hollywood's had to offer recently. Considering men who also admit that they loved it write a lot of the reviews, it has done us women proud. Pure gold."

","Annie (Kristen Wiig) and Lillian (Maya Rudolph) have been best friends since their childhood, and now with Lillian getting married Annie is chosen to be her Maid of Honor. Annie is now forced to help her best friend through the happiest time of her life, when secretly Annie wants to find someone to love. Lillian then adds a whole heap of characters in her bridesmaids group including her fiancé's bosses, wife Helen (Rose Byrne), and her soon to be sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy). <br/><br/>I absolutely love Kristen Wiig, she is smart, funny, and also one of the few remaining SNL cast members that I enjoy. Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who makes a great cameo in the film, teamed up together to write their first comedic feature and blew me away with the amazing writing. Its a refreshing change to see real women with real problems struggling to control their lives, then seeing some ditzy blonde going to the mall. Kristen Wiig can also act, her dramatic timing is just as good as her comedic timing. I can't wait to see what her next film will be. Im hoping a nice indie dramedy.<br/><br/>Rose Byrne has become one of my new favorite women in films this passed decade. She was amazing in ""Wicker Park"", ""Sunshine"", ""The Dead Girl"", and just recently ""Insidious"". She started her comedy improve kick with ""Get Him To The Greek"", and having blown everyone out of the water, Judd Apatow decided to put her in Bridesmaids. <br/><br/>Now the person who single-handedly stole the whole movie was Melissa McCarthy. I remember seeing her small cameo in ""Go"", and thought she was funny. Then John August put her in his small film ""The Nines"", co-starring with Ryan Reynolds. And now she has been able to jump to a major supporting role in a big comedy and nails every line that comes out of her mouth. A particular part of hers that had me on the floor laughing, involved her character's experience on a cruise ship.<br/><br/>The only thing wrong with the film is that it is about twenty minutes to long. But other than that, Bridesmaids is a fantastic comedy. I give Bridesmaids an 8.5 out of 10"
"wccghtyz","8","1","3","24 August 2013"," Hilarious movie with great story
","This is one of the few comedy movies that I have been able to laugh all-throughout the film, and still say it had a good plot by the end. The realistic characters and good acting really made this film for me. I'm a guy who doesn't like chick flicks very much, but after my sister made me watch this one I LOVED it! (Even enough to come and write a review on it.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this to any age or gender, and the only reason I didn't give this 9 or 10 stars is because of the ending. It is one of those girly ""all problems get fixed at once"" sort of endings, which I'm sure will not bother you if you are a girl. (You probably are lol)"
"Mentat57","1","1","3","9 May 2013"," Terrible!
","I normally like comedies with a romantic twist to them. This is neither. If you get your kicks and can laugh at people being humiliated, then this movie is for you - it is the most common feature in this movie. I for one cannot stand it, too much empathy perhaps. Romance? Well, the characters are heterosexual but that is about it. It does not contain what I would call romance. <br/><br/>I kept watching it in the hope that somehow the plot would take a turn and that the first half hour was something you had to get through. The first hour? No, it was the whole movie. The actors do their job, it is the plot that is terrible. I actually threw away the DVD which is something I only do when the movie was painful to watch.<br/><br/>Stay a long way away from this but if you don't, remember that you were warned!"
"pontifikator","8","1","3","20 April 2013"," Not a chick flick -- guys will like it, too
","Although called a female comedy, this is chock full o' laughs for the guys, too. Co-written by Kristen Wiig and Anne Mumolo (who also has a small role), ""Bridesmaids"" stars Wiig as the woebegone near-spinster who has a knack for picking losers as her lovers. It was directed by Paul Feig, and co-stars Maya Rudolph as the bride who picks Wiig's character as Maid of Honor. This was Jill Clayburgh's last movie before her death from cancer. Somebody picked great music for the movie, and the Wilson Phillips performed at the end. <br/><br/>The writing and the performances knocked my socks off. ""Bridesmaids"" was nominated for Academy Awards for best original screenplay and for best supporting actress for Melissa McCarthy for her role as Megan. Although McCarthy shines, I preferred Rudolph's performance, but I don't pick 'em for Oscar Awards. Both Rudolph and Wiig are alums of Saturday Night Life, and the movie abounds with others from SNL. Judd Apatow is credited as producer, although there is a string of names of other producers of various sub-types.<br/><br/>Casting was stellar. I don't know how much Allison Jones had to do with it all, but she deserves an award for picking the right actors for the roles. Casting Jon Hamm as Ted, Annie's jerk boyfriend, is only one of the strokes of genius in this movie. <br/><br/>This is not a momentous film worthy of preservation for the eons, but it's a drop dead funny laugh-out-loud movie. At two hours, it'll fill up an afternoon quite well on some dreary cold day you don't want to go out."
"jojosendy","9","1","3","19 February 2013"," Bridesmaid takes a twist on the typical wedding-focused film!
","""Bridesmaids"" does an excellent job recreating the typical wedding- focused romantic comedy by switching the focus from the bride-to-be to her bridesmaids. Instead of having to worry about the bride being left at the altar, the audience's concern is placed on the power battle between maid-of-honor (Kristin Wigg) and bridesmaid (Rose Byrne) in their attempts to woo the bride (Maya Rudolph). The events leading up to the big day highlight the ridiculousness and humor in their actions. <br/><br/>Lillian, the bride, chooses life-long best friend, Annie, to be her maid-of-honor alongside her husband's boss's conniving wife, Helen. Helen's mission is to compete for Lillian's friendship and upstage Annie's efforts whenever she can get the chance. However this wedding couldn't be taking place at a worse time in Annie's life. Annie resorts to being unhappily employed at a jewelry store after her baking business fails. The wedding can't help but remind her that she's single and struggling to find a significant intimate relationship. Ted (John Hamm) further lowers Annie's self-esteem by keeping her around as his personal booty-call. Annie can't help feeling threatened by the constant input from perfect, glamorous Helen. The rivalry between the two provides endless entertainment for the bridal party. <br/><br/>Writers, Kristin Wigg and Annie Mumolo, crafted the script to include two different kinds of humor. The first contains the simpler, stupid jokes that are expected of a romantic comedy. This is evident when Annie's roommate pours frozen peas over herself instead of using them as an ice pack. The classic usage of food stuck in one's teeth and awkwardness in the bedroom are also presented. On top of this, the uniqueness of this film is accentuated, with Wigg and Mumolo's use of crazy funny. Annie completely loses her professionalism at work when she yells at a young girl for wanting to buy a friendship bracelet. This convention of insanity is seen again during the bridal shower when Annie overreacts and trashes the party. The combination of these two elements makes the film's humor unforgettable.<br/><br/>The key performer and bridesmaid in this film is Saturday Night Alumni actress, Kristin Wigg. Director, Paul Feig, makes use of the character, Annie, by taking her on the biggest emotional journey of them all; it completely outshines the experience of the bride. The viewer wants to sympathize with Annie's character because her low self-worth disadvantages her from the start. Annie learns how to ""fight for her shitty life"" and become aware of the things that are important to her. Although she was not thrilled about planning a wedding she steps up to the plate when fellow bridesmaid, Helen, tries to take over the show. <br/><br/>Overall the film provides a hilarity that is not normally produced by romantic comedies. Although there are a few tangents to the main plot, it keeps the audience's interest from the very beginning with its lively script. The film goes beyond the surface by displaying the bridesmaid's motivations to succeed in the wedding for Lillian. Even ""evil"" Helen becomes a person the viewer wants to get to know more about."

","This was far funnier and better than I expected. It was actually quite dark. At times it was incredibly painful viewing but I mean that as a good thing. It was like Mr Bean, but funny and without the silly noises and faces. Anyway, I heartily recommend it as drama and comedy. Kristen Wiig was superb. And for those who like action it contains one of the best fight scenes in cinematic history too. Annie versus Megan. Hope that doesn't count as a spoiler. It also made me want to bake. Well... Go out and buy some baked goods and eat them. If anybody watches it and knows where I can get a similar Burt Reynolds painting to the one featured in Annie's bedroom at her Mum's house please let me know. Okay... Am I at 10 lines now? Great. Stick a fork in my I'm done. Good night my lovelies."
"manendra-lodhi","9","1","3","20 September 2012"," Defines the meaning of a pure comedy.
","I would say that this film is the best in the comedy genre and that too female comedy. It relies heavily upon the acting and the amazing story. The story is a perfect mix of girl fights, jealousy, love and their guilt. This is the best film that any girl can expect. It would be very difficult to surpass what this film has created. The story revolves around the lives of few girls, one of whom happens to be married soon. All credit must go to the story.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>Films like these are genuine laughter though in Adult category but not useless stuff. You will not be able to stop yourself praising after the first viewing itself.<br/><br/>Message: ""Everyone walks through a bad phase in life.""<br/><br/>Verdict: ""Very much recommended."""
"Agnelin","Null","1","3","15 September 2012"," A great choice for all girls who aren't necessarily into chick flicks
","Kristen Wiig is the kind of actor who doesn't let her ego get in between her and her character. Which means that, in ""Bridesmaids"", she is so good because she isn't afraid of laughing at herself or, to better put it, at her character, Annie Walker, a 30-something who is currently failing at the most important sides of her life and who is asked by Lillian, her lifelong best friend, to be her bridesmaid. Annie is delighted, but will soon have to face hard competition from Lillian's new friend and contender to the best friend title, classy and beautiful Helen.<br/><br/>The whole movie is a series of misadventures starring Annie, who manages to ruin every step of Lillian's wedding arrangements, as well as her own living arrangements and her barely extant love life. Of course, everything will end up nicely and happily for everyone involved.<br/><br/>Though I'm not precisely a fan of the Apatow factory's kind of gross humor style -and this is also quite present in ""Bridesmaids""-, I enjoyed this movie, and I think it stands out, because it works well on many different levels. If, like me, you don't much appreciate gross, in-your-face jokes involving natural bodily functions, for example, you can still enjoy ""Bridesmaids"" because, for instance, it makes fun of the many clichés that Hollywood rom-coms have been pushing down our throats (and into our brains) for decades; it also makes fun of the stereotypical chick-flick heroine (Annie is cute in a girl-next-door fashion, sweet, and has her own style, but she is approachable and she is definitely quite real; she is awkward and acts silly or downright stupid sometimes, which we all do) and of the real things that real men and women do in real life. It also has good comedy dialogue and a nice message at the end -it's not a mere sequence of funny sketches. The characters are real and there is a story behind the whole thing.<br/><br/>Besides, the whole cast is great and you can tell everyone loved being in this movie. For me personally, it was especially delightful to see Rose Byrne in her role.<br/><br/>My score: 8 stars out of 10."
"jcox713","10","1","3","18 August 2012"," Hilarious movie. It is girls being bad as the boys, and some people just can't handle it.
","While I'm not surprised some people may not like this movie, I am amazed at how many people absolutely loathed this movie to the bottom of their humorless core. Not only do so many say they didn't like it, but that unequivocally Bridesmaids is ""the worst movie of all time."" Wait. Really? Of all time? Little Fockers was WAAAAAAAY worse. Have you all seen that? Seriously, I think we need to get to the bottom of what this hatred is actually all about. I think it just might be a bit of conscious or unconscious sexism. The women in this film don't do anything more outrageous than what any boy has done in recent films that conversely garnered near universal critical acclaim. ie: Wedding Crashers, The Hangover. The difference? It is the deep subconscious aversion much of society has to women being bold and daring and to be just as brazen as the boys. This movie had me laughing at nearly every moment - several until I was crying. If you are stiff and grounded by social norms (ie: only men can exercise flatulence and be funny) then yes, you will likely be naturally repelled by this film. On the other hand, if you are relaxed, have a healthy sick sense of humor, and are one who goes against the grain and have an higher-than-average comedic intellect (enough to know when absurd and utterly ridiculous is the whole POINT and THAT is why it is funny, then you'll likely not only enjoy this film, it might very well be one of your favorites."

","The acting in this film is excellent; despite the comic and crazy dialogue, there is a lot of subtlety in the delivery. Lead actress Kristen Wiig is superb as Annie, the maid of honour, working fluidly alongside a talented and well directed cast. Interestingly, the only actors that didn't fit for me were Annie's English flat mates, Gil and Brynn (played by Matt Lucas and Rebel Wilson), whose inclusion is baffling - those scenes could easily have been edited out with no detriment to the final film.<br/><br/>Unlike other wedding films, this one has a bit more bite and language - so a welcome change for a genre that was in danger of being dominated by slush. An excellent comedy that has a bit of soul and keeps the laughs coming."

","This movie is what the Hangover movies should have been... funny. I can't recall seeing Kristen Wiig anywhere before this movie but I'm going to keep an eye out for her. I never spoil movies in my reviews by telling you what the movie is about especially when I love the movie. This movie is a laugh fest from beginning to end. Well written and never a dull moment. Even though we have an all female cast in here this isn't a chick flick. There is some romance in the film but it is very minimal and works in the story and isn't forced into it just to have it in there. I heard they're planning a sequel to this movie but without Wiig. I could see that working if it is super well written but I really think Wiig would be missed. In this movie she basically plays the sane person that reacts the the madness around her coming from the other crazy female cast. I guess the only good thing about Hangover is that is brought these kind of comedies into the mainstream light.<br/><br/>GO RENT THIS NOW."

At the time of viewing IMDb rating was only a 7, so this left us with a low expectation. Pleasantly surprised, and Kristen Wig was fantastic. We finished up wondering what all those who rated this lowly actually expected. Great movie, entertaining and light. The laughs were nicely spread out through the movie and at no stage did it lag. Some great supporting cast with the guy from the English TV series The IT crowd and also Matt Lucas from Little Britain. Don't expect them to be funnier or get too much limelight. the star of the show is Wiig.

Lillian was a little boring but the rest of the cast did good jobs with their roles. <br/><br/>There were parts of this movie that had you laughing so hard, most of which was because of Megan and the movies kept a good pace also.

","Ever since this movie came out, I've heard great things about it, still, I was hesitant to see it. I mean bridesmaids, a wedding, I just wasn't sure. It was however produced by Judd Apatow, and that alone made me give it a chance. Basically, Bridesmaids is a girls version of The Hangover meets Knocked Up, with an almost trip to Vegas and without the hangover. Kristen Wiig is the writer and star of this film and she was great! I'd never even heard of her before this film came out, but after seeing it, I want a lot more. It seems pretty hard for a woman to make it in comedy, it's a fairly rare event, but she's got a tremendous future ahead of her. As for the story it's pretty solid, it's a comedy, so you're not really looking for realism, just something cohesive that you can follow and this definitely fits the bill. If you're looking for something funny, but different, I'd highly recommend this film."

Where the Hangover stuck to the main plot throughout the entire film, Bridesmaids flips back & forth between Annie's personal/love life and her role in her best friend's wedding.

"ashleywhittaker","Null","1","3","14 August 2011"," Gross out yet touching best friend flick
","Bridesmaids implores you to, 'Save the date', as the all-female cast glare menacingly in their pink meringue frocks from the poster. For all its gown fittings, cake tastings and bachelorette frolicking, Bridesmaids really brings it with the toilet humour. This is definitely not one to take your mother or a first date to. You'll know what I mean once you experience the pillow bitingly graphic sex scene that opens the film. I should warn the fainter of heart that this seemingly lady friendly, wedding-themed, rom-com comes from the creative loins of one Judd Apatow; the man responsible for gross-out genre hits including, 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad. <br/><br/>Perhaps not so well known this side of the pond is the film's writer, Kristen Wiig, who has successfully helmed the team at Saturday Night Live alongside the likes of Tina Fey since 2005. Honing her craft as part of the infamous Los Angeles comedy sketch group, the Groundlings, Wiig is comfortable among a cast of like-minded women who you will just about recognise from bit parts in various indie flicks and alternative US comedy series. A notable scene stealer comes in the form of Melissa McCarthy; a regular on US cable, she does a 180 degree turn from her usual style to portray Megan, the groom's masculine yet predatorily hetero sister. McCarthy is hardly a rose between thorns though amongst this cast of truly glittering comedic performances.<br/><br/>In fairness, I could describe Bridesmaids as the all-girl version of recent hit, The Hangover, but in truth, it's so much more than that. Sure, it follows the fool proof plot of, best friends forever-one gets engaged-they both set out to plan the best wedding ever-jealousy sets in-a rift arises-then all is forgotten with a heart wrenching reunion, but what else do you want from a light-hearted rom-com? Having seen both, I can attest that the script is infinitely more natural and less cheesy than the Hangover and I give full credit to the aforementioned Wiig. Admittedly, the in your face toilet humour does seem more jarring when delivered by females, but that says more about the Neanderthal mentality of us viewers. You will be shocked to see the bride, Maya Rudolph, defecating in an unthinkable location and even women's' the irresponsible drunkenness seems somehow more upsetting, but Bridesmaids is a trail blazer in this sense. It's nothing we haven't seen before in cinema, it's just being said from behind a particularly beautiful bridal gown.<br/><br/>For those of you expecting a reprisal of that hallowed, long anticipated girls' night out to the cinema of 2008 (and, undoubtedly, again just last summer for the sequel) be aware that Bridesmaids is the anti Sex in the City. In my opinion, and I loved SATC 1 and 2, this is a good thing. Bridesmaids doesn't skimp on drama or laughs, yet manages to create authentic relationships between relatable women. It's surprising to find a film that subtly imparts touching life lessons alongside diarrhoea and vomit explosions but Bridesmaids delivers just that. Tell your boyfriend from me that I promise he won't be bored and please, for the love of god, don't eat before you watch it."
"UnderCeej","Null","1","3","17 August 2011"," Can't see by this movie! Actually laugh-out-loud at more than a few parts!
","So, after going to the movies to see Bridesmaids twice, I felt I had to write a review here for anyone who might be on the cusp of seeing it.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Yes, it's true to be said there are a fair few ""cheap"" jokes, the diarrhoea scene for one, and also the running joke about Annie and her f*ck-buddy. But as any girl will tell you, (and don't be fooled, the film is definitely aimed at girls), it's very true to life. We've all felt that feeling of someone encroaching on your best friend, that we desperately keep returning to that one person who isn't good for us and is never going to change, and then falling in love and feeling like you've f*cked it up.<br/><br/>It all comes good in the end though :)<br/><br/>One thing needs to be said. Almost every scene with Megan (Melissa McCarthy) had me in utter stitches. The woman is absolutely fantastic in this movie, and actually made me find it as funny as I did. <br/><br/>8 out of 10 for me. Best feel-good movie I've seen in a good few years."
"mirwais-orbit","8","1","3","14 August 2011"," Great honest performances
","Bridesmaids really is what is seems: a funny, loose, entertaining and interesting movie with well developed characters that use a simple story to show the relationship between them and also their personal crisis, all centered by a woman that is living the worst moments of her life few days before her best friend's wedding.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is being compared to The Hangover (2011) which isn't fair, because this one may seems a chick flick but it's not just for having more important qualities. The Hangover is just a male celebration without any other interest than just make audience laugh and have fun with absurd situations involving male culture and cliché comedy situations effectively used.<br/><br/>Written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, the movie is not absurd. The female culture is there for sure when talking about marriage crisis and all that bridesmaids culture, but it's just a background story. The personal dramas, the difficulties to achieve some objectives in life, relationship crisis between love and friends, the feeling that the world is conspiring against your wills... all of this is universal and everyone goes thru it at least one time in life. The movie shows it all in brilliant small doses without being corny for the effective use of comedy moments to relieve what would seems melodramatic, also it's not cheesy because there are amazing performances by an ensemble cast that most of the times use improvised dialogs and moments, making the movie flows naturally and with no pressures or high intents to be funny.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig shines and gears entire movie, her performance is stunning. Being or not being based on personal experiences, her character fits her perfectly. Rose Byrne also have her important moments and proves one more time that she's getting better with each new work. The other supporting characters are well placed, even some of them being a little underused.<br/><br/>Predictable? Yes, but loved it anyway. It's impossible not be fascinated by so charismatic characters within simple and at the same time amazing funny and heartfelt moments that never requires more than great honest performances.<br/><br/>As another one said: ""It's strong proof that one can make a comedy about women without it ever being stupid, sexist, or mean-spirited."""
"Jpeffer","7","1","3","14 August 2011"," Very funny female comedy
","Kristen Wiig is without a doubt one of the best members of the Saturday Night Live cast. She's had some moderate success in movies so far with supporting roles in Paul, Whip It, and a very small role in the comedy Date Night. I've been wanting to see her get a starring role for quite sometime now, but does it end up being good or not? In Bridesmaids, Annie (Kristen Wiig) is picked to be the maid of honor by her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Annie and Lillian have been best friends since they were young and Annie, getting to be her best friends maid of honor, should be lots of fun and a time to make some great memories right? Wrong. Once Annie gets introduced to another member of the bridal party Helen (Rose Byrne), all hell breaks loose between them. We get the two of them bickering throughout the majority of the movie and trying to one up each other to show Lillian how much better they are than one another. Along for the ride is the rest of the bridal party played by the likes of Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper from The Office, and Melissa McCarthy, who ends up stealing the entire movie.<br/><br/>There is also a subplot involving Annie and a police officer played by Chris O'Dowd. While a few of the scenes between them feel unnecessary, O'Dowd comes off as sweet and funny in the nice guy role. Another subplot involves Mad Men's Jon Hamm but he feels underused and surprisingly isn't very funny in his role. One problem that I have with this movie is the back and forth with Wiig and Byrne. While both women are good in their roles the scenes where they try to one up each other just come off as annoying and make their characters, especially Bryne's, unlikeable.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie ends up being quite hilarious overall. Wiig shows that she can be a leading lady in a comedy. Maya Rudolph continues to show off her comedic chops time and time again and we get a breakout star in Melissa McCarthy.<br/><br/>Other than a scene involving gross-out humor the movie is a funny, raunchy, and sometimes sweet comedy that pretty much all women, and even a good bit of men are sure, to enjoy.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10"
"trash0906","Null","1","3","14 August 2011"," Decently Funny and Heartfelt, A Bit Chick-Flicky, Not Really Gross
","So, you all know the story. Kristen Wiig plays Annie, the oldest best friend of Lillian (Maya Rudolf), the bride. Annie is down on her luck after her bakery goes out of business, and she has a cad of a boyfriend played by John Hamm. Lillian asks Annie to be her maid of honor. However, Lillian now has another close friend named Helen (played by Rose Byrne). Helen is wealthy, beautiful, thin, and sophisticated. So, Helen begins to dominate the wedding activities like picking the dresses, planning the bachelorette party, hosting the wedding shower, etc. Annie's bridesmaid outing to a Brazilian Steakhouse is a big flop, and everything Helen does is beautiful. Annie gets really jealous and ticked off by Helen and after many problems, gets kicked out of the wedding by Lillian.<br/><br/>This movie was just decent for me. Fairly funny with a few times where the crowd did burst into laughter. However, it was not laughs from start to finish. The characters were pretty well developed, and it was a bit chick-flicky. Annie has some pity party moments, and near the end Lillian and Annie sit on Lillian's bed and talk over all Lillian's bride panic problems. That was a bit ""womanly"" emotional stuff to me (a guy).<br/><br/>A pleasant surprise was Chris O'Dowd playing a cop, Officer Nathan Rhodes. He pulls Annie over for broken tail lights on her car. Nathan is charming, funny, believable, and sincere as he falls for Annie.<br/><br/>Other reviewers complain about the toilet humor and sex in the movie. I did not see any problem with it. The toilet issues relate to food poisoning, and are limited to one scene. There is relatively little sexual content. A couple of scenes of Annie lying next to a man in bed with no action or body parts. Just lying in bed. A few humorous bits of dialog here and there about sexual topics, but nothing really graphic or gross.<br/><br/>Worth the $1.50 I paid for it."

"scarletheels","7","1","3","6 August 2011"," Chick Flick Made Palpable for Men by Using Raunchy Humor
","Annie (Kristen Wiig), a down-and-out woman who's lost her business and boyfriend, is invited to be her childhood friend's (Lillian, played by Maya Rudolph) Maid of Honor. Coordinating the wedding is the insanely rich and pretentious wife of the bride's husband's boss, Helen (Rose Byrne), who from the get-go, tirelessly competes for Lillian's attention. In the mix are Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a housewife who is desperate to escape the confines of suburbia, Becca (Ellie Kemper), a clueless newlywed, and Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the groom's crass sister. The subtle rivalry between Annie and Helen eventually backfires on the both of them and it's up to the two adversaries to put aside their differences in order to save the big day.<br/><br/>One of the more hyped-up movies of 2011, Bridesmaids is marketed as a raunchy, female version of The Hangover, which is understandable but unnecessarily deceiving. The only correlation between the two is an impending marriage. This is less about the bridesmaids and more about about its central character, Annie, a self-loathing, loveless character who projects her negative attitude on to anyone who has the misfortune to cross paths with her. They include customers in the jewelry store she works at, Nathan (Chris O'Dowd), the baby-faced cop she ends up romancing, and her own best friend. At times, Annie is difficult to empathize with because she's such a destructive force. She's so intent on sabotaging herself that she loses her job and drives away a man who only wants to see her succeed and be happy.<br/><br/>You may not realize it right away but Bridesmaids is a chick flick that's been made palpable for men with some raunchy (though implied) humor and the really funny comedic relief of Melissa McCarthy. Kristen Wiig shows quite a bit of restraint, to the point where I wondered if this is the same ham of Saturday Night Live fame. I was disappointed, especially during the airplane scene, which was her moment to shine. It seemed like such a wasted opportunity, both for Wiig and her fans. Whether this was her choice or the director's, I don't know. McLendon- Covey and Kemper receive limited screen time, as does John Hamm, who plays Wiig's boorish, inconsiderate 'fuck buddy'.<br/><br/>Besides McCarthy, O'Dowd and Byrne deserve pats on the backs for their performances. O'Dowd may seem out of place with his Irish accent but he manages to infuse some much needed positive energy. He's silly and lovable with amusing observations about life and his law enforcement profession. My favorite was the quip about the ugly carrot in every bag (and I just ate it). Byrne as the gorgeous, impeccably groomed trophy wife was perfectly cast, as well.<br/><br/>The film clocks in at two hours and five minutes, thanks to jokes getting stretched well past their expiration. I like Kristen Wiig but her writing, especially the dialog, doesn't always gel. Sometimes, it's obvious a scene exists solely to showcase herself as 'the emerging female comedian' yet she never fully satisfies. Other times, the banter between characters is so unrealistic and outrageous that it's no longer humorous but outright awkward to watch. I squirmed more during the jewelry store scenes than I did during the much talked about diarrhea outbreak. Kristen Wiig is no Tina Fey but I don't hold that against her."

This movie was hilarious from beginning till end!!! Kristen was awesome, believable, relate-able. Melissa Mc Carthy stole the show for sure!!! This movie was over 2 hours, but it did not seem too long at all. There was never a dull moment! I saw this twice, once with girlfriends and once with my husband and another couple. The second time, my friend's husband was laughing louder than any woman in the theater!! There is raunchy jokes, potty humor and language in this film.

","I know that I am behind everybody else, but I just saw Bridesmaids on Sunday and I thought that it was funnier than any movie I have seen in a long time,blowing The Hangover 1 and 2 and Due date and Hall pass away.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig finally gets a lead role as Annie, a woman who is sort of having a life crisis. She can't find happiness. She had a business that failed, she is currently sleeping with a man(Jon Hamm) who makes her feel bad about herself, and now her best friend(Maya Rudolph) is engaged.<br/><br/>Its bridal shower that really sends her off of the deep end. She has to compete against Helen(the diabolically hatable Rose Byrne) for her friendship, and just this competition alone makes her go bonkers. Annie is also having a hard time balancing her relationship with Nathan(Chris O'Dowd), a cop who she flirts with.<br/><br/>The premise has been done to death... by the groomsmen. And now that the Bridesmaids have gotten their chance to shine, I would rather see another film like this one, instead of another Bachelor Party or, God forbid, The Hangover Part III.<br/><br/>I love Kristen Wiig. She is the star of SNL, and I will be sad if she leaves. I have enjoyed her minor roles in Whip it, Adventureland, Ghost Town, and Knocked up, but Bridesmaids is the film she deserves. She is the heart and soul of this film, and the way she connects with the audience is just marvelous. You feel for her, and you root for her. A wonderful performance.<br/><br/>The other performances are excellent also. Chris O'Dowd, who also had minor parts before this film, is delightful and lovable. But the Bridesmaids are the real deal. The other Bridesmaids are played by Ellie Kemper, the sweet innocent one, Wendi Mclendon-Covey, the foulmouthed parent, and last, but definitely not least, the scene stealing Melissa Mcarthy, the obnoxious one. Mcarthy truly steals the show here.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is a hilarious film. Men will look at it like its a chick flick, while they should look at it like the women's Hangover. The better Hangover. I hope Wiig doesn't decide to make a sequel to this heartfelt and hilarious comedy.Please, don't ruin it, and don't miss it. See it as soon as possible. This is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>A-"

","It turns out I'm a girl. I did not get the hype over The Hangover at all, and I laugh at a lot of anything and everything. I just found it dull, predictable, and completely forgettable. I was truly reluctant to go see Bridesmaids because it was so hyped as the woman's Hangover. Ugh. Furthermore, my own bridesmaiding memories are neither endearing nor funny. I broke down though, having gone through everything else I wanted to see in the last several months, and went. What a wonderful surprise. <br/><br/>I liked that it wasn't one cliché laugh after another, but very genuine huge laughs in the right places. Loved that there was an actual plot to it that was pretty real in amongst the escapades that were over the top for the laughs. If this is the girly version of the current comedies, maybe I am a girl after all. <br/><br/>** SPOILER ** My only criticism is maybe just a preference. I knew from right after girl met boy that boy will catch girl in the end. Too predictable / overdone. Not sure how I'd change that because I am also tired of the All Men Are Jerks themes in some 'women's' comedies, and Rhodes served to show us a decent guy who was not a pushover. Will have to think about what else can be done to prevent that predictability. <br/><br/>** end SPOILER **<br/><br/>Last comment. Love that they all looked like real people and all gorgeous."

Another kind of girl movie, it has been said.<br/><br/>But the difference is maybe just the fact that the women here are doing the same things as guys have in just too many movies. There are the common stereotypes. The girls who have known each other since childhood, the disgusting and mean rich bitch, the overweight woman who anyway is ""a real person"". They get food-poisoned, drunk and have conflicts. You've seen it before, but that was about guys.<br/><br/>Certainly there are funny scenes and Kristen Wiig is very good including much warmth.

"PartialMovieViewer","3","1","3","21 July 2011"," Funny Surprise
","This was actually a really nice surprise. I pictured myself cringing through two hours of insufferable pain, while paying down the, 'Pay-Back Movie Contract'. Was I ever wrong? Maybe I should stop right there. You probably do not know what the, 'Pay-Back Movie Contract' is. That is OK, I will explain - I am here for that. Let's say a guy takes his wife or significant other to an action or scary movie. You walk out of the theater discussing different segments of the movie you just viewed. Little did you know that a legal and binding contract was being filed in the cerebral court of one's spouse. You better respect that contract, or else. Enough of all that. When I found out that we were going to see Bridesmaids I knew I had to prepare, but I did not have the time to dream up an illness or excuse. I was in for it. I mean - even the name implied the movie would be bad for man-viewers. I knew this was going to be a massively gross chick flickmy brain began to scream so load I thought my coronal sutures would fail. About ten to fifteen minutes into the film, I had to eat my words. Even though the movie depended heavily on poddy and poopy based juvenile humor, I could not stop laughing. I may not like many shows for women (This is probably because I am not a woman) and I don't care about touchy-feely, boo-hoo, fluffy-foo-foo characters caught in some never-ending, non-stop, redundant story about chicky junk - I enjoyed this flick.

"3xHCCH","5","1","3","21 July 2011"," Drama Parts Actually Outshine the Funny Parts in this Comedy
","I am not really used to watching a comedy where all the main actors were women. This is especially if the comedy is Rated R, raunchy, and vulgar which we are more used to seeing with male actors. I do not even know any of the cast members in this movie very well. I just watched this because of its reputation as a sleeper comedy hit in the US. <br/><br/>In a very short summary, ""Bridesmaids"" could roughly be compared to a female version of ""The Hangover"" as all the character's misadventures lead up to a climactic wedding at the end. Basically it is about Annie (Kristen Wiig) whose best friend since childhood Lilian (Maya Rudolph) is about to get married. However, with all the unfortunate things (lost business, bad boyfriend, bad housemates) that were happening in Annie's life at that moment, even her friendship with Lilian was being strained by the pushiness of Lilian's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne) in one-upping Annie in the preparation for the wedding.<br/><br/>The funniest scene for me was when Annie was trying her darnedest to catch the attention of a cop to get him to help her look for Lilian. This scene really made Wiig shine in her physical comedy, really hilarious. Too bad though that lot of the other gags were quite awkward and uncomfortable to watch, especially the one in the bridal shop, that one of the plane to Vegas, or anything with Annie's jerk of a sex partner. Unfortunately these rather unfunny scenes took a very prolonged time. <br/><br/>Ironically for a movie that was supposed to be a raunchy comedy, the dramatic scenes were actually quite good. You can see in my summary of the story line that there is actually a very real conflict here that can try friendships. Everything after the funny scene I described above leading up to the charming ending was very good. I also sort of liked the surprise guest appearance during the wedding, a very nice touch."

"Generic_Gooner","7","1","3","17 July 2011"," Refreshing...
","OK, so the idea that this is the female 'hangover' is not entirely the comparison to draw, but in many ways i can see why its said. <br/><br/>What i like most about this film is it has seemingly drawn inspiration from a film like the hangover but has not just tried to make the same story with a female cast. <br/><br/>For a start when you are working with ladies as the main characters the extreme comedy and gross out areas don't bring the same comedy value. Where comedy born out of misfortune requires you to love the character but also not care enough about them so as to find it funny when they fail in some way, its harder to strike that balance with a female without either making them too adorable or making them too bitchy. Its sort of sexist as a point but there really are one rule for one and one for another. For example, a guy gets a beat down from a girl in a scene and done right can bring a laugh. Can you imagine trying to pull a laugh from a guy beating on a woman? Ain't going to happen nor should it. <br/><br/>I like that this film took a foundation with a feminine touch and obvious chick flick markers and then added to it genuine comedy moments that didn't rely on the gender of the character to emphasise the scene. <br/><br/>It was good to not simply have a whiney tale of girl power, it showed that these were women who knew their own mind, had their own problems and made their own mistakes. <br/><br/>I liked also how the character who was played for slapstick value in megan (very much initially in the Zach Galifianakis role as the odd ball future in law) didn't just stay as this freaky peripheral player but steps up to instill some much needed tough love and give an insight into the fact that her character is actually a very successful woman in her career... emphasising as ever that you don't judge a book by its cover. <br/><br/>Overall the film paced perfectly with only a few noticeable exceptions where they felt a need to leave us wallowing along with the lead character a few too many times (taking a sledgehammer to a walnut, we already sympathised with her and liked her after the early scenes, it didn't need further pity plays), and it left us on a satisfactory conclusion. <br/><br/>I would hope this film doesn't try and dip in for a sequel, as i cant see a great scope for one and will be simply a cash cow that will take the shine of the original film."

","Hollywood is constantly pumping out crude, gross-out comedies aimed at testosterone-charged young men, so it's a change to have a comedy with a good dose of both crudity and grossness aimed at women of an older age demographic. ""Bridesmaids"" is a chick-flick that will appeal to many guys too and, at its best, it is laugh-out loud funny.<br/><br/>At its core is Kristen Wiig as maid of honour Annie who gives a marvellously naturalistic performance that reminds us of Meg Ryan at her height (""When Harry Met Sally"") and Wiig - familiar to American viewers but unknown outside North America - also deserves credit as co-author of the often sharp and acerbic script.<br/><br/>But is this a movie that feminists will find appealing? I'm glad you asked. On the one hand, there are six leading roles for women actors here and ultimately the film is about female friendship and support. We avoid the bums and breasts that would be in a male-oriented gross-out, but lovemaking scenes in which the woman wears her underwear look ridiculous and we still have vomit and faeces.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a narrative that places at its heart the notion that the marriage ceremony and all that leads up to it is the height of any woman's aspiration and consequently worth throwing inordinate amounts of energy, time and money at is deeply unfeminist. And the only developed male character in the movie is an Irish state patrolman of unbelievable gentleness."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","1","3","14 July 2011"," Superbly acted, believably scripted, and delightfully vulgar: all in one.
","Today, I got out to see Bridesmaids, a raunchy female-driven comedy that stars Kristen Wiig as Annie, a woman in her 30's, living in Milwaukee, and crumbling under personal crises. She's gone through a bad break up, has been forced to shut down her bakery, and has also been chosen by her recently engaged best friend, Lillian (Played by Maya Rudolph), to be the maid of honor at her wedding, but due to this wedding, Annie fears that she may lose the one relationship she's been clinging desperately to, and along the way, discovers that she needs to get her own priorities in line.<br/><br/>Director Paul Feig, and especially screenwriters Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig delight in blending real human flaws and quirks with gross out gags and snappy one-liners, while still being able to retain control of character development. The movie is very sweet and thoughtful, and it's also the funniest movie I've seen this year, so far, even if not everything in the picture works. It has a slight tendency to drag, and a hit or miss romance subplot between Annie and an Irish cop.<br/><br/>But where would this movie be without its great ensemble cast? One of the main cast standouts is obviously Wiig. She gives it her all in a quirky, and quietly subtle performance that holds the whole movie together. She proves she's got lead star chops to spare, so I'll be waiting in line for her next movie.<br/><br/>Not to be forgotten is co-cast standout, Rose Byrne, who plays Lillian's rich, over preparing friend, Helen, with whom Annie is constantly competing with, and whenever Byrne takes the stage, she doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Then there's Melissa McCarthy, who earns some of the biggest laughs in the movie as Megan, the raunchy sister of Lillian's fiancé. They're just the tipping point of a great cast that also includes Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, as well as the final film appearance of Jill Clayburgh.

","How one feels about the raunchy female kink-fest Bridesmaids also hinges on how much one likes (and/or can tolerate) the old Wilson-Phillips standby, ""Hold On"" (for real). The song is an admitted guilty-pleasure to many (including myself); but Bridesmaids shouldn't be quite the guilty pleasure as that song as there should be NO guilt in liking this female driven Judd Apatow-production (thanks to him we have Superbad, Knocked-Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Anchorman, Step Brothers etc in our video libraries!!). <br/><br/>It is a rare female-driven bawdy comedy along the lines of The Hangover (but NOT as graphic or extreme) that is smart, crafty and emotionally-driven with a mature-comedic performance by its star, Kristen Wiig (SNL, Knocked Up, Whip It). Wiig's Annie finds her life spiraling downward after her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph - SNL, Idiocracy, Away We Go) becomes engaged and her life appears to be approaching ""perfection"". I MUST say and stress that Wiig is a marvel here and her bridal shower meltdown is one for the record books (cookie, anyone?!). Wiig may have been around for years; but this performance solidified her as a comedy star.<br/><br/>With a ""new"" best friend (Rose Byrne - Sunshine, 28 Weeks Later, Insidious, ""Damages"") who steamrolls into Lillian's life, Annie feels abandoned and alone when all of her thoughts and concerns should be focused on the upcoming nuptials of her best friend. The drama that plays out behind the film's comedy is surprisingly sophisticated and grown-up and very realistic. Add to this comedy-drama some fine-supporting players as in the UNCREDITED sleazy/sexist Jon Hamm (""Mad Men"", The Town, The Day the Earth Stood Still); a still radiant but SADLY late Jill Clayburgh (Love and Other Drugs, An Unmarried Woman, Running with Scissors) in her last role; and a perky Ellie Kemper (Somewhere, ""The Office"", Get Him to the Greek) and Bridesmaids has a little bit of everything for everyone (although fellow supporting player Melissa McCarthy of TV's ""Mike & Molly"" takes it a bit too far).<br/><br/>Even if the film is all-about Annie and her fellow bridesmaids ... I think the story of ANYone being ""left behind"" as a friend moves onto the next stages of his/her life is a universal one. Wiig's performance captures the fragility of a scared individual who's life has not turned out according to plan ... but as the story (and song) can attest -- if one can ""hold on for one more day ..."" things may change.<br/><br/>Life does come at us one day at a time ... it is too bad that films like this come around much less often. I must say that I highly enjoyed Bridesmaids after seeing it ONE time; but my opinion has only gotten stronger and improved with each subsequent viewing! I think this movie is something rather special."

","So I saw this with my mom, which is the perfect person to see it with. As this movie encompasses nothing more than an uncomfortable intro, a warming middle section, and an ""I have a cramp from laughing"" ending.<br/><br/>From the beginning scenes you couldn't really tell if you would enjoy this film or be suffering through 2+ hours of I want to be funny but I am not really! The best friend chemistry between Maya Rudolph and Kristian Wiig was hard to find. Despite this however, out of no where you find yourself smiling. And it turns out that smile was the movie stretching your face muscles for some strong laughs that last through out the film. The film follows in the tradition of the ""Hang Over,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" and ""40 year Old Virgin."" But it stands on it own by presenting a strongly funny all female cast that could be the beginning of a new comedic voice(Kristin Wigg). Just wish it could have been about a 1/2 hour shorter."
"mad_mandonna","9","1","3","29 June 2011"," Great comedy for all to enjoy
","What I loved about this film mostly is these ladies don't mind not looking glamorous if it means they will get a laugh. This is a rare thing, Hollywood women rarely are seen in an uncompromising state. Taking a film like the hangover, the women are sensible and the men make complete fools of themselves. Heaven forbid the ladies look like they have fun, its a rather stifling look at women in comedy, especially when you look at romantic comedies where the female leads rarely make much of a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Enter Bridesmaids which is unashamedly funny, there are so many laugh out loud moments that some of the slower moments can be forgiven. The lead performance by Kristen Wigg is fantastic, as a neurotic down her luck girl, with a sharp tongue and a magnet for disaster. Bridesmaids works in the same way The hangover did, a great ensemble in that each bring something different to the table. Though at times I felt more could have been done with the supporting cast, Kristen Wiggs character is so much fun its only a minor grievance.<br/><br/>The film is a laugh riot that should appeal to everyone, despite it looking more like a girls film, it is genuinely universally amusing. In fact there is enough gross out humour to compete with likes of American Pie.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is without a doubt the funniest film I've seen this year, though the ending I felt was a little bit too neat any negatives are fairly minor and are made up for by so many laugh out loud moments. I would rather watch this a thousand times than watch the hangover part 2 again."

","Just lately i have really struggled to find many films enjoyable. With either too much explaining, lame jokes or poor character development. I felt that character development in this film good-even if the main character was a total unlikeable ""person"". How selfish can one woman be, I didn't like the engagement party scene or the shower, as it made the lead just awful, if one of my friends behaved like that, well we wouldn't be friends for long. And why didn't the bride say anything? The fact that Annie and Lillian were meant to be such good friends yet Annie had not met anyone except Lillians cousin, years ago-very unrealistic.<br/><br/>Some good points were, the opening scene-we've all been with someone who doesn't match us in bed, the end scene, truly beautiful, and the character's of Megan and Rita, not so sure about Becca, she seemed a weird ad-on to make the girls an even number. I would watch this film again-it'll be interesting to see if i feel the same after watching it at home.<br/><br/>Anyway I generally really enjoyed the film, it was exactly as I expected."

","The healthy vein of cynicism in my makeup suggested that this just had to be over-hyped certainly in terms of vulgarity and/or outrageousness and I was right. Whilst the crass scenes were mildly amusing if those were all there was to the film it would fade from the memory as you walk up the aisle at the end. What I found much more appealing was the undercurrent of genuine melancholy and the fine writing and outstanding performance of Kristen Wiig. Not unnaturally perhaps she has written a great part for herself but she's in good company, in 1924 Noel Coward wrote a play-stealing role in The Vortex, played it himself and was never heard of again. Kristen Wiig is one of those actresses you radiate warmth whilst contriving to be brittle, again, she's in good company, think Celeste Holm, Eve Arden. Looks like I'm in love again."

"Enchorde","3","1","4","12 February 2019"," Disappointing
","I was told that Bridesmaids was a refreshing new look, out of the perspective of a woman, of the buddy comedy, such as The Hangover. And in some ways it is, some ways it isn't.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids do certainly put the action in the lap of the women, the number of men in the movie is easily counted for they are few. It will certainly pass the Bechdel test if anyone is interested, although a lot of the women characters is referencing their lives to the men around them (which is a bit that I expected that the movie should try to avoid). The comedy is based much on the social intricacies of the group in a way that similar (""male perspective"") movies don't. So that is somethinng new.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Bridesmaids, in an attempt to be the counterpart to The Hangover, copies a lot of jokes from that type of movies. It is far too much of juvenile toilet humor, and that is in my view the least fun of comedy out there. I had hoped they would go another direction, but unfortunately no.<br/><br/>The only other type of comedy is when the character Annie (Wiig) makes a complete fool out of herself. I don't know who was embarrased the most, me or the character. I know that this is a common theme for jokes and comedy, but it is not to my taste (here actually The Hangover does it better, using wierd situations and characters to build up the comedy). So, there is toilet humor and embarrasment, and unfortunately not much else. Not much of variation and the movie relies too much on just a single track of comedy.<br/><br/>McCarthy was nominated for an Oscar in a supporting role, but can't really see why. The role is very minor and not that funny at all. McCarthy has been better in many other works, Gilmore Girls for example.<br/><br/>No, this movie was not for me. Maybe I am not of the target audience, but I found it became dull and boring as it started to repeat itself."

","Bridesmaids directed by Paul Feig, introduced a movie not only for women, but also for men. It was released to theaters on May 13, 2011 and was a box office success. This movie brought in the raunchiness of The Hangover, but appealed it to women. It showed the main characters as a ""Group of women friends who are as unbehaved as the guys in ""The Hangover"""" (Ebert). Its crude humor made it appeal to both sexes and this is one of the most important elements of this film. ""A woman's point of view is one of the film's great distinctions"" (Morgenstern). Based on the trailer I did not believe it was going to be a very comical movie, but once hearing all the good words about it, I had to see it for myself. I thought the movie was going to be a typical maid of honor story, but I was happily surprised. The movie obtained great reviews from reputable sources; it had compelling characters, a comical plot, and incredible writing. IMDb rated Bridesmaids (Feig, 2011) a 6.9 out of 10, which is higher than average, but I think it could have been better. Roger Ebert had the right idea and gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and he believed that this movie made an attempt to cross the line from ""chick flick"" into Raunch comedy. Entertainment Weekly also believed this idea, ""Bridesmaids begins to leave every cookie-cutter ''chick flick'' miles behind"" (Gleiberman). This movie was not afraid to cross the line and this was shown during a lesbian kiss during the plane scene. Bridesmaids (Feig, 2011) showed the audience that men and women have an equal playing field and that even romance films can be for both sexes. Rolling Stone writer Peter Travers believed that the only downside of the movie was when it was trying to resemble and compete with The Hangover. Some people could have believed the movie contained too much sexual content, but it was definitely not too graphic. The raunchiness of the film added an extra uniqueness to this popular female dominated comedy. <br/><br/>The cast did a spectacular performance of their roles especially Melissa McCarthy. Her character Megan was a highlight of the movie because of her quirky and strange personality. Most of the audience's favorite scenes included Megan in a substantial way, such as the bridal shop food poisoning scene and the plane scene. In the plane scene she had great interactions with the ""air marshal,"" who in reality is her husband. This was an interesting addition to the film. McCarthy was not the only great supporting role. Rose Byrne who played Helen adapted right into her pushy and insufferable character (Morgenstern). One of the best parts of the movie was at the engagement party when Annie and Helen had to deliver speeches and it turned into a competition of who was a better friend to Lillian. Feig took a simple moment and expanded it into one of the most remembered scenes. Kristin Wiig was extraordinary and definitely excelled not only as an actress, but as a writer. In the movie she brought in some of her own mannerisms and made the character of Annie seem more real, and created a three-dimensional character (Gleiberman). Annie had a sad and hard life, which the audience could easily relate too. Annie lost her business and had to work in a job, which she hated. She had terrible roommates, a confusing love life, and a horrible car, which all combined to a train wreck of a life (Morgenstern). The main plot featured Annie and Helens' feud and through out the movie it progressed into funnier moments. The passive aggressive remarks towards each other developed the tension and the comedy in the film. There were multiple characters in the movie and one great thing about it was that it kept ""all the members of the bridal party in play"" (Ebert). The bridesmaids with the smaller roles developed along with the main characters. The character Becca slowly started to discover herself as she got to know Rita. The movie took a short time to look into their newfound friendship. There were not very many male characters, but the two that are predominately shown, did a great job. ""Jon Hamm scores howls as a man-whore, and Chris O'Dowd excels as an Irish cop sweet on Annie"" (Travers). Something that was probably not necessary was the addition of Annie's roommates. They did not support the story line and the movie could have done without them. Even though they provided some humor, they were only in about three short scenes. The writing by Kristin Wiig and Annie Mumolo made the film as popular as it is. The comical phrases such as, ""I'm gonna climb him like a tree"", ""It's coming out of me like lava"", and ""help me I'm poor,"" have become very quotable and memorable (Bridesmaids). The movie did not focus its attention on the romance side rather than on its comical side. The dysfunctional characters coming together in one bridal party was a simple idea, which had great results. Bridesmaids (Feig, 2011) is a movie, which lifts audiences' spirits when they are low. It is a movie, which will bring tears to your eyes and laughter in the room. Each character in the movie played their role to their best ability and achieved great popularity for their film."
"GenerationSilverScreen","1","1","4","24 July 2013"," Can you say, ""Overrated""?
","For a comedy, I really thought this would be a bit more, y'know... funny.<br/><br/>There are really only two ways ""Bridesmaids"" could have gotten this awful:<br/><br/>1. Bad comedy writers write bad comedy. 2. Good drama writers write good drama which is then turned into bad comedy.<br/><br/>See, here's the thing: Bridesmaids is a movie with an identity crisis; it can't pick a genre. It feels like a pretty good drama was written and then taken to the producers who said ""there are too many dramas out there; what we need is a comedy."" The times when this movie sucks the most are the times when you could tell the writers were trying to be funny- ""trying"" being the operative word, here. The fact that I can pick out every single supposed to be ""funny"" moment in the movie shows that it is not, in essence, a funny movie. <br/><br/>The best comedies I've ever seen had me laughing from beginning to end, with a few exceptions. If you asked me to pick out every time the writers put in a ""funny"" moment, I would probably end up telling you that the entire film was funny, and that it was too hard to pick out a few moments from that treasure trove of hilarity. Of course, comedy doesn't always mean ""laugh all the way through"", and I would have been just fine with only a few stabs at humor in this movie had they not all made me cringe until I disappeared into my seat. My friend watching with me tried to coax the people showing us the film to turn it off, because the level of idiocy had surpassed embarrassing.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it was the writing in the movie that made it unbearable for me. They couldn't figure out what kind of movie they were writing, and the price for being unclear conceptually is essentially a mess.<br/><br/>Did this movie have anything worth the 2 hours and 12 minutes it wasted of my life? Yes. Melissa McCarthy was actually pretty amusing. It probably helped that I already loved her from other films.<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes, you lost my respect when you gave this a 90/100."

","Whatever else ""Four weddings"" achieved, it certainly spawned an awful lot of comic wedding movies. This is not perfect but it is one of the better ones, with generally good quality dialogue, and some committed acting by the protagonists. It's also strongly influenced by the films which get all their laughs from bodily functions and swear words. Kristen Wiig, the star, wrote it herself with help from Annie Mumolo (who puts in an appearance in the airplane sequence). <br/><br/>Annie (Wiig) is to be one of several bridesmaids at her best friend Lillian's wedding (Maya Rudolph). Clever, arty Annie is fully expecting that she will play a major role in proceedings – choosing (or possibly making) the dresses, organising the bridal shower (what we in the UK would call the Hen Party), etc. However, Annie is increasingly sidelined by well-heeled bitchy snob Helen (the brilliant Rose Byrne), who manages to upstage her efforts at every turn. To make matters worse, all the other bridesmaids seem to prefer Helen's spectacular but somewhat derivative ideas to those of Annie. <br/><br/>Annie also has personal issues. She has lost all her money in a cake-making venture, she has no boyfriend and no prospects, she lives in an apartment with a monstrous couple of siblings (Matt Lucas and Rebel Wilson). Her 40-something life is going nowhere. On the plus side she has a one-night stand with Rhodes, a nice Irish policeman (Chris O'Dowd off ""The IT crowd""). She then ruins it by walking out on him while he is trying to persuade her to take up her cake-making again; despite the fact that they are clearly made for each other. She loses her job at a jewelry store after a hilarious exchange with a customer involving the C-word, and ends up going back to her mother (the great Jill Clayburgh). Meanwhile the preparations for the wedding are getting more manic and over-the-top. <br/><br/>After a number of wacky incidents, this being a comedy, we know everything will get sorted out. There are some genuinely touching and surprising moments, as well as some which fall a bit flat (I wasn't overly impressed by the airplane sequence to be honest). <br/><br/>A special mention goes to Melissa McCarthy as Megan, whose larger-than-life antics threaten to steal the show a couple of times. Despite some irritating mannerisms, Annie has wit and charm, and we want her to be happy. There seems to be ""chemistry"" between Wiig and O'Dowd. The film has some really funny moments, and some quite romantic ones. Anyway, I liked the film enough to watch it twice."

","For everyone whose life has hit rock bottom, or so they thought, we have Annie (played by Kristen Wiig). Working as a jewelry store clerk after suffering a massive business failure and living with two very, to say the least, eccentric fraternal twins despite being chronically late with the rent. Meanwhile, Lillian her best friend (played by Maya Rudolph) is engaged and to a man she's deeply in love with who makes a great living. And as her beast friend, Lillian enlists Annie to act as her maid of honor at her wedding. It's at the engagement party where Annie first meets Helen Harris (Rose Byrne). Helen's husband employs Lillian's fiancée and has become strangely close to her as a result. <br/><br/>The other bridesmaids provide little more than comic relief while Helen, who plans on the order of a Martha Stewart clone on steroids, is the antagonist as she seems intent on usurping Annie's role as maid of honor and Lillian's best friend which, given Lillian's impending change of address, appears to be a position that will be vacant soon enough. During all this, Annie's romantic life is complicated by a waning entanglement with a man whose interest in her is mainly physical and a relationship with kind and respectful police officer whom she met thanks to a long-broken taillight. <br/><br/>The story isn't all that interesting and the fact that only the audience sees things from Annie's point if view is near infuriating, in my opinion. That said, Wiig, Rudolph, Byrne and company are hilarious as the events depicted, though some seem meant to make the viewers cringe or test their gag reflex which runs counter to my personal taste. Funny, entertaining, and that's about it."

","As a comedy, to me, this movie just wasn't really good or funny enough. It actually was a pretty awkward movie to watch at times and I just can't understand why it is being liked so much. Oh well, perhaps I simply need to be a woman to 'get it'.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with this movie was that it was buildup like a realistic and serious movie, complete with emotions and women trouble and all but with yet also some truly over-the-top comedy thrown into it. This just wasn't a combination that worked out very good or felt organic to me. Some of the insane comical situations really seemed out of place and totally not in tone with any of the rest of the movie. This especially goes for the movie its gross out moments.<br/><br/>It's good and all that there is a big and popular comedy for- and by women for a change but I'm just incapable of seeing it as a great or fun one. But like I said, this is probably all because I'm male and just can't relate to any of the issues being handled in this movie, or just simply don't find them all that interesting or appealing. Yes, this foremost truly is a chick-flick, so if you are a female, simply just ignore what I have to say about it, since chances are you are going to have a totally different opinion- and feeling toward this movie.<br/><br/>But really, the movie as a whole doesn't seem to be all that well written or clever. It's of course mostly being predictable and most of the comical situations feel forced and like they were shoehorned in. Besides, it seemed so unlikely to me that all of these girls were all truly friends, since most of the them have very little in common. Some of the characters are also terribly underwritten and I have no idea why they were in this movie at all.<br/><br/>It's not like the actors were bad though. I known lots of people are always saying bad things about women doing comedy but this movie definitely shows that females are perfectly capable of handling comedy material. It of course helps that the movie is written by females. You could really tell that by basically everything that this movie was written by females for females. The dialog and story-flow all feel more natural because of this. I only did wish the comedy was something better and more natural feeling as well. But again, if you are a female, chances are you will still end up really liking this movie.<br/><br/>I wasn't all that impressed but then again, this movie clearly wasn't made for me.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I've been getting some stick of late from my lady that we always end up watching my movies...zombies, monsters, guns and horror. I consider myself to have a diverse and open-minded attitude to film, so wished to prove this to her by hiring ""Bridesmaids""...I mean, how bad could it be right? On the cover it had 5 stars from (what I thought) could be reliable sources and since some nut-bag declared that it was ""better than the hangover"" (which I mildly enjoyed...for slapstick eye-chewing gum)...I decided to give it time. Never before have I regretted wasting my evening on one particular entertainment item...so incensed at being lied to and conned by ""professionals"" and advertisement that I have decided to leave my bit on here for not only men seeking advice on this movie, but for anyone with any self respect and standards when it comes to film arts. Let me begin by explaining my 2 stars.<br/><br/>1) ACDC...""Dirty deeds done dirt cheap"" - (thank you for the momentary relief and reassurance that there are good things in the world), coupled with the young lads comment at the end of the tennis scene ""I've seen better tennis on a tampon commercial""...as far as one liners go, this was the pick of the film. <br/><br/>2) Melissa McCarthy. I'm sure most will agree the only semi-comical part in this drivel. The most 3D of characters, the most warming and genuine of the cast...but you were not involved nearly enough to save this train wreck.<br/><br/>So that's the good points...really. The rest was not as 'More Magazine' described as ""Pure Feel Good"". The rest was about a woman dealing with her depression, interspersed with cheap attempts at comedy. The bridal shop scene highlighting the result of food poisoning?? Come on...American Pie ring a bell? It would not of been so bad a thing if one could sympathise with the lead actress...but the writing made it feel as though she brought it all on herself, hardly the heroin...more the victim. Aside from the clunky and unbelievable flow of the proceedings, the relationships between the characters was so fake it was cringe- worthy...heightened by it's innate ability to prolong the torture of individual comic set-pieces such as the battle for the microphone during the engagement party. The trailers for this tripe did (as mentioned by other disgruntled reviewers) hint at it being a female-""hangover"", it had me believing it was a film about the antics of a group of colourful and larger than life characters on a hen do. But the hen do didn't even happen! The most we received was the totally unrealistic portrayal of Kristen Wiig drunk on a plane. How I ever managed to get to the end...the grand finale with the weddings special guest appearance...I will never know. However when that moment occurred I realised the film had hit a remarkable low...and so had I. <br/><br/>I have been assured from my girlfriend that women do not interact with each other in the way this film portrays...as it turns out she thought it was as poor as I did. I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not as 'The Daily Telegraph' states...""The funniest film of the year"", although I cannot presume to say what may tickle your funny bone, I can at least make a suggestion as to a movie of superior writing/directing/humour from 2011...rent ""Horrible bosses"" instead. Not a classic or gut-buster by any means, but certainly a funnier 2011 film than this pile of motion pictured flatulence. This is the first time I've ever left a review of any sort online...be it for a shopping purchase or restaurant dinner etc. My reasoning is that it was late by the time we finished and if I went to bed I would have not been able to sleep through the frustration and washing-machine stomach sensation that this movie has brought on. My release on here has somewhat helped...that and finishing the rest of the ""Dirty deeds..."" album. I hope that this review has not been received as a rant from a cynical guy taking a shot at a chick-flick...if it has, then perhaps I have absorbed all of the cynicism from critics, paid bundles of cash to offer the general public their expert advice, who declare Bridesmaids to be ""10 out of 10. Very, very, VERY funny"" (Daily Star...should have known better). A quote as grotesquely misguided and deluded as placing this film in the category - comedy. Please...do yourself a giant favour, don't bother with this. Play a game of blind scrabble, walk over hot coals with a nail spiked through each of your heals, eat a dozen live worms while listening to ""Spice Girls - Wannabe"" on repeat...and perhaps you shall enjoy your evening more than I.<br/><br/>Good night..."

This is more depressing than funny to watch. <br/><br/>I believed that this might be some ladies version of the popular film hangover, but you cannot compare it at all.

","Surprising in several ways how much I enjoyed this, expecting it to be a film for a female but it was far from that, in fact to the contrary it with much emphasis on a dry humour it was probably more suited to a male audience.<br/><br/>It was pleasantly refreshing to see, in the main, a more written based comedy rather than the simple visual and crude masturbation type gags of Hangover & the In Betweeners. I had to check a couple of times on the level of English imput into this film, as the style of humour was unlike anything I'd seen out of the States and after too many attempts to count have probably laughed more than three times at a film from outside of the UK or Australia for the first time since Airplane.<br/><br/>It's not to that standard, but can be applauded for at least half a dozen genuinely funny scenes, good characters and further refreshing to see it written by females. One of the criticisms, if any were that having watched the additional/deleted scenes there were several that probably warranted a place in the film and would have improved it.<br/><br/>7/10 is extremely low, given some of the recent films that pass as comedy on a rating closer to 8.

","this movie is off-the-hook funny. If you don't enjoy it you either live in a cave or under a rock. 10 out of 10 stars. And don't think this kind of drama does not happen in reality - it happens, every day. More surprising is which characters take the movie and run with it. Although the main character (the blonds) is SNL-funny in her own right, the heavy set sidekick is truly a gem in this one. NOT family friendly, but extremely funny nonetheless. One of our favorite movies in years past was Super Troopers and this movie literally plays along the smae lines (meow). I am certain they will have a sequel as this movie still has plenty of humor left on the table."

","I didn't see this in the theater when it came, but everybody said it was sooo funny (these were all women). I went in with an open mind and wanted to see a funny ""female"" version of THE HANGOVER, or something as funny.<br/><br/>Boy was I disappointed. The night before watching this, I saw BAD TEACHER, which was funny from start to finish. Far exceeding my expectations.<br/><br/>Then I went in to watch BRIDESMAIDS, and the opening scene was funny. The next scene with Wiig and Rudolph talking about penis was good. But... waiting... waiting... waiting... waiting...<br/><br/>This was what I was doing for, what seemed like 30 minutes. I was waiting for the next funny scene.<br/><br/>This movie felt like they were shooting a first draft of the script and didn't bother to take out the slow stuff. I was yelling at the screen... ""Alright! Alright! Move it! Get to the point!"" This was soooo slow and drawn out. Then... Rudolph shitting in the street was kinda funny after the ""forced"" jokes in the fitting scene. I mean forced. Melissa McCarthy shitting in the sink, was so forced and bad. No pun intended.<br/><br/>The worst scene was the airplane sequence. Just a bunch of weak little jokes, or failed attempts at jokes, with all the characters. There was set-ups that didn't pay off. It was just bad. They should have just cut that scene out. There was no real need for it. The point of the airplane scene (and the previous scenes where they discuss Vegas) was for this bachelorette (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) party that we NEVER EVEN GET TO SEE! One chick wants balls in her face, the other chick admits she's never slept with any man but her husband... set-ups... with NO PAY OFF! WHAT WAS THE POINT? The only funny thing I can remember next, was the scene where Wiig is trying to get the cops attention in her car, driving back and forth, drinking, topless, etc. That was funny, but...<br/><br/>That was it. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. They needed to have re-written this script, because there was lots of potential, that went wasted, in my opinion.<br/><br/>But, it made over $286 million worldwide, so, they got lucky with it.<br/><br/>I really wanted to love this one, but it wasn't for me. Maybe it was just meant for women."

","BRIDESMAIDS is not a film this viewer would normally have watched, but in a week where there is very little else available On Demand on television, the button parked here. In many ways the film was a surprise, actually better than expected. The promo for the film was that it was a female version of HANGOVER or BORAT, an attempt to demonstrate to guys that women can be just as gross and vulgar as men. But actually the story is more a tale of a group of sad women, unhappy in many ways with their relationships with not only men but also with other women. Written by star Kristen Wigg and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig it is a pulled together series of vignettes about women in distress, and while it does include the gross-out promises of PR (barf/flatulence/body insert references) and the manner in which women in competition behave, it still remains a story of how sad people cope.<br/><br/>Annie (Kristin Wiig) is a barely employed woman who has lost her dream of having her own bakery and having a meaningless physical relationship with cad Ted (Jon Hamm) relies on her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to get through life, until Lillian announces she is getting married and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Even though Annie is broke, living with a disgusting British brother and sister as a roomer, she accepts the responsibilities. The sparkle of the wedding dream plans fizzles when Annie meets the incongruous group of women who will be bridesmaids: the wealthy, haughty Helen (Rose Byrne), the obese socially gross Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the oversexed inappropriate mother Rita (Wendi McLendon McCarthy) and the silly insubstantial Becca (Ellie Kemper). In a series of gag moments - eating in a Brazilian café, trying on dresses, a grossly overdone flight in the direction of Las Vegas, and a preposterous wedding shower - the girls fall apart as potential friends only, of course, to some together in the end.<br/><br/>There are a few redeeming elements in the film that are worthy of attention - the Irish police officer Nathan Rhodes a sparkling Chris O'Dowd) who provides the only semblance of true sentiment in Annie's ridiculous life and Annie's mother played by Jill Clayburgh in what was to be her last role (she died of Leukemia seen after the film was completed). Kristin Wiig does carry the film, despite the fact that her expressions and character show minimal variation as the story plods along. But in the end, despite all the attempts to out-gross HANGOVER, this is a sad little film about bruised women and how their interdependence provides a way out of the meaningless lives they lead. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"alex-frey-pattaya","10","1","4","11 September 2011"," It's not what you think it is!
","It doesn't happen often that I would give 10 stars to a movie just like that but this one deserves it because it got balls, balls on what many viewers hope to be a chic flick which it is not to my satisfaction. If I knew what to expect I would rate this movie probably with 8.5 stars but after reading how disappointed the romantic comedy fraction is about this movie, who expected another boy meets girl, boy falls in love, they have a have a break up and get back together in the end kind of movie it deserves the whole 10 points. Haven't we seen them all? Haven't we seen them enough? I sure did and this movie kept surprising me the entire 2 hours. I didn't really know where it would go, I didn't know why it is going where it is going, and while it was crossing several lines of good taste it was surprisingly touching.<br/><br/>This movie got Kristen Wiig in the lead, she is not cut out for a romantic comedy, she is weird on SNL and she was weird in this movie and the role was perfect for her. This movie isn't even a comedy or a drama it is pure satire and it shows women doing men stuff. I am sure that is upsetting a lot of men and makes them insecure. The movie provides rare insight for men what women think about us men in bed and what they dream of, it is not another Cinderella Story and that is the charm about it. It was refreshing to see Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly) from her dark side, it actually fits her brilliantly and even me as a guy was charmed by Chris O'Dowd in his role as officer Rhodes.<br/><br/>This movie features plenty of scenes with profanity which I wouldn't dare to laugh at if it was done with men but since these things happened to women I simply loved it since I have never seen it before. This was a new kind of movie to me and I can only recommend to see it if you like dark satire and when you are not ashamed to see bad things happen to good people, if you are the type of person who likes to see one of those streamlined romantic comedies you will be disgusted. You certainly need a brain for this movie because it doesn't have a dramatic soundtrack that tells you where to laugh and where to cry it has no music whatsoever, it let's the characters act it out and that suits this movie quite well, however there are people who need a soundtrack since they don't know the concept of sarcasm and satire and they will end up confused.<br/><br/>I quote one of the other reviewers since he analyzed it brilliantly, this is the ultimate anti chick flick. This is a love it or hate it kind of film, the reviews clearly show that, it is new and provocative and in 10 years the same people who are ripping this movie apart today won't remember why they did it. As time goes by movies evolve and cross more and more lines, this movie is a front runner when it comes to that."
"bob the moo","Null","1","4","17 August 2011"," Delivers the laughs but remembers to keep the warmth and heart in there too
","I'd not had my fill of Judd Apatow movies when it came to Bridesmaids being released, but to be honest I was wondering how he managed to get as much success as he had and I had not loved his films as much as everyone else; so, although he was only executive producer of this, it was enough to make me wonder if it was worth the money. I went anyway and was pleased to find that the film not only did his style of humour but did it in such a way that the viewer is along for the ride and cares about the film rather than being on the outside, which I had found can happen with some of his own stuff.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids follows a group of women mostly in their mid-30's and focuses on Annie, who is semi-trapped in a f-buddy ""relationship"" because it is at least something even though it is not what she wants. When her best friend gets engaged, Annie finds herself in a battle of one-upmanship with Lillian's new friend Helen (who is quite wealthy) in terms of showering the bride-to-be with love. At the same time as losing these battles, Annie's unhappiness also ruins other aspects of her life. It is a fairly relatable tale, even for men but more importantly it is very funny.<br/><br/>In terms of the majority of the film what we have is a serious of comic misadventures for Annie as nice ideas turn sour; a pre-fitting meal turns into a terrible toilet-related experience, a fear of flying sees her drunk at 40000 feet and so on. All of it is pretty much par for the course (indeed the female characters even talk in the ""dude"" language of Apatow's films) but yet it works because it has energy and imagination in its execution. The script is tight as a drum and the awkward aspect of the comedy is well used. What really made it work for me though, was that I felt the film had a genuine heart and warmth to it that isn't always there with similar films. I understood Annie and also cared for her, so I had a connection to the film beyond waiting for the next laugh. Although the comedy did involve nudity, sex, bodily functions and swearing, it never felt cruel towards the characters or that any of the characters were simply written that way to get a laugh. Even with Megan, she was a funny character, but she was still a character I liked rather than just being the butt of jokes. I laughed frequently throughout but at the same time still cared about the characters.<br/><br/>The cast are all good even though it is the oddest cast selection I have seen in quite some time – so many odd sources, so many faces I know from TV (some of whom never even had a word to say). Wiig is really relatable and funny, with just enough edge of pained loneliness to carry that side of the film; OK she should pay 50% of her fee for this to Tina Fey because of how much of Fey is in her performance, but it works nonetheless. Rudolph is really natural and the rest of the group all have a similar air of realism. McCarthy is hilarious, even in little asides she is great; Kemper sort of repeats her Office turn to good effect; St Claire is funny in a limited way while Byrne is just a perfect bitch with money and fake smiles. The supporting cast beyond this are such an odd mix of names and faces that even a few days later I'm still thinking ""how did all of that come together"". Firstly the male lead is an Irish comedian famous for a UK sitcom; O'Dowd does a great job and I thought he had an easy chemistry that worked so well with Wiig, but he was still an odd find. Matt Lucas is here too, and there's Terry Crews in a tiny role (Everybody Hates Chris), and the N.General from Deadwood (Ajaye), and John Hamm, and Michael Scott's old boss David from The Office (who doesn't even get a word); it is an unusual cast to say the least but yet it works because everyone (even small roles) are on point.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is not too different from similar pack comedies that deal with grownup ""dudes"" struggling with adult life, but yet as an end product it is stronger than these similar products. That the stars are women is neither here nor there, the difference is that although the very funny comedy is based on bodily functions, sex and exaggeration as normal, Bridesmaids remembers that it helps to like the characters involved and that it helps to give the film at least some heart and warmth. It is this sense of charm and warmth that made the difference for me – not only was I laughing frequently, but I actually liked the film for how nice it was as well."

"gilligan-11","8","1","4","22 June 2011"," A smart and funny movie--not just for women
","A very funny movie, ""Bridesmaids"" is more than just a female take on ""The Hangover."" Although the movie did contain some thematically Hangover-like elements (general silliness and buffoonery), one scene in particular—and I'm talking about the scene when the bridesmaids all go shopping for their dresses after having dined at a questionable Brazilian restaurant—manages to outgross even some of the raunchiest ""guy"" movies. Kristen Wiig is hilarious (as always) as the main character whose life is spiraling to rock-bottom (loser boyfriend—played by an uncredited Jon Hamm at his absolute smarmiest, lousy job, bizarre roommates) just as her bff (Maya Rudolph) is planning her wedding with the assistance of a new buttinsky bff, played with appropriately haughty aplomb by Rose Byrne. Melissa McCarthy is offensively hilarious as the earthy sister-of-the-groom who lacks any sense of tact, and Jill Clayburgh (in her final film role) is quirkily earnest as Wiig's mom. Although the film devolves somewhat into a typical happily-ever-after master narrative (Wiig's character really can't be happy until she finds a man—luckily, that man is played by the handsome and charming Irish actor Chris O'Dowd), its sharp sense of humor and caustic wit definitely make it worth seeing. And just try to resist singing along to Wilson Phillips' ""Hold On"" during the wedding scene."

Some of the reviews on here are just ridiculous. ""It wasn't what I expected from the previews"". Really? It was EXACTLY what I thought it was going to be from the previews. Do you not watch SNL? What previews were you watching? I thought the movie was really funny and the only reason I saw it was because I lost a bet with my wife (I wanted to see X-men: First Class).<br/><br/>I love Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph on SNL so I knew they were funny but I didn't know they could act as well. The chemistry between the two of them really makes the movie for me. Maybe because they have spent so many years together on SNL or maybe they really are best friends but you really believe that the two of them are best friends. The dialog between the two just seems real.<br/><br/>So is short, this humor is not for everyone but to think it is any different than the previews is just moronic.<br/><br/>Good Movie. Go see it!"
"paulf-61","7","1","4","18 June 2011"," About time we saw the ladies behaving badly
","Bridesmaids, the latest film from producer Judd Apatow, is a little different from his usual male-driven comedies. Instead of a group of guys having a long series of amusing mishaps, this time it's the girls. Or rather one girl: Annie, played brilliantly by Kristen Wiig, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Annie Mumolo.<br/><br/>The film follows Annie in her adventures as maid of honour to life–long friend Lillian (Rudolph). She already has her fair share of troubles (roommates, job, money, car, failed business etc.), and now she's in competition with ridiculously rich Helen (Byrne) for the role of best friend/best bridesmaid to Lillian.<br/><br/>There are a lot of jokes in this movie; almost all of them are hilarious and not always the gross-you-out kind, which we tend to see a lot of these days. There is the food poisoning bit, which as an idea is pretty disgusting(ly funny), but apart from some vomit, you don't see anything gross. As well as the lack of revolting images, it's also nice to see a comedy where all the best jokes aren't used in the trailer. Yes, the food poisoning and the plane scenes are set up, and the roommates are introduced (Matt Lucas and Rebel Wilson as the British siblings she share the apartment with), but watching the whole thing is much, much funnier.<br/><br/>The film does have an actual story going on besides the bridesmaids' antics, and some drama to go with our troubled character. The breather in between all the jokes is welcome, and a little bit necessary. Some jokes wouldn't work so well if the audience is still laughing from the last one. The pause is always cut appropriately short, usually courtesy of Megan, the groom's sister (McCarthy). She also manages to save Annie's self-pitying from getting annoying. Watching her cry at Cast Away can only be so funny. However, it is so difficult not to laugh for the most of the movie that these small moments are easily forgiven.<br/><br/>Some parts of the storyline weren't fully developed. The bit between Rita and Becca (the other two bridesmaids, played by Wendy McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper) on the plane didn't really go anywhere after that scene. I didn't find it that funny, so it's not like I wanted it to go somewhere, but it's an odd moment in my memory of the film. Also, the character of Annie's mother (Jill Clayburgh) could have been really funny if it had gone further, but she barely had two scenes. She goes to Alcoholics Anonymous but she's never had a drink in her life. I wanted to know more.<br/><br/>For a movie written by two women the characters are a little more clichéd than I would expect, but if it works, I guess it doesn't really matter. Rudolph as the bride and Wiig, Byrne and the other three as her bridesmaids make a really good ensemble. There won't be a moment you won't have a smile on your face, if you're not already crying with laughter. The film seems to be aimed at a female audience, but hopefully the Apatow name will bring the guys in as well, because there is no one (of the appropriate age) who would not enjoy this!"

","Throughout the years, gross-out comedies would revolve around groups of guys (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"", ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""The Hangover"" and now ""The Hangover 2,"" which I have no intention on seeing since I didn't like the first ""Hangover,"" ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" and ""Dinner for Schmucks,"" from more recent years) or just one girl who is the object of desire of many guys (""There's Something About Mary""). But now, there is a twist. The girls are the protagonists of gross-out.<br/><br/>Raunchmeister Judd Apatow is the producer. Paul Feig is the director. They treated the ladies the same way men would get treated in gross out movies. The ladies would drink, cuss, tear each other apart, and would have so much fun doing all that.<br/><br/>""Saturday Night Live"" alum Kristen Wiig is the star of the movie. She is Annie, a young woman whose life is on the rocks when her best childhood girlfriend Lillian (fellow SNL alum Maya Rudolph) asks her to be the maid of honor at her upcoming wedding. Her love life is not so lovely and she lost two jobs. She beds one man, but has the eye for a police officer who continually runs into her on the streets and everywhere else. Complications come when there are four other bridesmaids on the scene, and all of them duke it out. <br/><br/>Expectedly, the best work comes from heavyset actress Melissa McCarthy as the tough as nails Megan, the sister of the groom. There is always that principle where the least attractive actor/actress becomes the most attractive when they get the best and funniest lines, steals the show from everyone else, and no one else can be as funny or clever, not even the leads. Surely enough, the filmmakers are doing her a favor where beauty is only skin deep, and they are right. The other three ""beautiful"" bridesmaids are Rose Byrne as Helen, who becomes a fierce rival for Lillian as the matron of honor as she is the trophy wife of the groom's boss, Wendy McLendon-Covey as the tall blonde Rita, an aggressive foul-mouthed stepmother of equally foul-mouthed children, and Ellie Kemper as Becca, the most sensitive bridesmaid who is newly married and feels the sorriest for Annie because she is still single. Lesson to be learned: Never take your beauty for granted. You can be sexy because of your brain.<br/><br/>There are numerous gross out gags that pop up and keep you laughing out loud. But there is a lot of heart as well so we won't think it's just another rambunctious comedy. Due to Jill Clayburgh's recent death, her presence is the most bittersweet. She did have very funny lines as Annie's lustful mother, although she looked wan and weak. It was nice to have a funny comedy be her swan song for her distinguished and respectable career.<br/><br/>Have a great time and laugh. Bring all your friends to see ""Bridemaids"" and you'll be glad you did."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Kristen Wiig is everywhere these days. If you don't know the name, you certainly know her face. She is credited with 26 projects since 2009 - and that doesn't even count her weekly work on Saturday Night Live. She is the new Tina Faye ... even though the old Tina Faye is still going very strong.<br/><br/>While I have little doubt that the success of The Hangover was a driving force behind the creation of this film, Ms. Wiig's writing and acting talent elevate this mixture of chick-flick and comedy into one of the finest female film comedies in quite awhile. That's probably not strong enough praise since that category is a bit sparse, but as a guy who gets really tired of the formulaic chick-flick rom-coms and sappy dramas, I found the film to be quite refreshing.<br/><br/>Sure, there are many similarities between this and The Hangover, but the key difference is that the element of female friendship is never far away from the often raunchy comedy we are witnessing. Women so value their BFF's and Ms. Wiig and her writing partner Annie Mumolo (seen as a nervous plane passenger) never lose sight of this.<br/><br/>Also key to any group of female activity is the competitive nature and envious mutterings. They try so hard to appear happy for their friends, when often they are blinded by the current funk in which they find their own life. And look out when a beautiful, rich ""new"" friend enters the picture. The real fireworks begin ... even in the battle for the last word on the mic at the engagement party! I am not going to give away any of the punchlines or set-ups, but I will highlight the cast. Maya Rudolph is Lillian, the bride to be and lifelong friend of Annie (Wiig); Ellie Kemper (The Office) is Becca, the goody-two shoes newlywed; Wendi McLendon-Covey (Reno 911) is Rita, the bitter, frustrated long-time mother and wife looking for inspiration; Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly, Gilmore Girls) is Megan, the slapstick, gross-out comedy relief; Rose Byrne is Helen, the aforementioned seemingly perfect ""new"" friend; Chris O'Dowd (Blind Swordsman in Dinner for Schmucks) is Officer Rhodes, the nice guy who has a crush on Annie; Jon Hamm (Mad Men) as Annie's Porsche driving bootie call; and Jill Clayburgh (her final film role) as Annie's mom.<br/><br/>Here is hoping Ms. Wiig continues to push the boundaries of creative comedy for women. I for one look forward to seeing women on screen as more than just love interests and femme fatales."

","I wasn't so sure about seeing Bridesmaids, it seems every movie with a female lead in a comedy just doesn't work. But I kept hearing great reviews from friends at work, so my girlfriends and I decided to check it out and see if it was worth the hype, but I went in with an extremely good attitude. However once again my girlfriends say how I'm no fun to take to a chick flick because I just thought this was OK. The beginning of the film seemed so promising, I've been waiting for a movie where it would be like the female Hangover. I was maid of honor at my friend's wedding last year and one thing I didn't realize that came with that package is also that you can get quite a bit of jealousy from others and some real competition. It's amazing how seriously women take bridesmaids positions so seriously, but it'd be a great comedy. The problem is that this film fell back into typical formula and became very predictable.<br/><br/>Annie and Lillian have been best friends since their childhood days growing up; when Lillian gets engaged, she asks Annie to be her maid of honor. Lillian also selects four bridesmaids: Helen, the wealthy wife of Lillian's fiancé's boss and new close friend; Becca, a newlywed who loves marriage; Megan, the outgoing sister of the groom; and Rita, a relative who is dissatisfied with her marriage and three sons. While the wedding preparations continue, Annie's personal life is falling apart. Her cake shop went bankrupt, forcing her to take a job at a jewelry store where she is an ineffective saleswoman and makes very little money. She is kicked out of the apartment that she shares with a pair of invasive twins. Despite advice from her friends, Annie is in the midst of a self destructive relationship with a man who only thinks of her as a sex buddy. Annie's chaotic personal life, budget restrictions, and insecurity about Lillian and Helen's friendship begin to take their toll as the wedding draws nearer.<br/><br/>I don't want to complain completely about the movie, the main thing that I found very entertaining was the character Megan played by Melissa McCarthy. I think because she felt like the most real character, she was extremely likable. Kristen Wiig is a very good lead and I found her character while annoying at times, very relatable where sometimes it feels like when it rains it pours. Her and Melissa really carried the film well and had the most laughs. I just wished they had also maybe toned the jokes down, there were three jokes that dragged on forever. The engagement party toast competition, it was starting off really funny, but then dragged on a bit. Then the airplane, where Kristen Wiig is high off of a drug and drunk, so you can tell she was improvising but again it went on a little too long and started to get uncomfortable. And then when she was trying to get pulled over, I got the point after the 3rd joke within a joke. I just thought these jokes if edited correctly, it would have gotten a bigger laugh from me.<br/><br/>But the one thing I cannot deny is that this film was something special for the audience because the lady next to me was laughing hysterically, annoying a little bit, but maybe I'm just missing something or I have become too harsh on films. Like I said, there are some great laughs, I just felt that the ending lost it into being too predictable and that it should have been more about the competition between the bridesmaids. But I would say this is a solid rental, it was over all very harmless and I would say decent enough comedy especially with Kristen and Megan, they made it worth the watch.<br/><br/>5/10"

Kristen Wiig's (Annie) character with her dry humor and side commentary, and Melissa McCarthy's (Megan) character with her in-your-face-but-likable manner, were the most hilarious. Overall, despite a few slower-paced scenes that seemed to drag the movie out a bit, this was a great one to catch in the theaters."

","The soulfully, relatable comedy is nicely blended with over the top crass, crude humor. The amusingly unique movie plays out from the female standpoint and mentality and that differs from movies of this kind that are typically based upon the male psyche. It is up there with the best of the irreverent, nasty comedies of this genre such as the Hangover, Knocked up and Superbad. <br/><br/>By creating a cynical theme, due to the melancholy, jealousy and nihilism that the friend believably feels from the occurrence of her bff getting married, a crass/slapstick comedy evolves into a dark and sophisticated one. When a Bff gets married resulting in the inevitable ""growing apart"" while at the same time the friend not getting married feels as though she is going nowhere a soulfully bluesy mood resonates. The acting amongst the main characters, especially their connection with each other was well done. <br/><br/>The assortment of side characters and bridesmaids were well developed. We really cared about these supporting characters since their own histories, and idiosyncratic personality traits created complex eccentrically believable personas. Especially amusing were the heavy set bridesmaid and the policeman. <br/><br/>Finally the typical plague that frequently decimates movies of the genre, the overlong sappy ""tie things neatly together"" moments, did not go on too long. Instead what was wisely focused on was crude, slapstick humor, developed side characters and real connections between friends."

","One blond (Kristen Wiig), one brunette (Maya Rudolph) and one fatty (Melissa McCarthy). Covering all the demos, are we? BRIDESMAIDS was advertised as being a Chick Flick version of SUPERBAD. Nope. It's just super bad. About a lonely bridesmaid (Wiig) who battles another snobbish bridesmaid (Rose Byrne) for the affections of the ugly bride (Rudolph).<br/><br/>BRIDESMAIDS also aspires to being THE HANGOVER. Nope. The closest it gets to that raunchy film is when Wiig gets drunk on the way to Vegas and gets kicked off the plane. Then she wakes up with a hangover.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow produces. Yet even with his usually perceptive comedy radar, this movie fails. At least, for me. Because I have man parts. It's not as hubristic as SEX AND THE CITY, but it's almost as annoying.<br/><br/>Film loses me in its first frames, as Annie (Wiig) has raunchy, multi-positional sex - with her bra on. Who's buying this crap? Unless it's a quickie in someone else's bathroom, or across the hood of a car, or on a crowded dance floor, what Man would tolerate the prudishness of a woman who bolts on her bra through hours of sex?! Annie's schlep-buddy is Jon Hamm, delighting in squeezing her boobs - through her padded bra. What kind of madness--? (During this scene, Annie actually cracks a BRADY BUNCH joke about ""George Glass,"" which only aged viewers of the 70's series will appreciate, if at all.) From there, it's an estrogen thrill ride, as we are dragged like whipped boyfriends through Woman Adventure, i.e. choosing dresses, tennis doubles, lunch, brunch, chocolate fountains, weepy movies and whining about not being married.<br/><br/>The unbrained message is, as always, if you're Annie's age and don't have a husband, then something is wrong with you. After the constant dissatisfaction of being single, one would think that after a woman gets married, she would stop trying to trade up to an Antonio Banderas lookalike while partying in Vegas. Movie desperately tries to appeal to all genders and demos by injecting swearing, sex and scat into the Woman Adventure, but it's just polishing turds.<br/><br/>Directed by Paul Feig, it's mostly hell, but there are two good aspects about BRIDESMAIDS. One is Kristen Wiig. Co-writer and lead, she sells this bilious piece of crap; a luminous darling of the screen, a female comedian who is consistently funny in all her work, and cutie-pie sexy to boot.<br/><br/>And the other amazing thing about this unfunny comedy is that everyone pulls off such a fine acting performance, all underplaying so well, it's like they think they're in a good movie (except for the fat chick, who plays it broad; yes, pun intended). Cameo from Matt Lucas (LITTLE Britain), one of two fat, pasty Brits who love showing off their porcelain girth. Jill Clayburgh, the hottest chick ever (SILVER STREAK), is Annie's mum. Chris O'Dowd is Annie's tentative cop love interest; sensitive performance, we feel his love and pain.<br/><br/>As well as Wiig, Byrne and McCarthy, the bridesmaid clique includes RENO 911's Wendi McClendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper. And then there's the bride, Maya Rudolph. Note how the ugliest of the women is the bride. Because she's the ugliest. If she were one of the bridesmaids, she would have played Aggressive Ugly Chick, the role that the Fat Chickfulfils. It stuns me how anyone could consider Rudolph ""beautiful"" - or, heaven forfend, keep impregnating her! - when she is so obviously empirically mad ugly. Is it just a stock fallback position that one has to adopt around women in prominent positions, like Barbra Streisand and Jennifer Garner? I'm sure Rudolph herself - being a good actress and comedienne and more financially successful than I will ever be - would be the first to admit she's a special class of beast. It doesn't help when she takes a botulism dump in her wedding dress in the middle of the street. I was already on the verge of vomiting having to endure that face - and now I have to think of her greasy pork-hole expulsing feculence? Jesus on a donkey! <br/><br/>I'm telling you, Movie Maniac, the distraction of Maya Rudolph's mugly noggin robs fully half my attention away from the movie and Kristen Wiig's padded bra. If you think it's just me, take a good look at the BRIDESMAIDS poster: Rudolph is the only women altered so that she looks like someone else! We all know that movie stars' pictures are always ""treated"" to make them look ten years younger than their human age, sans pores. But on the BRIDESMAIDS poster, the Photoshop artist made some solid overtime on Rudolph: rounder eyes, less hooky nose, less grotesque lips, slimmer cheeks - it's a work of art! Everyone else is doctored with mere contrast and color balancing - they didn't even doctor the fat chick! So it's not just me who thinks Rudolph deserves some kind of Porridge Award for that puss - it's the marketers as well! <br/><br/>And the marketers have done some extraordinary work, BRIDESMAIDS proving that the sniveling awards season is all about politics and not quality, as the movie is nominated for numerous Golden Globes, Oscars, AFI Top Ten, SAG Awards, etc. Even the Fat Chick has been nominated for Best Supporting just for acting like a walking erection.<br/><br/>And as if the movie isn't painful enough, Wilson Phillips do the last song. You read that right: Wilson Phillips, that unlistenable 80's girl trio of vocalists made up of one blond, one brunette and one fatty.<br/><br/>--Poffy's Movie Mania"

","The movie took forever to get going. The first 30 minutes were filled with jokes intended for the older audience and it felt like watching ""Corner Gas"". Kristin Wig is the least funny female character in this movie by far which she proves throughout. The movie was beyond predictable in its story line as well as upcoming jokes. <br/><br/>All this stuff about being heartfelt is so dumb. The movie is a campy corny chick flick which has a few moments of actual humour. <br/><br/>You can tell that Judd Apatow clearly had nothing to do with this movie other then using his name to try and draw people into the theatre. <br/><br/>I'd say 10% of the jokes in the movie were successful for both men and women. Again a lot of the humour was geared to females/old people and will not be even close to funny for males. Its not for a lack of understanding the so called jokes; It's everything to do with the fact that very little of this 2 hour movie consisted of new jokes. Most of the comedy seems to be taken out of 1960's-80's TV sitcoms. Again these are jokes aimed at the older crowd/females. Men under 55 will find this movie stale and old with very little new ideas as they have seen it done many times. <br/><br/>When the group goes shopping for dresses, it is beyond the funniest scene in the movie. This scene was written so well for the female cast it hampered the rest of the movie because it seems like after that they just didn't try. <br/><br/>There are worse movies out there and as far as female comedies this sadly ranks near the top. <br/><br/>Girls can bring their boyfriends/husbands to this movie and not have to deal with a lot of moaning from them. Just don't expect them to enjoy it 1/10 of the amount that you do."
"Floated2","1","1","6","19 December 2012"," Not as good as the reviews say
","Bridesmaids. The cast go for broke in their effort to breathe life into the weak material, and for the most part come off badly. Wiig is trying to be a wild-eyed Lucy Ricardo type, and grows increasingly annoying as the plot proceeds; but then she has nothing to blame but her own script. Byrne is appropriately uptight and rigid, and manages to suggest the vein of vulnerability in Helen that's ultimately supposed to make her less than obnoxious, but again the screenplay doesn't offer her much to latch onto. Under Paul Feig's typically unsubtle direction McCarthy comes on big and brassy, and would have benefited from some greater distancing to make her less overbearingly; by contrast Rudolph makes virtually no impression. Worst used of all are Hamm, who adopts a smarmy smugness that reduces him to a Hank Azaria type, and the late Jill Clayburgh as Annie's oddball mother. Like Apatow's other output, ""Bridesmaids"" is nicely mounted, with Robert D. Yeoman providing crisp cinematography and editors William Kerr and Michael L. Sale doing their best to smooth over the episodic feel and keep up the energy level. It's hardly their fault they don't entirely succeed.<br/><br/>Weddings are trying experiences as a rule, and so is ""Bridesmaids."" The attempt to apply the male slob template to female characters is dispiriting, and it's more depressing to think it will probably be a great success."

","I have seen quite a few movies released this year, some brilliant(Tree of Life), some great(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2), some good(On Stranger Tides), some disappointing(Green Lantern) and some really bad(Battle:Los Angeles). Bridesmaids is one of the brilliant films I have seen released this year, while there are one or two moments where the gross-out humour is a little tiresome, I haven't seen anything this funny and this original in a while. The production values are great, the cinematography is crisp and smooth and the scenery and fashions are very striking. The soundtrack also brought a smile to my face, as did the buoyant direction, the original and well-paced story and especially the sharp and acerbic writing. The characters are examples of those perhaps that initially you think am I going to like these characters, but the actors clearly make an effort to give them personality and likability. Of the talented cast, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy stand out, both these actresses are brilliant, but Rose Byrne and Chris O'Dowd are also terrific. Overall, a great film and one of my favourites of the year so far. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"blackmambamark","7","1","10","13 May 2011"," First half, hilarious.......second half, cheesy chick flick trap
","Can women be funny? Sure they can, but only when it's under 30 minutes. I'm sorry, i know that may sound sexist, but seriously, name me a female comedy that is made up only of women that is worthy of remembering? The only thing i can think of is when they roast somebody on Comedy Central.....hence why, because it's under 30 minutes. Anything after that, always tends to fall into the emotional cliché' side. Honestly, i'm rooting for you women....i really am. I want you to turn this tide.<br/><br/>The first half of this movie is comedy at it's best. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. The pace and timing is spot on, very relative to ""The Hangover"", which is great. However, some of the comedic bits created this strange uncomfortable vibe between the characters. I know it was intended to make the scene even more funny, which in a way it did, but since they did it at almost every turn, after a while it began to loose some of it's luster. But, still funny non the less.<br/><br/>So you got a great first half that has everyone in audience geared up for more laughs.....so you would expect a hilarious finish, right? Well, once again, they fell back into the cheesy emotional not so funny cliché' sequence that i hoped would never come. Case in point, take ""The Hangover"".....imagine right after Mike Tyson punches Allen, the guys sit around a mope about how much they have messed things up, instead of doing other hilarious tid bits. And that is the route this movie took. Yes, i understand that this is the one for the ladies......but come on gals. If you want a girl to girl movie, i'm sure blockbuster has an entire section dedicated to just that. Let's bring something new to the table. Prove that you can be funny all the time and not so emotional.<br/><br/>Bottom Line......the movie started out with a bang, and looked very promising.....but then it slowly morphed into a giant cliché' trap. I'm sorry, but if you want me to buy your comedy, don't include a sequence where a girl bakes a cake that says 'I'm sorry' on it.....sorry, i know i spoiled a little bit of it, but now you know what to expect, because that's exactly what this movie turns into. It goes from hilarious comedy to cheesy chick flick. So is it bad? No, not really......but, it could have been so much more."

It's a remarkable performance that feels entirely sincere and genuine every step of the way, and she's surrounded by a first-rate comedic cast that manages to extract every bit of comedic potential out of all the movie's scenes.

This movie hits rock bottom when Kirsten Wiig explodes with jealousy when a pretty friend of her best friend tops her wedding shower gift. She tries to destroy everything in her path, lashes out at strangers, causes herself to lose her job, dumps a man who sincerely cares for her, refuses to accept apologies, and generally emits poison everywhere she goes. <br/><br/>And this is a COMEDY.

The ending is great and I couldn't stop laughing or the way though. I love love love this movie.<br/><br/>Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is a single woman in her late 30s. Following the failure of her bakery, she lost her boyfriend and her savings, forcing her to take a job as a sales clerk in a jewelry store and to share an apartment with an obnoxious roommate Gil (Matt Lucas) and his sister Brynn (Rebel Wilson). Her business's failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely. She has a no-strings-attached sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted (Jon Hamm) but hopes for something more from him. Her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), is virtually her only source of happiness.<br/><br/>Lillian becomes engaged and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. At the engagement party, Annie meets Lillian's bridesmaids: cynical cousin Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey); idealistic friend Becca (Ellie Kemper); the groom's raunchy sister Megan (Melissa McCarthy); and Helen (Rose Byrne), the rich and beautiful wife of the groom's boss. Helen and Annie, who are jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian, take an instant dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together.<br/><br/>Annie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a Brazilian steak restaurant for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop. However, Helen must use her influence to gain entry to the shop because Annie didn't make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the whole party— with the exception of Helen, who chose not to eat before the fitting —becomes sick from food poisoning. Later, Annie's suggestion of a bachelorette party at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a trip to Las Vegas planned by Helen. Worried about her finances and too proud to accept a ticket paid for by Helen, Annie books a ticket in coach although the rest of the party flies first-class. However, the trip is cut short by an outburst from Annie, who had accepted a sedative from Helen because of her fear of flying. The plane makes an emergency landing in Casper, Wyoming; and the party takes a bus back home. Annie apologizes, but Lillian decides she wants Helen to take over planning the shower and the wedding.<br/><br/>Annie continues to hope for a relationship with Ted, but Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), a friendly State Patrol officer who had earlier let her off without a ticket for broken tail lights, begins flirting with her. Nathan encourages her to open a new bakery, but Annie refuses. Following a night together, Nathan buys baking supplies for Annie to start baking again. Offended and overwhelmed, Annie leaves. Annie is later fired for being rude to a customer and kicked out of her apartment by her roommates, forcing her to move in with her mother (Jill Clayburgh, in her final film appearance).<br/><br/>Annie travels to Helen's home in Chicago for the bridal shower, which has become a Parisian-themed event, an idea that Annie previously came up with but Helen turned down. Helen also upstages Annie's heartfelt, handmade shower gift by giving Lillian a trip to Paris, an idea Helen stole from Annie. Enraged that Helen has taken credit for the Parisian theme, Annie throws a tantrum. Lillian kicks her out of the shower and the wedding. On her way home, Annie is involved in a car accident due to her still-broken tail lights, but the other driver flees the scene. Nathan is the responding officer, and he admonishes her for not fixing her tail lights and taking responsibility for her life. He storms off when Ted arrives to give Annie a ride. On the ride home, Ted asks Annie to perform oral sex on him. Angered, she breaks off the relationship and walks home.<br/><br/>Throughout the next several days, Annie becomes reclusive, refusing to leave her mother's house and obsessively watching television. Eventually, Megan arrives and gives Annie a pep talk, telling Annie that she must stop blaming the world for her problems and take control of her life. Annie realizes her errors and begins to repair her life, beginning to bake again and getting her car fixed. She tries to make amends with Nathan, but he ignores her. On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annie's doorstep distraught; Lillian has disappeared, and Helen begs for Annie's help in finding her. While driving, Helen apologizes to Annie and opens up to her, revealing that people only involve her in their lives because she is good at planning events, but she does not have any true female friends, leading to a reconciliation between them. The two enlist Nathan to help, and he grudgingly agrees. The group finds Lillian at her own apartment, discovering that she ran from her wedding because of Helen's extravagant planning and from fear of leaving her life in Milwaukee. After reconciling, Annie helps Lillian prepare for her wedding.<br/><br/>Annie resumes her place as Maid of Honor. After the wedding, which Annie agrees with Helen is ""perfect"", Helen again apologizes to Annie and states her hope that they can be friends in the future. Realizing that Annie and Nathan were falling in love, Helen also arranged for him to pick up Annie after the wedding. Nathan and Annie reconcile and the pair ride away in his police car."

","Things aren't going to well for Annie, her business has failed and the man she is seeing only wants one thing and once that has finished he'd rather she left. Then her best friend Lillian invites her to be her maid of honour; this should be a good thing but things quickly get worse. Annie tries to organise things but Lillian's new friend Helen starts to take over proceedings. While this is going on Annie starts a relationship with the police officer who pulled her over. After a string of disasters to looks as if Annie and Lillian's friendship is doomed and Helen takes over the arrangements. At this point everything starts to get worse for Annie; she loses her job, her home and her new relationship appears to be over before it has really begun.<br/><br/>This film shows that women can do gross-out humour just as well as men but that doesn't mean that all the humour is like that. There are plenty of laughs to be had; to my mind the best were provided by silliness rather than the more course moments. The story itself is fairly simple and predictable but it does serve to provide humorous situations. Kirsten Wiig carries the film in the role of Annie; she makes the character believable and sympathetic. She is ably supported by Maya Rudolph, Rose Bryne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon Covey and Ellie Kemper as Lillian and the other bridesmaids. Chris O'Dowd is likable in the role of the policeman Annie falls for. One could be excused for thinking this was a 'chick-flick' given the amount of pink on the DVD case but while I'm sure women will enjoy it there is no reason that men won't enjoy it too. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody who wants a good laugh but isn't too easily offended."

What surprised is how well written the characters are, they have an excellent development through the course of the film, especially our main girl. Next to the great formed characters is quality acting, Kristin Wiig. I would like to single out also Melissa McCarthy which is in every scene totally unpleasant but at the same time hilarious.

Definitely a refreshing comedy which I recommend."
"UNOhwen","Null","0","1","10 September 2015"," if you liked the ensemble style and humour of The 40 Year Old Virgin, you'll love Bridesmaids
","I never see films in theatres, in fact, the number of 'new' films I will see if pretty low. <br/><br/>But, since Bridesmaid's release, I've only heard positive things about it, and, of the main cast, I love Maya Rudolph and Ms. Wiig (though, as odd as it may seem, I've NEBER - Ever caught them on SNL), and I know that several lesser-knows of the central core have since gone on to their own successes, so, given this, I said, 'why not, ' and sat down with Bridesmaids.<br/><br/>What I really enjoy about Bridesmaids, is its a terrific platform for women comedians to shine. Their definitely not 'lady-like, p' they think, talk just as raunchy as men, and it's great to see a great cross-section of types of humour - gross-out, top<br/><br/>In a way, Bridesmaids seems to me to be a book-end to The 40 Year-Old Virgin. Not in story, but, in style, both films were made by funny, talented people, and it shows Like 40 YYOV, there's tons of throw-away lines, just, rapid-fire humour, and it comes from the oddest places.<br/><br/>All the bridesmaids have different styles, different styles of humour, I.e., the slutty, miserable housewife ('I can get cocaine from my hair dress'), the straight-laced, practically lives in a bubble, the blue-collar, slightly insane one, and then the three 'main ones.' <br/><br/>Some of the jokes may leave you scratching your head, wondering; 'that sounds familiar,' like when Annie mentions she's a very hot date named 'George Glass.' That was the 'boyfriend' Jan Brady made up, when she was doing on of her 'pay attention to me' schticks, on The Brady Bunch.<br/><br/>When Annie goes to a guy named Peter's home, she's stuck waiting for Peter in his living room, and her company - Peter's kid. <br/><br/>The one-liners which come out of his mouth had me in stitches, and would make Henny Youngman blush. I'm certain you will be laughing as well.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast contains such wonderful people, who excel in all manner of comedy, like Rebel Wilson and Matt Lucas, two of my favourites from seeing them years ago, and, who I've loved. They're a pair of very odd brother/sister who share an apartment with Annie, and though they're not main characters, their on-screen time is hysterical.<br/><br/>One especially great thing, I must credit to Ms, McCarthy and a speech she makes later in the film, regarding the cruelty she suffered in high school. I'm NOT condoning bullying, or any such thing, but, the bigger point ,out parents today miss, is - you MUST - M-U-S-T - let your children fall for themselves. <br/><br/>As Ms. McCarthy said (not relating verbatim, just the points), she was picked on, dusted herself off, and did the BEST she could, and OVERCAME. <br/><br/>Too many parents think protecting - isolating - their kids from REALITY is good. <br/><br/>It sure isn't.<br/><br/>The world ISN'T your home. No one other than immediate family will treat you, or care about you, or yours, as YOU do.<br/><br/>People MUST get 'scabs.' <br/><br/>Parents let their kids scream in restaurants which Aren't 'family friendly,' and expect everyone to 'put up with it.'<br/><br/>WRONG! <br/><br/>You - YOU - MUST teach your children how to ACT IN THE REAL WORLD, because no one is their 'mommy, daddy,' aside from YOU.<br/><br/>I may sound like I'm going off the topic, but, I'm not. This film is about accepting yourself - not letting what others say, or think about you make you feel less about yourself. <br/><br/>But, that means you must start somewhere, and that place is childhood, because kids NEED their parents to TEACH them about LIFE.<br/><br/>I real Y applaud the makers of this fil. For having such a varied spectrum of types of people - quirks, personalities, etc. <br/><br/>It shows you, people are not 'cookie cut-outs.'<br/><br/>We're all different, but, we all have emotions, and we need to understand them, so, we can move forward.<br/><br/>We're all different, but, as this movie shows, that doesn't mean we can't care for one another.<br/><br/>I want you to enjoy this as much as I did.<br/><br/>My only complaint is for a well thought-out, and planned film, written by people with actual brains, was the 'telegraphing' of where the plot was going. <br/><br/>By 'telegraphing,' I mean the obviousness - the set-up of what's going to happen couldn't be any more obviously clear, then p, if someone had smacked me on the head with a mallet.<br/><br/>I knew early on what would happen, and, while I don't think most of you will, I do think that definitely before the film's 1/3 over, you'll come to the same conclusion. <br/><br/>Not that, in this film, is that fully a negative, but, you've got a premise: after suffering personal setbacks, personally, and professionally, a best friend's getting married.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I still enjoyed this film, not so much for the (what I felt to be) the obviousness of the plot's layout, but, for the humour - which never stops.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, and, I'll say that, if you saw The 40 Year Old Virgin, and you enjoy an ensemble cast of comedians, you'll definitely have fun with Bridesmaids, as well."

","Bridesmaids (2011): Dir: Paul Feig / Cast: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Chris O'Dowd, Melissa McCarthy: Amusing comedy counterpart to The Hangover about friendship. Kristen Wiig opens the film within a failing romantic fling. Her bakery went out of business, and her best friend is engaged and choosing her to be the maid of Honor. That would be great except that her other close friend in charge of planning the event, is mugging to the point of competing with Wiig. Director Paul Feig does well with a comedy that proves that females can be funny too. Wiig is hilarious in a much deserved lead role that has her go from best friend to victim of competing foils particularly on a plane trip that has her a little trippy. She does encounter romance with a cop, but ultimately she must learn that not everything is about her. Maya Rudolph plays Lillian the bride who is a witness and victim to the competing bridesmaids to the point where she disappears. Her best scene occurs during a food poisoning situation that has her sprint into the street in her wedding dress. Rose Byrne is a fine actress and as rival Helen she is introduced as a threat to Wiig and then it is back and forth as she always one ups her. Their reconcile is no surprise. Chris O'Dowd is another funny comic but as the police officer who pulls Wiig over he is reduced to nothing more than a predictable romantic fling. Melissa McCarthy became a big breakout star through this film and receives many of the funniest lines despite her role being strained to weight clichés. Strong theme regarding timeless friendships and uniting new ones make this wedding worth attending. Score: 7 ½ / 10"

Every time I watch this I'm in tears laughing, howling uncontrollably because of the jokes and perfect delivery. Kristen Wiig's awkwardness and eventual competitiveness as Annie is great stirring on the fire and tension for Rose Byrne's Helen, Byrne is at her best and as you've never seen her before. Melissa McCarthy simply steals the scene as Megan, I cried with laughter as she went through the story of how she fell off a cruise ship, and immediately after that comes the defining moment of laughter that is the endless wedding speech from Annie and Helen. Wendi McLendon-Covey is hilarious as a foul mouth sick of her kids mother whose incessant bitching about them gets more hysterical as the drinks come in, Ellie Kemper's best moment as Becca has to be her explanation of her sex life whilst on a plane to Vegas, and Maya's Rudolph's poo in the street in a wedding dress scene is outrageously brilliant.

","Makers of Bridesmaids,<br/><br/>I love how you emphasized the importance of friendship in this movie. Lillian and Annie are the dynamic duo and remind me of what a true friendship should be.<br/><br/>Have you read Book VIII of Nicomachean Ethics? It's one of my proudest works, really. If you haven't I suggest youhow do you call it—Google it. Now that you've done so, let's walk through it together:<br/><br/>1. Friendship based on utility At first, it was hard to see how Lillian benefited from Annie. For Annie, the benefit of friendship with Lillian was clear—Sanity. Lillian was there for Annie whenever Annie needed someone to talk to, and that was portrayed in the breakfast scene after Annie spends the night with Ted. It was quite hilarious, might I add.<br/><br/>Then as the movie went on, I can see how Annie tries to make it clear to Lillian that the friendship between Annie and Lillian is much greater than between Helen and Lillian. Granted, Helen offers so much for Lillian in terms of the material things like traveling, playing tennis, and shopping. Oh gosh, I really hate how Lillian is indirectly rubbing it in Annie's face that she has a new best friend. Talk about passive aggressive. Poor Annie. <br/><br/>2. Friendship based on pleasure Haha, I doubt that Annie and Lillian like each other as best friends for their insanely good looks. But I'm pretty sure that the two of them see how good-looking the other one is in terms of personality. And Lillian knows how much Annie deserves in a man. A+ on seeing the bigger picture, that it's not about the outside, but on the inside.<br/><br/>3. Friendship based on goodness Generally, this type of friendship is long term. It's pretty inevitable for a good friendship to be long lasting. Annie and Lillian were friends since they were little girls. Years and years of friendship are exemplified in this film when Annie makes her toast to Lillian at the wedding party. By the way, Annie's passive aggressive is much much better than Helen's. <br/><br/>All of these types that I mentioned above are exactly what Annie and Lillian have. I want to thank you for creating a plot and challenging even the greatest of friendships. <br/><br/>In the end, Annie, Lillian, and we can even say Helen; give love more than to be loved."

","I remember very well that this was one of the big movies from the summer of 2011, often being announced as the double X chromosome version of ""The Hangover"". The fact that it took me over two years to finally watch it makes it obvious I didn't have the greatest interest in seeing it despite the positive reception and awards recognition it was acknowledged with. All in all, it was pretty much what I expected: a decent romcom that definitely overachieved, however.<br/><br/>The very first scene makes the course of the film pretty clear. We hear a couple laughing and moaning as the camera slowly moves closer to them. The initial reaction would be. Oh that's too obvious. Probably gonna fool the viewer in how they're like playing some board-game or actually building some furniture. But nope, it was what it looked like. The film progresses and mostly focuses on Kristen Wiig's character's interactions with the men in her life, her best friend and a new competitor for her best friend's affection. It's all pretty predictable, yet here and there they managed to get a laugh out of me. It's frequently vulgar, casually gross, occasionally funny and rarely gooey. Fans of the TV series Mad Men will enjoy seeing a 21st century version of Don Draper and he hasn't really changed much. Another highlight was Emmy winner Melissa McCarthy's performance who delivered the comedic highlights. I'm not sure if her effort justified the Academy Award nomination, but I'd say she was more deserving than the screenplay.<br/><br/>With easily passing the two-hour-mark, this film runs pretty long for a comedy. I never felt that it dragged though. Admittedly it didn't fly by either. It's a solid effort all in all and I'd recommend it, although I'm fairly certain I'm not interested in a rewatch anytime soon. There's a whole lot of comedies on this level every year. It's a film where you can sit back, relax and suck it in without really having to think that much and that's not necessarily a negative thing. Somethimes it's exactly what I need. The predominantly female cast makes it probably a decent choice for an all-girls DVD night or for whenever one of your friends or family has a wedding coming up."

(blah blah etc.)"" Other person looks uncomfortable and stays quiet. The movie has several exchanges like that between characters and that is supposed to be funny or cute? It's just... not.

"Arcyli","7","0","3","2 June 2013"," More Bridget Jones than Hangover
","I watched Bridesmaids last night on TV. Never really planned on watching it, but there wasn't much else on. When Bridesmaids first came out in theaters the trailer and reviews gave me the impression that it was a female version of the Hangover (as it did to many others, according to user reviews here on IMDb). Well, it's definitely not. But I kind of liked it anyway.<br/><br/>To give you an indication of how different Bridesmaids is from the Hangover: in this movie, the girls are on their way to Las Vegas for the bachelorette party. Cut to next scene: the protagonist (Annie, played by Kristen Wiig) is back in her car in Milwaukee. I guess what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is actually more of a romantic comedy that's also about some issues that 30-something women have to deal with. The romantic part is nicely played out and didn't feel too contrived. Chris O'Dowd is perfect in his role as Annie's love interest and really grows on you as the story progresses.<br/><br/>Then there's the part of Annie and her bridesmaids dealings. Most situations, although exaggerated for the sake of comedy, are quite recognizable. The feeling of having to compete with someone for the position of best friend: yes, very sad and childish, but who hasn't been there at some point? Every party guest confronting you with the fact that you're the only one who didn't bring a plus one... Walking out on a perfect guy because he just seems TOO nice... it happens. <br/><br/>Basically, it's Bridget Jones's Diary with some over-the-top scenes thrown in. But what makes Bridget Jones so much better is its sense of realism. And I'm not complaining about the getting-kicked-off-the-plane scene or the food-poisoning-in-the-bridal-store scene. I can handle bodily fluids. What I'm talking about is the nearly constant perfect state of Annie's hair, make-up and wardrobe. Just got up in the middle of the night after some bad sex to go to a convenience store: perfect face. Getting up after a one night stand that was preceded by some heavy drinking: not a Guinness stain on that shirt. And if you've spent a week on the couch watching Tom Hanks DVDs and someone tells you to go wash your hair, I would expect it to be at least kind of greasy. I'm not saying that Kristen Wiig should have done a Renee Zellweger and gained 40 pounds, but then don't let her complain about how skinny her 'competitor' is when Annie's clearly a size zero herself. Whose decision was it to keep it glam? Did Kristen Wiig's vanity get in the way? I guess we'll never know. But I thought it was a definite flaw in the story.<br/><br/>Overall: Nice romantic story with good acting. Some over the top scenes, but a lot of funny moments too. Probably not for guys, but most women will enjoy it. Just don't expect to be able to identify with Annie; despite all her character flaws she's just too perfect."

It is actually a pretty good film but not as funny as I hoped. I'm rating this film high because despite the marketing of this film as a comedy, I was touched by all those dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>This film is about the ups and downs of a friendship between two best friends as one of these friends is about to get married and the other friend is Maid of Honor.<br/><br/>I must say Melissa McCarthy stole the show. I never really heard if her until this movie came out. I know some people despise her because of her gross-out humor, but I thought she made the comedy in this film. Kristin Wiig also gave herself a good name as she played her character very well. She had a very sad character which surprised me as I thought she would have me cracking up.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a funny and touching film. This film surpassed my expectations by a lot.

","Bridesmaids was a huge hit with both critics and audiences because it successfully combined what women think is funny with what men think is funny.<br/><br/>Women think relationships are funny, whether the relationships are with men, other women, children, pets, cars, jobs (more or less in that order) ... with anything, in other words, as long as the humor gently points out how exasperating but challenging and potentially rewarding it is to try to relate to other creatures, animate or inanimate. In sharp contrast, men don't think anything is funny except doing in public what normal people do only alone in the bathroom with the door locked. Bridesmaids' considerable achievement is combining those two seemingly incompatible elements seamlessly into one coherent movie.<br/><br/>As a gay man, I most enjoyed the relationship humor, but as a man, I laughed out loud (and I really couldn't help it, because I tried) ONLY at the scene where all the women suffer food poisoning in the high-class, by-appointment-only, white-carpeted bridal shop - especially Melissa McCarthy perched on the sink.<br/><br/>I think I can safely say that every single male human being who saw this movie laughed out loud at that scene; and many of the straight men afterward congratulated themselves, astonished that they were able to enjoy a chick-flick. That's because THIS otherwise ordinary chick-flick was peppered with enough guy gross-out humor to keep them from fidgeting, but not with so much that it turned women off. It's still 80% orthodox chick-flick, but 20% farting, vomiting and explosive diarrhea is enough to keep most men satisfied."

What follows is an attempt to prove who is closer to the bride to be and a bizarre sequence of events which neither make you laugh nor you can connect to. The fact that Annie has a weird mother, weirder roommates and with no job security fails to evoke any sympathy. The only bright spot in the movie is definitely the subtle but surely there romance between Annie and the cop. Its cute.

","I found this movie exceptionally predictable and an exercise in modern sexism. I thought it was supposed to be another triumph of a new kind of comedy; one that's self aware and about dynamic people who have dynamic emotions (A good example would be in Knocked up when Seth Rogan yells at ""hormones"" or when he apologizes mid-insult in Pineapple Express for said insult). Too many comedies have characters throwing insults and jabs at each other without feeling or consequence. A lot of the movies this film has been compared to have actual character development and consequences for their actions.<br/><br/>Instead: Pathetic woman who measures herself against everyone else and turns all of her relationships into adversarial exercises in jealousy. She's most concerned with how other people see her and feel about her. Best friend getting married? She's not the center of attention. Another bridesmaid is richer/prettier/wealthier/more cultured? She's not the center of attention. Handsome guy she's screwing calls her ""fuck buddy?"" She's not the center of attention.<br/><br/>The fact that she's a skilled baker and artisan kind of takes a back seat here. Why didn't she bake her best friend's wedding cake? I would've liked to have seen her grow more thoroughly and have more of an existential crisis rather than a crisis of vanity.<br/><br/>A plus is Melissa McCarthy's performance. That was a truly original and fascinating female character. I would've liked to have seen more of her. I would've liked to have seen more of an ensemble-driven plot. Kristen Wig and Maya Rudolph have amazing chemistry.<br/><br/>But we don't get much of the good because culturally we associate women most immediately with vanity and that's what audiences -- or what studios and screenwriters Wiig and Mumolo think audiences -- want. This film is about a crisis of vanity. As most films about women are."
"itamarscomix","6","0","1","29 May 2012"," Drawn out
","Bridesmaids seems to have been so acclaimed mainly because it's not as bad as you might expect. It's often compared to The Hangover and not without reason, but the one area in which The Hangover truly excelled which made it stand out, is where Bridesmaids fails miserably - pacing. Each gag is drawn out over painfully long periods of time, and the movie is 40 minutes too long. It almost makes sense when you realize that the two leads are SNL graduates.<br/><br/>That's not to say Bridesmaids doesn't deserve some credit. A comedy with an all-female lead cast is rare enough, and the movie has the unusual distinction of being a comedy directed at women that isn't a romantic comedy - in fact it's anything but, though it comes close at one point - and along the way breaks a lot of conventions about what a 'chick flick' should be, including some scenes of no holds barred gross-out comedy, of a kind that would fit right in with a male cast, but feels strangely disturbing with the female cast (and what does that say about our perceptions of gender?). Those are the moments where the movie is truly funny; and although the humor is low, in many ways it feels fresh, and as a comedy - in the big picture - it works and is memorable.<br/><br/>When there's actual plot, though, it feels like the characters keep talking long after we got the point. Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and Rose Byrne all play characters of varying levels of unlikability and it's hard to care about any of them. The saving graces are Melissa McCarthy - the movie's only likable character, for me - Jon Hamm and Jill Clayburgh, whose scenes are shorter, funnier and more to the point than anything else. When Wiig and Byrne are bickering on screen, though, it's tough to remember why we have to root for either one."
"Gin-ster","8","0","1","17 May 2012"," Serious drama and gross-out comedy - an uneasy mix but it worked
","This movie was all over the map. It was a serious drama about friendships, and about the sad plight of single women in contemporary society having to pretend to be okay with mistreatment by males as they attempt to show how ""liberated"" they are. Kristen Wiig was excellent both as a dramatic actress with great depth of expression (when needed) and at the same time, capable of doing physical comedy of the sort displayed in her Saturday Night Live skits. The scene when she was first stopped by the policeman and tried to demonstrate (unnecessarily, as it turned out) that she was not drunk was one such example. Which leads to the SPOILER - the one area in which the story didn't ring true related to her rejection of the policeman after they had spent the night together and he openly expressed a wish to keep things going (instead of just sending her away like John Hamm's character). It seemed like a plot contrivance to inject more suspense into the story (i.e. ""Would they reconcile? Had she ruined her chance for happiness?"") as there was no clear reason why she fled and then refused to return his calls etc. I see that as unrealistic behavior, a situation driven by plot and not character. Otherwise, while the movie didn't always seem clear as to what it intended to be (i.e. a gal pal comedy? a poignant drama about human relations?) nevertheless all the pieces added up into a moving film. PS, the trailer is entirely misleading and I can imagine many expecting a comedy romp were disappointed."

Sad, with many of her problems of her own making, Ms. Wiig still came off with a certain level of charisma. Kudos to Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper for keeping some of the smiles going.

","Once upon a time, I'm looking for a new comedy. I was trying to get away from the mainstream comedies nowadays, I was looking for something different. When I first saw Bridesmaids, guess what I put it off as? A chick flick. The cover looked so bad and terrible, and looked like another pathetic attempt at humor. And guess what again? The movie has the same effect on you as looking at the cover, triggering you to say ""really?"" <br/><br/>Now, listen, Bridesmaids is surely not a bad film. In fact, at least it was something different. Different I mean in it's cast. The movie had spice in it's cast. It was all something different. We have actors all from Kristen Wiig to Melissa McCarthy. Now don't get me wrong, I love Melissa McCarthy. I whole-heartily think she's laugh-out-loud hilarious. But in this film she's basically a one trick dog. She thinks she can say a few lame things and cross it off as funny because that's who she looks out to be. Wrong. Her lines were cringe-worthy to say the worth. And she was the one with the most potential in her character, and than finished in last place.<br/><br/>The film's humor was probably the best part of this film. It's a blend of warmheartedness and even it's own pinch of raunchy humor. Some scene, though, came off as an ATTEMPT but others had me rolling. Now this leads me to the next big problem we need to discuss. Even though the movie is a blend of genres, it never knows exactly what it is going for. It's like that clichéd scenario where you let your dog out and let him decide his owner. Except the dog/film doesn't know exactly where to go, so this entire 125 minutes is confused and desperate to find somewhere. I love diversity, but it's gets annoying and raunchiness and warmheartedness don't really click together. <br/><br/>Expect the expected, Bridesmaids is critically-appealed but deeply inside another chick flick. It does nothing new, for me, and it never knows if it's a straight-up comedy our a raunchy chick flick. Whichever one, I knew the movie wasn't for me. And no, that doesn't mean I am sexist. The movie wasn't to my taste, how is that so hard to believe? I recommend for people who know what they are getting into, and actually really enjoy chick flicks. Bridesmaids can be considered a faithful one at that, but not faithful to my tastes. But who am I to say? Go see it for yourself.<br/><br/>6/10."

","Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy and Chris O'Dowd star in this 2011 comedy. Annie (Wiig) is an out-of-work pastry chef who is asked by her best friend, Lillian (Rudolph) to be her maid of honor for her wedding. Annie meets Lillian's friend, Helen (Byrne) who tries to take over and things go wrong for Annie when they start competing for Lillian's friendship. McCarthy plays Megan, one of Lillian's bridesmaids who becomes good friends with Annie and O'Dowd plays cop, Rhodes who becomes romantically involved with Annie. Wiig and McCarthy steal the film and I like Wilson Phillips' ""Hold On"" performance. I recommend this good comedy that's not just another chick flick."

","Set the scene: <br/><br/>Annie and Lillian have been best friends since they were kids. They do everything together. While Annie's life has hit rock bottom, Lillian's just gained a huge rockshe's engaged, and happily asks an increasingly desperate Annie to be her Maid of Honour. There's just one problem. Lillian's got a new best friend, Helen, who is beautiful, rich, saccharine sweet and a massive, perfectly pedicured thorn in Annie's side. Cue - battle of the Bridesmaids. <br/><br/>So, what did you think?:<br/><br/>OK, so it's pretty hard to give an unbiased review on a movie I already have a soft spot for. It's been said that 'Bridesmaids' is the female equivalent of 'The Hangover', a movie that has some frickin' hilarious, belly-laugh-inducing moments. However, this opinion is not one I subscribe to. Between the moments of hilarity that vaguely echo the chaotic humour of the Hangover are sweet moments full of heart, particularly in a scene in the second half between a scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy as Megan and the effortlessly funny Kristen Wiig as Annie. It's a breakthrough moment for Annie. <br/><br/>In fact, it's the female actresses that elevate this movie from an in- your-face comedy to a well-rounded film. It's great to see female actresses delivering punchy, funny lines that aren't just about their respective sexual partners. It nicely portrays the best-friendship between Annie and Lillian, and an budding romantic subplot, with an unusually cast Chris O'Dowd as a honest and frankly adorable police-man as Annie's love-interest. Kristen Wiig, of Saturday Night Live fame is refreshing as Annie, and has become one of my favourite female comic actresses following 'Bridesmaids'. Melissa McCarthy is the icing on the wedding cake for this film. 90% of her lines are hugely funny and slightly gross, the other 10% the voice of reason for Annie. <br/><br/>Still, as good as this film is, it's not perfect by any means. While Chris O'Dowd makes a sincere, puppy-dog-like romantic lead as Rhodes, I just don't buy the chemistry between Rhodes and Annie. Matt Lucas, of 'Litte Britain' fame and Rebel Wilson appear as Annie's housemates, a clue-less British brother and sister duo. I just can't get to grips with their scenes. They feel jarring and out of sync with the rest of the film, although I can't quite put my finger on why. <br/><br/>Still, nice film, not breaking any boundaries, but a good film to watch with your mates on a movie night in and have a giggle. <br/><br/>Roll the credits<br/><br/>Megan: 'You're your problem Annieand you're also your solution'"

There's a few comedic points of the movie but for the most part it's a typical sappy love story. The movie wasn't bad mind you just not what I was hoping to get out of the movie going experience. They call the movie Bridesmaids but it ought as well have been titled The Bridesmaid since the whole movie is basically about Kristen Wiig's character Annie. The Helen character and the bride Lilly get a bit of time too but the other 2 bridesmaids are basically after thoughts.

","Paul Feig has directed a comedy that will bring you to tears. He has turned the writings of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo into a side splitting comedy that just won't quit. It is not a ""Chick Flick"" as many may presume, but it is rather one hilarious scene after another as I have not seen in many years. The costuming is great. The casting by Allison Jones is perfect, and the cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is very effective. I don't know if he kept a straight face while filming, but it must have been a very difficult task. The audience should thank the producers for providing the audience with a full two hours of fun and frolic. I doubt that it could have been any better, and more just like it would be welcome from these truly professional comedians.

"GirishGowda","7","0","2","5 March 2012"," Good Times
","I wasn't interested in this movie even though it was being billed as the female version of ""The Hangover"". I liked The Hangover, but the trailers just didn't make me want to watch this movie. I'm not prejudicial when it comes to chick flicks and I do watch them with an open mind, but most comedies which are female-oriented tend to be on the boring side in my honest opinion as a guy. After it surprisingly got nominated for 2 Oscars, I had to watch ""Bridesmaids"". To be frank, I have watched only 4 movies out of all the Oscar nominated movies including all the technical categories as well. But I saw this movie due to the fact that Oscars don't nominate comedies for Best Picture, EVER! The closest was ""(500) Days of Summer"" which I absolutely love to pieces. So my expectations for ""Bridesmaids"" was pretty high.<br/><br/>Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) had to let go of her passion, the bakery because of the bad economy. She sleeps around with a guy who doesn't respect her, barely makes her payments, her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is getting married to a rich guy and the race for maid of honor is on with Helen (Rose Byrne), the new bestie who seems to be perfect for the job in every aspect, which culminates in Annie screwing up everything that comes along her way.<br/><br/>First things first! The movie is highly overrated and didn't deserve its Best Picture nomination. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is THE best comedy of 2011 and if any comedy had a right to be nominated for the Oscars, it was that amazing movie. Don't misunderstand me, I liked ""Bridesmaids"" and while I did enjoy it and laugh in many scenes, it plays it too safe. Secondly, I get that the movie is trying to send the message across to all of us guys that women aren't sex objects and we shouldn't objectify them. But the toilet humor was over the top and I always hate such cheap stuff. My real gripe is with the lead, Kristen Wiig. I love her in her SNL sketches, but I really didn't enjoy her character much in the movie. Annie was pathetic, unlikable and not even remotely funny most of the time! Which, in hindsight, was the way they wanted her character to go and so Wiig succeeded in that regard. Anyway, I didn't like nor care for her character one bit.<br/><br/>This movie has lots of stuff going for it though. Melissa McCarthy deserved her nomination as she was the one who got the most laughs and was perfect in her role. Her character could have come of as atrociously cheesy, but thankfully it doesn't. I don't think any female character has ever made me laugh so hard as much as Melissa's Megan did. The ensemble cast which involves the weird siblings, a little boy, the police officer, the bridesmaids themselves and others are fluid and really enjoyable. Girls will really like this movie, my friend was laughing like a maniac. All in all, this is one of the better comedies of the year and you should watch it, but don't expect it to blow your mind.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The only words to describe this comedy are COMEDY. Hilarious acting done by the whole cast, especially by Melissa McCarthy. Complete immersed in such dry humor you simple forget that there's a genuine story being told. Teaching people morals and other values, the plot was simple, creative and genuine. It was rare to see a scene that was ""boring"" or ""dull"". Every moment had a reason and served purpose. After witnessing this movie, I have no regrets, all star cast made it what it was and really forced the lines to come alive and make the whole family laugh out loud! The funniest scene HAD to have been when all of the bridesmaids had food poisoning and were trying on dress's together. All of the actresses put their best humor to the test and really came through. Watching the bride run out to the street in order to poop was the funniest thing I've seen in a while."
"yayasan40","10","0","4","1 March 2012"," Women are people...shocker!
","This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. People keep comparing it to the Hangover, but this film is far superior.<br/><br/>For one, although the Hangover is hilarious none of the characters are relateable or have any depth to them. Wigg and Rudolph's friendship is well developed and you feel for Wigg as she begins to face a new life without the one person in her life who gives her joy and helps her through her tough times.<br/><br/>I have been reading some of the bad reviews here, and it makes me sad. Now if ""gross out"" comedy is not your thing (in this day and age there is nothing that gross about it) then fine. This movie is not for you but then neither is the Hangover. When I see people here talking about how it's nothing but a ""chick flick"" or ""it's no hang over"" I can't help but feel like these people are trapped behind the times.<br/><br/>I think a lot of men, and some women too have a hard time with this movie because they don't want to see women as people. Women to some men are supposed to be ""the other."" We're not supposed to relate to them. They have periods and cry for no reason and do stupid things. That's how so many men unfortunately see women. Then there are women out there, who refuse to see themselves as people as well. They like going to a romantic comedy and seeing a really good looking fashionable girl who for some reason just can't find a good guy, and then TA DA! She meets Matthew McCoughnahey or Bradley Cooper and lives happily ever after.<br/><br/>It's sad that in 2012 we have to be reminded that WOMEN ARE PEOPLE. They chase the good looking guy who treats them like dirt. They have insecurities. They get angry. They fart and vomit. They're frustrated by the opposite gender and they share deep bonds with their best friend. Get over it.<br/><br/>Seriously some of these reviews just make no sense to me. The male love interest isn't a hunk. The women use foul language. It's a chick flick because GASP the characters have some depth, while others claim the movie has no character development or any substance. I really don't get it.<br/><br/>Since Something About Mary/American Pie mainstream movies have been dirty and gross. This one wasn't even that dirty or gross I honestly thing it's because people are uncomfortable in seeing women in these types of situations. Women are supposed to poop roses and fart rainbows. They're supposed to be the ones with all the power in the relationship, the ball breakers the evil bitches who can never appreciate the ""good guys"" of this world who will treat them well. They're not supposed to want to go to see male strippers in Vegas and if they do they're supposed to pretend like they don't like it and giggle.<br/><br/>I really don't get it. This movie was so charming, so hilarious, an ensemble cast (and it has Rebel Wilson who I fell in love with when i was living in Australia watching her show on SBS: ""Bogan Pride"") if you don't like it because it's Hollywood, fine. If you don't like it because it had sex and foul language, fine. But honestly most of the bad reviews seem to be coming form people who want to see women as not human. As some ideal ""other"" species incapable of having the same feelings, frustrations, shortcomings and yes, bodily functions that men have.<br/><br/>Get over it."
"estreet-eva","6","0","3","1 March 2012"," Comedy heavy on the drama
","The most surprising thing about this supposedly female version of ""The Hangover"" (and ""The Hangover II"" which was apparently the same movie) is how much it is not a female version of ""The Hangover"". While to some degree a raunchy comedy, the movie deals more with the complexities of female relationship and dealing with personal failure in life more similar to Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"". The movie take a long, well- informed look at the waning process of longstanding female relationships as well as female rivalry. The rivalry between Wiig's Annie Walker and a far more successful suitor for her best friend since grade school Lilian (Maya Rudolph)is the better developed with very funny scenes of one-ups- manship (or one-ups-womanship). Annie's coming-apart-at-the-seams development after she loses first a bakery business, boyfriend and eventually her best friend is also interesting to watch. You cannot blame Lilian's or Chris O'Dowd's character turning their back on her as her behavior gets more and more erratic. While the strong plot carries the movie, there are some very distracting problems. Wisconsin looks nothing like Southern California where a lot of it was shot. State policemen act nothing like Officer Rhodes and would quickly get fired if they did. Melissa MacCarthny's Megan, which got her an academy nom largely to make the group seem less stuffy, makes no sense. Is she supposed to be the Zach Galifianakis screw-up from ""The Hangover"" or the international spy we hear about towards the end of the film. Wendy McLendon-Covey's Rita is an interesting character given that she foreshadows the miserable life that Maya's character (who seems a little old to be getting married for the first time) is destined for later down the road. The film does have some surprisingly darker moments before the obligatory ending dance number. In short, more substance here than you have been lead to believe although there are some genuinely funny moments."

The acting is great, the relationships between all of the characters are so natural you can almost relate to them. Rose Byrne was especially good, her portrayal of Helen was spot on, with the fake smiles and laughs. Kirsten Wiig and Maya Rudolph are known to be good friends and it is shown greatly in this film. Melissa McCarthy does steal the show here and fully deserves her Oscar nomination - she's hilarious. You almost wish you knew someone like her because she provides over half of the films' comedy.<br/><br/>I guess the plot outline is fairly basic and predictable but you hardly notice it because the humour in this film shines through in nearly every scene. <br/><br/>Overall, if you have not seen this, watch it - it will make you laugh all the way through. It's brilliant because it's a chick flick with harsh language, vulgarity and cringe-worthy circumstances which are sadly rare in this genre of film which is often considered trash - 'Bridesmaids' is what chick flicks should be like."

","I must admit whenever i first saw the advertisement for Bridesmaids, i was not overly enthusiastic about seeing it. I thought it was going to be yet another chick flick surrounding romance and weddings. But boy was i wrong. This is much more than just any chick flick, in fact its that hilarious my sides were splitting with laughter at times.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is a fairly simple movie, which centres around Annie, the girl who has recently been unlucky in life. Her best friend is getting married and she is finding the role of maid of honour and all the planning which surrounds it overwhelmimg. Of course the path of true love does not run smoothly, therefore comedy ensues.<br/><br/>Without being too forthright, Bridemaids is a filthy, vulgar, over the top comedic experience, that attempts to affect your limits of compassion, just as much as the extent of hilarity. The stand out scenes for me where that in the bridal store and also the girls flight on an aeroplane for the batchelorette party. These scenes in particular, had the uncomfortable comedy effect, where you don't really want to watch, but at the same time, can't help yourself from watching.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids had a surprising amount of depth to it, which was something I didn't expect. The narrative takes time to develop its characters and also establishes the various relationships and conflicts that the women have. The themes that are explored within this film, are nothing out of the ordinary but certainly ones that an audience can relate to easily. And even though comedy is one the main elements throughout, there are also some very heartfelt moments.<br/><br/>Annie is most developed character in the narrative. She is someone who feels completely let down by life, with having one thing after the other happening and not in a very good way. This is something that I'm sure the majority of people can also relate to. Not only do you witness the personal journey her character goes through, but you can also feel it. Despite the fact that the other bridesmaids were not developed as much as Annie, they certainly hold their place within the film, each in their own individual and unique way.<br/><br/>I do believe though that the length of the film should have been cut down slightly more. At times there are way too many subplots going on, which where not even fully explored, and arguably yes it goes too over the top at times. But with everything else in the film being so entertaining, these are only minor criticisms.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids is definitely one of the most enjoyable comedies I have seen in a while. It has all the heart and charm of a romcom, but is not afraid of pulling out all the stops, just because the leading cast are female. It may not be perfect, but it is a perfect catalyst to have for a girls night in."

","As raunchy as any female flick could bear, BRIDESMAIDS is not just a female version of THE HANGOVER spin-off. It hinges firmly on a 3S lady's (single, seventies and stuck) personal mire, and elaborates a watchable diagram of friendship and, eventually a tad of love. <br/><br/>The film manages a tug-of-war competition between our protagonist Annie Walker as her childhood BFF Lillian's maid of honor and an almost immaculate bridesmaid Helen (a new friend of Lillian) to the coronet of the best friend of the bride, the battle is inequitably brutal since Helen's filthy rich and such a phony, thus soon it plummets into a steep plight for Annie. However a fairly anticipated buck-up is congenially under the way, so no more melodrama and a woman's victory is all well-deserved. <br/><br/>The film is a tailor-made vehicle for Kristine Wiig (who co-writes the script) and her comedic bent has grabbed the best platform to bloom and it is an awesome job! The hysterical turmoil of her life is surprisingly conceived with humor and self-mockery. Among the sidekicks Melissa McCathy is another feat on screen, her embodiment of life with her own weight is the best part in the film and expunges extensively the side effect of a hackneyed plot contrivance. Also Wiig's Saturday NIGHT LIVE co-star Maya Rudolph and an inscrutably dulcet Rose Byrne are adeptly cast. The great news is that the film has become the highest grossing R-rated female comedy of all time in USA, while a sad thing is that it is Jill Clayburgh's final film. <br/><br/>It is also another triumph for the producer Judd Apatow (after the tepid welcome of FUNNY PEOPLE 2009), he is still able to pioneer the red-hot craze for the modern-day comedy and be innovative, I hope BRIDESMAIDS 2 will not be a disheartening cool-down as THE HANGOVER PART II (2011) did."

","I'm seriously shocked by all the hype surrounding ""Bridesmaids"". I understand the Best Picture Musical/Comedy mention at the Golden Globes, because the competition there is always quite weak, but the nomination for Best Picture of the year at the PGA's? Sorry, but I don't get it. I didn't dislike the film at all, though. I thought it was a rather funny comedy with a good screenplay and better acting, hence the relatively high mark, but that's it! <br/><br/>I admit that the scene with the teenager at the jewelery store, Annie's breakdown at Lillian's bridal shower and the plane incident were hilarious. Kristen Wiig does a really good job and carries the whole film so well it's astonishing, considering her lack of experience as a leading lady. Rose Byrne and Melissa McCarthy are highlights as well. The latter, though, is receiving way too much praise in my opinion for her performance as Megan. She is definitely one of the best parts of the film, but I think her character is too one-dimensional to be getting that much attention.<br/><br/>There are a couple of things I didn't really like. First, the food- poisoning scene. I thought it was too much and not funny at all, actually. The other thing that didn't do it for me was the whole romantic storyline. I felt they gave it too much screen time and that the film could have easily got rid of it. I would have preferred if it had focused only in the relationships between the bridesmaids, which is the best thing about it.<br/><br/>Finally, I must dedicate a few words to Jon Hamm. How come he wasn't even credited? He was hilariously funny as Annie's ""sexual partner"". Sure his screen time is reduced, but he's a real scene-stealer!"

The scenes with sexual banter and/or bodily functions aren't the basis of the movie's humoristic side; they're merely a backdrop adding an ""Oh my!"" to the overall atmosphere."

","This movie does divide people. It is very foul mouthed and it does not care if you like the language or the way the characters act in it. I do respect if people feel offended by it. Unfortunately that will cloud their view of the underlying themes in this. Just because it is crass and vulgar, it doesn't mean it's pointless.<br/><br/>Quite the opposite is the case. You have strong themes of friendship, envy and growing older to bare (well our characters have to bare those things). Not to mention the whole wedding thing, that is quite a big deal for every woman. I didn't enjoy every joke, but I liked the way women handled themselves in this. Our main character has an arch and you can clearly see her progress through the whole film (and all the jokes).<br/><br/>Again, if you are easily offended this is not for you. Don't expect it to be a female Hangover either. And then you might enjoy it too :o)"

","Having heard good things about Bridesmaids, I was really looking forward to watching this film. Boy was I let down! I actually turned off my TV half way through the movie. While this film does have its moments, the moments are only somewhat funny. On top of that, there is not one original joke. I now can relate to the many other bad reviews on this board.<br/><br/>On the flip side...wait...there really is no flip side. This is an average comedy at best. This may sound harsh, but I truly believe my third grade self could compete with the humor in this film. I also think that many people share this belief.

","This movie isn't quite as overrated as Paul was, despite the fact that it got even better reviews. This movie has three things that saved it. 1. The way it made me actually care about Kristen Wigg's friendship with the bride. 2. The bridal shower scene. And 3. the most important one, the fat chick, Meghan, played by Melissa McCarthy. Good Lord was that chick hilarious. The scene where she just went screw it and began crapping in a sink almost had me in tears. Every time she was on screen, I had a smile on my face. I wish the same could be said for the rest of the film. This movie has very unfunny scenes, the stuff on the plane wasn't funny, the scene where Kristen Wigg and Rose Byrne are trying to get attention from the cop wasn't that funny (exept when the car rolled by and no one was seen in the car), and that scene where Kristen and Rose are trying to give the better speech, Oh my God, shut UP!!! That's another problem, this movie is way, way too long, this movie is about 2 hours and 5 minutes long, that's already pretty long for a comedy, but for me, it felt like five hours. Seriously, if a movie is 2 hours long and it fells like 5, something has gone horribly wrong.<br/><br/>5/10"

","""You read my diary? - At first I did not know it was your diary, I thought it was a very sad handwritten book."" <br/><br/>At first you'd think that 'Bridesmaids' would just be another romcom. Women having a good time before the wedding with a bachelorette party, meeting men etc and losing every male audience member while doing it. Well, 'Bridesmaids' proves to be a fresh example of a new strong female comedy.<br/><br/>'Bridesmaids' is directed by Paul Feig, who has made a name of himself directing award winning TV series like 'The Office', 'Mad Men' and 'Weeds'. But this is not the reason why 'Bridesmaids' is a success. The whole glory and honor goes to Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who have written the script. What I've read is that Wiig and Mumolo (who makes a short appearance in the movie as the nervous plane passenger) wrote the basic plot and dialogue for the film and when the film went in to production, the cast met and rehearsed for a couple of weeks. The dialogue, the scenes that then came to the screen are mostly improvised by the performers.<br/><br/>Wiig stars in her first major role as Annie, a 30 something woman who has lost pretty much everything. Her fiancé, her business and self respect. Her societal clock is ticking. We all know that in the US, a woman of that age is considered a failure. Get married, get children and lose yourself in the illusion inside the white picket fence. She tries to do everything to get her hands on the cocky money man (Jon Hamm), even though she knows that he's just using her.<br/><br/>Despite all this crap in her life, she does have something nice happening in her life (not to her, though). Her best friend Lily (Maya Rudolph) is getting married and asks her to be her maid of honor. Without money, how does she manage to make Lily's day the best ever possible? And then there's Lily's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne) fighting for the title BFF, doing everything she can to make Annie look meaningless.<br/><br/>The bachelorette party, Vegas, the bridal shower. All clichés that has to be in the movie of course, but the scenes end up being nothing close to a cliché. We have the female rat pack including Megan, Rita and Becca. Megan (Melissa McCarthy) is the not so typical woman. She's more of a masculine trashtalker who has limitless confidence towards the opposite sex. Rita is bored with her ""perfect"" life and Becca is a sweet innocent woman who knows NOTHING of the real life. Six different women celebrating the last days of Lily's single life. What could go wrong? <br/><br/>Like I said earlier, Paul Feig has nothing to do with the success of 'Bridesmaids'. It's a good thing that he has let loose the women and let them go on their way. Wiig and McCarthy are powerful comedians and there are several scenes that will deliver serious laughter. The scene in the bridal shop, the airplane, the bridal shower to name a few. <br/><br/>There was one unfamiliar face that I started to like a lot. Chris O'Dowd who plays the police officer did a fantastic and in my opinion a realistic performance. I enjoyed it a lot and I'm sure that after the success of 'Bridesmaids', he (as Kristen Wiig) will get some serious offers from the production companies.<br/><br/>There is one thing that ""bothered"" me. Like most of the other Apatow productions, 'Bridesmaids' could've been edited a 10-15 minutes shorter. Fortunately 'Bridesmaids' ain't no 'Funny People' in length but some repetitive comedy can be seen in the film.<br/><br/>But now for the real reason why 'Bridesmaids' is in my opinion a good movie. This movie has some enormous emotional depth. When was the last time you saw a film with female leads talking of something else than men? Women and their ways of thinking will always be somewhat of a mystery to men but 'Bridesmaids' investigates and gives a realistic (at least that is what I think) view on how the female friendship works. The movie gives a whole different perspective on women and their friendship on the screen. F**k all the lame '27 Dresses', 'In Her Shoes' and 'Bride Wars'. This is the real stuff (still, just thinking over here!) <br/><br/>I hope that 'Bridesmaids' will change the view on how studios see female comedies. This film is smart, sexy, funny and in some ways cruel. It doesn't star the soon-to-be relics like Julia Roberts or whatever. The cast is somewhat unfamiliar to the bigger audience but managed to make hell of a lot of money because of the strong cast and performances. Recommended! Also to those with a purple helmeted beaver basher."

","No points for plot or story. You can pretty much tell exactly where every relationship and character arc is headed, and at over 2 hours it becomes a bit unnecessary. Luckily the film is just fantastically funny. It really does know how to play out all kinds of humour. From those embarrassing moments, to gross-out set pieces, and a variety of oddball characters. Wiig plays Annie, who has just been asked to be the maid of honour at her best friend's wedding. Cue a series of comical mishaps and a rivalry with Rose Byrne. Chris O'Dowd really stood out to me, undoing most of the harm from Gulliver's Travels. His relationship with Wiig seemed believable and was a good anchor point for the rest of the shenanigans. There were times when this very comical cast tried to outdo each other in the now common improv scenes. This was sometimes too distracting as it would just go on and on. Melissa McCarthy should also be applauded for taking on a role with no shame. Great cast, great jokes, just a bit overstretched in places."

","I was under the impression that 'Bridesmaids' would be another ditzy rom-com, perhaps something on the lines of the ghastly 'Bridewars'. I had been avoiding it for some time until word of mouth got to me and I learned of its international ensemble that included many gifted comedy actors. It turned out to be quite a pleasant and refreshing surprise. It has the polished look of those typical New York rom-coms and even the romance and dramatic moments of that genre but what sets it apart is the dialogue and the crudeness which really gives it more of a touch of reality and it is done so amusingly. The humour is very dirty but the jokes work excellently. It's nice to see a comedy for a change with interesting and funny female characters swearing and cussing and make fools of themselves. All the actors perform confidently. Kristin Wiig (whose also the co-writer alongside Annie Mumolo) does an excellent job in carrying the film. She is wonderfully supported by the first rate Rose Byrne, competent Maya Rudolph, scene stealer Melissa McCarthy, laidback Chris O'Dowd, always dependable Jill Claybourgh (in her final role) and many more. The writers and actors ensure that there's plenty to laugh at and I found myself laughing out loud many times. I see that many have compared it to 'The Hangover' but in my opinion, 'Bridesmaids' is both funnier and cleverer."

","I don't know why I thought that this film would be one of those dumb in-your-face explicit comedies that seem to be the trend lately. Maybe it was the title, which made me think it'd be about a bunch of drunken bridesmaids having sex left and right. Maybe it was because the person who recommended it hasn't had the best taste in films. Either way, I watched it with low expectation - and I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>It's darker and deeper, with well-developed characters. All the bridesmaids have different backgrounds which result in their having different characteristics. The protagonist's character is well told and it's played really well by Kristen Wiig. We can sympathise with her 'going down the drain' life, even when she's being weird and crazy.<br/><br/>The main event of the film is of course the rivalry between our protagonist and her best friend's NEW best friend, which are funny at times and frustrating at others. There's a good mix of drama and comedy in the whole storyline, but as the consequence, there are some awkward moments there as well - some funny parts are not realistic enough compared to the more serious dramatic parts. But hey, that's how life is - sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry. It's still a refreshing comedy compared to what Hollywood is dishing out these days."
"meeza","7","0","2","25 November 2011"," Here comes the ""Bridesmaids"", all dressed in just alright
","I am sorry to separate myself from most of the moviegoer audience, but I just did not feel the love of ""Bridesmaids"" and think it's the most overrated movie of the year. Now, don't get me wrong, I did not mind walking down the cinematic aisle with a viewing of ""Bridesmaids"". It did have its share of shits and giggles, especially the former in a most- talked about bridal dress shop scene. But the movie has been hailed as the top comedy of 2011 by many film critics, and I just don't think it deserves that ring of honor. ""Bridesmaids"" stars the always enigmatic Kristen Wiig as Annie, yea she is a bridesmaid and also the maid of honor of her best gal pal Lilian played by Maya Rudolph. Annie is intimidated by Lilian's new close friend Helen (Rose Byrne) who is an egocentric socialite who will stop at nothing to be Lilian's new best friend and dethrone Annie from that classification. Sounds like silly teenage girls battling for a ""best friend"" confirmation, doesn't it? Well, that is pretty much how it is in ""Bridesmaids"". Now, that is not what ""Bridesmaids"" is all about. There is the rest of Lilian's bridesmaids entourage- the bored housewife Rita (Wendi McClendon-Covey), the adventure-seeker Becca (Ellie Kemper), and the zany Megan (Melissa McCarthy). Director Paul Feig dresses up ""Bridesmaids"" with many aspects that have already been addressed in other chick-flick movies; the jealous friend, the villainous socialite, the crazy obese character, and the formulaic rom-com storyline. The primary romantic storyline in the movie is of Annie and police officer Nathan Rhodes. They are opposites that are destined to be together; and their boy-gets-girl, girl-loses- boy, girl-desperately tries to get boy again-in movie's final scene is a narrative feature that has been exposed way too many times in this genre. Sure, I am speaking now to forever hold this piece on what is awry of ""Bridesmaids"", but there was some positive uniformity in the film. Kirsten Wiig was very good as Annie, and the Annie protagonist is what made me want to hold on to ""Bridesmaids"" as much as I can. Wiig continues to get ""wiiigy with it"" as one of the best female comedic actresses in today's Hollywood. Chris O'Dowd no doubt was arrestingly charismatic as the witty-liner Officer Dowd. And it was very joyous, even though a bit heartbreaking, to see legendary actress Jill Clayburgh in her final performance as Annie's mom. Clayburgh passed away a few months ago. Wiig and Annie Mumolo scripted up the ""Bridesmaids"" screenplay with some funny lines, but not enough in the ""laugh out loud"" department. A lot has been talked about new comedy queen Melissa McCarthy's performance as the madcap Megan, now it was good but not to the level of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination as it has been buzzed around. Megan sure did a bit of scene-stealing in ""Bridesmaids"" but I think it does have a bit of Alan-takeoff in them. You don't know what I am referring to, stream or Netflix ""The Hangover"" and ""The Hangover Part 2"", which it would be an exercise of futility because chances are you already saw them. Jon Hamm's performance as a womanizer who uses Annie for sex is one of the most pointless performances of the year, Hamm is a good actor and I don't want him to be a mad man towards me for my comments but his talents were wasted here. ""Bridesmaids"" is a recommendable feature, but there is not enough colorful-movie coordination for it to be proclaimed as a comedic classic. *** Average"

","A moderately funny comedy that highlights the considerable talents of the under-utilized Kristen Wiig and makes you wish she had been given better material to work with.<br/><br/>When Wiig and her ""Saturday Night Live"" fellow alumna, Maya Rudolph, are on screen together, the chemistry is palpable and makes one wonder why someone didn't think to give these two a buddy comedy along the lines of ""Baby Mama."" But instead, Rudolph gets little screen time, and the show belongs to Wiig. Wiig is a very funny comedienne, but the character she gets to play wears out her welcome early on, long before the movie wants to let her learn the lesson all such formulaic comedies must have their main characters learn and rebound for that happy ending. Therefore, the crash and burn that Wiig's character endures becomes pathetic instead of funny, despite Wiig's frantic efforts to wring comedy out of situations that don't lend themselves much to laughs.<br/><br/>Still, the film is a diverting enough amusement for a Friday night, and there are enough laughs to make some of the more mediocre parts worth sitting through.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

Just adding some jokes about shitting yourself does not make it a edgy. The lead character is extremely unlikable, and though she acts like a complete dick throughout the film towards her friend and love interest she never apologies and for some reason they end up apologizing to her. <br/><br/>The pacing was terrible, the film was way too long.

"brando647","9","0","3","2 November 2011"," One of the Few Rom-Coms I Can Enjoy
","Of my entire DVD collection, there are only a handful of romantic comedies because, no offense to fans of the genre, most of them are total crap. Predictable, corny, and shallowI would rather suffer through a Uwe Boll marathon than watch the average romantic comedy. Leave it to producer Judd Apatow and rising star Kristen Wiig to actually make a romantic comedy worth watching. It's a chick flick that despite it's themes of female friendship/bonds, weddings, and relationships, is still funny enough for men to enjoy. Any doubts in my mind were erased when I saw this film in theaters and a scene was so disgusting that it caused a group of elderly women who didn't know what they were getting into to leave the theater muttering about how filthy the movie is (for the record, it was the infamous dress shopping/food poisoning scene). The movie follows the character of Annie (Wiig) as her life essentially falls apart around her. She hates her job, lives with a pair of obnoxious roommates, and the closest thing she has to a relationship is ""no strings attached"" sex with a man who laughs at the thought of an actual relationship. She holds on well enough until her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces that she's gotten engaged. Of course, Annie is going to be her maid of honor but there appears to be some competition in the form of Lillian's new friend/wife of her fiancé's boss, Helen (Rose Byrne). Helen is wealthy, tasteful, and impeding on Annie's territory. As the wedding draws near, the two butt heads over everything from the dresses to the wedding shower, but there can be only onewait, wrong movie.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig deserved this movie. She's one of the best talents to come from SNL in recent years and she's provided some hilarious supporting performances movies like MACGRUBER and PAUL. This movie is her chance to be a leading woman and she knocks it out of the park. I love the awkwardness Wiig infuses into her characters; her character feels really genuine in this movie. She's struggling to get by and luck just isn't on her side. She means well as she tries to help Lillian plan her wedding but her plans just turn into disaster, and Helen is there to take advantage of every misstep. I feel like I've seen Rose Byrne has been everywhere lately; I know I've got at least 2-3 other films she's been in this year. No complaints though, because she's great. She's proved her comedic chops in GET HIM TO THE Greek and she continues her excellent work here. She's snotty, overbearing, and self-centered without coming off as a caricature. And then there's the A+ supporting cast giving their best here: former SNL alum Maya Rudolph, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Ellie Kemper. Melissa McCarthy stands out as probably the funniest bridesmaid in the crew. She's been compared a lot lately to being the Zach Galifianakis of the BRIDESMAIDS team and it's pretty accurate. She's the schlubby, socially inept goofball of the group and steals most scenes. Finally, there's Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm as Annie's love interests and opposite ends of a spectrum, both providing some great laughs (especially Hamm).<br/><br/>Earning almost $300 million worldwide, BRIDESMAIDS was a blatant success and proves that romantic comedies don't have to be mass-produced from the same mold. I'm hoping the cash this movie banked will convince filmmakers to put some creative energy into future rom-coms instead of flooding the market with cheap garbage. I'm glad to see Kristen Wiig getting so much attention from this film and I hope that means she'll be getting more leading roles in the future. This movie is hilarious and has a lot of feeling behind it. If there is a comedy where men and woman can come together and both enjoy it, it's this one."
"jzappa","7","0","2","14 October 2011"," A Smarter, Funnier, Ultimately Not a Whole Lot Less Petty Sex and the City
","I would say Kristen Wiig fixes a bawdy, plucky and boldly estrogen-soaked banner in the male-dominated raunch-comedy genre with this comedy from the Judd Apatow workshop that his fans have long been hoping for, were it not for that the dilemma at the center of the film is an earnest jealousy over who gets to plan a girlfriend's wedding and lose all self-control when you're not chosen to do so. It's not empowering in the way 9 to 5 or A League of Their Own are, but more like a smarter, funnier, ultimately not a whole lot less petty Sex and the City.<br/><br/>Wiig plays a has-been cupcake entrepreneur whose bakery went bust in the downturn and whose love life comprises ad hoc sex with her obnoxiously vain bed pal, in a hilarious turn by Jon Hamm. Indeed, Bridesmaids opens with one of Wiig and Hamm's vigorous sessions in bed, an unmistakable broadcast that this is a movie that doesn't want much to do with restraint like most chick flicks. When Wiig finds that her lifetime best friend Maya Rudolph is engaged, and that Wiig herself is to be maid of honor, the new reality propels her into a cave-in of resentment, unhappiness and self-pity. But when it's revealed that Rudolph's bridal party will also involve the moneyed, statuesque, impossibly proper Rose Byrne, Wiig's anxieties filter into extravagant circumstances of uncontrollable impulses. This New Money snob is plainly a challenger for Wiig's BFF position, a rallying call Wiig confronts with a swelling succession of ill-advised efforts at one-upswomanship, each bombardment including at least a couple of cup sizes full of explosive laughs.<br/><br/>As funny as these moments are, it's the smaller, more perceptive ones in this Apatow production that I hoped would make it worth appreciating, for director of Bridesmaids is Paul Feig, creator of Apatow's early call to arms for all his talented regulars, Freaks and Geeks, also both touching and hilarious. And indeed, an early scene here with Wiig and Rudolph, in which a chat effortlessly rolls from blowjobs to finely conveyed inside jokes, seizes the patterns and mutual implicit back story of friendship without a glitch. When Wiig meets a romantic-interest policeman named Rhodes, played expressively by Irish actor Chris O'Dowd, the sense is likewise discreet and credible. But this diverting but unfocused formula comedy, which gets this handful of qualities so spot-on, doesn't appear to grasp that it's wide of the mark for much of the remainder: It's content to indulge in graphic and humiliating inconsequentialities, and bashful about the material about which it should've been graphic and indulgent.<br/><br/>Wiig has the unaffected beauty and self-deprecating showmanship it takes to be a star comedienne. She so deftly manages both the laughs and the more tender frowny-faced side of Bridesmaids that the movie's supporting characters often don't have the opportunity to come into their own. Paul Thomas Anderson's talented consort Rudolph is too often demoted to judgmental on-looker of Wiig's behavior.<br/><br/>As two of Wiig's fellow dyed-to-complement entourage, Wendi McClendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper have virtually nothing to do, except one scene culminating in amusingly maudlin drunkenness. In fact, the one eponymous character who imperils to give Wiig a movie-stealing hustle for the envelope is the groom's husky sister Megan, played by an unvaryingly laugh-out-loud Melissa McCarthy.<br/><br/>It's an excessively manufactured hodgepodge, attempting too many comic ideas that ultimately drown the core theme of what a modern woman needs from friendship, love and marriage. If the movie was meant to be bolder, it definitely had a apt satirical foil at its center. The issue of overindulgence, which inculcate the series of extravagant parties in the long build-up to the overstated wedding that ends the movie is left virtually ignored. Never does Bridesmaids ever try for real biting stuff. So at the same time as it feels unreasonable to carp that Bridesmaids never comes together as a cutting satire of the demeaning protocol of getting married that it portrays, the existence of other comedies in Apatow's canon, perhaps especially Feig's work, which develop their character arcs into something more complete and poignant, prevails as an gauge of Bridesmaids' lack."

That's where I was wrong.<br/><br/>Besides being really funny, ""Bridesmaids"" had depth you rarely see in comedies. You laughed at what was happening and also often times felt with the characters. Whether it was lonely Annie, who'd given up on the world or Lillian, who probably thought everything leading up to her wedding was going to be perfect and wasn't, or even Helen who really just needed a friend. These women were three dimensional and the movie played that out very well.<br/><br/>The funny scenes were random, laugh out loud moments in the best sense. This movie was not at all over the top. No, it wasn't perfect. For example, the sex scene in the beginning went on for too long and was a little awkward to watch because of that. However, it didn't deter the rest of the movie. Not at all. Rose Byrne's character was someone you could easily hate and get annoyed of, yet by the end feel almost sorry for.<br/><br/>Kristen Wiig as Annie does a fantastic job carrying the movie and her funny moments, along with her more dramatic ones are excellent as well. Also, she co-wrote the movie! I see great things in her future.<br/><br/>Melissa McCarthy really brings the laughs in this one. Especially the scene on the plane with the fire marshal. Wonderful all around.<br/><br/>So, go ahead and give this movie a try. It'll probably be better than you expected! 9 out of 10 stars!"

","This movie definitely exceeded my expectations. But it did take a while for it to happen. Other than the fact the opening for the movie was a sex scene, despite the title the whole film revolves around the maid of honor, trying to best out one of the bridesmaids (who's younger, prettier, and richer) who's coming in between her friendship with the bride, while the other three bridesmaids couldn't accumulate more than forty-five minutes of screen time in a two-hour long movie.<br/><br/>But other than that, the film is actually pretty funny. I haven't had a good laugh watching a comedy in a long time. The plane scene in my opinion was hilarious, while the attention-car scene at the end was priceless. Kristen Wiig is a very talented actress and I don't believe they could have chosen someone better to play the role of Annie. Same goes for Rose Byrne in the role of Helen.<br/><br/>In the end, I guess you need a clear head to watch this. Because if you're gonna be thinking ""this is so unrealistic"" or ""no one ever acts like"" than don't even bother watching it. If not, then you should definitely see it!"

I had already mentioned that she was by far the best cast member in Saturday Night live, but not only is she great at the comedy but she also gives a heartfelt character. Melissa mcCarthy was also enjoyable, as was Rose Byrne who was freakin HOT. Overall, I was pleased with this comedy. My complaints would be that while it is a very funny film, there is nothing that stands out as original in its storyline and it is rather formulaic when the plot is looked at. Still, definitely enjoyable and worth a watch."
"dung0301","5","0","2","7 October 2011"," It's different, if you can stand for more than 30 minutes at the beginning, you'll enjoy it.
","I did not view the trailer of Bridesmaids before watching the full film, and hoped to watch a deep film, expected a little joke, a little romantic, a little classical sex - maybe, and a hidden meaning - must be. Not all things gained, but overall, it's a good movie, I have to say it's about 8 over 10.<br/><br/>I read some previous comments, some said that this film is kinda amazing, lots of humors, laughing - what watchers all expect, and was partly contained in Bridesmaids. However, ""most of the ""funny"" scenes were either involving sex, about sex, about poop/vomit/farting/burping"", and the first scene is a real one ""porn"" - which subtracts some points. In addition, about 40 minutes at the beginning, you can say this film is pointless, and some long scene, I think the director could cut off, as the length is over 2 hours, which, in my point of view, should be 90 minutes, more or less. What makes this film worth watching is after the scene that the main character - Annie, hit her bottom. Yet, I still cannot understand why Annie doesn't want to bake cookies or run her Cake Baby again while she is only good at this (on the film, after she was fired, how does she live?). Another annoyance is the asshole, who slept with Annie and just wants to not be serious. This happens but it's a little confusing why she hangs out with him why she knew about him.<br/><br/>Good things about this film? I must tell you a quotation: ""You're your problems, and your solution"". Moreover, there were some romantic, deep and sweet moments that bring some credit: the romantic love about the official who loves Annie, a remarkable ""tough & strong"" guy , the story of Megan about bullying stuffs, and joke scene's involving her.

","Annie's (Kristen Wiig) life spirals into chaos through a cascade of events spurred by the announcement that her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is to get married and she is to be her maid of honour. After failed business investments and a love-life in self-inflicted permanent hell (punctuated by masochistic nights spent with her egocentric prick sex buddy) she seems to have already hit bottom. Only to be proved entirely wrong, when Lillian's work associate, the sumptuous Whitney (Jessica St. Clair), collides head on with Annie in trying to fulfil the bridesmaids honours. The remainder of Lillian's ragtag team of the Brides little helpers is made up of foul-mouthing mom of three rascals Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), goodie-two-shoes Becca (Ellie Kemper) and tomboy Megan (Melissa Mccarthy), the movies very successful response to Alan from ""Hangover"". The entourage is however secondary, as the movie really and truly focuses on Annie and her debacles with only limited time offered to the supporting cast.<br/><br/>As chaos reigns laughter ensues. Sometimes in droves, but more often with a little smirk of enjoyment. The movie in the end does turn out to be a bundle of fun, but it does have a very weird mix of conversation based humour, subtle absurdities and situational comedy with immature fart and anal jokes coupled with people thinking that swearing equals being funny (both these points punctuated by the appearance of Matt Lucas of Little England ignominy). In the end not everything works in this slightly chaotic comedy unsure of which direction to best take. Add to that some some of the key jokes in the movie just dragged on beyond their expiry date replacing a good laugh with an internal suggestion for the editor to recut the movie. But after an uneven start our girls in pink really get going and break inhibitions to force out a tirade of laughter. The dramatic side of the story is also very well written, so you feel strongly drawn to sympathise with Annie, whilst simultaneously screaming at the screen for her being such an emotional moron. However irritating she is as a person, you somehow end up gunning for her and happy she found a pastry munching Irish cop to get romantically involver with.. <br/><br/>The ending left me slightly disappointed. Rushed and lacking the warmth of the build-up it really would have done better with some more minutes to prepare for the big resolution.<br/><br/>Definitely up there with recent comedies such as ""Role Models"" or ""Hangover"", but for brief issues with pacing and bad jokes. The movie also feels way too engineered and sincere for its own good. Being the response to ""Hangover"" doesn't help it one bit in this regard."

","Not since Tommy Boy did I laugh out loud so hard. Melissa McCarthy made this movie. Kristin Wiig is excellent and has more talent than most. She is confident enough to know not to overplay her character. Most comedy's today are a string of lousy sketches with the hope some type of theme will emerge...which rarely happens.<br/><br/>Bridesmaids scores here with a decent little movie to boot. The director could have let Maya Rudolph show more of her comedic chops. She played things well under the radar. Jessica St. Clair nailed the beauty queen well with fine acting.<br/><br/>See this movie...laugh out loud! If you are reading this director (and you really should) there is NO excuse for a bad movie today. Learn from the masters...craft a good story and allow your actors to make magic.

","THE GOOD - I am not a romantic comedy fan. I'll admit that. However, I am a fan of good movies. This movie is ridiculously funny! The story centers on a bridesmaid at odds with another bridesmaid for her best friend's affection. Jealousy and competition ensues! We follow our heroine's life as the world just continues to take a dump on her. That's the sum of the story. A movie about love and jealousy among the ladies. I'm male, but I feel as if I am one of the girls in the story. I am one of the bridesmaids as we take a glimpse into the various relationship problems, which bind the story.<br/><br/>THE QUESTIONABLE - Some may find it a little long for a two hour comedy movie but I have to tell you - two hours of laughs. Come on! <br/><br/>THE BAD - Perhaps the worst part of this film was the fact that most of the side plot dealing with the side characters was never integrated into the main character's part of the movie. It almost felt like a TV show. You know, where we are following different stories that never really work well with the overall story. But hey whatever so <br/><br/>WHY do I give this a8/10 IMDb style or a very high 3 out of 4 stars. Look my original IMDb rating for this film was a 7/10. But I switched it to 8/10 because I believe the chief purpose of a comedy is to make us laugh. I can't say most comedy movies make you laugh and feel for the characters throughout. This one did. More than that, this movie is one of those stories where certain memorable scenes will stick with you for a while. Chicks using the bathroom on the streets, breakdowns in front of people, being used by studs for sex, getting drunk and getting kicked off a plane... If this sounds interesting to you I'm sure you will be interested in watching ""Bridesmaids""."

","Why should guys have all the ungoverned gross out laughs in films seems to be the intent of Bridesmaids a very funny response to the men behaving silly Hangover franchise.

In the role of the requisite funny fat guy ala Zach Galifinakis, Jack Black etc. Mellissa Mc Carthey fits the role perfectly with the same self assured dead pan flare.<br/><br/>While the cast and the situations do hold there own in the zany department with guy versions Bridesmaids begins to drag with time outs for melancholy reflection and heart to hearts stretching the film beyond two hours resulting in diluting the full comic thrust and while it prevents Bridesmaids from becoming the bride of all comedies there are more than enough belly laughs for a good time to be had by all."

","A genuinely funny script that didn't really need to go the gross-out route, it doesn't suffer for choosing to do so anyway. At its best during a rapid-fire first hour, the humor cools off noticeably when the drama llama rears its head during the home stretch, like it suddenly decided not to fully commit to any one specific identity. Though it occasionally presses too far over the line separating awkward humor and legitimate discomfort, the flick's lively, personable cast is never far off, life preserver tucked under one arm. Loaded with all-stars from every corner of the comedy spectrum, the jokes are delivered with predictable credibility, with many cast members also showing a surprisingly strong set of dramatic chops to boot. Despite a sappy, lovesick ending that seems to stand in contrast to its initial character, this is a witty, charming, raunchy little bundle of joy that's as good as you've probably heard, no more and no less."

","Bridesmaids directed by Paul Feig, written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig.<br/><br/>Starring Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, and Chris O'Dowd.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying expectations for this film were pretty high, and they were met to a certain degree. Bridesmaids is a fairly entertaining film, with several funny moments but also several WTF one's as well.<br/><br/>The basic plot is that of Annie a woman who lost not only her boyfriend but also all of her savings. She then finds that she has been picked as her best friend's maid of honor, where she finds herself working through some weird rituals alongside a group of bridesmaids.<br/><br/>This film has some nice direction (alongside other things) and some funny moments. It's pretty impressive considering the fact that this is Kristen Wiig's first leading role (I don't think she's very funny on SNL), and there's some funny moments from other members of the cast (especially Jon Hamm in a cameo as Ted a man that Annie has a sexual relationship with).<br/><br/>One note of interest is that this is Jill Clayburgh's final film (the actress that played Annie's mother).

"estebangonzalez10","Null","0","2","16 September 2011"," Funniest Comedy of 2011
","¨You're like the maid of dishonor¨ Bridesmaids isn't your ordinary chick flick, and I wouldn't necessary call it the female version of The Hangover either, because this movie works very well for a male audience as well. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo managed to write one of the funniest scripts of the year in my opinion. I hadn't laughed so hard in a movie for quite some time. This is definitely the best comedy I've seen all year. Kristen Wiig not only co-wrote the script, but she also played the main character of the film; and she was absolutely hilarious. Mumolo also had a small cameo as one of the passengers in the plane that sat next to Wiig. After watching Bridesmaids all I can say is that I hope that these two actresses continue to work together because they managed to deliver a lot of laughs and it's a movie that both male and female audiences will enjoy. It is probably the best SNL film I've seen in a long time. This is a really smart comedy which at times reminded of Tina Fey's work in Mean Girls. Paul Feig was also the right choice as the director, although he was mostly known for directing TV series like The Office, Nurse Jackie, and Arrested Development. Judd Apatow's name is also attached to this film as one of the producers and that is always a good sign because Apatow is usually synonym to a funny comedy. This is my favorite comedy of the year so far.<br/><br/>Annie (Kristen Wiig) and Lillian (Maya Rudolph) have been best friends all their lives; they've shared the best of times and the worst of times together. Lillian seems to be going through a great point in her life and she has a healthy relationship with Dougie (Tim Heidecker), while Annie is pretty much at a low point after losing all her money in a bakery business that went bankrupt. She also has an unhealthy relationship with Ted (Jon Hamm) who only calls her for sex and then basically kicks her out of the house. Dougie asks Lillian to marry him, and of course Lillian asks Annie to be her maid of honor. Annie decides she is going to give Lillian the best wedding ever, but things don't turn out as expected. Lillian introduces her other bridesmaids to Annie and she finds a rivalry with Lillian's new wealthy friend named Helen (Rose Byrne) who seems just perfect. Helen seems sweet and nice, and Annie becomes jealous of their friendship. The other bridesmaids: Becca (Ellie Kemper), Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), and Megan (Melissa McCarthy) all seem to love Helen's ideas as well. As everyone begins to favor Helen; and things continue to go bad for Annie she becomes more and more jealous and pretty soon this might affect her friendship with Lillian. As a side story Annie is pulled over by a cop named Nathan (Chris O'Dowd) who ends up being a neighbor of Annie's and soon they begin a nice friendship that can turn things around for Annie if she doesn't blow it likes she's done so many times before.<br/><br/>The movie began a little slow for me and I didn't have as much fun with it until the bridesmaids show up and the rivalry begins. I really loved Melissa McCarthy's (star of the TV series Mike and Molly) performance; she was truly hilarious and stole every scene she was in. Wiig also is great in the lead role and she had good chemistry with her SNL co-star Maya Rudolph. There are also very memorable and laugh out loud scenes like the one in which the bridesmaids go try on their clothes, or when they all get on a plane together to fly to Vegas. There are really great moments in the movie and I had a great time with it. I laughed really hard and loved most performances from the cast. Guys shouldn't doubt on seeing this film because it isn't an ordinary chick flick, it doesn't follow those same formulas, it is much more than that and the scenes work in a true comedic fashion. This is a really funny movie and one you won't want to miss.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"intelearts","9","0","3","6 September 2011"," 451th Review: Rude, Crude, and Seriously Laugh out loud funny...
","Bridesmaids is the funniest straight-up comedy that this viewer has seen for a very, very long time. Sure, it's rude & crude, with a sentimental side, and it's all delivered with such verve that it triumphs.<br/><br/>The plot is exactly what the title says - Bridesmaids, and every one of them is portrayed well (We really liked Melissa McCarthy, know from the Gilmore Girls and Mike & Molly, who gives it 100% - she is the OTT character and rather than nauseate she brings her wonderful energy to this and it works). Director Paul Feig, best known for TV comedies The Office and Freaks and Geeks does a really nice job.<br/><br/>There is scene after scene of laugh out loud lines, and we can't remember the last time a comedy made us laugh this much, instead of just smile. <br/><br/>Bridesmaids is definitely not just all focused on sex and relationships, there's a good measure of life in there too. The situation comedy is nearly as sharp as the lines and generally work well - it's the wit in the script and the comic timing that really makes this though.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you coped with American Pie there is nothing worse here - and for my money this there is an honesty about being female, single, and over 30 that makes this more than just the laugh-fest it is.<br/><br/>A funny and fun film with a great ensemble cast that you'd have to have missed the last 20 years to find offensive - made us laugh....a lot."

","Have not laughed this much in a move for a long time.<br/><br/>Took my female friend, I'm a guy, to see this movie as she has been wanting to see it. Heard good things about it.<br/><br/>We saw it at a second run theatre and it was still very well attended.<br/><br/>This is a very funny movie from the female perspective, which is a refreshing take as many recent wedding movies have been from the male perspective. It is male friendly, in that the jokes are not too much inside jokes only women would get. There may have been a few but everyone enjoyed it.<br/><br/>It is a very funny movie. There are a lot of jokes tossed around and a few are easy to miss. The foul language was used to make a joke or a point, it was not like some films that just cuss to establish a ""tough"" character, here it was for comedic affect.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast each was a different personality that a person would have to deal with in a wedding party. The writing really worked the dynamics well to provide character development that lead to more laughs. It was over the top at times, but intentionally so and did not take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Go see it with friends. You will have a good laugh-out-loud time and something to talk about afterwards. There is something to be said about experiencing a good comedy in a movie theatre with other people. It is more enjoyable when you are laughing with other people. Know I probably embarrassed my friend by how loud I was laughing and spilled our drink from a ""OMG she did not just say that"" moment.<br/><br/>There is one extra scene after the movie ends before the credits. Was hoping there was something after the credits as it is becoming more common, but unfortunately it was all before the credits and after the movie."

Like those movies, the first people to see it, before the hype and word of mouth got out of control think this is great and hilarious. People like me who have waited a little too long and have outrageous expectations are left disappointed. Going in thinking this is the female ""Hangover"" I was excited. While I can see the comparisons, it was more chick-flicky then I was expecting. While this did have funny parts and I did laugh it wasn't as good as expected.

","Good, very good piece of comedy. The leading actress was splendid, as the rest of the actors, the story was engaging, and over all, VERY funny. What I liked most was the film's poignancy at criticizing the wedding ritual in American (occidental) society. Oh yes, so funny! Exactly what I feel about weddings and all the stupid traditions around it, based mostly in one feeling: ENVY. The comic situations are very extreme and funny. But the ending... after such a strong and saucy social satire, why has it to end as any romantic comedy does??? the vulgarity! the girl overcomes herself, gets to grasp her life, and the blue prince appears (OK; the gag of the car, with her trying to get his forgiveness is funny, but still...) and the friends, after showing each other their most ugly faces, they all became super really good friends again and... PUAG!!! It does not match the first part of the movie, which confronted social traditions so wonderfully, and it totally spoils the movie. And it is not realistic. Too bad. Do the audience still need a good ending to go back home in peace, thinking that everything is gonna be OK??? I feel like a five year old when they patronize me like that!!!"
"mysteriesfan","Null","0","2","19 August 2011"," Likable but too thin and low-key to deliver bigger laughs or a serious point
","When I am in the mood for a fun, screwball comedy, it is nice to find a film by Saturday Night Live cast members. Over the years, I have missed a lot of these movies (all of Belushi, Adam Sandler, and Rob Schneider, much of Will Ferrell and Mike Myers and (fortunately) Bill Murray; plus Baby Mama, MacGruber, and others). And there have been some big disappointments (like Master of Disguise, Stuart Saves His Family). But I still look forward to the ones I am able to get to the theater to see. The latest was Bridesmaids, which generally received good reviews but which left me with mixed feelings. The plot is well summarized by other reviews, so I will not repeat it.<br/><br/>There were some funny scenes. Stand-outs include the bridesmaids trying on fancy gowns while being stricken with food poisoning from a diner Wiig took them to; Wiig acting crazy on a plane, or to vent her frustrations at the over-the-top bridal shower, or to get a patrolman's attention. Although crude at times, the movie mainly came across as cute, sweet, and genuine. Overall, the acting was good. Wiig's down-to-earth, slightly cranky policeman boyfriend stole the show. The characters were quirky but had real humanity. Only the narcissistic pig who Wiig spent the night with at the start of the movie was a total loser, and he got some well-deserved comeuppance (but not enough, due to a too low-key Wiig). Otherwise, the movie avoided mean-spirited or over-the-top caricaturing. Even Wiig's nemesis, her childhood friend Maya Rudolph's glitzy, seemingly perfect new friend, ended up being portrayed sympathetically as a decent person. The characters' actions, even when exaggerated for laughs, mostly seemed to flow naturally from who they were presented to be. The movie suggested the larger themes that life is what you make of it and that tomorrow is another day.<br/><br/>But the movie fell short. Qualities that made it endearing also held back and sapped its energy. It was too slight and understated, and its storytelling too choppy, slow, and uncertain (as, to some extent, was Wiig's acting; Rudolph was reduced to a totally straight role, with none of her normal spark). The film's scattered attempts to be serious and to send a message (including simply coasting on some easy-listening song lyrics toward the end) felt vague, superficial, and false.<br/><br/>For example, at a low point for Wiig, when she is hiding out at her mother's home depressed, a loud, crass bridesmaid who is Rudolph's groom's sister and appears to have no prior relationship and to have spent almost no time with Wiig, suddenly shows up and starts wrestling with her on the couch (to get her to show some spunk, we are told). But this key scene (which also includes the sister trashing the groom to Wiig for no reason and with no explanation) comes out of nowhere. There is no preparation for it in the character of this other bridesmaid or any familiarity or rapport between the two women. It is uncomfortable, drawn-out, and phony. Wiig, again acting far too subdued (as she does too often in the film), does not even seem to get it, or to take it anywhere. To chalk this up to Wiig's character's self esteem problems does not make it interesting or effective. Another example, also a key scene, is when the new friend's plans for a flamboyant, extravagant wedding finally become too much for Rudolph, who goes AWOL, returns to her roots, reconciles with Wiig, and says the whole thing has gotten out of hand and out of sync, financially and otherwise, with her family and friends. Yet, the movie bulled right ahead, as if the scene had never happened, to exactly the overblown wedding that Rudolph supposedly had come to realize was not true to who she is, just to squeeze laughs out of all of the excess and to close on a flashy note.<br/><br/>Nor did it help the movie that some of the gags did not flow naturally from the characters and story, but were gratuitous, silly, or pat. A small example was Wiig suddenly becoming childish after a serious scene with the policeman, giggling to him to run the siren, just to provide a light-hearted note to end on. A much worse example was the ill-fitting, baseless, tasteless scene about a sandwich that was tacked on to the end credits when it should have been left on the cutting room floor or for a deleted scenes disk.<br/><br/>These problems dragged down a movie that I wanted to like a lot more."

","Something does not seem to add up. Something seems to have passed me by and I have no idea what it is. As I sit down and recollect what took place during the past 125 minutes I am overcome by mixed sensations of satisfaction and disappointment. How will I rate this? This is the constant thought that is running across my mind whilst I recollect my thought. I always had 4 stars in mind, 4 out of 10! I know I am being very pessimistic and sincerely I feel I am a bit too harsh on my opinion. Hence I am content to settle with 6 stars, 6 out of 10!<br/><br/>Are you familiar with the term Ventricular fibrillation? In Layman terms it's a condition where a human has an irregular heartbeat. Normally our hearts beat almost to that of the beat of the Bee Gees hit Staying alive. Now picture the same beat on a heart rate monitor. A normal beat Vs a patient who is suffering with VF. Erratic lines will be jumping all over the monitor and if something is not done about it the patient sadly will die. This is what the flow of comedy was in Bridesmaids. It was very erratic, the funny scenes are very scarce however when it did get funny, oh boy does it crack you up. The scenes are amazingly well written and brilliantly interpreted by the cast. However once that particular scene is done and dusted with it bogs down tremendously. Now this brings me to the script. Written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo I have strong feeling this was entirely written for women. I am not exaggerating. I am seated in a theatre full of women whilst I watch this. I am also overhearing a lot of negative chatter on the movie as well. This is one in particular that stuck in my head ""This is nothing like Hangover"". Exactly what my thoughts are as I am watching the movie. I believe the marketing campaign was a bit misleading to a few us since this was supposed to be the female version of The Hangover. In fact they did approach Todd Phillips for the directorial however does not seem to have worked out well. <br/><br/>When Lillian (Maya Rudolph) quite unexpectedly is to be married, best friend Annie (Kristen Wiig) is unanimously picked as her maid of honor. Annie who has no sense of direction in life hits rock bottom and now there is now way to go but up or so she thinks. At the rehearsal dinner Annie is introduced to Lillians' fiancés bosses wife (Did I lose you there?) aka Helen (Rose Byrne). There is saying ""The party starts after a toast is made"". OK I made that up, but really after 25 minutes into the movie, break out its first comic relief. It was hilarious and my sides hurt after all the laughter! Annie feels she is being stepped on by Helen and wants to regain control of all that is left until the wedding day. Sounding a bit like Bride Wars, Monster in Law at this point of time, it actually is quite similar although it should not be mistaken for a parody. Regardless of it all, the 6 ladies bond in an effort for making this a successful wedding treat for Lillian. Megan (Melissa McCarthy) who is the sister of the groom and Officer Rhodes (Chris O Dowd) are the show stealers. In fact the directorial approach by Paul Feig is felt more like that of THE IT CROWD or EPISODES (Sitcoms). It's not slapstick like Jack Black doing Cartwheels in Lilliput. It's all in the script and its lines and its very little acting but more of the dialogue that matters.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly I am clearly a minority who share this opinion, since this summer hit was very well accepted by our viewers; however I do know that there is a potential market out there that has misread the entire advertising campaign and would feel as I do. <br/><br/>YES YOU NEED TO BE DRUNK TO HAVE THE HANGOVER!<br/><br/>Title: Bridesmaids Directed by: Paul Feig Starring: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne & Chris O Dowd Rated: R for strong sexuality and language throughout.

The other cast members were not. Every scene with Ms. McCarthy was hilarious, especially the bathroom scene which she stole. As for the story itself, the conflict between the two bridesmaids was completely contrived, seemed to be almost tragic and not particularly funny. The actors were not funny and indeed there were moments when Maya Rudolph seemed like she was going to cry. Now if Melissa McCarthy had played the main bridesmaid and Ben Falcone her boyfriend, then the movie would have been a farce and would have generated a lot more laughs, but so much for ""what if.""
