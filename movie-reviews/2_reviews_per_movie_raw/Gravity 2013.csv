"andrewroy-04316","8","8","8","29 November 2018"," A visually stunning and yet also intimate film that makes us think about space and humanity
","Gravity is a wonderful work of art. Cuaron and Lubezki are at their visual storytelling bests, which is quite a statement. The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension. Gravity is a groundbreaking work of art that, despite its narrow focus on just Ryan's journey, he manages to both amaze us visually and thrill us, start to finish."
"vikascoder","7","579","853","4 October 2013"," Great Visuals, Weak Script overall
","Visually, Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie. The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive.<br/><br/>On every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals, the chinks start showing up. Overall the script is very weak. Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything in its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request, Kowalski (who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while, floating around, spouting inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to disengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts.<br/><br/>We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human. Apart from this minor bit, nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea.<br/><br/>Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense. Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she does it three times), the debris presents itself like on cue every single time. Then a fire in a space station, then running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It's fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense.<br/><br/>Also at times I couldn't shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual. Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them? Really? Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages, why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me. Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can't-understand-this-thing machinery.<br/><br/>The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about. Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy. I wont even mention the in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is.<br/><br/>So what works for the movie? It's a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking.<br/><br/>But it's not. Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either."
"junkmail-385","7","336","499","6 October 2013"," Super special effects, weak story and dialog
","In segments, Gravity has marvelous special effects--truly a remarkable achievement. The weak parts of the movie are the contrivances that link these segments together, along with unbelievably bad dialog. (Maybe someone will be brave enough to register the contrivances formally as ""goofs"" here on IMDb?)<br/><br/>No way could astronauts from the shuttle ever reach the International Space Station, but Gravity asks us to believe both this could happen and that an astronaut could then go on to reach a Chinese space station, too. These objects just don't orbit anywhere--ANYWHERE!!!!--near close enough to each other to make these events even remotely possible. Not only are their orbits vastly different in altitude and trajectory, it would be highly unlikely for them all to be near each other in the same orbit. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Gravity also asks us to believe that the orbit of the space debris intersected with that of the shuttle and was synchronized with it.<br/><br/>No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate a Soyuz capsule in a few seconds of reading the manuals. No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate the Chinese capsule just by poking around.<br/><br/>Of lesser failures: Space debris traveling 20,000 miles an hour relative to an observer is not going to be visible except *possibly* as an indistinct cloud that passes by so fast the ""observer"" won't know what hit them.<br/><br/>For all of the CGI effort, I had hoped the Earth would look more realistic and (naturally) beautiful.<br/><br/>In closing, the special effects were great but the weak story relied on too many absurd contrivances and the script contained no redeeming dialog (sorry, George). On balance: 7 stars."
"BKTrayner","1","978","1496","8 October 2013"," Lost in Space
","The big ""spoiler"" is that this is a big budget Hollywood move with a preposterous plot and lots of special effects. The problem here is that nobody could possible survive through any of this, and the special effects become a substitute for any meaningful plot. Even taken on its own terms, the movie makes no sense. Sandra Bullock has become an astronaut but lacks even the basic skills for that occupation. She tells us she always crash landed the flight simulator, and we find her thumbing through an instruction manual about the size of the instructions for a DVD player to figure out how to safely pilot a space craft back to earth. She even picks the buttons eeny, meany, miney, mo style. Add to this the contrived scenario that she has not only lost a child but also is ""revived"" and given a reason to live by the now dead George Clooney appearing in a dream sequence. And how great a movie can it really be where there is only one character (and almost no dialog) on camera for most of the film. The special effects are impressive, but what they've obviously done is use computer graphics to create all the weightless effects. As such, things remain weightless even when they shouldn't be, and you eventually become more interested in looking for the screw-ups than watching the movie. Please, please, please. Will someone make a movie with a clever plot that keeps you guessing to the end and with interesting and passably believable characters."
"tcara111","1","1675","2614","6 October 2013"," Gravity is Weightless
","Did those who've written glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie I did? Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. And I don't want to rag on it, but if you're going to make a dramatic science thriller, you had better get it right or expect to catch it from the smart people. Despite the cosmic setting, the only star I can give Gravity is for the computer generated graphics.That said, this is not a movie for intellectuals and those of a scientific bent will be sorely disappointed. What made Ron Howard's Apollo 13 so gripping was its dramatic realism and superb acting. Unfortunately, none of those adjectives applies to Gravity, with the possible exception of some drama. However, for thinkers, effective drama requires an intellectual investment in the credibility of the story, the characters and the interaction between them. Intelligent humans need to believe that what is being depicted could actually happen. Unfortunately, the events depicted in Gravity are likely to alienate anyone with an above average IQ. Once one has acknowledged the impressive graphics, any anticipation of emotional investment is quickly dashed to smithereens by the unbelievably vapid and inane dialog. It is painfully obvious that someone with a double-digit scientific IQ appears to have awoken one morning and haphazardly decided to write a ""space movie"". The physics are off, the events highly improbable. The entire story demands a suspension of belief in reality. Worst of all, the dialog and interaction between the characters is so juvenile that anyone with a brain gets the immediate impression that the project is the product of sophomoric show-biz types who think that the way to move the product is to recycle hackneyed clich√©s, shiny objects and big explosions. Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is so unprepared and emotionally disabled by adversity that it is impossible to believe that she would have been selected as a mission specialist. Yet, she manages to flit from one space wreck to another and yet another. She consults operation manuals in Russian and, later, Chinese, yet she is heard muttering ""eeny meeny miney mo"" while haphazardly pushing control buttons like some clueless chimpanzee. The space vehicle's communication equipment fails to pick up ""Houston Control"", yet, miraculously, is able to receive a bizarre Chinese comedy and howling dogs, which Bullock's character feels compelled to imitate. Clooney's character, Matt Kowalski, is such a clich√©d hero that he is depicted as nonchalantly jesting with the hysterical Dr. Stone while he himself is drifting into a desperately life-ending situation. We are expected to believe that, despite having trained intimately together for this mission, these characters address each other by their formal titles and make clich√©d announcements back to a non-responsive mission control. Kowalksi has waited until he's drifting to his death to ask where Dr. Stone is from and if she has any kids. Finally, director Cuaron makes a supremely lame attempt at cinematic iconography depicting Bullock floating in a fetal position, a la Kubrick's Space Odessey. And after having had such a bad day and having plunged to Earth in a flaming meteor-like reentry, Stone emerges, unscathed and barefoot mind you, from the ocean onto an idyllic, uninhabited beach like some primal human emerging from the sea. Now, I feel bad about feeling bad about this movie. And I respect Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney as actors. However, it is my humble opinion that actors must assume some responsibility for the roles they accept. This movie was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. Alas, other than the black hole into whose abyss was irretrievably sucked away any hope I once had for discovering intelligent life in this movie, ""Gravity"" lacked gravitas."

","In Space no one can hear you ‚Äì ""ask for your money back!""<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Spoiler Alert - its horrible.<br/><br/>I just left the movie theatre angry. I cant think of a time that's ever happened to me. <br/><br/>Yes I may know more than the average Joe regarding manned spaceflight, after 30 years of writing about it. That doesn't mean the movie makers have to insult movie goers with the lack of any sense of reality. No wonder people don't think man landed on the moon.<br/><br/>From start to finish there were blatant factual errors in everything from the laws of Physics, Engineering and Orbital Mechanics to the unidentifiable views of the earth. I recognized two views of the earth, one of Florida and Cuba, the other the Nile in Egypt. It seems the producers decided to mess with those as well, good luck recognizing them.<br/><br/>I stopped counting errors after 50, by that point I was considering leaving the theatre, a few others managed to escape. <br/><br/>I know at least one NASA Astronaut bragged about making a contribution to the film as a technical adviser. I wont name her because its embarrassing enough for her to know she did that. I always wonder why movie makers use Astronauts as tech advisors when they have no intention of actually using their contributions.<br/><br/>Im not going to quote any of the script, why waste your time. It's a ranting monologue from an Astronaut with all of six months training at NASA to conduct an EVA at Hubble and who addresses her crew mates by their formal rank and last name only. Oh and magically during her six month training to fly on the Shuttle she managed to get a little Soyuz pilot training under her belt, very fortunate for her.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is poorly written, almost ad-libbed, poorly researched, with a story line that has no connection to reality. I wouldn't watch this a second time if I was paid to. At the end I was expecting to see a 2,000 year old arm from the Statue of Liberty on a beach, seriously. <br/><br/>For a more representative vision of Spaceflight you may choose to watch the Simpsons episode where Homer and an inanimate carbon rod, save the Space Shuttle.<br/><br/>I highly do not recommend this movie unless you download it for free off Pirate Bay or get someone else to pay for you.<br/><br/>FYI ‚Äì Im not a movie reviewer and I typed this out in five minutes, because I want my money back."

","Sound: 2/2 - Stephen Price's music is alternately nightmarish and euphoric between lulls. <br/><br/>Acting/Characterization: 1.5/2 - George Clooney is, well, Clooneyesque, but Sandra Bullock shows palpable emotion. It's easy to root for her character as a fellow human being, despite her seeming incompetence as an astronaut. <br/><br/>Script/Writing: 0.5/2 - The script is uninspired, peppered with unfunny anecdotes, clich√©d backstories, and inarticulate fretting, but it wisely avoids pretentious meditation on the meaning of it all for a few poignant moments of the heroine quailing in the face of death. <br/><br/>Visuals: 2/2 - Impeccably shot, Gravity is stunning from start to finish. Objects move with geometric beauty, while Earth is a vivid, distant dream. <br/><br/>Concept (Plot/Theme): 1.5/2 - The threat of space debris is wonderfully mundane and realistic, but everything that follows the initial catastrophe requires some suspension of disbelief as survival becomes increasingly improbable. Still, the film adeptly captures the minuscule fragility of human existence. <br/><br/>Total Score: 7.5/10<br/><br/>Gut Feeling: 8/10 - While I wondered how her character qualified for a space mission in the first place, Bullock delivers a moving performance in an immersive film that is worth seeing for the cinematography alone.<br/><br/>Final Average Score: 7.75"

","Most of the other reviewers who gave it 1/10 have already nailed it. Yeah, the CG was beautiful, but the story and physics were awful.<br/><br/>But also, what was up with the ""woman of science"" going all religious when faced with death? ""oh lord if you are up there... oh wait"". What's more she always seemed to need a man around to tell her what to do. What does she do when she doesn't have his guidance? Tries to kill herself. Great.<br/><br/>Sandras character just spent the entire time messing things up. You could cut together her bumbling about, add yakety sax and a laugh track, and title it ""Sandra Bullock is a klutz in space!""<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the imagery. They were really trying to hit home on that fetus thing... that shot went on forever. How dumb did they think the audience was? Pretty dumb I'm guessing if they all believed the reviews and threw their money at it. Yes we get it, she was reborn and overcame the grief of losing her daughter. But now we're secretly hoping she gets eaten by a camel or something. That would have made it worth the 90 minutes."
"arathorn357","4","284","449","6 October 2013"," A contrary view to the popular acclaim
","The box office takings and the almost universal acclaim from the critics for this movie - see eg http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/gravity-m100091079 would suggest that this is a must see - well here is a contrary view.<br/><br/>This may be from an age perspective (I was at school watching TV when that Armstrong guy sang 'I was walking on the moon one day' in July 1969) - and for the first 20 minutes we have a similar light hearted banter from G. Clooney, who while being highly space savvy is, unlike that original space larrikin, just plain annoying as he tries to emulate past heroes as he calms and guides S.Bullock through a predictable and ongoing series of high impact incidents. A handsome show off, with a serious penchant for rescuing damsels in distress, sits naturally with our George, whatever the state of his pulse.<br/><br/>But the movie is really about Bullock's character, and she is an actor capable of both great comedy and feeling (often within the same work) but here she is just not believable with the exception of the initial panic scenes that do get everyone's heart racing for a short time. In dealing with loss she has suffered on earth and in facing eternity in space, neither portrayal is credible. <br/><br/>Weaver in Aliens or Hanks in Apollo 13 - those were stories that really got to you (well, me anyway) but at the end of this its all a bit so what?<br/><br/>A very honorable exception for the cinematography, especially if you see it in the IMAX or 3D versions which really do give you a new perspective on space - but well deployed technology alone does not a movie make.<br/><br/>I give it 4 out of 10 - slightly disappointed at something that could have been so much better. I appreciate most of the world seems to disagree with my view."
"watchtiger1","1","355","574","17 October 2013"," What the heck did I just see?????????
","First of all there is NOTHING I repeat NOTHING that warrants the cost of a 3D ticket.<br/><br/>Second, this movie is boring and overly predictable.<br/><br/>Third, there is nothing in this movie that makes you want to care that suddenly this ""mission specialist"" played by Bullock is stuck up in space alone.<br/><br/>Fourth, where points could have been made to make you want to care about anyone in the movie they don't bother. Clooney's character keeps telling ""Mission Control"" stories for the most part that they've heard about his life. We haven't heard them and you never do. His character is only concerned about getting a record for the longest un-tethered space walk.<br/><br/>Fifth, Bullocks character acts like a buffoon. She ""claims"" to only have had 6 months of training. Based on what she says she would have been disqualified due to her questionable mental state after (years before)her daughter dies from some play ground accident at her day care. Now I like Sandra Bullock, but this performance is not worthy of an Oscar at all.<br/><br/>Sixth, She ""magically"" makes(this is because she spent over 5 minutes breathing in pure carbon monoxide, if this had been real she'd be dead) it to the Russian Soius Space capsule. She then using pictures in books can magically use buttons in Russian capsule to make it work, though claimed she trained on the simulator for them, she still needs the books to operate these things. She then ""magically"" get an empty fueled Soius capsule over to the Chinese station. Which is identical to the Soviet but in Chinese instead (this is probably fact as China bought their space station tech from Russia)and again using picture books she gets the thing to work.<br/><br/>Seventh, Drama and suspense, WHERE, you are told that the satellite debris will be around ever 90 minutes, the astronauts set their timers for the count down so again that's NEVER a surprise not only that, it's camera shot debris coming, look at watch. NO suspense.<br/><br/>Eighth, The ending, Specialist Ryan escapes in the Chinese capsule and gets back to earth, crashes in to the water and you are left with her walking on the beach. That's it you just wasted 100 minutes for this pointless that could be done in 30 minutes.<br/><br/>NOT worth your time or money."

","Truly epic in scale! Whilst 'Gravity' falls short against films like '2001: A Space Odyssey', it is a tense and visually stunning thriller from Alfonso Cuar√≥n. Cuar√≥n is one of my all-time favourite directors, and this CGI-heavy project just boasts skill and ingenuity from the director, DOP and VFX artist. The critics stated that you would be gripping to the edge of your seats, this is true in every aspect, the film is full of intense and thriller situations with amazing performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Just shy from winning Best Picture over '12 Years a Slave', 'Gravity' left the Oscars with 7 Academy Awards to its name, and it deserved each and every one of them. A masterpiece that allows the viewer to become immersed within the scene to often thrilling effect."

"writer10-1","5","171","275","5 October 2013"," GRAVITY - In space, substance doesn't matter
","The critics who drool over GRAVITY must be as oxygen-starved as Sandra Bullock's character. Visually arresting, yes. But GRAVITY is a triumph of style over substance, and fantasy over plausibility. (Many spoilers ahead.) Leave aside for the moment the utter implausibility of the chain reaction of satellite disasters. (Satellites orbit at different altitudes. That's space 101.) In my former life as a journalist, I wrote a long article on space junk. A collision with one piece of flotsam would have plausibly sufficed. A fusillade of space junk is overkill. And Ed Harris's alert about the first mishap was a clumsy telegraph of the crisis to come. Would that the director had invested one-tenth the attention he gave the pictures into the plot. Also ignore Bullock's out-of-control Chinese capsule surviving re-entry into Earth's atmosphere ... or landing within a dog-paddle to shore on a planet that's 70% covered by water. Oh, and space capsules are DESIGNED for water landings, which means they DON'T flood when the door opens. Forget all that. Instead, focus on character, which is what movies are all about -- or should be. The actors can't be faulted for the sins of the writers: Clooney is written as a one-dimensional, wise-cracking Danny Ocean. Bullock sounds like her character from SPEED, not a brilliant Harvard Ph.D. In one of the hoariest moments of the film, Bullock actually PAUSES in her tortoise-like race to safety to listen to Clooney's pep talk (can't we drive a stake through that clich√©?), then gets a second wind -- while breathing Co2 -- and sprints the final yards to safety (another clich√©). Upon reaching the Russian capsule, she wastes time stripping and napping -- for the sake of the director's silly rebirth metaphor -- while Clooney waits to be rescued. Again, the actors are doing the best they can with the material they have. But the only Oscars this film deserves are for the visuals. Certainly not for acting, writing, or music. (Composers: The single, sustained note that slowly builds to a thunderous crescendo is a clich√©. Oh, and you just telegraphed the outcome.) Which brings us to dialogue. To quote one screenwriter, ""Why does every director assume he can write?"" Anyone who's been in a life-or-death moment knows that people just don't engage in serial wise-cracking or kill time with long anecdotes. The sheer silliness of some of the lines undermined the spectacle of the images. As for Bullock's monologues (e.g., the baby broadcast, the ode to Clooney) -- well, the writers wrote themselves into a corner there. As a writer, I appreciate the challenge of putting words into her mouth when she has no one to listen. What came out rang false.... Want a good film about a disaster in space? Watch APOLLO 13. Enjoy -- or try to -- GRAVITY for the 3D spectacle it is. But don't let it go to your head."

"secondtake","8","77","125","19 October 2013"," A stellar space film that is literally about space and vertigo and survival--fiction, but not science fiction
","Gravity (2013)<br/><br/>A ridiculously visual movie. The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.<br/><br/>The idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, ""Children without Men."" And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of ""effects"" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.<br/><br/>Once you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.<br/><br/>The answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid ""Grey."" No distractions here.<br/><br/>Except the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.<br/><br/>The photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. <br/><br/>The best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. <br/><br/>There have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. <br/><br/>It's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.<br/><br/>a postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film ""Aningaaq"" which is recently posted all over.

"LetwitJr","8","519","938","10 September 2013"," Outstanding Sci-Fi Film
","Big science fiction films are all the rage this year (Oblivion, Elysium, Pacific Rim...) and Gravity is finally one worth watching. From the trailers I had no idea what to expect. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock floating around in space for two hours eventually became my best guess. I rushed the film at the Toronto International Film Festival and when someone said they were showing it in 3D, I was half tempted to leave the line. I hate 3D movies, they give me awful headaches and I don't see the point of them. As soon as Gravity started, I changed my mind.<br/><br/>The 3D definitely adds something to the film. The opening shot of earth and space is absolutely beautiful. The film starts up fast enough. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are both out doing repairs on the spaceship when Houston warns them the Russians blew up their own satellite and accidentally destroyed every other satellite there is. Debris is coming their way and they have to get back to earth as soon as possible. Of course, from the trailers we see that debris does his them, and without a spaceship they must find another way home. <br/><br/>George Clooney basically plays George Clooney in a space suit (a funny self-loving character also often played by Robert Downey Jr) and Sandra Bullock plays a doctor who was trained a few months for this mission only. George gets very little screen time but Sandra shines throughout the whole film. Despite her being alone, I would say there is quite a lot of action in the film. She's alone out there and you feel you are too. The film takes you in space and it feels claustrophobic to be there. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Throughout the film, you see Sandra's character growing as well. Not only is she trying to get back home, but she's finding the will to do so as well. <br/><br/>The film is a visual masterpiece. Yes there is a lot of CGI of course (basically everything you see on screen is fake) but it never felt like it. For once, the 3D definitely adds something to the experience. You get the depth of field you need to truly experience the movie and feel as through you're right there with Sandra. She gives an absolutely stunning performance, acting to absolutely nothing, yet always being right on the spot. <br/><br/>If you get a chance to see Gravity in theatres, go for it, especially if you see it in 3D (even if you usually hate 3D, believe me, it's worth it.) Alfonso Cuar√≥n has outdone himself with this film, it's definitely a must see for sci-fi lovers."
"Beju-lakhani","9","593","1080","9 September 2013"," The most visually stunning movie I have ever seen
","This movie is absolutely stunning from the get go. I can't remember ever being pulled into a film so completely and thoroughly, and I don't think I've seen a more beautiful film. Its a pretty intense ninety minutes, with Bullock's character constantly battling one catastrophe after another, and all of it is amazing to see. The plot is pretty straight forward (see it, I won't talk about that), but its the way they pull it off that makes it absolutely worth seeing. Thanks to some incredible CGI, great direction, and solid acting, the movie is an absolute must see. I'm normally not a fan of 3D movies (I hate wearing the stupid glasses), but this movie uses it wonderfully and to great effect. I would strongly recommend seeing it in an IMAX theatre if you get the chance - if there was ever a movie made for 3d IMAX, this is it."
"N_ig-matk3","1","129","221","1 January 2014"," Gravity hurts the genre.
","This is yet another movie demonstrating space for many new viewers, IN THE WRONG WAY. If you set aside the horrible acting and the obviously written-in-a-day plot, all you have left is a steaming heap of special effects and sound editing that is designed to rope in young or stupid movie viewers, these days they are synonymous. This is essentially Sanctum(2011) cloned, set in space, with worse acting, and less intelligence. This movie had it's accurate moments, a rarity among cinema, but the creators also dropped the ball hard on many of the physics in the movie. Any of you that have studied physics and understand the concept of a vacuum, please stand up.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead!~~<br/><br/>This genre is very hard to get followers as it is, but why oh why would you cast two of the worst possible people that could portray astronauts and then proceed to have them read lines that are most likely written by some guy that has absolutely no knowledge of internal conflict. Okay so here we go. -Does anyone truly believe that, during a SCHEDULED maintenance mission to a prestigious satellite like the Hubble, Russia would have been operating in the same level of orbit? OR if that doesn't hit it home, detonations are not executed in geosynchronous orbit EVER for fear of permanent debris OR how about did the engineers of either Russia or America randomly think that,"" hmm so we are going to blow up something in orbit(to reiterate this does not happen) and there absolutely won't be a chain reaction that causes the I.S.S. or the future C.S.S. to receive damage"" NO because this just won't happen ever. -Why would NASA, assuming this is our time line (she mentions Huston, which is mission control) have authorized this woman(Bullock) for space operations if she is so prone to be mentally disabled in a crisis?(loss of child, apparently no significant other or family, seems depressed so the psych. eval. would have failed) -Why if after being approved for a mission to orbit(which requires ridiculous amounts of training), would this certified astronaut and specialist(most likely an electrical engineer, which happens to be my profession), be so idiotic in a situation as grievous as this. I mean there are well over a dozen times that she seems to have the capabilities of a high school dropout. -I know this is a movie but damn, the clich√©'s are killing me softly. Ripley is the only solo-heroine of the space genre, sorry Sandra. Also the hallucination clich√© ,cough, movie isn't over, cough, she gets away unscathed,cough.<br/><br/>In conclusion, yes the special effects depict earth well and the debris/fire-in-zero-g was pretty good, it is clear that the budget went to the cg. The downfall is that space is big, this genre NEEDS exploration, not just our atmosphere! There is a big reason why media like Star Trek has staying power, and why many of the viewers and readers can obtain a lasting memory by stopping by NASA's website and read testimonials of astronauts and see pictures from satellites etc. This movie is just a hyped up 1.5 hours of cg with a terrible script and bad acting, that has nothing to give to the space genre. Sorry Hollywood, but until you give us the desire, you won't get viewers hooked on bad space movies. Sincerely yours, concerned techie."

"moagueus","2","106","182","13 October 2013"," Shocking
","I had high expectations for this movie. It started out interestingly enough, I suppose. The problem is, very early in the movie we get down to the movies central core: all sizzle and no steak.<br/><br/>The whole movie was full of physics blunders, explosions, fires, debris storms and one inconceivable escape after another. I don't understand why they had very little character investment before the explosions started. I have a hard time caring about any of the people since I don't really understand why they are here, or anything about them. Clooney's character seems to be obsessed with winning a space walk...fine. He is a major character who is relegated to being a one dimensional (although certainly crafty) character. Bullock does become a bit more balanced when she talks about her daughter, so she does feel like a person briefly during the journey to the ISS with Clooney. Why didn't we get some more of this? I guess so we could blow some more stuff up with that persistent debris storm...UGH.<br/><br/>Her character does have an amazing arc. She goes from this space-sick scared little girl to supergirl who can pilot modules, time space jumps, etc. perfectly. I think the problem is TOO MUCH arc in this case. I did give it two stars instead of one since they did include some character development, even if it was ridiculously over-the-top. <br/><br/>Additionally, it seemed to be s special effects extravaganza, so there was little emphasis put on things that could have added tension. I think some first person shots from Sandra B. would have made her alone time in space more tension building. Instead, we often seem to be beside her, next to her, etc. This makes it seem like we are with her, and kind of detracts from the isolation dread that could have been developed in a better way. <br/><br/>Of course there are a bevy of 3D parlor tricks in the movie. They look great in 3D but are just silly. I am not gonna get into the stuff flying, floating, drifting into the third person camera. You know what they are and just what sort of cheap showmanship they are. <br/><br/>I will explain my two biggest issues with the physics of this movie. This is by no means a comprehensive list! <br/><br/>(very early minor SPOILER) It was after the debris struck the shuttle that I became concerned at the poor attention to physics this movie was playing. Once this happened, I can't help but look for more physics shenanigans! Sandra Bullock's character was sent spinning on some part of the ship into space. She was urged by George Clooney's character to disengage her lanyard or she would go too far away. What on earth was stopping her momentum once she separated from the debris? She would just keep right on moving into space with the debris, only once she let go, she would be a smaller object which would be more difficult to find. So he gives her bad advice and she follows it. It doesn't matter, because somehow he ends up finding her anyway.<br/><br/>(SPOILER!) The most egregious and annoying example was the incident where Clooney cuts himself loose, after they were stopped at the ISS. This one really bothered me. What on earth was pulling him (and her) away from the ship once they stopped at the end of the ropes/cables around her feet? What made him magically float away once he cut his tether? C'mon guys, make this happen some other way! <br/><br/>Since Clooney is just some one-dimensional glory hound, I just don't care very much when he dies. Why should I? Heck, he won the space walk! I suppose he was happy about it when he inevitably ran out of air floating in the emptiness of space. <br/><br/>A badly constructed story with boring characters which is obscured by spectacular effects. Many people loved this movie. Good for them. It was a disaster in my book."

"doorsscorpywag","1","131","229","10 December 2013"," Unbelievable.....in a bad way
","Hollywood could have probably made 100 decent movies from the money they wasted on this garbage. The film should have been called drudgery not gravity. A 3D extravaganza that delights you with flying pencils, fire in zero G and Bullocks arce but is devoid of any sensible story and utterly empty of any acting from the two leads. We start on a NASA mission to repair the Hubble and are introduced to the most unprofessional team of astronauts NASA has assembled since Armaggedon. Bullock, a medical doctor ???? with 6 months training, is repairing a complex piece of equipment in the void of space while the mission commander Clooney does loop the loop around the shuttle and another of the crew does some kind of space dance. Ignoring the glaring plot chasm in that why would NASA use an untried doctor of medicine to repair space telescopes we have two astronauts playing like school kids in the scariest environment known to Mankind. At the very least they should have been keeping an eye on the rookie. Then the Russians blow up space to save money on decommisioning a satellite and the story hits rock bottom as a very unprofessional NASA start a general panic and the crew get killed. Bullock is drifting in a ridiculous way screaming her butt off as Clooney jets in like someone off Star Wars to save the day.<br/><br/>The rest consists of some nonsensical Perils Of Sandra situations and the most stupid scenes which exist for no other reason than to look at Bullocks skimpy knicker clad bony ass in 3D. The question has to be asked what does Sandy do when she feels the urge to go to the loo as it's hardly the 'you should have gone before you left the space ship environment'. <br/><br/>The end is too ridiculous for words and would have been much better if a couple of Gorilla's riding horses and armed with rifles had hoven into view.<br/><br/>The worst movie of 2013. 3D crap to take the audiences mind away from the fact there was no money for a script and any decent actors."
"nmstormchase","7","269","490","4 October 2013"," Good, but let's not say it's completely realistic...
","The visuals for this movie are impressive. The story line is enjoyable, and it leaves you appreciating your place on Earth. The characters also provide some good laughs.<br/><br/>It was one of the better 'space' movies. However, as a geek (I know, I know it's a movie) the orbits are all wrong for some of the events to even remotely take place. So if you know anything about space travel, as usual suspend disbelief for the moment. It at least stayed largely true to the no sounds in space thing, and provides some good lessons about linear and angular momentum. The fact I even get to bring this up, means I give the film makers some serious props... I wouldn't go so far as some of the reviews where they says the movie is creating a whole ""new genre"". The reviewers and movie makers just never realized, until now, what us geeks knew all along... space is much more awesome and frightening if you portray it more realistically.<br/><br/>Hopefully the movie also provides a good reminder about how special this little rock is, and how unforgivable the rest of the universe is. Let's try and keep our planet that way! At least I was reminded of this when I left the theater."
"jbhellier","6","111","193","6 October 2013"," Did the producers of ""Gravity"" pay for glowing reviews?
","When I saw the film in IMAX, the reviews on here were 98% positive. Hmmm...<br/><br/>Six things in honor of my six score:<br/><br/>1. I should say from the get-go that I'm a product of the 80's, so I have a different impression of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney than most people. To me, Sandra Bullock is a clumsy and silly lady who can occasionally drive a bus at high speeds. And George Clooney is that guy from ""Facts of Life"". They can act in other films, but some early work set their images in my mind. Sandra was a medical engineer? I think not. Why not Rachael Weisz or Tilda Swinton? How about Cate Blanchett? And for the guy, how about someone who seems like he can focus for longer than a minute or two? <br/><br/>2. The cinematography is wonderful, and it does get very suspenseful. I found myself holding my breath at times.<br/><br/>3. It goes from dead silence to eardrum-piercing in 2 seconds flat throughout the movie.<br/><br/>4. They spent over four years on this movie, and yet some things seemed incredulous. George was supposed to know so much about motion and gravitational pull, but couldn't be bothered to take of his backpack (or anything) and propel himself backwards towards Sandra even though he was at a dead stop. He didn't even attempt to use the propulsion to show that it was out.<br/><br/>5. The Chinese craft was already heading toward earth...how?<br/><br/>6. They kept banging into things very hard. This never seemed to modulate. Wouldn't somewhat smart people begin to learn to lessen the propulsion? Or did the guy who figured out that special effect go overboard in his demands for scenes? When Sandra would open a door to the crafts, she'd be thrown very hard against the side of the craft, and yet at no time did she let go...couldn't she have attached herself and then get thrown beyond the door and have to pull herself back? It just got repetitive and ridiculous.<br/><br/>But it's still a 6!"

And the movie was predictable. Of course, when the movie becomes quiet out of nowhere, something bad is going to happen! When Ryan was on the first spaceship, the debris were destroying everything around her and apparently with some magic power, she and her spaceship is barely getting damaged! And when she said she is going to save that Kowalski guy, she was just like floating and chillying in the freaking spaceship! What a nice person! And the inside the spaceship, the cord was catching on fire! and she just didn't even see it...and after she noticed it, the ship was going to explode. She tried to use the fire extinguisher and bumped her head because of the pressure, can she be more STUPID? After that, she flew off and the debris still did not kill her, while destroying everything around her. Just before she was going to press the firing button, the movie was silent AGAIN! OK, so obviously the button doesn't work because the ship is out of fuel. And she was clumsily flipping the manual booklet trying to get the ship to work and she FAILED! Then she had a dream and Kowalski made her remember EVERYTHING she learned and she got the ship to work, without a manual! And she was able to use the fire extinguisher for coordination in space and she grabbed on to a full speed spaceship. Yeah, a with a fire extinguisher you can catch on to a full speed spaceship! GOOD JOB!!! Once again on the Chinese spaceship, the debris came AGAIN! Way to be so REPETITIVE! And obviously, everything caught fire because the spaceship is way above its speed limit. And with all the pressure and the FIRE! Ryan is still alive and the spaceship is not burned to a piece of crap. What is more, she landed lightly, without any coordination predetermined, on some lake in a forest. And the spaceship was floating on the lake. And she is stupid enough to open the door so the water could drown her. And with the heavy spaceship and her heavy spacesuit, she is sinking as slow as a turtle, and somehow she got out of her suit and swum half a mile to the land. People can barely walk straight when they get off the spaceship and this woman can swim half a mile and be like I'M SUPER WOMAN!!! Any ways, this movie is just stupid, cheesy and if my physics teacher, or anyone with a right mind watches it, they will cough blood and be MIND BLOWN by the stupidity."

","I anticipated watching a good space movie for a change until I saw who wrote and directed it - Alfonso Cuaron. I knew then I should lower my expectations considerably. Somewhere below Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars"".<br/><br/>It's all about internal consistency. This movie makes no claim to being science fiction, it purports to be a realistic scenario, yet it violates physical laws and disregards current facts at will. The Law of Inertia only seems to apply to the minds of the writers and director. This spinning junkpile is really a fancy vehicle for Alfonso Cuaron to make a not-so-subtle philosophical statement against science (that is, assuming he wasn't just trying to make another roller-coaster video game movie like ""Children of Men"").<br/><br/>Everything in the movie points to science as being dangerous and incomprehensible to commoners like Sandra Bullock (even her protective suit eventually turns against her and tries to drown her), and that we are better off wandering through the forests in our underwear (or preferably naked... but I doubt if Sandra would agree to that). In Cuaron's world all these Machines are out to kill people. Science Bad! Cuaron Smash!<br/><br/>Yes, it's the inconsistencies that make movies look bad. But the investors will be happy, most of the critics and movie-going public do not have enough practical scientific knowledge or critical thinking skills to know that ""eeny, meeny, miny, moe"" is not the correct module separation and landing sequence in Chinese space station escape pods."

","It's pointless to talk about the technical and artistic values of this movie.

I just got out of the theater and I'm still in awe, and what really got to me, beneath all the visuals and everything, is that this is the ultimate movie about nature. It's a celebration of the complexities of nature, about how we, as human beings, are so insignificant and weak facing it. We are a tiny little thing among a vast system that's beyond our control. This movie is a study on the humanity's place in the universe, so it's a call for us to face the ""larger picture"" humbly, and see how our lives, our societies, our achievements and our problems are NOT as important as they seem to be. Look further, your life will seem very fragile. At the same time - and that's the brilliance of the movie - Gravity is a celebration of the human being, because even though we are in fact very insignificant, it is our will to life, and our effort to make our lives meaningful, that make us matter. This is now my favorite movie ever, because it's so rare to find a movie, especially a Hollywood one, that can speak so deeply, so poetically and so subtly about life, the universe, and everything, in 91 minutes with such astonishing grace and artistic honesty."

","Where does tooth cavity come from? Suposedly around 70% of products one can see in a supermarket are more or less corn and sugar. Diversity or rather Illusion of diversity derives more or less from usage of different additives and package design. Same principle as in Hollywood. So how did they pack the same old story this time?<br/><br/>An old, yet still vital, charming American dream alpha male coffee machine seller uses his last breaths of life mutating in the depths of a digital space into a some sort of a spiritual mentor to a desperate American woman who tries to deny the loss of her child by enrolling into Nasa. While this male vs. woman emancipation melodrama develops , the Russians (who else) bomb their own spy satellite, causing a chain explosion reaction, that causes some major problems to north American face-book community and demolishes all the stuff that was ever put into the mother earth's orbit. <br/><br/>While International Space Station and Chinese station magically will temporary stay untouched by the Russian clumsiness, first the space rocket will be destroyed. George and Sandra will of course survive. First catastrophe can be evaluated in a picture of a framed American dream family floating next to an American best dad from the same photo with his head now having a big hole in it. That is what is left after the Russians interfere with the American dream. Literally a mind-blowing idea. <br/><br/>The coffee machine seller will in the meanwhile commit something like a ritualistic suicide. He will for the sake of his own spectacle sacrifice himself, so that Sandra can survive. Some major self-image problems this guy must have had. But he sure had a brave heart. (time for some orchestral tear provoking music) <br/><br/>After our tears finally dry, the saga goes on. Super Sandra, after already winning a space Lotery and surviving the unsurvivable is about to win few more once-in-a-lifetime jackpots. She will stay untouched in the middle of few more devastating explosions, bite her way through breathing co2, opening space stations doors like a Hulk, doing a floating fetus, driving around in space with help of a fire extinguisher etc. Basicaly she would have made it back to earth untouched even if she would have taken her space-helmet off and cover her eyes with her hands, hold breath and space-swim back to mother Earth. On her free fall to Earth she would have probably caught a parachute that per coincidence fell out of the full HD blue sky just when she needed it. <br/><br/>Somehow tired, being a Super Woman, Sandra eventually finds herself in a moment of depression, barking like a dog and wants to end her life as well, but coffee guy magically appears in her dream, reminding her, how everything is possible if you try hard enough and similar Oprah Winfrey inspired life lectures. She uses her magical powers once more and does the Eeny Meany Minny Moe trick and consequently pushes the ¬ªSafe drive back home¬´ button. (time for some uplifting orchestral music)<br/><br/>Trapped in a burning coconut she spectacularly flies down to the earth, everything around her burning and exploding again, while she lands softly in a calm lake. Now that she is back to Reality her super powers seem to fade for a moment. Clumsy as she is, she almost drowns herself, but the strong will to survive (and be able to have an ego-trip of her life afterwords, telling her amazing story to all the other suckers on the planet) motivates her once more to breath water and eventually she walks out of the lake like a Lara Croft.<br/><br/>What follows is hungry t-Rex hunting the protagonist that is now driving a bus that magically appeared on a bus-station by the lake. ;)<br/><br/>Gravity is yet another example of a very shallow American movie that has a big success, by seducing the viewer with the help of usage of some well-tested psychological manipulation techniques. A viewer identifies with an invented every day person, that manages to become a homo superior. Presumably due to the strong will and faith protagonist has. If you look carefully, it it more than obvious that success in most similar movies is a result of a chain of pure luck situations happening over and over again. The manipulation uses the human empathy and consequently neutralizes it, for it is acted out in a virtual realm and find its nirvana in a virtual realm as well. Another neural linguistic yes-we-can-ism. Another hero for Oprah's couch. Another movie masterpiece to make our life seem meaningful. (as if it wasn't meaningful unless one is an infantile sentimental wreck that blindly believes everything is possible if you just ¬ªbelieve¬´ hard enough). The psychological implication of movies like this is simple: if you did not make it it was your own fault. For we definitely did all we could do for you. Help yourself and Hollywood will help you. (sound of a splash into a swimming pool in front of a Mediterranean villa)<br/><br/>I am surprised, how many people interpret movies like this, as if they would glorify the so called Mother Nature- for movies like this, are essentially always telling us a story of a person, representing an American tech-no-capitalistic Enterprise, that in the end manages to win a battle over nature, a profoundly absurd idea.<br/><br/>Even the movie critics seem to have a rather very limited perception and understanding of cinema and its psycho-sociological implications. Nothing new on planet Earth while technological utopia pushes the American dream into a new level of meaningless hyper-reality, a corn and sugar based candy for hungry masses of people. Sweet tasting dreams that keep on making holes in our hypnotized mind and soul."

This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department.

Apart from the astonishing, beautiful and epic scale of the film, with directorial and photographic moments reminiscent of David Lean and Stanley Kubrick, the original script will keep you guessing all the way to the final frame of film. Both actors give solid, convincing performances, but Sandra Bullock has finally been given a part capable of revealing her real talent.

That scene of Clonney falling it's one of the most epic failures. But one can actually forget that, it's not so bad... the bad thing is watching Sandra Bullock overacting all over the movie. O good, she actually has to pay people for watching it. I mean, astronauts has to pass very strict psychological test, they don't get everybody to space, because it's unsafe! And then, flying a Russian escape pod modified by Chinese... It annoys so much seeing this movie selected to receive awards that this is the first time I made a review."

George Clooney has been used like a clown. <br/><br/>My regret is all that when a movie like this gets a rating of 8.6 then it surely encourages other script writers, directors, producers and whoever involves in making a movie will become ready to give another shitty movie just like this with some other different simple one-liner boring, non-sense story. <br/><br/>It definitely belongs to shouldn't watch movies list of all-time.

","I have seen this movie on IMAX 3D and i think i would have eaten Nando's or have gone to bar then watching Gravity movie. Gravity is a low budget movie and its ingredient is two high paid actors, 4-6 voices and the cheapest story of all time. No doubt ,the special effect of movie was very good but other then that, there is nothing in the movie worth watching .i don't know why people have voted so much for this movie that after 140k votes ,the ranking of gravity is 8.5. I would say that, the production of movie was done in the bathroom of universal studio with some good special effects. So my suggestion, don't waste your money on watching this low budget movie because by watching the rating on IMDb and watching on cinema, this movie does not worth paying ¬£¬£¬£¬£ and time.

So kudos for that. But why did they completely leave out any kind of story? They could have just shown actual footage of spacewalks. Some of those events portrayed in this move are also extremely unlikely. (what are the odds, that the debris stays on the exact same orbit as the ISS, not even 0.000001 degrees off???) But the biggest downer was the ending. It was so predictable and dull that I did not actually see it coming as there is no way that anyone would seriously use such a clich√©d Hollywood ending.

Of course I enjoyed the special effects - everyone did - but I felt they were thrown in your face just for you to drool at.<br/><br/>I will admit I understood only some of the science - it was too complicated for me - but I could tell a few flaws. For example, how was Stone's hair staying flat on her head when she was in the space station?<br/><br/>The characters were very thought through and had a lot of detail in them, so you felt sad and/or shocked in their (suggested) death.

Just a few minutes into the movie it became apparent that it had some problems, and they just got worse as 90 minutes of our lives slowly drained away.

"ClaytonDavis","10","503","989","20 September 2013"," 'Gravity' lives up to the hype with Sandra Bullock's crowning achievement intact (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ)
","There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso Cuar√≥n's space thriller ""Gravity"" possesses and manages to sustain in its 90 minute run time. I think I left my jaw on the theater floor. There are four things in particular to credit for this occurrence. The first of which being co-writer and director Cuar√≥n, who has constructed one of his finest outings. ""Gravity"" breathes in a way I haven't seen before and is probably one of the best technical marvels that cinema has offered in the past twenty years. Cuar√≥n handles the film with absolute certainty, restraining himself from committing any science fiction bourgeois, and reinventing the genre in a miraculous execution. <br/><br/>I've never looked at the world of Cinematography with so much respect and adoration until I saw the works of Roger Deakins and now, firmly sitting next to him at the table as the most innovative and brilliant DP working today, Emmanuel Lubezki. We've all seen what he's accomplished in his Oscar-nominated works in ""Children of Men,"" in which he was teamed up with Cuar√≥n, and Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life,"" both of which resulted in unimaginable losses. A 13-minute opening shot shows his abilities to capture the essence of the now, the feelings that life offers. Real life doesn't cut, Cuar√≥n and Lubezki understand this. The liberties where he chooses to take us, even when we step inside from the cold, lonely edge of space, manages to turn this very simple tale into a full-fledged meditation session with the sooth sounds of composer Steven Price. Visual effects have never been put to better use than what you will witness in ""Gravity."" One of the few films I urge everyone to see on the biggest screen possible. The post-conversion in 3D, although cool at times, was a bit unneeded. It doesn't add to the depth and scope of Cuar√≥n's dramatic endeavor, it actually undersells it as a cheap, blockbuster space movie. An IMAX screen, the largest you can find, with a sound system able to make your eardrums bleed, those are the basic requirements. I haven't been in this much awe of a film's quality and optics this since I saw ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" when I was six years old. ""Avatar"" and ""Life of Pi"" are great spectacles, but this will be revisited in years to come as the bench mark for modern day science fiction. It's this generation's ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""<br/><br/>Finally, I've had a childhood crush on Sandra Bullock since I feasted my eyes on those pretty browns driving a bus in ""Speed"" during the early 90's. This manifested into looking at her abilities as an actor with a skewed vision. She's hinted at this greatness I've felt she could achieve in films like ""A Time to Kill,"" ""Crash,"" and her Oscar-winning role in ""The Blind Side."" Sandra Bullock has finally realized her potential as a leading lady and taps into the very essence of the human spirit as Dr. Ryan Stone; a work that stands as her greatest endeavor and her gift to the silver screen. Natural, poised, and fully engulfed, Bullock is absolutely magnificent and in many ways, my favorite performance of the year so far. She rallies an emotional connection from the audience and demands things of herself that she hasn't done before. An Oscar-worthy work that should land her as a Best Actress nominee...and perhaps a winner.<br/><br/>George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky is exactly what you'd come to expect from the Oscar-winning producer and actor. He utilizes his wit and charm to be a lighter force of our dark tale, and is a perfect balance to Bullock's frantic demeanor. As aforementioned, Steven Price's musical work is tenderly utilized and precisely executed, building up lots of affectionate tones that may leave some audience members in tears. The script by Alfonso Cuar√≥n and son Jonas Cuar√≥n inhabit a rich texture of dialogue that aren't thrown in for the sake of breaking the silence. They aren't afraid to let the scenery speak for itself or to let the actors portray their emotions in mannerisms, but when they step away from that, everything connects beautifully.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is a rare breed. Simplistic but so refreshingly new. Visually, it will be studied for years to come, and thematically, will be revisited by the genre's most ardent enthusiasts. One of the best films of the year. I'll say, if you haven't watched the trailers and clips, continue to do so. Too much information."

","Arguably the best tagline for a movie EVER, ""In space no one can hear you scream"" Alien's ""In space no one can hear you scream"" tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all-time. That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso Cuar√≥n's latest thriller, Gravity.<br/><br/>Starring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.<br/><br/>Their struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.<br/><br/>Bullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn't amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.<br/><br/>With only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.<br/><br/>Gravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar's in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.<br/><br/>Cuar√≥n incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character's success in each new attempt at survival.<br/><br/>With still a few months left in the year, it's too early to call a film the year's best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year's conclusion. It's that breathtaking. It's that good.<br/><br/>www.killerreviews.com"

","I finally got the chance to see Gravity the other night and I just wanted to share my thoughts on the movie and hopefully shed some light on the physics, CGI, plot and acting throughout.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the film, George Clooney's character, Matt Kowalski, is seen rapidly moving all over the ISS (International Space Station) un-tethered while suited in an MMU (Manned Maneuvering Unit). He begins to make formal talk with Sandra Bullock's character (Ryan Stone) and then proceeds to talk about a party he went to in Mardi Gras. Now, I'm not astronaut, but I highly doubt one would feel obligated to reflect on a night out on the town while on a space walk, un-tethered. Sanrda Bullock's character was nothing but a klutz. NASA would never have chosen her as a mission specialist given her unrelenting emotional behavior. She was constantly messing things up (mind you her character only had 6 months training) and constantly needed Clooney to help her out. Clooney was nothing but a smartass full of clich√©s and bad acting all around. It's almost as if his mind was still in the green screen room and not in space. He's an actor, he's been in many films. Acting would have been nice here.<br/><br/>All of the sudden, debris hits the robotic arm and spins Bullock out of control. She eventually gets flung off into space, at a rapid speed. There's one small problem here, that is impossible. NASA procedure during an EVA (Extra-vehicular Activity) requires the astronaut to have a SAFER, which is a small self-contained propulsive backpack system used in case of emergency only. If the astronaut would drift off, it provides free-flying mobility, adjusts roll, pitch and yaw, making possible for the astronaut to return to the spaceship safely. She didn't have one.<br/><br/>Lets talk a little about the physics in Gravity, shall we? At one point in the film, a chute opens on the capsule while in orbit and spreads all over the ISS causing a chain reaction of disaster. This is also impossible. The chute, in reality, would not have opened, It would have stayed in tact. You know why? There is NO WIND IN SPACE.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock then begins to run out of Oxygen, and breathes on nothing but carbon dioxide for over 5 minutes. She would have been dead and the movie would have ended (which is what I was hoping). Sandra Bullock's character manages to get inside the ISS after releasing Clooney's character, who eventually dies. The were holding onto each others' hands, what invisible force pushed Clooney away from the rest of everything in that orbit? Oh yea, nothing did because there was no force. At all. After she gets inside the capsule, a fire starts and ignites on...nothing. It spreads as if the entire capsule was emerged in WD-40. This couldn't happen either, because OXYGEN IS NOT A FUEL HENCE IT IS NOT FLAMMABLE.<br/><br/>Bullock manages to get on the Chinese station, where she begins to read an instruction manual for re-entry the size of a DVD instruction booklet. Using only pictures. Thank God during her 6 months of training she manages to squeeze a little Soyez training in there as well. She is seen frantically pushing random buttons while actually saying out loud ""eenie, meenie, miney, ...mo!"". She is supposed to be a mission specialist, not a clumsy emotional nitwit with the brain capacity of a mentally retarded monkey with cerebral palsy. Then, over the radio, she hears the sound of someone talking, then the voice starts to play around with her and you can hear barking, so she starts howling and barking like a dog back at whoever was on the radio. She re-enters the atmosphere unfastened and barefoot. The re-entry capsule had a 60 second countdown. This is also false because almost everything during a EVA has an override in the event of a de-orbit emergency. Apparently not in Gravity.<br/><br/>So, lets talk about how this movie made almost $300,000,000 in a few months. Apparently there are either a lot of idiots out there or someone hacked the IMDb database and gave it high ratings. It's very sad to see such mediocrity being praised and tainting our collective unconscious with garbage. If you want to see a good space flick, I recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey and/or Apollo 13. 2001 came out in 1968 and it's still light years ahead of Gravity. The acting in Apollo 13 is as good as it gets. I happen to think Gravity is the worst movie ever made, of all time in any genre anywhere. I used to have Troll 2 reigning at the #1 spot for worst movie of all time, but I think I just made an exception with Gravity to take it over.<br/><br/>If you don't believe me, see it for yourself if you haven't already.<br/><br/>Thanks to nysalesman on IMDb for a really good review as well."

","Long Live Alfonso Cuaron! Que Viva Alfonso Cuaron! In just a few hundred words, I will now try to do the film, its director and cast (Sandra Bullock & George Clooney), justice. ""The Seventh Art"" is a term that seems to have fallen into disuse during the past 15 or 20 years. GRAVITY's director, Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men), has not only resuscitated, but also reinvented it, adding a signature spin all his own. Where is it written that a movie's commercial success is almost always inversely proportionate to its artistic, intellectual and aesthetic quality? GRAVITY, most certainly, brings to mind the adage, ""The exception proves the rule!"" <br/><br/>As this review is being written, Gravity is rated 8.5 on IMDb.com, by 184,000, placing it in the all-time film top 75, just behind The LION KING and just ahead of REQUIEM FOR a DREAM. Truly great films are both original and work on multiple levels. How, specifically, does this one manage so much in just 90 minutes? Alfonso Cuaron's poetic visuals enable us to view his reality through the eyes of a cinematic genius. A glimmering tear, floating aimlessly, impacts the viewer with a Tsunami of emotion. The breathtaking, yet surreal, backdrop of hovering earth and stars provides an ever-present reminder of both our relative insignificance on a cosmic scale and the fleetingness of our problems, however transcendent they may seem to us in the moment.<br/><br/>GRAVITY communicates more via imagery and resourceful, subtle, yet intense acting, than it does through dialog. The dialog here mostly serves as a buffer, a veneer, to calm and disguise extremely turbulent inner-emotions. Some of life's great tragedies are framed in the most insipid of words.<br/><br/>There is genuinely something for everyone here. If gut-wrenching is what you seek, there are some chaotic, frenetic and viscerally charged moments. Almost forgot to mention, GRAVITY's use of 3-D is never over- the-top, in- your-face nor employed gratuitously. It is deftly and strategically used to highlight on-screen occurrences, not to detract from them or be the sole focus, per se.<br/><br/>Bullock's character, Dr. Stone, who at first seems utterly driven to achieve perfection, is in reality locked into a self-induced drone like state of professional isolation, resulting from a profound loss she seemingly refuses to come to terms with. The inner conflict this causes her and Bullock's ability to involve the audience in her character's catharsis translates into moments of overwhelming poignancy. .<br/><br/>Why is her performance Oscar worthy? Ms. Bullock literally carries the entire last half of the movie solely on her shoulders and her performance is tersely awe-inspiring. Very few Hollywood actresses could pull this off. And to think that initially she wasn't on the short list for the role! George Clooney's character, larger-than-life, veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, is the jovial kind of guy who can be a bit of an ***hole at times, but amazes you with his simple selfless professionalism when it really counts. In this supporting role, the on screen platonic chemistry with Sandra Bullock is uncanny. Honestly, some of the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Lastly, in addition to gut-grabbing, heart-involving and mentally engaging¬Ö Gravity does what only 1 film in a 1,000 manages¬ÖIt captures your soul! Some really fine films try to provide the right answers. After experiencing GRAVITY, you'll be asking yourself many of the right questions. ¬Ö.ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! <br/><br/>Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa√±ol, are most welcome!....."

In the real world there would be zero chance of survival - so the film is festooned with ludicrous science as it transforms itself into a juvenile comic book adventure. The cornball script confines the one-dimensional characters to lame banter and maudlin sentimentality as a series of implausible cliffhanger exploits play out against the backdrop of spectacular special effects. Despite its box-office success, 'Gravity' is just another featherweight tale from Hollywood, 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'."

"jediviper","9","201","396","1 October 2013"," Gravity is a very well put together film. Stunning visuals combine with brilliant scoring to play backup to some great acting and very solid writing.
","When I first opened my email to see a Klout Perk inviting me to an advance screening of Gravity, starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, I'll admit my first thought was... 'what is Gravity?' At this point, it was still early enough that the huge marketing blitz for the film was just starting, and since I don't watch a lot of live TV, I had not seen any trailers for it. Since I never like to turn down a free movie however, I immediately signed up. I'm very glad that I did.<br/><br/>Security was pretty intensive for a screening only a month or so before a new release, forcing us to check in (my name was on 'the list') with 3 separate people, as well as having to leave our cell phones out in the car and be screened though a metal detector wand to ensure we weren't bringing ANY electronic devices in the theater. <br/><br/>Thankfully, the drama wasn't limited to the process of getting in, the movie provided plenty as well! From the opening scene to the closing credits, there are many dramatic moments, underscored brilliantly by the AMAZING Steven Price score. The music and sound in this film really stand out, both in the places where it is used, and even more dramatically in places where it is not. Movies very rarely seem to know where silence is the right choice, but they do a fantastic job here.<br/><br/>The screening was in 3D, of which I normally am not a huge fan. Typically, the glasses are uncomfortable, or don't fit over (or under) my glasses, which forces me to wear them alone and watch the movie with my crappy blurred vision. The glasses provided for this film, however were easy to slip on over my own glasses without feeling like I was wearing safety goggles. The 3D effects were well done, and accented the movie nicely without feeling obtrusive or 'gag-like'. I probably would have enjoyed the movie just as much in 2D, but I will recommend seeing it in 3D if that's your thing.<br/><br/>The visuals in Gravity are absolutely stunning! The views of the earth from space and the way the graphics are completed really give you a small sense of what it would be like to be in space. Even without getting into the script or acting, the visuals, combined with the previously mentioned sound design excellence, create a truly immersive experience well worth going to a theater to experience on the big screen. Of course, we have to talk about the acting... Both Clooney and Bullock put on a great show in Gravity. With Sandra Bullock actually putting on an acting clinic at times that I, for one, never gave her credit for in the past. Without spoiling the movie for anyone, I will tell you that these two are the only people you see on screen, with the rest of the very short cast list appearing in voice form only. It can be incredibly hard for a one or two man show to keep people's attention, but much like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, they pull it off with the 1-2 punch of great acting and solid writing. <br/><br/>It also doesn't hurt that the run time on the film is only 90 minutes. I'm sure they could have easily forced another 20 to 30 minutes in to get the time up, but they made the right choice I believe in making it short and to the point. The overall effect is that when you leave the theater you know that the whole story was told (and beautifully told at that), and that none of your time was wasted on superfluous or gratuitous film stock.<br/><br/>In short, Gravity is a very well put together film. Stunning visuals combine with brilliant scoring to play backup to some great acting and very solid writing. I gave it a 9/10 and I highly recommend giving it a watch, preferable in the theater... your choice on the 3D or 2D version."
"titan98696","1","34","58","22 October 2013"," This movie needs gravity
","I was very anticipating this movie for a couple of months after I watched the trailer. But now I regret wasting nearly 20 bucks and 90 min for this movie. How can this movie get 8.7 out of 10 ?!?! Did I watched a different movie? All the character, dialogue, plot(if it had one) was full of clich√©, easily predictable and does not have any meaning at all. The characters have unrealistic personality. The dialogue was pretty stupid. Two main characters repeat the same words like a half smashed radio. The plot was also stupid. Russia fires missile to destroy their satellite? Do you really think that is plausible? But the thing I thought most terrible was the messages it carries. One superficial message is ""don't give up, overcome the adversity."" Don't you think it is too worn out to fill whole 90 mins? And second deep message is ""through the adversity, a human reborns"" presented by the fetus scene and last near-drowning scene. But this kind of message is pretty worn out also. You can find the same exact symbolism in many movies made 10 or 20 yrs ago. Even if this symbolism hasn't worn out, there should've been enough supportings in plot or dialogue. Just throwing few isolated scenes dosen't make symbols. Visual is fine. That's only good thing in this movie. But visual alone can never make the movie great. If you use only your two eyes while watching movies, this movie is for you. but, at least if you use a tiny portion of your brain, you should not watch it. You better wait for a movie that has a better 3D technology and watchable plot."

After that, is more of the same.<br/><br/>The feeling is once in the space you will receive rain garbage every half hour. Positive point: the feeling that you are in the space is almost real (I think,because I've never been there) . A lot of issues in the film has no response. What happened to Clooney character? Is he waiting to appear in the sequel if the film succeeds? <br/><br/>In the end I left the theater with a certainty: Sandra Bullock is still hot!"
"dfranzen70","9","161","315","30 September 2013"," One of the year's top films
","Gravity, Alfonso Cuaron's explosive, white-knuckle sci-fi instant classic is a wonder to behold, with devastatingly realistic effects as a backdrop to a terrifying, compelling story and terrific work by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. It is both a concrete what-if story and a mesmerizing existential mindbender.<br/><br/>The U.S Space Shuttle Explorer is docked at the International Space Station. Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), on her first space mission, is installing an external device on the station that will enable astronomers to peer even deeper into space. Meanwhile, the mission commander Kowalski (Clooney), on his final mission, merrily spacewalks in a jet pack; other crew members perform maintenance or communicate with Earth.<br/><br/>Then trouble strikes. Houston reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites, hurling debris throughout Earth's orbit. Before the crew can return to the shuttle and head back to Earth, the craft and the ISS are pounded with lots and lots of pieces of metal traveling at extreme speeds. The damage is extensive, setting off an odyssey for Dr. Stone that is both literal and figurative, as she must find a way to keep going and return back home.<br/><br/>There is hardly a moment of inaction. Stone and Kowalski veer from problem to problem, everything accentuate by the simple fact that they are alone up there, not even able to contact NASA. It's a terrifying situation. Most of us might have a slight panic attack if we're stranded on the side of the road without a cell phone. Imagine being up in the heavens with no way to get down.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki's dizzying camera-work serves two purposes: it provides us with Stone's visual perspective, that of a novice, and it provides context for the disaster she and Kowalski find themselves in. If you think that the pictures from the Hubble telescope were beautiful, wait until you see these breathtaking visuals; they're as stirring and evocative as the acting and story itself.<br/><br/>Stone journey, as I mentioned, becomes more than just a path back to safety. She is grieving in her own way, becoming a quiet, almost listless passenger in life. Her decisions and her proactive attitude not only bring her closer to survival but also to a healing of her mind. This is definitely among Bullock's finest work, perhaps her greatest achievement to date.<br/><br/>I've noted before that 3D movies in darkened environments, such as outer space, are utterly needless, since 3D actually removes light from scenes. But somehow, the 3D effects in Gravity sidestep that downside. The technology is used so expertly here that whether we are approaching an object at high velocity or it is approaching us, we feel immersed in the scene, not distracted from it. Tough to do.<br/><br/>I simply cannot delve into the plot any more than I already have. The astute viewer will still have trouble guessing the outcome and the twists within the movie, particularly because the action is so hard- driven ‚Äì while still utterly coherent and plausible.<br/><br/>There are plenty of heart-stopping moments in Gravity, even for the most jaded of viewers. It is fantastic storytelling supported by arresting cinematography. It may be too early for movies to get serious award- season consideration, but I'll come out and say this right now: Gravity is one of the very best movies of the year."

Like a woman that trips and falls when being chased, it's just an excuse to ratchet up the tension with a weak character instead of a tough situation.<br/><br/>The character's back-story seems contrived, just to introduce some character arc.<br/><br/>It's shows satellites and space stations within site of each other.

I do love Sandra Bullock, I really do, but seriously to send her up there and have her flailing around like that until Clooney comes along (in dream form) to tell her to sack up...is really irritating and offensive to watch. More interesting would have been to have Sandra play Clooney's character and Clooney, Sandra's<br/><br/>The one great thing about this movie is that it has given limitless bitching fodder to me and my friends.

I laughed when I read the ""spoiler"" disclaimer--there is no plot in this movie to spoil!! Seriously, I couldn't tell you what the point of this stupid film was.<br/><br/>What most angers me is that it has this collective 8.6 rating on IMDb.com and we would NEVER have wasted time and money if it weren't for this site, which we trusted prior to this.

They decide to end a $16.00 movie without a beginning or an end, I am not sure which. An hour and a half movie that was no where near a full movie. It clearly was not finished. As soon as the lights in the theater came on everyone around us was complaining. I heard ""I want my money back."" ""That's it?"" ""Too short!"" And the best was ""I think they forgot the rest!""

He had a genuine creative vision that was completely corny and turned out to be the most terrible movie of all time, but it was GENUINE. He worked with the materials he had and made an honest attempt.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" has no such creative vision. It has no such honest attempt to make the best movie it could for the bloated budget sunk into it's production. It doesn't have a director that is emotionally involved in his own creation. Don't let the mindless drones fool you - the script is a class of mediocre all it's own.<br/><br/>It is pointless and utterly absurd that this movie was even made. Only more absurd is the high rating this movie has. It's like nobody wants to admit that this is a crappy movie so they just keep giving it a 10 and cheering it on like it's going to magically make it a good movie.<br/><br/>No, it does not.

One pet peeve that comes to mind is the lack of adult diapers - the director was more concerned about making Sandra Bullock's butt look good than he was portraying a semblance of realism. <br/><br/>As for the ""Symbolism"" of the movie - don't make me laugh. If you want symbolism, please watch ""The Matrix"" movies or ""Lost."" THOSE productions are chock full of symbolism.<br/><br/>The symbolism of ""Gravity"" is a superficial attempt to inject depth and meaning that the script just doesn't have. The script is beyond poorly written.<br/><br/>It's important to note - I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE. When I plunked down my thirty dollars to watch this in 3D with my date, I was prepared to find nothing but good in this movie.

","It was named ""Gravity"" instead of ""Zero-Gravity"" for a good reason - because for some unknown reason gravity had some how returned to the astronauts in space above the Earth. This would explain why Bullock's hair laid flat on her head. It would explain why Clooney had to let go of Bullock because he was being pulled by gravity! This could happen if the Hubble and the space stations were somehow stopped from their different orbits and put into a fixed spot over the earth and held there by some mysterious force. This would explain why the exploded Russian satellite debris would attack them every 90 minutes because the debris is still in orbit. But what could do that and why? Maybe the first scene might explain it. Bullock was trying to fix some device on the Hubble telescope which might then enable it to see an alien life form. The aliens did not like this so they pulled the Hubble and the space stations together and held them there while they blew up a Russian satellite using the debris from it to destroy everything in space around the earth including the communication satellites in a much much higher orbit. Perhaps they destroyed most humans on Earth also because no one one Earth was responding and no one greeted Bullock when she landed. Thus the title ""Gravity""!<br/><br/>It reminds me a bit of the old 1951 movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". In it aliens were upset with us developing atomic bombs and ""neutralized all electric power everywhere around the planet except in situations that would compromise human safety, such as hospitals and airplanes."" (Quote from Wiki.)<br/><br/>Looking forward to ""GRAVITY 2""! Here Bullock discovers that she is pretty much the only person on Earth except for the other astronauts that made it home from the space stations. She also discovers she is pregnant from Clooney (queue flashback showing how this happened in space on the shuttle). Their son, played by Justin Bieber, builds a rocket and goes into space to fight the aliens that killed his dad in the first Gravity.

Can the flash really be that bright that no one can see the truly lousy script?<br/><br/>Spoilers coming!<br/><br/>Here's the plot: 2 good-looking astronauts and 1 not so good looking are playing in space. The not-so-good looking one gets creamed with debris, a whole punched through his face, as if to remind us, in relief, how good looking the other 2 are. The space shuttle is destroyed.<br/><br/>With no where to go, the 2 astronauts deiced to go visit the Russians, but the Russians aren't home, so the one remaining saunters over to the Chinese' house. No one can hear you knock in space, but that doesn't matter because they've left too. Oh my! in a seemingly unrelated coincidence, the Chinese pace station is being dragged back into earth's atmosphere and wow, wouldn't you know, despite all the controls being in Chinese, Sandra Bullock manages to push the right buttons after just 1 or 2 misses. (Ostensibly, she's trained on the Russian station and this is just like it. How convenient!)<br/><br/>Now, it;s my understanding that re-entry into the atmosphere is a very tricky thing - too steep and you burn like Joan of Arc. Which is what happens to almost every single piece of the Chinese Condo in space, except, of course, the piece that our heroine is in. <br/><br/>And then, wouldn't you know it, it lands in water, and it begins to sink, because it was designed to land on, well, land. Oh no! After all she's been through, will she have survived everything only to drown ironically in the end? Of course not - because as we learned previously in the film, she has found the will to live in the memory of her dead daughter. (Like that's not been used before.) But not only does she survive, she arises out of the primordial ooze like a Jungian woman, ready to go out and, presumably, breed again.<br/><br/>So if you can look past all of the house calls in space and the hackneyed plot in general, it DOES offer some pretty views of the planet.

","I really have nothing positive to say about this movie. It sucks! How anyone on here can give it 10 out of 10 and it be at 8.4 which is higher than any star wars is beyond me. Fixed ratings that's how! I am a clooney fan but this movie script I felt like was put together in 2 months by a high school drama club. The first 45 mins is Sandra moaning ah ah ah every minute as of shes having sex at 80. It was very annoying. It was almost like there was no beginning and no end to this movie. The trailer is the whole movie in my opinion and by many others. Read all the reviews all the way to the bottom. There are many that feel as I do and the ones giving this 10 out of 10 must get paid to say this. I won't go into details with the acting but lets just say it was below par... Like 3 under par. I would not recommend this unless you are into big time visuals staring at outer space over and over. As far as a plot and storyline it gets a solid D- Blair witch movie was put together better than this on a budget the price of my car :("

","It's been a while since I watched this, but it's a nice brief (by today's standards) 90 minutes that fit well into the afternoon. I first watched this in a cinema in 3D with one of those chairs that shakes you around. I'm not a fan of gimmicks, or 3D which is largely a gimmick, but I have to admit it worked wonderfully for this film. It is after all a film about floating around in space with several occasions to shake the hell out of you. That's not all there is to it though. Yes it's sentimental at its core and follows are fairly predictable story arc, but it's still looks fantastic, rattles along at an engaging pace, sounds incredible and sets your teeth on edge. There's some nice shots and tricks, making full use of the fact that very little is real in camera, pulling in through the helmet glass in the opening act. It's also nice to see a strong female lead, I'm not a big Bullock fan, but she seems to fit this role perfectly. Clooney does his roguish clown thing well, adding that counter humour to the ramping tension. Yes it has an air of 'Really, what the hell is gonna go wrong next', but it's a disaster movie, plain, simple and I really enjoyed it... again."

","I felt that I had difficulty breathing for this movie. And the air was so fresh after watching. Alfonso Cuar√≥n fascinate me completely!<br/><br/>Ryan Stone was thrown to the universe and was left. I had a heavy heat till watching because it's likely to be in the lack of oxygen. If I were in her situation, I would give up on survival quickly. I'm not good at the silence and the emptiness. Perhaps it's harder to doubt your existance by yourself than the death.
The short of breathe which Cuar√≥n depicted is including suffering as much as I don't want to watch it again. In spite of it, I am fascinated because my heart is shaken by a katharsis and a salvation enough to surpass them.
The impression and the comedy have the same gimmicks. Those are carried by ups and downs of tension. The more extreme the situation is, the bigger the emotional range is.<br/><br/>In Japan, it is called 'Zero Gravity.' But the original title is just 'Gravity.'

Each time I watch this film I am surprised at the amount of suspended intensity. It feels like I'm holding my breath for 50% of the run-time. And the other half is split between the most gorgeous depictions of space you've ever seen (required HD viewing), and a deeply personal meditation on what it means to be alive; the ability and privilege to pray, to walk, and to keep going despite how tough it gets (both physically and emotionally) ...all innately bestowed upon each person from the womb.
There is so much to praise here, from experiencing the weightlessness of space by Emmanuel Lubezki's floating unbroken takes...to the beautiful metaphor of birth.<br/><br/>One of the biggest regrets of my life is not watching this in theaters.<br/><br/>It may rely heavily on CG, and it may not have an intricately developed plot, but I firmly believe that this is one of the greatest films."
"antcro-61352","10","3","3","22 May 2017"," Don't let go of this movie!
","As the film starts, we are introduced to a title card that reads as follows: ""At 600km above planet Earth, the temperature fluctuates between +258 and -148 degrees Fahrenheit. There is nothing to carry sound. No air pressure, no oxygen. Life in space is impossible."" While this opening is doing it's stuff, a haunting score (consisting of radio interference noises and string players doing a crescendo from the Devil's backyard) can first be heard only distantly. But each time a terrifying fun fact about space blurs onto the screen, the riveting concoction of sounds gets louder and louder. When the final sentence reveals itself and the title of the film (Gravity) lights up the screen, the floor vibrates beneath you, and the contents of your stomach bubble up. And, finally it stops (and stops very abruptly) and we encounter space. Beautiful space accompanied by earth's heavenly face. It smiles at us in pure silence while radio voices whisper in the distance, and our heroes drift into the scene. A great movie begins. Originally, three well rounded astronauts were faced with a by-the-books mission to repair the Hubble telescope. Unfortunately and rather predictably, things go horribly wrong when satellite debris caused by a Russian missile is catapulted throughout earth's orbit at the same velocity of a speeding bullet ,and turns the astronauts' ordinary work day in space into a catastrophe that leaves only two alive out of the astronauts and the Explorer crew. In order to return to earth, the sole survivors work together to succeed in survival.<br/><br/>Of the alive is the brilliant medical engineer, Dr. Ryan Stone. A first timer out of the nurturing atmosphere of earth, she has very little experience in space, and even less experience in the problem they face. She works by the books and is rather robotic in her character. In the beginning of the film, we are ignorant of her origin and future causes. Later in the film, Stone's accompanying survivor bring out confessions of her life on earth. She tells of her four year old daughter Sara, and her untimely death ""She was playing tag at school - slipped, fell, hit her head and that was it. The stupidest thing."" After being asked what she'd be doing on earth at their present time. Her answer was driving without a destination. She wakes up, goes to work , and then just drives, with the radio playing. Matt Kowalski (great name for an astronaut) accompanies Stone in their solitude. A seasoned astronaut (deeming this particular flight as his last before retiring) who has very little yet very entertaining stories to tell, and whether the stories he tells are factual or not, it is hard to tell (very similar to Rochester, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre). He has quick wit and charm, like most of George Clooney's character's. Sandra Bullock is great in this movie. There aren't many characters (after Kowalski's death, she is the only character for the majority of the movie) in this movie, she faced high difficulty in being good in this movie. Nonetheless, she did a great job, and I can't imagine any other actress in the role. Even though George Clooney has played this type of character before (Fantastic Mr. Fox, Ocean's Eleven) I don't think that any other actor is fit for it. He was perfect for the role, and played it well. I can imagine the casting team saying ""We need a George Clooney type for this character."" There are many things that contribute to this movies greatness, but three protrude in my mind. The cinematography, the visual effects, and the musical score. Emmanuel Lubeski's cinematography in this film is astoundingly modern and free. The opening scene of the film is a twelve and a minute long continuous shot, where the camera moves freely through space. The camera moves like some unknown entity, which is somewhat unsettling. Space has no up or down, so making the ""unnatural"" twists and turns in the camera's movement actually seems very natural. Something that is also very incredible are the first person shots, where we are the character, and we see what Ryan sees. It feels almost like a video game. The only thing in this movie that isn't made from a computer are the actors faces, and we aren't even sure about that.The visual effects in Gravity are all digital, but they look completely real. The visual effects are so painstakingly detailed that even the positions of the stars are accurate with the real thing. There isn't a flaw that I can spot with the visual effect - simply astounding Steven Price's Academy Award winning score for this movie is very grand. There is a wide variety of instruments (glass armonica, strings, winds, computers)that work together like cogwheels in a clock. Do to the lack of sound in space, they've filled in those soundless moment with music. When an explosion occurred, there was an explosion of music, when a massive piece of debris passed by and just barely misses our heroes, a massive crescendo followed by a decrescendo happened with music. Another thing that happens quite often in Gravity is massive crescendos that continually inch their way up the scale and are cut off very briefly. This is very disorienting, and adds to the intensity of the film. This movie isn't just here to be beautiful and spectacular. It serves as a guide to survival, and I don't mean from a debris storm in space. This movie is about healing, and letting go. It's very metaphorical actually, Ryan's physical body mustn't let go, if she did she would go flying into oblivion. She must also let go mentally. She must let go of her daughter in order to truly live. ""No more just driving. Let's go home!"""
"meetjosefla","10","3","3","16 May 2017"," Best movie ever!
","Forget the visuals, they are just a distraction - instead look at the script, look at the character of Ryan Stone, how vulnerable, yet never defeated she is. She was introduced as a lonesome, weak, discontent and pessimistic character. But by the end of the movie, she has found new hope, new strength, new reason and purpose to fight for life despite the adversities she went through. Ryan Stone is the main focus and if you focus on the main thing, you're into a life changing movie going experience."

","A technical masterpiece, proved at the Oscars, that Alfonso Cuar√≥n brings to us. The story is very simple, a medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in orbit. <br/><br/>""Life in space is impossible""<br/><br/>This sentence proves itself in the movie, it's obviously very dangerous to work in space (reparing satellites) and to land on the moon (but we did it!). It all seemed to be good until a Russian satellite is hit by a missile (on purpose by the Russians, to destroy it) but the debris of it end up hitting on Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). After the first hit. the timer is set, the debris will come, and they'll have to be prepared. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty straight forward, but the way they pull it off is brilliant. The character development was really good. Ryan had a daughter once, but she died very young because of a stupid accident, and at some points in the movie you understand why she would give up her life, to reunite with her lost child, or simply to give up because no one will care (we can see that she is a lonely person affected by tragic events). Matt gives the idea of a experienced and very calm astronaut (much like Clooney's usual characters), but we don't know much about him except some stories he's always talking about. But it's OK, the main character really is Ryan, it's her character that's important to this movie and like Cuar√≥n said at the Oscars, Sandra Bullock is Gravity.<br/><br/>At some points in the movie without noticing I found myself holding my breath in certain moments. It's a claustrophobic movie. That good. The change between sound and no sound is brilliant, that's why I did that, along with the change I would hold my breath to experience the same as they would. In terms of sound mixing, like I said it was well done with the sound matching the experience of the movie. Excellent visual experience, beautiful images of the earth and surroundings, a real breakthrough in special effects, and personally the best movie yet in 3D. This is absolutely worth seeing in 3D, in fact it's necessary to obtain the full movie experience. Cuar√≥n and everyone involved in the movie should be proud of themselves."
"TheDonaldofDoom","8","5","6","1 January 2019"," The most expensive art movie ever made?
","Those disappointed with Gravity were expecting, I suppose, a standard blockbuster space movie. Instead what we got was primal, stripped back. Very little backstory. Only two characters. Only the barest plot. This allowed Cuaron, and us, to focus on what mattered: the atmosphere, the immersion, the beauty and emptiness of space. In removing everything but these essentials, Cuaron allowed himself to make something pure.<br/><br/>Gravity starts with about a 15-minute shot. It's masterfully executed, and filled with intent throughout. It's amazing. In the last part of the shot, you see her float away, against a backdrop of stars. That image captures the imagination. I tried to imagine how long her journey to those stars will be. It's moments like that make Cuaron's purpose most clear.<br/><br/>At one point, the camera focuses on Stone's face and the reflection of the earth in her helmet as she spins. It then slowly rotates to assume her point of view inside the helmet. For a long time, you just see the universe spinning around. It's these types of unique perspectives that make Gravity's visuals special. In another beautiful scene, Ryan is pulled by the tether attached to Matt over a gorgeous view of the sun and the earth. It's also amazing how pretty the break-up of a space station looks, pieces travelling in all directions. There are more subtle moments of beauty too, like Ryan's reflection in Matt's wrist.<br/><br/>Gravity is more science fantasy than science fiction, but that doesn't get in the way of the immersion except at certain times, namely when Ryan was being chased by a fire that just happened not to burn her as it twisted around her.<br/><br/>Gravity isn't too focused on the characters and that's fine, although there is a simple arc there for Ryan. But it's not particularly well executed. Towards the end of the movie there are some moments that aimed to tug at the heartstrings but are clumsily handled. What is meant to be the climactic moment for Ryan, when she decides whether to give up or to carry on, ends up being a pretty corny scene in which Matt's ghost speaks to her. Not too long afterwards, she's howling like a wolf. I get what Cuaron was attempting with the communication with a foreigner who couldn't understand English, but I thought it was badly executed. Regarding Matt's ghost, I think it would actually have been more effective to leave out the sentimentality. That said, seeing how unimportant the character development is to enjoying the film, I can't say these mistakes made me enjoy it much less.<br/><br/>Gravity is a great achievement, technically and artistically. Even watched on the small screen as I did it's an immersive experience."

","I missed Gravity when it came out, and finally caught up on it after having it on my bucket list of movies to see. Wow, did I miss out on a great one.<br/><br/>Once again, my praise of the movie has as much to do with the amount of awful and clich√© kinds of movies that continually are made and come out these days that either bore me or are an insult. Most are underwhelming and what I would refer to as ""opportunities missed"". Gravity doesn't miss. It is all it can be and I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>The beauty and visuals of the movie are incredible and awe inspiring, but I was also surprised that the story, acting, action, and dialogue were also very good. After seeing many survival movies where only one or two people battle nature or the elements, I had a good measuring stick for what to expect.<br/><br/>There's Castaway and The Revenant for instance and although both these movies are good, the boredom that sets in at times due to having little instances for dialogue with others you do feel. In Gravity, the key to its' ""never boring"" take on such a solo survival story is that it's short. The movie is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long so there is never a feeling that it drags at all, unlike similar movies like the aforementioned.<br/><br/>Gravity is intense, gripping, fun to watch, emotional, and at times sprinkles in some unexpected humor to boot. Sandra Bullock is an inspiration. This is a must see, classic, science fiction movie with some of the best cinematography of a space movie ever. I was really glad I watched it and finally caught up on what I missed. 10/10"

"jul-kinnear","8","8","11","22 January 2014"," Gravity in a Word: ""Captivating""
","Gravity is the latest in science fiction feature films, a thriller directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n that will have your heart racing and your breath held for most of the film. Gravity toys with your emotions from minute one, juxtaposing the beauty and serenity of space with its impending danger and destruction.<br/><br/>The film stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and tells the story of two astronauts and their fight to get back to Earth after the destruction of their space shuttle. Bullock plays the role of Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first expedition to space with Matt Kowalski, played by Clooney, a veteran and the more experienced of the two. Bullock's acting is wonderful, as she shared strong and true emotions with the audience despite the fact that for most of the film, she only has herself or Matt (a man her character isn't very well acquainted with) to talk to.<br/><br/>What set this film apart are the special effects. With a budget of $100 million, about 80 per cent of the production was done in CG (more than James Cameron's Avatar) to create a visually stunning film. Viewing the beauty of Planet Earth from space is what captivates you for most of the film, with the help of 3D technology designed and added in post- production under the supervision of Chris Parks, giving an amazing depth to the film. The work producers put into bringing space to life is phenomenal ‚Äî not to mention the light box, with over 4,000 LED bulbs that had to be created (invented, even) to film the actors' faces inside their astronaut helmets. <br/><br/>Gravity shares similarities with traditional tales of determination to return home and survival. The Odyssey and Castaway come to mind. But in space, this narrative takes on a new perspective. The theme of perseverance is written all over this movie, with Stone questioning her ability to keep fighting ‚Äî to look death in the face and either go on or give up. This is a story about going against all odds when the entire universe is against you.<br/><br/>There are several hints of a rebirth theme as well, with the astronauts hanging from the space shuttle with their lifelines like fetuses with their umbilical cords. Look out for the scene partway through the film with Bullock floating in a C-shape fetal position, and remember the way astronauts have to relearn to walk and gain strength in their muscles upon returning to Earth, like a child. All these instances suggest a Kubrick-like interest in demonstrating the evolution and vulnerability of human life, united with the scenes of confronting death.<br/><br/>Gravity is at the top of the list where the Oscars are concerned, with ten nominations (tied for the lead with American Hustle), including a nomination for Best Picture. Even astronaut Buzz Aldrin gave the film positive reviews, and he told the Hollywood Reporter that he's happy Gravity was made and hopes it will ""stimulate the public"" to encourage advancements in space technology. I think with a movie like this ‚Äî and all the recent press from Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield ‚Äî we're taking one small step in the right direction. <br/><br/>http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/gravity-movie-captivating"
"nupichn","8","8","11","17 November 2013"," An Artistic Adventure!
","So let's talk about Gravity. Gravity, in my opinion, is one of those movies that is more of an artistic experience than a plot driven story. Other examples include: Life of Pi and Pan's Labyrinth. Some people may hate that idea but personally I think that it can create a door to whole new worlds like... Space. And Gravity is definitely a great example of this. Some of the shots in this film truly show the size and scale of space in a way that sends shivers down your spine and makes your hairs stand on end. The film also has a great soundtrack which is really suspenseful and exciting one minute but pretty and peaceful the next. If you want a good example, look up the track ""Atlantis"". Truly breathtaking. The first hour of the film is one of the most breathtaking experiences I have ever felt in a movie. You truly feel like you are floating around in space with these astronauts. But when everything starts to go wrong... The film starts to feel a tad clich√©. Not bad, just clich√©. A good example (Spoiler alert) is when Ryan is in one of the space stations She starts to say a speech that I feel like I have heard about 30 times already. The speech is about how she will never give up and if anyone is going to save her life. It's her. So if you are looking for a good film, give it a shot. But if you really want a plot driven story with a complex and sophisticated feel then look elsewhere. An artistic and beautiful adventure that will take your breath away. Gravity gets an 8/10"

","The movie goer is transported to a place the vast majority of us will never go. I now have a greater respect for astronauts -besides the technical side of their work - the personal side comes out, and the working with other nations in space. Ryan is the newbie - a medical trained astronaut who is running from a sad event in her life - as she says 'she drives'. With an experienced astronaut they are subjected to a happening that probably could happen. Their dependence on each other and then the training that makes for the rest of the story - they are smart. The best part of the story is the cinematography - the filming is amazing and I admire the director and all who were able to do this film - it is one of the best. Even though there are some things not true - you do believe it when you see it. I have read about this and admire the actors for what they did - I'm sure it was a challenge in many ways. I really liked this file - but with what I consider a really great film, I cannot get it out of my mind for several days. I saw this yesterday and that has not happened with it.

A welcome change from all the shaky-cam that we see in the recent cinema.<br/><br/>An interesting and refreshing point was proper use of the first-person camera. I felt as if I was looking from inside of the space suit. I felt that strange mix of claustrophobia and agoraphobia that is possible to experience only in the vastness of space while being in this insignificant amount of fabric and tech. These shots were few which made them significant and were well established in the relationship to the surrounding so I knew where I was looking at all times. One of the harder things to achieve in the emptiness of space.<br/><br/>The film was perfectly paced for a space movie. Coming into the movie, I was ready for extremely slow space walks, but Cuar√≥ns managed to beat my expectations by introducing welcome highly dynamic scenes to separate off the slower paced ones.<br/><br/>The plot was fairly standard, but here again Cuar√≥ns managed to keep it very fresh by giving us one large surprise mid-film. One major problem with the movie was that it did not make me care for Stone which was essential to sink into the movie. Cuar√≥ns made a strange decision to make her a person without family. Meaning that her only motivation to survive was her own survival instinct. But this decision meant that Stone could explore some topics that are available only to people without stronger survival motivations.<br/><br/>On a more nit-picky note, what was with that in-your-face symbolism of a womb in the middle of the movie. Either I have not noticed other symbols, or in a film with a very few symbols, there is one that is sticking out and heavily disrupting the flow of the story."
"hkauteur","8","8","11","24 October 2013"," HK Auteur Review - Gravity
","In my opinion, the key to making special effects convincing on screen is designing the effect to look somewhere between real and unreal. When the audience can't figure out what's real and what's not, they will believe it. This is what happened to me during Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity.<br/><br/>Since Children of Men, Alfonso Cuar√≥n takes his love of the long take and brings it to new levels. I couldn't figure out how these long shots were accomplished. The camera floats freely around the astronauts in space in long takes, occasionally shifting from third person perspective to first person. The camera loops, twirls, corkscrews around space, completely forgoing the human sense of up and down. It looked like the cameraman was really floating around with the actors. I knew that wasn't possible. But eventually I tapped out and let the movie spectacle just wash over me.<br/><br/>As science fiction thematically explores the extreme potential of mankind, awe is an important component to every science fiction story. I was in sheer awe through the entirety of Gravity. Firstly, outer space and the beauty of Earth from a distance awed me. Then there was the solemn beauty of witnessing the space stations being decimated in space. I began to marvel at the destruction and momentarily thought deep thoughts. It was as if for a second I was watching waves wash ashore on a beach while reading J. Krishnamurti. Finally, I was awed by the fragility of human life. After all, all astronauts are just little fishes trying to survive out of their own habitat. The experience was otherworldly, self-reflective and dangerous all at the same time.<br/><br/>I walked into Gravity mistakenly thinking it was a George Clooney vehicle. To my surprise, it's a Sandra Bullock movie. Sandra Bullock has always had a natural personable quality on screen. Whether it was pining for her crush to awaken from a coma in While You Were Sleeping or driving a bus that's primed to explode in Speed, she's always able to draw the audience into her plight with vulnerability. Bullock's characters never feel above the audience. Often this quality of hers get overlooked from having to play cheerful funny characters in romantic comedies.<br/><br/>In Gravity, that quality is used to its full extent. We watch as she struggles to survive a series of obstacles. Her performance is as immersive as the special effects. She draws you in completely into her plight. I wish more depth were given to her character. By the beginning of the third act, the film starts to run low on its spectacle and it came to the moment where more character was needed for a bigger statement. Gravity elected to stay with its spectacle and jetted for the finish line. It had a good ending, but it was missing that final thematic punch that answers, ""What is this story ultimately about?"" and ""Why am I watching this?""<br/><br/>And for that, Gravity is a great gem and one exhilarating thrill ride. I am even happy that it was a great role for Sandra Bullock. I just do not know if the thrills will be as compelling on subsequent viewings. So in the end, it is not a masterpiece, but a very awesome movie nonetheless.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"

","Jaw-droppingly spectacular; it's one hell of a ride! Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts. <br/><br/>The acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic. She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders. The well-timed bouts of humour by George Clooney's supporting character, the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky, give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller. The cameo by the ecstatic Indian astronaut singing around ""Mera jootha hai Japani"" in space was hilarious as well. <br/><br/>Other than being an adventurous suspense thriller, the slow character- development helps us to form an emotional bond as well. So, by the time the movie reaches climax, you're in it as much as the heroic lead, Dr. Ryan Stone. The mesmerizingly-orchestrated meteoric-shower-like scene of the entering spacecraft, towards the end of the movie, is one of the best executed scenes of cinematic history!<br/><br/>Whether you're a fan of science-fiction thrillers or not, whether you're a fan of 3D films or not, (to quote the lead characters from the movie) either way, it's gonna be one hell of a ride!"

","The more I watched the trailer the less I was sure I wanted to spend the money to see it. I am glad I went but it is not something I would see again.<br/><br/>The visual is very good. If you go see it you must see it in IMAX 3D or don't see it at all. It is great to see views of the earth from space and also nice to see extreme closeups of the Hubble, the shuttle and the ISS both inside and outside. The 3D was so realistic I blinked a few times as things came flying toward the screen.<br/><br/>As for the story, don't even both paying much attention. Just sit back and watch the visuals and ignore the story. The believability is not even in the near vicinity of this universe. There is almost nothing about this movie that is any way related to how things like this would happen in space. I would go so far as to say you could take along earplugs and not listen to the story. Just watch the visuals."
"jamiew8383","6","39","71","5 October 2013"," A lot of hype
","While this is a visually beautiful film I didn't feel Sandra Bullock was successful in carrying the movie essentially alone. I didn't really root for her at all. The lost child back-story was clich√© and the monologue towards the end when Sandra's character was telling Clooney's character to give the child a message wasn't even a little believable. The little interactions between George and Sandra were laughable, and not in the good way writers were intending. Maybe I was expecting too much. This film could easily qualify sir some sort of visual, sound or editing awards the performances do not even come close to capturing best picture or best actress awards, or nominations."

"maddog-50","2","90","178","5 October 2013"," Gravity for your eyelids
","Open Water in Space, i guess: A lame story which fits on a coaster stretched to the excess before people would get bored to death. All solely carried by visual effects. The problem here, to convey the infinity wideness of space to the audience, you need a reference point, otherwise, all you could show is a black background with little light dots on. Obviously, you have to show the only reference point available over and over again: the Earth from 400 km above, and what you see is more or less the same, for 90 min..<br/><br/>And, honestly, Sandra Bullock in a space suit doesn't give me the slightest impression of what it would mean, to be in such a situation as an astronaut. Either you see a white space suit in front of the Earth, spinning around, or, you see a face from inside the helmet of a space suit.<br/><br/>The 'drama'-plot could be easily translated to someone being captured in a small room anywhere, that the whole thing happens in Space does not make any difference, plot-wise.<br/><br/>The possible ways to get rescued are crystal clear, either someone picks you up or you die. And if this wouldn't be boring enough for the viewer, there's only one possible way to die, no sharks, or whatever...and you can't die from being attracted by gravity! So even the title of the movie is a kind of stupid.<br/><br/>1 extra point for the nice Earth view CGI."
"isotimpex","4","27","47","11 November 2013"," (sigh) What am I missing?
","This is getting ridiculous! How can everyone and their neighbor see this flick as a ""masterpiece"", but I'm left, yet again, deciding if I should spend money any time soon on another big screen show? Keep in mind that my rant is not intended for those, planning to see the movie, as spoilers are aplenty!<br/><br/>Space has been a magnet for my interest/imagination for many years, so I've seen countless hours of TV documentaries, NASA footage and movies. Seeing Earth from far above, is always a treat, but not enough to be the center of my attention for another two hours. People awkwardly floating and bouncing around in open space, have long since become as exotic, as scuba divers. In other words, there wasn't much ""new"" in the setup. I do appreciate the meticulous work done to create something artificial that represents the real thing so well...but that's just the background. What was there to see on the stage? Well, nothing. As strange as it sounds, there was nothing to see! The main point of this ""movie"", is to show us in ridiculous detail the stress, pain and misery a survivor goes through hundreds of miles above the surface of the planet. The characters are as anonymous as those on the NASA TV channel, and rapidly disposed of. Sandra's character gets all the screen time, so it gets to make at least a physical impression. No emotions stem at all, however, spare for pity - her only child is dead, her life down on Earth is pretty much empty and now she's getting this brutal treatment up in space. She is so frustratingly clumsy, as she fails to grab and hold onto all but the very last sticking out objects (eventually you learn the pattern, so you can predict which antenna or cable will save her from doom). Good thing is her grip becomes infallible, whenever she is being tossed around by violently opening latches. <br/><br/>Once you get used to her ""I'm so helpless in this nightmare!"" attitude and after you are comfortable with the camera's tireless efforts to REALLY show you how nauseatingly disorienting it feels to spin in space, you should try to make peace with the torturous soundtrack. It makes you pay for every moment the director demonstrates how quiet space is. Since ears naturally get more sensitive in silence, you are forced into a cheap trap, as you feel physical pain, when the grotesque and pompous sound returns. <br/><br/>Speaking of annoyances, few more things should be mentioned - the villains of the movie - the fast flying debris, which, thanks to the 3D-boosted realism, make your eyes flicker far too much. On the list is also Clooney. George got the ""He was only a week away from retirement"" veteran casualty role. As predictable as they come - experienced, cheerful leader, ready for the ultimate sacrifice 24/7, dying on his last mission, to save...whoever is left to be saved. <br/><br/>The movie is a kindergarten level survivor guide, teaching you how to calm down, think/talk about something other than the traumatizing reality and, of course, ""Never give up! Never surrender!"" The funny thing is that so many critics called this nagging lecture ""annoying"" in ""After Earth"" (which it was, along with the entire movie), but in ""Gravity"" everyone gave it standing ovations. All there is worth experiencing out of this mess, could have been extracted into 20-30 minutes. The rest is an hour-long series of Sandra's panicked face and frantic breathing, which she is reminded again and again to be a known waste of oxygen. You see her crying in 0G...then her floating tears get in focus...then her crying face again...(yawn)<br/><br/>Basically, this is a train wreck in slow motion - lots of crude machinery gets smashed and death inevitably follows. It tries so desperately to squeeze emotions out of the viewer, that it's just soaked in well tested clich√©s. I guess, I'm just not the right type of public to enjoy monster truck shows...or ""Gravity""."

"saschakrieger","9","14","22","25 February 2014"," The human quest
","The blue planet: At the beginning of Gravity, the earth moves slowly into view, inhabiting a dark, silent universe. The silence is broken by faint radio communication that gradually grows louder as a space shuttle appears, first as a dot, then slowly growing larger. It is a long, slow, quiet opening sequence that sets the stage for Alfonso Cuar√≥n's latest film. Three astronauts are doing some repair work on the Hubble telescope, the focus is on seasoned commander Matthew Kowalsky (George Clooney) and scientist Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). The atmosphere is loose: Kowalsky tells funny stories and plays country music, Stone is focused on her work, when suddenly a Russian missile meant to destroy a disused satellite caused a chain reaction: debris from countless satellites and other objects turns into missiles destroying the shuttle and sending Kowalsky and stone on a lone quest to survive - alone in space. A nightmarish scenario and yet not one entirely implausible. Debris is more and more clogging then earth's orbit, attempts at getting rid of things in space manifold and often short-sighted. This is one theme of the film, coupled with the human hubris of controlling nature ‚Äì or, in this case, the entire universe. On the other hand, Gravity is a tale of human perseverance, of the strength the will to live can instill, and also of the power of human sacrifice.<br/><br/>Little of this is new, yet the way Cuar√≥n tells his story is entirely his own, even though he quotes extensively from science fiction classics such as Andrey Tarkovsky's Solaris (Clooney also starred in Stephen Soderbergh's remake) or Stanley Kubrick's 2001 ‚Äì a Space Odyssey. The sense of aimless drifting, of losing control is there, as is the feeling of loneliness in a hostile infinity. As in Kubrick's masterpiece, technology is friend and foe alike, rescue and damnation employ the same instruments. It is Gravity's strength that there is no overt criticism in man's often blind belief in the value of technology, his hubris to be the master of the universe he knows. Yet it is all there: in the hypnotic imagery, the startled faces, the toy-like fragility of these technological masterpieces we have sent spinning around our planet. In all this, the human is as vulnerable as ever. When Stone reaches the assumed safe haven of the International Space Station (ISS), we see her floating in a fetal position in front of the circular airlock. This is, of course, a nod to 2001 (as is the opening sequence), but it is also a powerful image of human vulnerability. Stripped of all technological support, the human being is naked and helpless.<br/><br/>But it is also a rebirth: Stone, relying on training and countless gadgets, is entirely at a loss when unexpected disaster strikes. She has to battle her fears and face her demons before she can believe in a chance to survive. Sandra Bullock is impressive in her portrayal of this broken, hurt, desperate yet stubborn woman, who is, as we all are, groping along alone in eternal darkness. Her character is given her power by Kowalsky who shows her what humans are capable of doing for each other. Only then does she start believing in herself. Gravity takes much of its power from this combination of survivor story and meditatively philosophical science fiction tale. Man's hubris fails, but the will to survive remains. This is the key difference to Solaris and 2001: Cuar√≥n chooses to believe in the human strength, in humanity's ability to change ‚Äì one self and one's course on earth and within our universe.<br/><br/>Gravity has its very own pace, the pace of zero gravity, of floating in a vast, infinite and ultimately hostile space. A space in which the elaborate constructions humanity has built seem ridiculous, like badly made toys, which cannot protect but surely have the ability to destroy. The camera is floating along with the objects and protagonists, it moves in and out, often films the faces though their visors, then suddenly moves inside the helmet. Space is vast and unintelligible, yet for those lost in it it is a narrow, claustrophobic room as they are caught in the prison of human ambition. When ‚Äì in accordance with physics ‚Äì a space station explodes without a sound, this is a powerful reminder of our place in the universe.<br/><br/>The elementary fear and despair is always present: in the darkness of space, the cold emptiness of the technological contraptions, the clean, anti-septic images, whose polished surface reveals an unfeeling, indifferent universe ‚Äì the real one as the man-made one ‚Äì in which being human is impossibly hard. That it affirms the validity of trying despite the odds, is one of the film's strongest points, as is the repeated, yet never obvious reminder of what it is we have to fight for: earth's beauty is shown as vulnerable, fragile, fleeting, yet overwhelming. While the musical score is at times superfluous, the story-lines occasionally to well-composed, the ending a little far-fetched, Gravity is a powerful reminder of the possibilities and limits of human aspiration, critical of human hubris and affirmation of humanity's strength. A hypnotic, mesmerizing and ultimately hopeful film that will prove hard to forget.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"

The computer generated graphics and space maneuvers can seem exciting at first, but when you realize that that's about the only thing the movie has to offer, it almost gets on your nerves after a while, as much of it is incredible and ""unscientific"". Besides, Sandra Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is supposed to be a Mission Specialist with adequate training in space flight. But, it seems as if she's an ordinary housewife who's put into space, as she's mostly fumbling and bumbling. If it was to make George Clooney's character, as Mission Commander, look great, well...it did. Apart from the repetitive computer graphics of space walks et al, Clooney's quips and witticisms are about the only 'entertaining' bits of a largely forgettable movie. Both George Clooney and Sandra Bullock have been wasted in the movie which has hardly any script to speak of.<br/><br/>Gravity even in 3D was perhaps the least exciting or thrilling Sci-Fi flick I have ever watched, and am amazed by the undeservingly high ratings it has enjoyed.

Firstly, blaming the Russians for all the ""bad"" that goes on in the world is really tiresome and very over done. Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone is a typical clich√©, she is a scarred individual with a tear jerking past who we are supposed to relate to and sympathize with. Yawn!! George Clooney is your typical brave, funny, all American hero that we all wish we were and is truly heroic and selfless in death.

Im not going to go into details about Bullock escaping the exploding space station and avoiding the millions of pieces of space debris or fumbling through Russian and Chinese space craft to magically re-enter earths orbit only to survive another near death experience to then crawl on a picturesque beach.

The many positive reviews its received make me only believe that the human race is filled with morons who need to be sterilized."

","Really people! Do you not have an inkling what a really good movie is. This is possibly the worst drivel I've seen in decades. It was sentimental tripe. Monumentally Bad. Clooney and Bullock are way to old to go into space. I thought its gonna get better but boy o boy...it just kept getting worse. The 3D effects weren't even that spectacular. Lost In Space was better than this. I should have know with Clooney in another space movie. Solaris was as rotten as this. But this stunk even more.

That mitigated my disappointment with the rest of the film to a certain extent. However, the thin story and weak dialogue kept dragging me out of the action. Sandra bullock did her best with the on the nose dialogue that was laughably bad at times. She didn't seem to be the right fit for the role but I don't think she can blamed for bad writing and misdirection ( no one told the director that thirty minutes of hyperventilating might be unnecessary realism?) By all means go see this film for the spectacular visuals but don't expect a story to go along with the spectacle. Even Jim Cameron managed a decent story with Avatar.

"Navaf","9","11","17","18 October 2013"," Excellent movie blew me away with stunning visuals, spoiler free and with spoiler halfway through
","First off this is a one of a kind movie, that blew me away with excellent cinematography and story telling. The movie is a sci-fi space drama/thriller, but unlike most sci-fi space movies Gravity strives and excellently depicts a more realistic current setting, with the current technological limitations. This is were so many peoples reliability to the movie comes from. <br/><br/>Movie stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, and are the only two live faces you would see on the movie, with Sandra taking a large chunk of the screen time midway through the movie. With only two cast members floating in space the the directors/writers pulls off an amazing feat keeping the audience engaged in a relatively fast paced plot, not only in an adrenaline fulled high, but playing with the emotions and creating empathy connecting the actors to the audience. This is largely achieved by clever dialogue close up face shots coupled with excellent acting by Sandra. What was really stunning about the movie was the breathtaking rendering of space, the earth from space, as the continents cities rolls by and the sun is peaking from the horizon, all of the visuals was amazingly realistic with great attention to detail. The shots of Hubble and ISS was was exactly as they are in space, not to mention details to starts and constellations. The directors tried to get the physics as real as possible, but sadly there were some shortcoming, but a casual majority of movie goer might not be able to notice these, this did not degrade the movie experience completely, i would say some of the choices to flaunt those rules did enhance it, for instance the decisions not to use space visors so their faces could be visible from the suit helmet. This movie is definitely worth the 3D experience, a must watch movie. <br/><br/>OK, from this point on the will be some spoilers for a more critical review...<br/><br/>The movie starts of with Kowalski (played by Clooney) a space veteran, and his team on the space walk mission doing some repairs to Hubble space telescope. Rayan Stone (played by Bullock), a medical researcher is out on the space walk doing some repairs to the Hubble. Strapped to a arm out in the space totally out of her element and profession. Its one of those moments where you scratch your head whats she doing out there doing repairs, and turns out its her first space walk. The plot unfolds as the Russians decided the best way to get rid of one of their old satellites is to blow it up with a missile. Another absurd moment, the Russians with all their experience in the space arena, blows up a satellite with a missile, this also while a active space walk was going on. Usually defunct satellites forced to re-enter earths atmosphere, where they burn up, and the remains safely crash on some safe zone. Anyway this explosion creates a chain reaction, which creates debris moving in hyper speed which are moving faster than speeding bullets, this scenario is somewhat plausible, these debris moves in and destroys the repair teams shuttle and on impact flings Sandra character hurtling into space. The first thing is faster than speeding bullet debris is seen coming their way, while of course it would be impossible to see such fast moving objects, but this can be overlooked as it created the great cinematic effect. <br/><br/>Moving further on there was one scene where physical laws was so blatantly twisted and disregarded it almost ruined the movie. This is where Mat Kowalski had to un-tether himself apparently because the momentum was pulling him and Rayan Stone both, so Clooneys character does this and floats away to die, all the while they were both pretty stationary and stable, physically speaking there should be no force acting on him. Although this most blatant abuse of physical law to further the plot, the story as a whole was pretty OK."

","To all the people that valued this movie 1/10. I've never written a review but in this case, seeing that this movie received 1 over 10 I would like to share some thoughts. First of all I wonder how much you would evaluate a movie like ""Sharknado"" or ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". This movie deserve more than 1 because surely is not the worse movie you saw or you will see in your lifetime. Originality: please enunciate me a movie that is talking about destruction about chain-reaction caused by debris. Who is telling that ""Apollo 13"" was better remember that the story was not original: it happened in reality, it was already there and the director already knew what happened, not having to invent it. There is a difference between reproducing and originality. State of art visual special effects: maybe you watched your movie on a tablet or laptop but for the time this movie was produced no better technology for special effects has been used before. For example, I like Inception but there is a big difference between filming ""no gravity"" effects with a normal camera and doing it with a 3D IMAX camera and the Academy Award Oscar is the evidence. If you watched it in a 2D small screen then it's not director's fault. To conclude I do not believe the director had even the idea to reproduce the reality or teaching science but only to show how beautiful is the life in our home, Earth and how difficult is to survive outside of it."

"GeorgeMcGinn","9","6","8","22 June 2016"," Gravity's nonstop action thriller keeps you on the edge of your seats and guessing up until the end on how the movie ends (No Spoilers Here)
","After the National Geographic's ""Live In Space"" broadcast the American astronaut revealed he watched the space thriller ""Gravity"" while whizzing around in space on the International Space Station.<br/><br/>While the astronauts made the comparison to that of passengers on a cruise ship watching the ""Titanic,"" it has garnered renewed interest in the film, which at the time of the broadcast had recently came out on DVD, On-Demand and on iTunes two weeks prior.<br/><br/>Gravity, winner of seven Academy Awards, including Best Director, is a fictional account of a disaster in space, with most of the physics of space and micro-gravity correctly portrayed. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first Space Shuttle mission with only six months of training to install her own updates to the Hubble Space Telescope for her research. <br/><br/>George Clooney plays veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, who is on his last space mission and is attempting to break the record for space walking using a prototype jetpack. And Ed Harris is the voice of mission control.<br/><br/>What seems to be the start of a routine spacewalk, disaster strikes 10 minutes into this 91 minute film, with 81 minutes of non-stop edge of your seat drama that keeps building until a the climax at the end allows you to breath again. But only in the last 30 seconds of the film.<br/><br/>Every time I watch this film, I swear the movie is only 60 minutes. That's how fast the action moves through the entire length.<br/><br/>The drama starts when Stone is working on the Hubble when the Russians shoot down one of their own, obsolete satellites with a land-based missile seven minutes into the film.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the film, the space shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalski alone in the deafening silence of space alone and tethered to only each other as they fly into the darkness of space.<br/><br/>After loosing the last lifeline they have, communications to Mission Control, the drama heats up as Stone and Kowalski have lost any chance of rescue. Or have they?<br/><br/>Fear turns into panic as they gulp down oxygen like it was a cold drink on a scorching hot day, adding to the growing list of problems with no solutions in sight.<br/><br/>Stone and Kowalski realize that they must go deeper into the dark abyss of space to throw a Hail Mary that makes the one Doug Flutie threw in 1984 look like a routine shuttle pass!<br/><br/>Gravity, directed by Mexican born Alfonso Cuar√≥n, who also produced, edited, and co- wrote the screenplay with his son Jon√°s Cuar√≥n (George Clooney was uncredited as collaborating in writing the screenplay).<br/><br/>This is the first project that the father-son team worked on together as directors, but not their first movie project. <br/><br/>Gravity for the most part is accurate in its portrayal of space. However, the sound effects people couldn't leave well enough alone. They broke some of the laws of physics, such as when the added sound to scenes where objects collided in space. Remember, as the film's opening says, ""there is no sound in space."" You can hear some of the sounds while the music tries to cover it up.<br/><br/>Also, anyone who knows something about space will see that at times an action does not always have an opposite and equal reaction. As an amateur astronomer since 1973, I could pick this film apart. However, any of the small breaking of the laws of physics will not interfere with the non-stop thriller, making you feel good about having both feet on Earth.<br/><br/>However, some of the best commentary on the film came from American Astronaut Rick Mastracchio during the live broadcast from the ISS during the NatGeo broadcast. <br/><br/>Mastracchio said that while such a disaster like the one portrayed in ""Gravity"" may be possible, nothing like that has ever happened in space.<br/><br/>There have been near disasters in space while aboard the Space Shuttle and the ISS, excluding the Challenger and Columbia disasters.<br/><br/>For those who have yet to watch ""Live In Space,"" there will be no spoilers given by the astronauts here either, other than that the incidents that did happen and discussed during the live broadcast could have been as equally deadly to the ISS as in ""Gravity.""<br/><br/>While the ISS is the most heavily fortified object in space, capable of withstanding strikes from small objects and micro-meteors, it is also protected by a virtual box that NORAD monitors. If an object enters this box, the first call goes to NASA, and the ISS has the capability to blast itself away from any danger. All I will say is that this call has been made to NASA on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>In addition to ""Gravity,"" the father-son duo produced the 2004 hit movie ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts.<br/><br/>If you love space movies, ""Gravity"" provides much realism, with a backdrop taken from NASA archives, and a storyline that will keep you on edge and guessing. <br/><br/>It's dramatic impact is non-stop and the 91-minute film flies as fast as the ISS does through space.<br/><br/>This is a movie that should be in everyone's collection."
"basscadet75","9","6","8","18 April 2014"," A great action thriller, surprisingly
","Looking at the previous reviews, this is obviously a polarizing film. In a way I can understand that, because it's so different in some ways from what most American movie watchers seem used to these days. It's a sci-fi film without two opposing sides blowing each other up, without capital ships blasting each other with torpedoes or fighter planes carving up empty space as if they're moving through air, all the while making swooshing sounds you'd never hear in real life.<br/><br/>At the same time, others criticize this film for its *lack* of realism, mainly on the basis that as a film that's *supposed* to be realistic, it's just so improbable. And it is, but then so is every film - that's what makes good films interesting! Nobody's going to watch a film about how Sandra Bullock went to space, fulfilled her mission and then came home without incident. Lots of things happen to her in this film that seem impossible but aren't - they're just implausible when taken together, but that adds up to an exciting film.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple - the Russians knock out one of their own satellites (no, not by mistake), which in turn sets off a chain reaction (yes, this was a mistake) among other satellites that creates destructive shrapnel flying around the Earth at 50,000 miles per hour. This is something scientists have actually worried about for years, because so much of what we send up to space goes into basically the same orbit - space is vast, but the altitudes that make sense for orbit are actually pretty limited in number. And there are thousands of objects up there now. The ISS itself - in real life - has had to adjust course due to flying shrapnel in the past, and shuttles themselves have been hit with small debris while in orbit (discovered after landing). So the premise is entirely realistic.<br/><br/>How Dr. Stone (Sandra Bullock) deals with the situation you may or may not find believable, but nothing she does is outside of what's possible, and it wouldn't be much of a movie without the drama of knowing she's always *this close* to dying. The movie entirely revolves around her, so she needs to be in a constant state of conflict. And she is - literally as soon as she solves one problem, another invariably crops up, and it becomes almost a running joke even to her. (She exclaims things like ""what now?!"", ""are you kidding me??"" and ""I hate space!"" at various points.) But this is not much different than real-life emergencies both in space and in the air, where problems can cascade and need to be solved one by one.<br/><br/>It's a clich√© to say things like ""such and such actor is a revelation!"" and it's strange to say it about someone who's been around as long as Sandra Bullock, but I confess I never respected her as an actress before this film. I still thought of her as the bubbly dullard from ""Speed"" and her other early films, but she drew me in here emotionally in a way that I was not expecting. Yes, she is strong enough now to literally carry an entire film with her acting. A little bit of her former self still comes through at times - for example, it's still cute when she swears, and I'm not sure it's meant to be in this film. But I actually appreciated those breaks in tension.<br/><br/>All that said, this is not, as some others have said, the second coming of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". In fact, I can't think of anything that really elevates this film above that of a very well-acted, very well-shot action thriller. There doesn't seem to be a larger statement or message in ""Gravity"", or any meaning to the story beyond what's literally presented on screen (unless you want to say it's a film that's against space pollution, or something). In this way, it *is* actually similar to other Hollywood movies of the present - what you see is pretty much what you get. There's nothing to really sink your teeth into beyond that.<br/><br/>You'll notice I haven't even mentioned the special effects so far - and that's because while they're impressive, they're not what makes a good film. ""2001"" was made in 1968 with plastic models and we still hold it up as the top film in the genre. No, what makes this a really good film is the acting, the tension created by the situation Dr. Stone is put in, and the execution of the directing, cinematography, sound and yes, to some extent the visual effects - in that order. I was actually generally just as impressed with the sound (and lack thereof) in this film as I was with the visuals. The realistic sound helped really put me there, although the music was a bit overbearing at times (what else is new in Hollywood?)."

","I would love to give ""gravity"" top marks, I really would. It is a genuinely unique movie. Set in space for 98 percent of its running time. Plus its special effects are amazing, and look completely jaw dropping on the big screen. It is a great flick I have to say, but one that relies on, and in some ways NEEDS its 3D effects to get by.<br/><br/>To me, 3D is still a gimmick. If you've seen one 3D movie, you've seen them all. If you haven't seen anything in 3D since ""Avatar,"" then ""Gravity"" will be a wonder to behold. Unfortianly though, i've seen a lot of 3D crap since ""Avatar."" <br/><br/>Still, the flick amazingly manages to keep its audience engrossed for an hour and a half in space. Doing this without having to resort to aliens or big fiery space ship battles. Its all about Sandra Bullocks struggle to survive in a realistic (Or at least more realistic than usual) movie version of space, and I've always had a thing for these one man shows. Especially when you find yourself genuinely rooting for this characters survival, in a creepy environment, where anything can happen.<br/><br/>So, in short, it is great.

"kurosawakira","9","6","8","15 November 2013"," A Masterclass
","This review will contain spoilers, and I really mean it. <br/><br/>Not many new films get me pumped up, at least not as many as I would like. The last time I was this eager to go to the cinema was a few years back when I was able to see B√©la Tarr's ""A torin√≥i l√≥"" (2011) and Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" (2011), both on the same day, actually. Before that perhaps David Lynch's ""Inland Empire"" (2006). I had read about Cuar√≥n's ambitions, and considering ""Children of Men"" (2006) is just as masterly as they say and wrestles with just the kind of filmic issues I'm fond of (space, length of sequences, movement of camera), why wouldn't I have been over the moon to see this?<br/><br/>But really. After this first sequence of 17 minutes I was sold, and they could have done anything, and I mean anything, after that and I still would have had the time of my life. I have seen quite a few 3D films and never felt its use was cinematically necessary, but here it's more than justified, it's integral. The movement of the camera is gut-wrenching at times, and the sense of space is achieved through the use of 3D, not through gimmicks that emphasize the technology but through subtlety, often emphasizing the naturalness of the environment. I have a list of the most uplifting and lucid film moments, and that sequence has its place there.<br/><br/>Not that the film goes downhill after that. On the contrary, it's a cinematic masterclass in entertaining and cinematically profound filmmaking, condensed in 90 minutes. The camera soars in space, becoming a third character. We become weightless. In contrast, when we finally arrive to Earth the camera stays down on the ground, only able to glance upward, unable to rise and soar as it did because of gravity. Is there a film where something so naturally mundane to us as gravity is lifted up from its everyday context and given fresh relevance?<br/><br/>I think this makes a fine companion to Al Reinert's ""For All Mankind"" (1989), a profound study of space, our insignificant yet beautifully meaningful part in this vast universe, the importance of achieving space travel, becoming acquainted with an unknown and thus fearsome yet grand and immensely breathtaking world, the feeling one might have when gazing upon the Earth as we gaze upon the moon from our planet. <br/><br/>But space has no feelings for us. If we think of space in terms of its dangers, we often describe it as hostile. But it is not hostile, nor is it friendly. Space simply is. And that sense of loneliness and terror in helplessness is also grandly present in these films, as it should be. Of those of us who have ever thought about space and what it might feel like to be there, who hasn't also thought of how it might feel like when one is adrift, alone, facing the infinite-seeming blackness with no hope of return?"

","**Spoilers**<br/><br/>Watched this movie finally yesterday after a week of trying to make it to the theaters for the 5.00 movie times. I watched it in 2D because I cant watch 3D. I didn't expect 95 percent of the movie to be in space, but it was pretty awesome it was. The visuals were amazing. The acting was good. The story line was OK. The realism was off. Of course none of us have probably been to space and have no clue how real it was, but the scene where is first losses control and spins off into space became very annoying after a minutes of her non stop freaking out. The debris every 90mins, I'm not sure if this would happen every 90mins in the exact same location plus wouldn't there be more occurrences since other equipment was destroyed along the way or was all the satellites in the same place? The fire in the ship was pretty cool but it looked like your typical 'explosion and jump' type of scene. Also the temperature changes is confusing. The last part that wasn't real to me was the fire extinguisher part to travel to the next space station. Bullock was scared the entire movie but then her life was 'whatever, lets die' then she becomes James Bond lol. The landing part was kind of cool but I just had a feeling she would land close to land which was a let down, because 70 percent of Earth is covered with water. Maybe middle of the ocean and a shark eats her would have made the movie some real! Despite all this, the other 85 percent of the movie was awesome. Very silent a lot of times, so I had to cutback on eating my skittles/bag noise lol. It did make me cry so it was very emotional at times. Go see it before its out of theaters and buy it on Blu Ray!"

","This is one of those very rare movies (like Jurassic Park) that were MADE for the BIG screen! From beginning to end, the excellent 3D effects are amazing and nearly constant. The majority of the movie is floating in space outside of the spacecraft, with a few minutes inside now and then. Things are always floating around, and there is a lot of depth and amazing views of the Earth, stars, spacecraft etc, giving you an incredible visual sense of being in space. <br/><br/>The story is pretty good, but not the perfect edge of your seat story (e.g Aliens). If you're hoping for a Clooney / Bullock romance or chemistry, it's not there. They are coworkers trying to survive. These are the reasons for losing one star, but the 3D experience in IMAX should earn it an extra 5 stars. <br/><br/>No other sci-fi movie I've ever seen has given such a realistic visual sense of being in space! If you read this review before Gravity leaves IMAX 3D theaters, go see it NOW, it's worth the extra money for IMAX to be engulfed by it!

It was more a philosophical thought incurring in a right place to invigorate the main points of the story. While, I believe, every one was immersed in how every thing could be so strange in a zero gravity, I was thoughtful about how lonely one can be whether she is among thousands of people or away from them thousands of miles. And then, it is the matter of how it all depends on yourself in either case to deal with it and pass it. These feeling started to become even more after everyone except her were dead and she was far from every thing with every single different laws of physics affecting her. In other words, that was a sense of familiar loneliness in a different context. The other part of the movie that thrilled me was when she touched the earth soil with a mellow sense of happiness in her face. It was not the soil of one particular area of the world. That would not matter. In that scale, that soil was familiar to her. That was where she belongs to without thinking of the borders, countries and people she might see. You might belong to a neighborhood, a city, a country, or a sphere depends on how you look at it."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","6","8","7 October 2013"," The most intense film experience of the year.
","Gravity is an intense, pulse-pounding, edge-of-your-seat cinematic experience. Am I forgetting any movie review clich√©s? Regardless, they all apply to this instant classic that redefines the rules for every film about space exploration that has been put to celluloid over the past 50 years. <br/><br/>Gravity is directed by Alfonso Cuaron whose previous film, Children of Men, stands among the very best films of the past decade. Much like Hitchcock's Rope, Cuaron's signature is the use of lengthy single-shot sequences. The climactic scene from Children of Men is one of the reasons the film is so memorable. Cuaron once again expertly uses this technique. <br/><br/>This time he opens the film with a 13 minute uncut scene as we follow the astronauts while they work on the exterior of the shuttle. Cuaron also seamlessly transitions as the camera slowly floats around space as we watch the astronauts, to inside Stone's helmet, to seeing everything from her perspective. The camera work and the use of CGI is pulled off so well that it really gives the illusion as if we are floating in space along with the astronauts.<br/><br/>There really isn't much to Gravity's plot. It's basically a two person Broadway play that takes place in outer space. George Clooney plays Matt Kowalski, a veteran astronaut who's completing his final space mission. Even in the depths of space and all the dangers that accompany it, Clooney plays it cool, often leisurely floating around without a care in the world like he's taking a stroll in the park.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is his polar opposite. She plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer embarking on her first space mission. Stone is quiet and understandably tense as she navigates around the outside of the space shuttle. Bullock's character seems to be wrapped in an orbit of sadness and despair. Even in the rare playful scenes between her and Kowalski, she seems sullen and her interactions with him feel forced and contrived. Soon we realize the reason for Stone's demeanor. Some will find her back-story a tad heavy-handed, but I had no problem with it.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, the astronauts are working on the outside of the space shuttle when an unexpected event sends debris hurtling towards them. From that point on, all hell breaks loose. This is where Gravity really starts to shine. Cuaron does an amazing job of immersing the viewer in the film. He captures the absolute emptiness of space with perfection.<br/><br/>Gravity also deals with interesting contrasts. One moment we feel the suffocating claustrophobia of Stone while she's in her helmet gasping for air and the next instant we are viewing the astronauts as a white speck in the vast expanses of outer space. There's also instances of deafening sound and utter silence.<br/><br/>Early in the film, there is a scene that is shot so beautifully that to try and explain it would ruin what makes it so special. The most I will say is that it symbolizes rebirth. From that moment on, Stone is determined to survive. This happens to be the main theme of Gravity: humanity's sheer animal instinct to survive at all costs.<br/><br/>Gravity also happens to be the rare film experience that actually uses 3D for the better. The use of 3D does a great job of using depth of field to separate the astronauts from the backdrop of Earth. Without giving too much away, there are numerous scenes that use 3D so perfectly I was so happy I chose to see it in this overused and often misused format.<br/><br/>The standout performance of Gravity is clearly Sandra Bullock. It's her film. She captures your attention like James Franco did recently in 127 Hours or like Tom Hanks did in Cast Away 13 years ago. Although Bullock won an Oscar for The Blind Side, her work in Gravity will go down as her best. <br/><br/>Also, film buffs with a keen ear might recognize a familiar voice as NASA's mission control. I won't spoil the surprise.<br/><br/>Gravity might be light on plot, but if you're looking for a memorable, non-stop experience, then buy a ticket to Gravity, sit back and prepare for liftoff."

","Don't get me wrong, it's not worthless, but like 'Children of Men' and unlike 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' it fails at a simple level of being convincing over it's entire length. I really don't mind when films make scientific gaffes, but this film simply changes situations that it has, itself defined when they prevent arriving at an artificial and totally improbable happy ending. <br/><br/>When one exits form a cinema and reflects on the film, one shouldn't feel cheated at a level of logic, with spectacular technical effects being used to mask the logical inconsistencies. The use of the fire extinguisher was clever, however. For some cheap temporary thrills and a glimpse into the psychology of astronauts, fine, for anything else, forget it."

"steven-boden","10","20","35","20 March 2014"," Depicts space like you've never seen it before
","Alfonso Cuar√≥n directs a masterpiece which deserves every award it is given. Yes there are flaws, like many films, but these flaws are overridden by sheer magnificence and beauty that Gravity manages to create in its depiction of space and the events that occur during a catastrophic mission.<br/><br/>To put things short and sweet, the visuals are breathtaking, the tone is perfect and the pacing is flawless. Although there are negatives, for example the lacklustre narrative along with the unconvincing dialogue, the film manages all what the audience expects to follow in the emotional journey through space. <br/><br/>The trailer instantly had me hyped for the film, it felt unique and seemed like an experience rather than a film that you'd just go to the cinema and watch, and that's exactly what it was, breathtaking and unforgettable. I was lost in the atmosphere and drama that was superbly created throughout the film. ""In space no one can hear you"" - this sums up the journey that we follow Bullock through and the isolation that the film creates and puts you into. Cuar√≥n captured the mood perfectly and had me in the eyes of Bullock to feel the situation she was in and be involved with the character's emotions from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The technical production of the film uses techniques which are new to the genre and make the experience seem like nothing you've felt before. The score is outstanding and full of impact which feeds the narrative in order to work together and create an atmosphere which feels real and has the audience isolated in its environment. The sound effects use a process like no other which have you constantly relating to the character's situation as you can literally feel what the characters do and capture the events as they happen. Drones in the score and muffled sounds in the audio all work in relation to one another to depict space in a perspective that seems to have ""impacted cinema"" and shows the scale and isolation that comes in space.<br/><br/>This entire sense of loneliness that comes with the film and suggested in the tag line is cleverly portrayed in the film's cinematography though the scenes where largely effects based. There is a definite sense of scale which the cinematography brings through the extreme wide shots and the minute long shots that suggests a lack of impact in space.<br/><br/>Lastly, as mentioned, the visual effects are just mind-blowing. Not once do the events ever feel unreal and lose the emotional sense that the film creates. They are subtle in a way where they are not regarded and talked about as effects although they take up a large part and drive the entire story. The journey is fuelled by Gravity's ground breaking special effects and was a huge influence to its overall success adding the excitement and action that everyone was looking for but had never truly discovered. The visuals and the effects show space from an angle that has no restrictions and because of this, creates a unique experience that has not been created before.<br/><br/>Overall, the film has a perfect rating from me because I can not give it an valuable or deserving faults as I was lost in an unforgettable experience that I reckon will make a big impact in the history of cinema and will last for many years to come."
"thehackzr","1","18","31","7 May 2014"," Sandra Bullock Breathing Hard: The Movie
","So, why is Gravity getting so many 1-star reviews? Because it's awful. Why is it awful? Let me sum it up for you:<br/><br/>1: The physics are wrong throughout almost the entire movie. There are so many examples that I don't know which one to use.<br/><br/>2: The plot is weak and predictable. Typical Hollywood bad situation with typical Hollywood will-to-live, topped off with typical Hollywood weak main character.<br/><br/>3: The dialogue is... oh my Lord, it's so bad. It's like it was written by a 13-year-old. Cheesy one-liners in spite of their astronaut buddy having his face annihilated almost made me turn it off immediately, but I felt that I had to finish the movie in case it got any better. Hint: it didn't.<br/><br/>4: Matt is constantly telling Ryan to conserve her oxygen... then proceeds to question her about her entire life, forcing her to talk and WASTE OXYGEN! Seriously, what the heck?<br/><br/>5: There's a Chinese man who has the most powerful radio in existence. And Ryan decides to just bark at him instead of trying to get a hold of someone who can actually help her. She tops off the... exchange? with the Chinese man by asking him to pray for her... and then for some reason mutters to nobody that nobody taught her how to pray. What's the point of that? Is it supposed to make us feel all warm and fuzzy if we do know how to pray? Is it supposed to make us feel bad for Ryan, who apparently cries without tears? I wasn't sold.<br/><br/>tl;dr: the dialogue and script are awful. Sandra Bullock has never been a great actor.<br/><br/>Now, there is only one reason why people like this movie: it looks gorgeous. Nobody can deny that. If you say you like this movie for any other reason you're just lying to yourself."
"patmcbride","2","59","119","15 October 2013"," Don't understand the hype!
","A friend described Sandra Bullock's moaning and gasping in a good portion of the film as sounding like ""bad sex."" This was just a bad movie with no realism and, really, no suspense...the whole thing just wasn't believable. How Sandra Bullock's character was not screened out of the space program due to her emotional problems caused by the sudden death of her four year old child cannot be explained. George Clooney's character was a modern day Don Juan (apparently the only role Clooney is comfortable portraying) and is about as realistic as Johnny Depp's role as Tonto in ""The Lone Ranger."" Putting ""the make"" on a fellow astronaut during a life threatening situation is only credible to Hollywood. Sadly, this kind of fluff in now de rigueur in today's world of film production!"
"dylansgabriel","1","15","25","11 May 2014"," Mission Failed
","I have no problem suspending disbelief for the events in the film, such as Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) leaping from space station to space station, or her miraculous safe landing on earth. To be honest I did not give any of it a second thought. What is inadequate, in terms of believability, is the characters of Dr. Stone and her colleague Lieutenant Matt Kowlaski (George Clooney).<br/><br/>Dr. Stone is mentally and emotionally unprepared for their mission. Anyone in such a fractured state as Stone (still mourning the death of her daughter) would never be put on a mission into space, which requires the utmost objectivity, mental precision, and focus. At one point, while Stone is floating above the earth, Kowalski asks her where her home is (he also finds out about her daughter's death.) This is beyond ludicrous. Stone and Kowlaski's training for their mission would have been long, laborous, and intimate. It is inevitable that such basic information would have come up prior to their launch. Moreover, someone as disciplined as an astronaut would never bring up the (still fresh) subject of their child's death on a mission, especially when it is going to distract/upset them. I could go on. I am not being hypercritical in the least, as clearly this is all common sense, whether the observer has knowledge of space procedures or not.<br/><br/>Clooney's character Matt Kowlaski has no personality. The dialogue between Kowlaski and Stone is vapid, asinine, and farcical. The weakness of the acting (and the characters), can be articulated in a single sentiment: any one of literally hundreds of actors could have replaced George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, and the film would have achieved the same emotional result.<br/><br/>The entire blame for the performances, of course, does not lie on the actors, nor Cuaron. Clooney and Bullock were working with a terrible script. But they must take some responsibility, since they took on the roles.<br/><br/>Whether Cuaron wrote the script or not, he is responsible for overseeing it. (Cuaron did co-write the script, with his son. But, considering its shortcomings, I do not understand why Cuaron contributed to the screenplay. He cannot write well.) Cuaron is very talented at constructing intricate, interesting camera setups. But the film's total reliance on visuals, combined with the fact that the entire thing is stitched together by a suffocating soundtrack, is Cuaron's compensation for the emptiness of the writing.<br/><br/>I am sure the film's visuals will stand the test of time, into the foreseeable future. The CGI, lighting, and sound editing, in particular, stood out. The CGI is pretty flawless. And the stupendous lighting is so convincing, so sophisticated, that after two viewings I have barely absorbed it.<br/><br/>In the final scene, after an emergency landing on an ocean shore, Sandra Bullock climbing out of the water looks like Sandra Bullock climbing out of the water. And even though she has just gone through the most mentally, emotionally, and physically tolling ordeal of her entire life, her skin doesn't have a blemish. Her glowing face makes it look like she's on an advertisement for a facial cleanser. And even looking past this, the penultimate scene of Stone stepping back onto land should have been the most powerful image of the entire film. But in fact, this was the most underwhelming visual, by far, in the movie.<br/><br/>The soundtrack could be beautiful on its own, but in the film it is, again, absolutely suffocating. And it takes the attention off the visuals, which probably should be the focus. Surely Cuaron was trying to make the film as dramatic as possible; but maybe it shouldn't have been dramatic. Why did Cuaron had to turn his space film into some Hollywood thriller? Because the visuals are so fantastic, why couldn't Cuaron have directed his efforts into another project to better serve the public; collaborating on scientific, educational space documentaries? Maybe his ego got in the way. Maybe his wallet got in the way. Maybe it's arrogance.<br/><br/>Or maybe Cuaron is simply more interested in the dramatic then the scientific. If that is the case, fine. He made a dramatic space thriller. And it was largely a failure. If he refuses to acknowledge this, he is deluding himself.<br/><br/>screenplayisles.blogspot"
"Spondonman","8","15","25","10 January 2014"," Brevity
","It's a modern ninety minute short film therefore it's probably a great film without even looking full stop. Most new films stretch out longer than their event horizon with cgi cartoonery too daft to laugh at and say less than this one's end credits. But however entertaining this might possibly be it's still as vacuous as the space that is the ... er real star - at least the ninety minutes didn't drag though.<br/><br/>Two astronauts (Buzz Clooney and Ripley Bullock, the entire cast) are tinkering around a space ship when debris from space collision causes space mayhem and serious space problems for them to get back to safety. There's some gripping and some risible moments always complemented with eye-boggling cgi; although this is a live action cartoon it looks real to me at all times ... is that partly because we all know Americans with their backs against the airlock are always as resourceful as this ... If I'd seen this with some Buddy Holly 3D specs in the cinema I might have come away seasick ‚Äì so thank the Lord I didn't! Without the 3D gimmick it's a film easier to concentrate on and criticise for its empty headed plot. And why off Earth did I keep reminiscing about Fireball XL5? I'd watch this again when it's on the telly in the future as a slot filler as no big loss.<br/><br/>But it certainly was fantastic and space-breaking work by the legions of cartoonists and technicians: it looks great, appears heavy, ends up lightweight."
"bhartman36","5","15","25","7 November 2013"," Visually stunning, with an, unfortunately, weak script
","If you go into ""Gravity"" with the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. It's a visually spectacular movie from beginning to end. I don't think there's been anything like it on screen before. Unfortunately, it suffers from weak writing, mostly towards the end.<br/><br/>Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (Clooney) are on a mission to a space station when the Russians blow up a satellite and the debris from the satellite destroys their ride home (a space shuttle) and kills the rest of their crew. The rest of the movie is about their desperate attempt to get home. More debris comes, Oxygen runs low. Things come untethered. It all gets very suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat, because there's a genuine sense that they could die up there.<br/><br/>But in the end, it doesn't pay off. The writers end up taking the easy way out, and what could've been a very powerful existential film ends up being just another feel-good movie with good visuals. Worth seeing for the visuals and the suspense, but not so much for the story."

","First, the cost. Twenty dollars to watch this IMAX video arcade game on steroids would be far better spent elsewhere. After parking your car (if you have one) and buying a small box of popcorn and a small drink, and there goes your mortgage or rent. Movies today, sadly, have little to offer except how better to inundate you with bigger and better special effects and ear drum-numbing sound tracks. Sandra Bullock does her best with the thin script, but should actually win the Academy Award for bruised knees. George Clooney tried out his comic timing again, but alas, I couldn't buy him as a NASA astronaut. The fact is, however, ANY decent Hollywood actor could have handled these roles, particularly since they're covered up from head to toe in helmets and space suits. So far, the best sci fi heroine I've seen was Signourney Weaver in the original ""Alien"" (all of the sequels were nothing but wannabees), her strong and edgy presence ringing as true as Bullock's was a rehash of ""Miss Congeniality"" in comparison. Wanna know the entire premise of the film? Two hours of dummies bouncing around a space ship on a wire. There you have it. And if you think that's a pretty slim reason for a major motion picture, rest assured, it is. I can only hope that Bullock doesn't return for Gravity Part 2-16. So, for all you kiddies who loved The Jetsons, here is some expensive rocket fuel for you‚Äî a futuristic cartoon couple flailing about in outer space. Only the Jetsons reached much deeper. A flimsy special effects pot boiler, this is one turkey that should have never left the launchpad."

"WheelzFourReelz","10","16","27","2 March 2014"," Gravity is one of the most beautiful, gripping, intense, moving, and downright satisfying movies I've ever seen.
","Have you ever seen a moment in a movie where it gives you a certain feeling inside? I like to call them ""Pixar moments"". We've all been there. We see a Pixar movie (most likely Toy Story, Toy Story 3, and every movie in-between) and we feel something. It's a combination of satisfaction, heart, and strong emotions. That's the impact that Gravity left on me, but instead of one part of the movie, it was the entire thing. This movie stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who are astronauts. They are on their normal day job when all of a sudden, lots of debris flies at them. Sandra Bullock gets separated from them and she has to find her way back to Earth. I am really bad at describing movie plots. And it's to describe this one because it is so well written and well executed that I don't want to spoil it. Not only is the plot very intense, but it's also realistic. Astronauts have to deal with this all the time and it's a scary thought when it does happen. That's also something I should bring up. This movie does a great job at keeping you on the edge of your seat. There's lots of destruction, but with the added bonus of zero gravity and no oxygen, it makes for one heck of a ride. And I like how the destruction looks and sounds. When you see the debris fly, you know that crap is about to go down. And let's not forget that in space, there is no sound, so when debris does hit everything, it's not a loud crash, but a quiet thud. It's like the sound that is made when you tap a microphone. It's very well done. The acting is well done, too. Sandra Bullock definitely stole the show. She does a great job at reacting to her surroundings and doing her scenes in general. George Clooney had a great performance, too. His character is the confident, talkative type and that really worked for this role. He even looks like an astronaut. That's a plus. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen in my entire life. The camera displays everything in a swooping motion, like the camera is in space, too. And how the scenes are set up is just amazing. I heard that every scene they had to do was choreographed so specifically. They had to know when to move and when to react to things. That added to the realistic factor and I liked it. And know it's time for the big one; the special effects. HOLY GUACA-STINKING MOLE! They are, without a doubt, the best special effects I have ever seen in my entire life. Everything looks absolutely beautiful from the stars, to the sunrise, to the Earth itself. It really feels like you, the viewer, are in space with them and that adds to the movie a lot. Overall, this movie was a masterpiece. This is one of those rare movies where while viewing, you can't think of anything you wished you would've liked changed or done differently. Gravity is in my top four favorite movies of all time (up there with the three Lord of the Rings movies). I loved this movie and I can't wait to see it again on Saturday. If you haven't seen this movie, please, please, please, watch it. This movie is amazing."

","There have been quite a few movies in the past that utilized a ""one main actor"" setup to carry a movie. From Castaway with Tom Hanks, to ""I am Legend"" with Will Smith, and Buried with Ryan Reynolds. If you notice the trend, these movies are mostly Lead by Men. All great actors carrying great movies, but where are the women? In comes Gravity. Gravity stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, but Spoiler alert... This is all Sandra Bullocks movie.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock has been great throughout her acting career with her all around charm, girl next door beauty and best friend sense of humor; but never has she embarked on a role such as this.<br/><br/>You have seen the previews by now so you know exactly what Gravity is about; a catastrophic event happens to crew of astronauts while in space. From there, it's a great ride on the edge of your seat action thriller that seems to hold you with its intense drama and ""what could go wrong"" happenings at every turn!<br/><br/>Gravity begins quickly. There is very little to the opening sequence other than a brief introductory paragraph, and then you are thrust into a beautifully constructed view of space and the earth. It is breathtaking and Space itself seems to be the true lead character of the movie. You are introduced to the characters quickly and like any great movie, you are quickly ushered into a tense situation (you know, from the commercials again). There is the necessary amount of time to establish who is who, but the movie and its short run time do not drag on with forced character development. I love a movie that doesn't give away each part of the plot in its previews; and in this one, the previews only told about the first 20 minutes of the movie! This left you in total suspense and made you eager to see what was going to happen.<br/><br/>Gravity is fairly short at just under an hour and a half. This is perfect for a movie like this. The obvious comparisons would be to Avatar, but I think this is what Avatar should have been. The pace was quick and intense and just the right length. Sandra Bullock (In my opinion) easily handles the role and makes you feel her anguish and pain throughout. This is an Oscar worthy role and performance. She took on the challenge to overcome. Not only her personal demons, but the beautiful, yet unforgiving character of space, and the force often taken for granted.... Gravity. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, a lot happens. During these multiple series of unfortunate events, you're held captive and an in awe of her resolve. She doesn't have it figured out or know what to do, and that is a good thing. She is a real person in an unreal situation. You root for her. You feel her stress, her pain, and her hurt. The caveat is the vastness of her circumstances and Ms Bullock brazenly takes on the challenges <br/><br/>The visuals of this movie are so stunning that you get tricked into the beauty of space and forget that it is a truly harsh environment. Sandra Bullock showcases her acting chops, and you get a real sense of her suffocation while in space. The grandness of the Earth is even alluring. You'll find yourself trying to guess what earthly locale you are looking at! <br/><br/>While On the surface it would seem that this is a self apocalyptic conquest of ""Sandra Bullock versus the universe"", it is so much more... But that alone is enough! I can't speak highly enough about how great Gravity looks. Sandra Bullock not being in consideration for Oscar, People's choice awards, MTV, or any other awards would be a travesty. <br/><br/>Gravity deserves to go down in the annuls of great epic movies, and worthy of two views. I can't wait for the Bluray to see the extra scenes!<br/><br/>Smush rating SMUSH - a must see!<br/><br/>S-1 SM-2 SMU-3 SMUS-4 SMUSH-5"

","3D techniques should work two ways-as I get an illusion of objects bursting from screen to hit me; the movie makers should also be able to get the illusion of viewers bursting through the screen to hit them.

Well so i have anyways tagged this review as 'spoiler'. In fact this whole movie is a spoiler. A spoiler of time and your hard earned money.<br/><br/>It is set out in space, where there is no air, no atmosphere, no gravity and of course no acting.

","For me, this is a profound film because of its simplicity in expressing that it is necessary to face oneself alone in order to experience the amazing connection that we have with each other and everything else in the universe, or life itself. Aside from the CGI, if you have experienced this facing yourself, you can't not appreciate this film.<br/><br/>Most of the negative criticism of the film has been that the story is full of clich√©s. Or that the CGI was off, or that the story is simply too simple. I remember living in Chile in 1963 and as a 15-year-old watching Fellini's 8 1/2. I nodded off. If someone had asked me then, I probably would have responded that it was boring, that I did not know what it meant. This film has something in common with Fellini, it's just more personal, and dare I say it, just as universal in its comment on being alive and human.<br/><br/>The tell here is that few comments I've read mentioned ""corny."" <br/><br/>In 1969 I was being asked to go to Vietnam. I could not do this. My father in his kindness paid $400 to retain a lawyer to advise me on what was involved in being a conscientious objector, and that was what I pursued. This involved writing an essay for the draft board to state for them why I could not do this. That experience resulted in some 17 pages from examining myself, going to the guts, spirit, soul, and was literally facing myself, looking in the mirror, and the most terrifying experience I've had in my life.<br/><br/>I am 66, have a wife, son, two grandkids. Viewed many films, read many books, experienced some stuff that might challenge anyone's imagination. But a child might know what this story is about.<br/><br/>It is not pleasant to be alone, at least for most of us, simply because we are connected with everyone and everything else. If we were not, there would be no responsibility and life would be ultimately boring.<br/><br/>I've seen films from the Angry Red Planet through 2001 to this one. I've watched the NASA videos, and so it is curious to me that some criticize the CGI.<br/><br/>The greatness of this story is that it is about you, about me. It is about what-if, and most about what now. You are there. You are going to die. What will you do with your time, whether hours or minutes, or seconds.<br/><br/>Space is a vacuum. Emptiness. I am certain that many of you have experienced this vacuum right here on the planet. What a wonderful thing that, in this story, some one of us who is a kind person with a good heart might experience the same thing and survive.

"seaview1","10","7","10","1 March 2014"," GRAVITY Soars
","Some films (Castaway, 127 Hours) have a simple premise, a basic tale of survival, devoid of large casts and complicated plot lines. Co-written with his son Jon√°s Cuar√≥n, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuar√≥n (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n) has combined state of the art technology and remarkable acting by Sandra Bullock in a spectacular, tension-filled adventure, Gravity.<br/><br/>American astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), work on repairs to the Hubble space telescope as news of a nearby Russian satellite explosion is reported. The quiet serenity is suddenly displaced by hurtling debris that decimates the repair mission and causes great damage to the telescope and more. Caught up in a life threatening disaster and stranded in space without any hope of rescue, the two must improvise and utilize survival skills to survive under impossible circumstances. As hope fades and oxygen running low, the astronauts must make difficult choices to make it home alive. <br/><br/>Caur√≥n successfully conveys the emptiness and vastness of space and how isolated it can be. What is remarkable is that this film could not have been made so convincingly until now because of recent technological developments. Even director James Cameron (Avatar), who was consulted early on, championed the film's ambitions for space realism that was years in the making. A ground breaking achievement in visual effects, not since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13 has a film so realistically depicted space travel. Even the realistic use of sound or lack of it enhances the authenticity. Great care and research obviously went into the production. <br/><br/>The film boldly starts with a continuous panning shot for thirteen minutes with nary a cut. When was the last time a major Hollywood film did that? There are some remarkable shots in space like the one instance where Bullock is in a womb-like position which acts as a metaphor of life. Gravity deserves to be seen in 3D (perhaps the best 3D film since Avatar) which opens up the magnitude of the visual effects. When did any 3D film show a person's tears? This one does. The realism and emptiness of space will be hard to match so convincingly in future films. <br/><br/>Cuar√≥n establishes a basic premise and creates a major conflict while continually upping the ante of impending danger. The suspense is palpable as we feel as if we are there with Bullock and must figure a way to first get out of harm's way and then to go home to earth. The one film this reminds you of is Marooned. <br/><br/>This is Bullock's (The Blind Side) show all the way as you feel her fears amid every threat; she is in virtually every shot. We learn to understand her feelings and get a glimpse into her past about her regrets in life. Paradoxically, space becomes a place to escape her past or prove to be her death. One major theme for her character is learning to let go whether it be a painful past memory or letting go of something in the here and now. It's about finding a reason to live and finding a deeply personal redemption under the most trying circumstances. <br/><br/>Clooney lends strong support as her veteran colleague and voice of reason who offers instructions and calm amid tragedy. You will never guess who voices mission control, but here's a hint- see Apollo 13.<br/><br/>Sure, despite convenient coincidences that facilitate some plot points and a couple situations that are a bit hard to believe, Bullock sells it with her conviction and desperation; you buy into the situation regardless even if it may be hallucination or a dream. <br/><br/>What should be noteworthy is the fact that Gravity is rated PG in an era when PG13 and R rated major releases dominate the marketplace. And it runs a lean 90 minutes. How such a simple tale of survival and hope becomes not only totally engaging but such a compelling, landmark work of cinema is the lasting legacy of Gravity."
"mikepunters","8","7","10","5 February 2014"," A story of two astronauts caught adrift of their space shuttles and only one of them survives to return miraculously back to earth
","For a lot of young people, going to space is a thing of dreams. The thought of leaving behind Mother Earth and entering the realms of the awesome celestial bodies captures our imagination like nothing else. This movie is one for such people. The realistic way the thrill of space has been captured through 3-D and animation technologies, just about outdoes our wildest flights of fancy. The movie begins with a dramatic message about the infiniteness and utter silence of life in space. The 13 minute opening shot introduces us to the astronauts Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) working with a space shuttle. They get an alert about a debris-attack and are asked to abort all operations immediately and return to the shuttle. But Dr. Stone (Sandra) takes a fraction of a minute too long to wind up, and already the swirling debris is upon them. It is not long before she is violently hurled adrift of the shuttle, and her final moments of communication with mission control (voice: Ed Harris) involved her frantically trying to relate her co-ordinates to him as the whole of Space revolved dizzyingly around her. The story develops from there, as she drifts untethered through space, and eventually after many adventures manages a miraculous return back to earth. In the process she encounters a multitude of crises, her initial sense of horror about her utter loneliness negated somewhat on gaining Kowalsky's companionship. Kowalsky revamps her spirits, and they use the thruster packs in their suits to reach the International Space Station. Somehow, by the skin of her teeth Sandra manages to cling on to the metal surface and get inside the station but in the process Clooney sacrifices himself in order to save his colleague. One can find glimpses of amazing selflessness and bravery as the final act of Kowalsky is to motivate his partner to propel a capsule to the nearby Chinese Space Station. Then, without a fuss or a goodbye the man drifts into the dark swallow of Space where he'd soon become just another piece of orbiting junk. The most stunning and symbolic visual imagery is achieved at this point when inside the safety of the oxygen-circulated chamber for the first time, Sandra sheds her astronaut's suits and she's shown swirling round suspended, surrendering herself to the whim of the planets. The complicated gravitational forces present make her rotate beautifully with the symmetry of a ballerina, as one equates the likeness of a fetus inside a womb to be symbolic of rebirth. The spirit of the movie is one ‚Äì of trying, even when there's nothing left to try for. Soon after, Stone suffers existential dilemma when inside the Chinese Space Station she realizes her capsule has no fuel. She shuts down the oxygen supply to her chamber, turns up the radio and prepares to commit a painless suicide. But just at this poet she has a delusional vision of Kowalsky returning to her shuttle and she imagines him giving her a motivating speech that ultimately makes her decide to try to make one final effort. Before she activates the escape capsule, she gives one final message to her late daughter through the dead Kowalsy that her mom is not giving up. Therefore, through the use of the latest 3D technologies, and by taking the audience on a breathtakingly vivid journey through space Cuaron tells a simple story of our journey through life, of facing all our adversities and of overcoming them. The core beauty of it lies in the exquisite visuals, in the odd moments of drifting through soundless space and watching the sun rise over the Eastern hemisphere of the globe and realizing the privilege of human existence. The conversation between two human beings detached from Earth, realizing the magnitude of their smallness in comparison to the Universe. The orchestra reaches a crescendo when the imaginary Kowalsky delivers the final portion of his monologue to Stone inside the capsule cabin: ""Ryan, it's time to go home"", and suddenly the implications of this simple phrase get magnified, as it brings home all the reasons why we should carry on with our struggle through life at all. A moment that all viewers alike can identify with. Finally, Sandra deploys the escape capsule at the critical point and it bursts through the earth's atmosphere as the voice of Life resumes again in the form of mission control's radio. The capsule spears down on a lake and catches fire as Sandra escapes through the hatch, sheds her suit underwater and breaks through the water surface to breath Earth's air once again! As producer David Heyman summed it up: ""Alfonso has given us beautiful, elegant film-making. Simple on the surface. The complexity of it challenged everybody. But none of that is visible. It's great."" True words one has to say!"

","Every once in awhile a movie comes along that reminds you to believe in possibility. 3D film was developed so that visionary filmmakers like Alfonso Cuar√≥n could make movies like Gravity. Quite simply, it is a groundbreaking, jaw-dropping experience of visual beauty and vicarious terror that leaves you breathless.<br/><br/>What I liked: This is not the transcendent wonder of Kubrick's 2001. This is a physical and visual encounter with cinema. For the record, I love 3D movies but not for the sake of it. I enjoy new ideas being translated through a relatively new facet of technology. Gravity left me feeling as though I knew what it would be like in space and that is no small feat. Cuar√≥n and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have given us a visual story that previously was beyond my imaginative scope. Just brilliant.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: As with most ground breaking films, what Cuar√≥n was trying to accomplish cinematically overshadowed character and dialogue. This is a rare exception where it's okay with me. The movie is not about Bullocks' back story. The movie is entirely in the moment and succeeds as such. Bullock and Clooney are commendable and convincing but their familiar faces within this magical moment of experiencing something new in film, for me, was almost distracting ‚Äì or a disappointing reminder that it was just a movie.<br/><br/>http://canyoutellastory.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/gravity-2013/"

"harimm777","8","7","10","26 October 2013"," Awesome movie, must be watched in 3D
","A great movie from a simple thread. To put it simply, it is the story of two astronauts Matt Kowalski and Dr. Ryan Stone facing a terrible disaster in space and how they try to tackle it. They try to work together to escape but unfortunately (SPOILER!!!) Matt (George Clooney) could not make it. One of the things that made me sad. Anyway as he says, nobody can beat his spacewalk record, for a very long time. But the perseverance and spirit of Dr. Stone helps her get back to earth in one piece, even though she seemed hopeless at times. The performance by Clooney and Sandra are remarkable.<br/><br/>Moving to the visualizations, I personally feel it must be watched in 3D. The space stations, the accidents, the flying debris, all have an enhanced viewing experience when viewed in 3D. The sequence when the Chinese escape pod re-enters the atmosphere is absolutely stunning. The final stage if the movie from where Sandra commands the escape pod to the end where she safely reaches solid land is breathtaking. Shortly a must watch."

Although everything is special effects, it nevertheless looks realistic. Sandra Bullock has done a fabulous job as Dr. Stone. She makes the audience feel the emotions of a lone survivor. The best part of the movie is the screen play- it is very engaging with no unnecessary scenes or fillers. Even the scene where Clooney comes back in her dreams and gives her the idea of using soft landing for launching the pod, the dialogues are carefully worded. Aningaaq, the man with whom Dr. Stone talks over the short wave radio is a fantastic touch. George Clooney's role, although short, is refreshing. Thankfully he doesn't come back alive- it might have ruined the plot. Brilliant watch!"

","Let's be honest. The movie theater is filled with remakes and sequels and ideas that are more or less redone to death. Even the dozen trailers I saw before watching gravity had at least 3-4 movies that were clearly remakes.<br/><br/>Gravity is a movie that you see if at the very least to take advantage of 3D technology which fits very few movies. This is one of them. The visual effects and 3D are some of the best ever. The movie doesn't use 3D quite as good as Avatar, but it definitely holds it own. You believe you are with the characters and at some points you feel like you are actually in outer space.<br/><br/>The movie is short by modern standards but it feels like the perfect length. You aren't wishing the movie last longer but don't feel like you are short-changed.<br/><br/>The sound is great and if you can find a premium sound system like Regal RPX 3D, then you are in for an epic ride.<br/><br/>The acting is great and Sandra Bullock definitely deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>While people want to mention about the physics errors and flaws in the movie, I say it only shows how great everything else is about this movie. It is like arguing why Godfather is bad because Michael Corleone shouldn't look so handsome being a war hero and all.<br/><br/>Overall, see this movie while it is in theaters and in 3D.

"billygoat1071","10","28","53","4 October 2013"," Grand Elevation
","Gravity doesn't seem like a big epic film like what most Sci-Fi pictures are treated today. The concept is quite simple, but despite of being simple, it's surprisingly more of a rewarding experience than you would expect. The real idea of the film is to portray how nature can bring both wonder and danger within the universe. The movie takes place in space, but there's definitely no alien twists to consider, because gravity and physics themselves are already their enemy, and all you have to do is to take its ride like you've never seen space before. The genius of the film is just being simple, but what's extraordinary is how it elevates the use of CGI and a direction giving us a good amount of suspense we need for a space thriller. Gravity is a cinematic experience that anyone shouldn't miss.<br/><br/>The plot is indeed straightforward, in spite of some scenes when the astronauts' are talking about their personal lives. The rest is all amazingly put together set pieces where danger can happen anytime and anywhere; it can be a struggle by the difficult movement in space, satellite debris destroying anything that passes, or just losing oxygen. Watching these characters trying survive the disaster going on is technically the only plot here, and how the film realized these incidents is astounding. I think the most memorable feat is whenever a soundless destruction occurs as the music score's beat replaces the clash. But really, most of the time is built in tension, and while everything is supposed to look terrifying, it also looks quite spectacular.<br/><br/>But it's not always about the the terror, the film is already remarkably stunning, with the marvelous perspectives that the camera picks. Most of its shots linger as it flies around from people to people and place to place, and it rarely shifts angles until it actually needed to. This brilliant camera-work makes you feel like you're part of the ride, which is pretty obvious for a film like this. Big budgeted CGI is usually used for blockbusters to impress the audience how cool the movie looks, but this is one of those that is able to be both cool, and electrifying. Looking at planet Earth is indeed a breathtaking view that may give you goosebumps, until an equally spellbinding peril happens up there. It, of course, had some human elements, but it works better in the exhaustion and longing of the characters' situation than the drama they make about their backstories. The performances makes it all easy to relate, if not nuanced. This is, most of the time, Sandra Bullock's show, and she controls the role decently. And George Clooney is always likable in any of his scenes.<br/><br/>Gravity is a magnificent achievement. It can also be an alternative to the genre in a while since Sci-Fi is recently (or has always been) taken over by epics with aliens and giant robots or whatever, but never forget what's scarier than those myths, simply just how force of nature works. This review probably sounds too hyperbolic that some might expand their expectations. One thing people should know about Gravity is it's a very simple film with a very simple story and concept, but by Alfonso Cuar√≥n's strong ambition, all of its elements are perfectly fit together. As a result, an experience that may stuck in your memory for a long time. Gravity is easily one of the best films of the year, and again it should be seen in theaters, either 3D or not."
"quanta67","1","38","75","10 December 2013"," What a load of old *&¬£$@! ass!
","What a load of codswhallop. I waited for months to see this movie and was swept along by all of the rave reviews. 10 minutes in and I had already counted more preposterous flaws and scientific absurdities than I was any longer able to keep track of. The acting is wooden, one dimensional and utterly juvenile. Bullock is an emotional and physical wreck almost from the first instant, she is technically inept, sullen and devoid of professionalism, or any very redeeming qualities whatsoever. She is nothing at all that you would expect of an astronaut. She doesn't so much just not have the right stuff, rather she appears to have no ""stuff"" whatsoever. In fact one could say her performance was such a 'howler' so to speak, that there are junctures in the movie where it becomes utterly comedic. To make things worse strong comparisons can be drawn between Clooney's character and Toy Story's Buzz Lightyear, the only difference in this case being that Buzz produces a much more convincing, likable and 'less plastic' performance than Clooney. If you like big ass old CGI induced explosions, vacuous performances and sci-fi movies that are utterly devoid of any of the ""sci"" component at all, then this is undoubtedly the movie for you. In space it seems, no one can see you create drivel.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that with the utterly inexplicable high reviews and rave ratings this movie has received, Hollywood will only continue to pump out more dross like this and in so doing will only continue to contribute to the dumbing down of science among the general public overall.<br/><br/>Basically if you like bad comic books, never progressed beyond junior level science (and did pretty badly in this), like huge pointless CGI explosions, enjoy 2D, juvenile, uninspirational characters, backed up by clueless, uninspirational acting and juvenile one dimensional dialogue (even though they use 3D special effects to no meaningful purpose, beyond a pointless visual spectacle for the spectacularly uniformed ), then this is exactly the movie for you! For those with even a modicum of scientific background, intelligence and taste, I suggest you do a search on Google for ""all the bad science in Gravity the Movie"".<br/><br/>I used to trust IMDb ratings. But that's twice in a row now I have duped into watching movies with off the scale IMDb ratings (the other being Prisoners), where plot-line, acting and everything about the movie was so abysmally bad, it almost beggared belief.<br/><br/>There must just be an awful lot of non-scientists out there. Cluelessness abounds ..."

","One use of science fiction is to purify the threads of a story by displacing them from the distracting familiar. This gives more than clarity; it often frees the narrative to rest in our souls rather than our eyes, rather like the contra-intuitive dynamics about orbital mechanics. If you speed up, you go slower.<br/><br/>This story is distilled. There is no villain, no love dance. We have only three characters. As with many films, the inner crisis of our central character is impossible to film, so we fold it onto an external, visualizable phenomenon but here it is also pure, austere. It allows the story to be independent from genre. So when a saucy astronaut uses a line from Star Wars, we make the connection through real life instead of film-to-film. Of course that guy would say such a thing. When the lost guy, usually the hero, miraculously appears well after we have forgotten him, we have no doubt that this film will not follow the usual trajectory of him saving the 'girl.'<br/><br/>So this worked for me, worked in a far better and deeper way than the actress could know. She delivered a simple skeleton: broken woman recommits to life. Perhaps this is something she knows. This viewer embossed his own narratives, and became totally committed himself. The filmmaker understood how to help this, so he creates polar environments. One is celestial and in being full is empty. No sound. No passion.<br/><br/>The other is physical environments we only see when purged of the living, but very heavily populated by the artifacts of life. Photos of course, but the power is in the everyday: a dental retainer, mementos from the astronauts' families, ordinary trash. These tell us more about the background humanity than we could have gotten from a few actors trying to collectively deliver the sense of the race.<br/><br/>So we can readily put ourselves here. We can readily engage with the notion of needing to fall out of mourning and into commitment. We have something close to a literal birth at the end. These things are very difficult to end well and even here the filmmaker makes good choices.<br/><br/>I like that it is entirely cinematic. If we need a fire extinguisher, then earlier we were given in offhandedly. If we need the noir notion of the innocent randomly challenged, we are given it visually ‚Äî paralleled by the random loss of a child 'for no reason.' If we need the requisite three visual ouroboro, we are given some rather powerful images: the ten minute meditation at the beginning; a lovely, sustained triumphant fetal position on the first accomplishment; a profound fireworks which includes the capsule containing by this time ourselves.<br/><br/>We do have precedent. 2001 was a tryst with God through weakness; Solyaris is not Tarkovksy's greatest achievement, but it may have been his most ambitious vision of introspection. The Solaris remake (with George Clooney!) was technically better but with less ambiguous reality. Sunshine was more ambitious than any of them in this regard of inner/outer, but included some 'action' stuff for better or worse.<br/><br/>(Try editing that film in your mind.)<br/><br/>I saw this in 3D and am profoundly thankful. I never noticed a gratuitous effect, and only once was reminded of the cheap glasses on my nose: when a tear floated close and was snapped into focus. That said...<br/><br/>I have written in these comments many times about the evolution of the camera. I believe we are in a state of accelerated evolution in how cameras are used and consequently how we dream ‚Äî when we dream semi-lucidly. The camera used to be and move where a man could. Then we got dynamisms in the curious and ironic eye. Then we got the sailing and noir camera. They did extraordinary things but never something that a physical camera could not do.<br/><br/>Pixar changed this with stances and motion tropes not possible with physical cameras, and we embraced it. Now you can find this in mundane action movies like Transformers. How to innovate? Cuar√≥n does what I think nearly impossible: he gives the supernatural camera eye a curious passion. Where someone else would draw in to display some detail, he withdraws into context. Where another may feign 'realism' he embraces the unreal vision of nature. Where a camera would be expected to be sympathetic, his is cold and vice versa. I feel like I trusted this man with my life and would do so again.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","I wonder what percentage of the budget was spent on reviews? Going off the glowing reviews I see here, my guess is that Rent-A-Review have been working overtime again. In fact, I think this is the most blatant case of review fixing I think I have ever seen! <br/><br/>I could possibly understand people being impressed by the CGI and maybe giving it a 5/10 based on that but anything more than 5/10 is ridiculous and an insult to anyone with an IQ greater than that of a gherkin! <br/><br/>I was contemplating giving the movie just 1/10 but the effects were quite good. I had even considered giving it 3 or maybe 4 out of 10 (based on the effects) but special effects don't make a movie, at least not for me, and all the special effects in the world won't change the fact that this movie is crap! <br/><br/>I recently watched a time-lapse video of the earth, taken from the International Space Station, and I can categorically state, hand on heart, that the video from the ISS was far more entertaining than this pathetic offering.<br/><br/>It's a sad day when this sorry excuse for a movie ranks higher than Blade Runner, which is arguably the best sci-fi movie of all time!

","Gravity was a very unique and original movie and because it was also executed incredibly well, it was a great movie and deserves much of the praise it has received. The special effects, cinematography, perfect amount of first-person angles, sound, and lack of development all create a certain sense of unknown and suspense that keep you on the edge of your seat almost from the beginning. The acting, essentially Sandra Bullock, is also very good, albeit slightly overrated. While it isn't the movie of the year in my opinion, it is still an exceptional film and one of the few movies I've ever seen that I felt like 3D added something rather than taking something away."

","Father and son team Alfonso Cuar√≥n and Jon√°s Cuar√≥n wrote the screenplay (with assistance from George Clooney) and Alfonso Cuar√≥n directed (with capable assistance from director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki) what is likely to go down in cinematic history as a shining moment of the art of the craft. It manages to tell an impossibly simple story about surviving and not surviving astronauts out in space and makes the emotions so complex that the audience is left speechless. It is a staggering achievement.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. How eventually Stone manipulates the fragments of international spacecraft in her attempt to live is profoundly touching and extraordinarily touching.<br/><br/>Both Bullock and Clooney offer portraits not only of the characters they portray but also the hopes and fears of us all if ever faced with surviving the impossible. This is a film that must be seen to understand and appreciate the little miracle Alfonso Cuar√≥n has created."

","Gravity.<br/><br/>I saw it on the fourth week it has been out, and I have only seen one trailer on TV for it,and it was intriguing, but like among most people, I didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>When I saw that George Clooney was in the trailers, I was like: ""Oh, he must be the leader of the team who comes up and rescues her."" Boy was I wrong! Jezus..this movie.. 18 hours later and i am still hyped up about this.<br/><br/>And please, if you get the chance, SEE IT IN THE IMAX Holy crap I was blown away. The very first scene that showed ""GRAVITY"" and these low tone sounds got extremely loud and deafening and then BOOM... completely silent shot of the earth. Freaking amazing.<br/><br/>SPOILER! I was really scared when George Clooney came back during that one scene. One of those ""coincidental"" happening that making this movie a happy ending was not going to help the ratings at all.<br/><br/>The one thing that kinda sucks about this movie is that you won't get near the awesome experience that you would get in the movie theater, let alone at the IMAX.<br/><br/>I am definitely gonna see this at least 2 more time in theaters. And of course, blu ray it in the future."
"jeremyglick","9","8","12","17 October 2013"," Worthy technical landmark
","Gravity joins the lineup of noteworthy films that have skated by with a thin story on their way to showcasing technical brilliance, and I'd put it in the pantheon with Avatar, Russian Ark, Star Wars, Citizen Kane, Rope, The Thief of Bagdad, and The Jazz Singer. Like Avatar, you will need 3D & IMAX to experience the full effect. Unlike Avatar, Gravity contains substance you'll be able to appreciate on any screen.<br/><br/>Much as been made about the technical accuracy (or lack thereof), mostly by the pedantic types who would argue that Mary Poppins really couldn't fly because the umbrella technology wasn't there yet. While I pity them for failing to enjoy this film for what it is (and wonder what they really do enjoy), I do have to concede they have a point. To illustrate I must discuss a key plot point, and insist you to read no further until you've seen the film.<br/><br/>************************ SPOILERS BEGIN *****************************<br/><br/>Several people have ridiculed the use of the ""mysterious force"" that wound up pulling Kowalski away from Stone. Of course the screenwriters didn't invent a mysterious force, they just wanted Kowalski to make a sacrifice, wanted a final moment between the two, and thought that was the best way to execute it. While watching I politely suspended my disbelief so I could enjoy the film, but it struck me later how they could have done it better.<br/><br/>Imagine instead they are still tethered together when Stone catches her foot in the parachute lines. Kowalski is floating past and sees the tenuous hold she has. Close-up of his face, close-up of Stone's foot.<br/><br/>""I'm going to pull you off,"" he concludes, and he begins to unbuckle the tether.<br/><br/>""What are you doing?!"" Stone asks.<br/><br/>""When this goes taut, I'll pull you off,"" he explains as he floats past her, just seconds left now.<br/><br/>""No,"" she insists, ""it'll hold, don't!"" <br/><br/>""I can't take that chance,"" he explains, and he unbuckles. We'll never know if his theory was right, but his sacrifice is all the nobler because of it. You can still have the tense moment, you can still have their conversation as he floats away, and you haven't violated any laws of physics.<br/><br/>So it could have been done better. But it remains important not to be one of the pedantic types. Case in point is the scene where Kowalski returns to the Soviet capsule. My thoughts during that scene were ""could that really be him? ... she can't survive that decompression. this is a hallucination ... is this a hallucination? could he be back? ... yeah, i knew it was a hallucination."" It is an emotional journey the filmmakers want you to take part in, and one you can't enjoy if you spend the whole time rolling your eyes, only to later come out feeling like an idiot.<br/><br/>So relax, Francis, sit back and enjoy a cinematic moment comparable to when people heard their first THX sounder, or the debut of CinemaScope, or when Dorothy opened a door to a world of color. You can't go back to France in 1895 to experience the thrill of L'arriv√©e d'un train √† La Ciotat and wonder if the train was going to run you over. But Gravity may be the next best thing."

","If this is the first review you have read about this movie, please stop reading any further! Don't read any other reviews at all. Go into the theatre without knowing what happens. You'll enjoy it much more. It's not a predictable movie, so the surprise factor will be lost.<br/><br/>Having started with that warning, let me get to it. This film blew me away. I left the theatre wondering whether I had just watched the best movie of all time. Almost 45,000 IMDb users have voted on this movie, and I agree with their collective wisdom this time. I'll give it a 9 for now, but I may raise my score to 10.<br/><br/>We have reached the point where filmmakers can show us anything on the screen. Here this artistry is not wasted on trivials (eg superheroes, huge robots or monsters), but on the majesty of space, the beauty of our planet, and the wizardry of our technology up there.<br/><br/>This is a little like watching a genuine IMAX film about space ‚Äì but one that is actually gripping and not a bore. This is an action film par excellence, not a soporific documentary. There is not much dialogue. The plot is uncomplicated, and yet full of surprises. This film has you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>At the same time, it felt completely realistic, although I understand some purists are pointing out the scientific mistakes. (Who really cares about that? It's a movie, for chrissakes.) <br/><br/>The director (Alfonso Cuaron) essentially tells us the story of a huge space disaster devastating all of Earth's space infrastructure. We are shown the enormity of the disaster, with our glorious planet as the constant backdrop. The director also succeeds in making it the personal survival story of a woman caught up in this disaster.<br/><br/>Bullock plays a remarkable character (Ryan Stone) who leaves you gasping at what is happening to her, both physically and emotionally. Space is a metaphor representing a beautiful but brutal and uncaring universe. Space is not her element, as it is for Kowalski (George Clooney). In this situation we long for the calm demeanor and competence of a Kowalski, but even he can't survive this one. <br/><br/>She soon realises that she is on her own and no one is going to rescue her. (Surely, an important lesson to be learned?) We are alone with her in the middle of one of the greatest trials any human being could ever face. This ordeal is shown in bone-crunching detail. Physically, she is strong as hell. Emotionally, however, the situation has her swinging wildly back and forth, from idiot to competent, from victim to survivor, from despair to euphoria.<br/><br/>The realisation that ""shit happens, so deal with it"" is a profound one ‚Äî a moment of rebirth. Most of us never truly get it. Our only choice really is how we deal with that fact.<br/><br/>I'd go see this movie."

","In Hong Kong, the promotion of this film stated that various film critics given this film very high score, I just saw the empire magazine and it was given 5 stars (the highest). So, I was excited to go to see this film in IMAX 3D, on a Monday night show. The story is straight forward, it's an episode film to me, meaning there is only one main thing happen throughout the movie, and the director's job is to guide you through it with all the abilities he/ she can, and let you feel that it's happening to you and you are right at the center of it....and this movie done it, perfectly. From the opening to the ending scene; you are immersed into the events happen to the main character. With spectacular and stunning view of the earth and the space, you are so absorbed into it and feels like you are at space with them. I won't go into details but the story is solid and the acting from both Clooney and Bullock is good. But this is basically a one man (or should I say woman) show, as most of the time you can only see Sandra Bullock on the screen, so it puts lots of stress onto the actress, because the success of the film solely depend on her; but she did a beautiful job. One more thing, I think that this story is visually stunning, but at the same time it told about the importance of courage, to live on no matter how desperate you think you are. Because help may come from places you never expected. P.S remember to watch it in 3D!! As big as a screen you can find!"

I felt as if I was right there with Bullock, going through everything that she was going through.

I'm not an astronaut or scientist so I can't comment on how accurate the depiction of space was but I sure did appreciate the visuals.<br/><br/>I was hooked, I was scared, I cried, I laughed and I questioned what I could do to make my life better. This is the effect watching this film had on me. Alfonso Cuar√≥n doesn't just direct movies. He creates art, like a painting. And any good painting incites emotion.

"alex-rj-hermes","9","14","24","6 February 2014"," Regardless of physics laws broken Gravity pulls you in, start to finish. A must watch.
","Firstly I would like to illuminate the vastness and incredible wonderment that is our galaxy. Our Milky Way, is spinning at an amazingly fast rate of 225 kilometers per second. In addition to this, the galaxy is traveling through space at around 300 kilometers per second. This basically means that we are rocketing along at speeds of 530 kilometers per second.. Annually our big old smiley moon moves further from us here on earth by 3.8cm. This is believed to be a result of tidal effects. The energy in the sunlight we see at present came all the way from the Sun's core around 30,000 years ago. This energy spent the vast majority of this time passing through the thick atoms of the sun and only a mere 8 minutes to reach the earth's atmosphere once it had left that fiery ball of fury we call the Sun. Crazy I know, But as Jesse Pinkman of Breaking Bad famously said ""Science bi%#!"".<br/><br/>Feeling small? Well Gravity initially instills this same feeling and then so much more. Gravity is a wild space roller coaster action film surrounding a major catastrophe caused by space debris colliding with a US satellite and the team left fighting for their lives and the impossible contingency to make it back home safely to earth. And yes whilst many of the physics laws are bent to suit, aesthetically and as a narrative this film is completely worthy of all praises.<br/><br/>Let's start with the casting, with so much resting on Sandra Bullock I will admit I was certainly a skeptic, however I could not fault her performance once you looked past her rather uninspiring career with some terrible ""zone out"" and ""how were they ever funded"" sequels and original films such as Speed 2 (one of the lowest rated films on IMDb scoring 3.6/10), Miss Congeniality 2, The Proposal, 2 Weeks Notice, Premonition and Forces of Nature. It was almost enough to make Steven Segal look good, almost. It was for this exact reason I didn't see this in cinemas and am now of course kicking myself harder then Guy Ritchie for both marrying Madonna and helping her make a movie. I digress, Sandra Bullock who plays a hardware engineer encapsulates the character in every aspect and the emphatic feelings are well drawn for her character as you are taken along for the ride with her. Whilst her character realistically would most probably never have been hired by NASA she as a character pulls on the heart strings and makes your heart ache for all she has and will go through. In short I am thrilled Angelina Jolie dropped this role. Mission commander Matt Kowalski played by the sterling silver fox George Clooney (who received the role after Robert Downey Jr pulled out with scheduling conflicts) was perfect for the role and somehow took the geek factor out of the profession and brought a charm, energy and cowboy style to the role and hit the nail head on. He makes it look good and romances space with an impeccable delivery and my only wish was that more was told about his character.<br/><br/>The cinematography which of course is vastly computer generated animation took 4 years for the directors to be happy with and it certainly was worth the wait. Looking down at the looming earth you feel like you are right there and every bump, jump and spin of the astronauts is shared with the audience. The action sequences are epic and the force and pressure are very well designed to give the feeling of complete helplessness in space, where nobody can hear you scream... (Terrible?) The films tag line ""Don't let go"" is fully incorporated in a visually stunning film which will surely educate and inspire future film greatness.<br/><br/>Watch this movie preferably on the biggest sharpest screen with the best audio possible, Fasten your seat belt, cause planet Earth is going bye bye. I give Gravity 8.9 out of 10."

","I saw ""Gravity"" on opening weekend, and was so overwhelmed by the visuals that I went a second time on the same weekend to absorb the rest of the film once the novelty of the visuals had worn off. I wish I had posted my comments then, because now that it's become a phenomenon, my review is just so much white noise, and to those who are determined to hate ""Gravity"" because it's so popular, I'll be easy to dismiss as just one more lemming.<br/><br/>But I did love ""Gravity."" I thought it was an absolutely beautiful movie, a story about loss, grief and rekindled hope disguised as a simple space survival story. It affected me very deeply and moved me to tears a few times, sometimes through the strength of its message, sometimes through the wonderful performance of Sandra Bullock, and at other times from the sheer visual beauty of the film. I can understand why others wouldn't be moved by the film (one of the things I love most about cinema is the subjective reactions audiences have to it), but I can't believe that anyone who purports to love movies won't at least acknowledge the sheer technical filmmaking mastery on display in this movie.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron has vaulted to the top of my list of favorite directors on the strength of this and ""Children of Men,"" another of his films that slugged me with an emotional punch to the gut. He's the rare director who can make us marvel at the technical achievements he's putting up on the screen even while he's touching us deeply with an emotional connection. In that way, he's a much less maudlin and sentimental version of Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>I'm almost disappointed that ""Gravity"" has become so popular, because it's the kind of movie I responded very personally to, and now it's going to be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and all we'll hear about between now and February of 2014 is how it doesn't deserve all of its acclaim.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"jrwilson7","10","9","14","26 October 2013"," Cameron is correct, the best space film of all time
","I have been waiting for this movie for years, yet I did not know that GRAVITY would be the film that re birthed my passion and love for the art and craft of film-making. I never knew that the simple premise of two stranded astronauts in space would bring about such exuberant and elated exclamations of absolute astonishment. Yet, from the moment I saw the most perfect image of the earth in the opening sequence of this film, I knew I was witnessing something special, something unique and something that would be seen as a pinnacle of the future of cinema ‚Äì a film that historians would look back too as the genesis of the new age of film. Yes, it is that good. But let me tell you why. Alfonso Cauron does something not seen in film, that I can recall, ever. With the use of the 3D format, remarkable cinematography and the films unyielding soundtrack, he delicately and sneakily submerges us into the film with each slow tracking shot and close-up. It's not until the first 10 minutes has passed that you realise that this has occurred all in one sweeping, continuous shot. Yet so much has happened in it, so much detail and movement that you need to blink away the awe. It makes you feel weightless; like you are floating in the scene with Sandra and George. The 3D is often the winner throughout this film and adds the ""experience"" that its supposed to offer you. This is 3D at its best, miles ahead of Avatar and appreciatingly used to advance the films narrative like Hugo. Films with minimal or singular characters have been done before, some successfully, some not so. To take on a film of this kind takes courage and a belief in the director's vision and faith in the writers story. Most recently ‚Äì and successfully ‚Äì the films Moon and Buried have centred on a plot of single characters to create a tense and meaningful story. Gravity relies on the fact that being lost in space, is second only to being lost at sea and both are equally frightening. Being adrift in the vastness of space is a hauntingly terrifying prospect considering the chances of being rescued are nil. And it is this image that replays over and over again; a solitary figure clad in white, untethered from the umbilical of safety, adrift against a blanket of black. It's frightening. I do not want to give away too much of the story. I would encourage you to remain impartial, don't go in with expectations and try not to read anything about how the plot of the story is revealed, slow take by slow take, but I will say that this is a well-crafted and executed idea. This is a story of triumph at its heart, a woman, and a strong (often flawed one) woman at that, overcomes the impossible when the easier option was to simply give up. The imagery is stark and brutally honest with cinematography that is fluid and beautiful. The majesty of the earth as the films backdrop provides awe and wonder, never getting in the way of the details or the characters. There are moments in this film where I found myself mesmerised by the action, often in the slow-motion of weightlessness, debris from a disintegrating space-station flies around the screen and into the audience at what feels like rapid motion, but is actually much slower. So much is said in the stillness and silence of the images presented on the screen. One moment I will mention is when Ryan (Sandra Bullock) enters the space station after breathing carbon monoxide for at least 5 minutes. The instant she is within the air lock and able to breathe oxygen she passes out in zero-gravity, spinning gently as if she was a foetus in the womb. It is stunning imagery like this that makes Gravity a beautiful film to watch. The other masterstroke of this film is the soundtrack and sound effects. Finally a film that does not shy away from the reality that in space no one can hear anything. To see exploding space stations, and space shuttles, without the sound of the explosion, all shown in the silence of space is truly a remarkable experience in itself. To think, we have been saturated with this unreal concept that anything that blows up in space does so as it would earth ‚Äì loud and at normal speed, then when we see it how it really is, it is simply frightening. To see someone escape wayward debris that is travelling with no sound and in the weightless ness of zero-gravity, combined with the loud, thrilling operatic music that saturates the audience, you are not on the edge of your seat, but on the floor peeping through your fingers trying to swallow your heart. Gravity succeeds where so many films fail. It is simple. The script is easy. The story is basic and, but the way it is presented is astonishing."

I agree I am late in reviewing this cinematic brilliance and probably more than half of the people who follow my Posts would have already watched the movie by now, and I am really sorry but I had other important things to do in Life, in the last 2 weeks!! Gravity is undeniably the best Space movie made at least after Aliens from the 90s. This movie literally transports you to space in every cinematic way possible. The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if the Movie was actually shot in Space. The storyline which is actually a Space documentary becomes incredibly interesting purely because of the realism through IMAX 3D, the anticipation and suspense the director succeeds to build in every scene, and the great acting by the Hollywood veterans Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and I am sure they already have one of their hands on the Oscar trophy for the next Year!!<br/><br/>I would just say that the Movie is a visual masterpiece. Yes I know everything you see on the screen is Fake and has been artificially designed through the CGI, but it never feels artificial and that's primarily because it has been completely shot in Spectacular3D. With 3D, you feel the depth of the Space and experience the movie as though you're right up there!! Please do not miss to watch Gravity in IMAX 3D (and not the regular 3D!!) and pray that you never get lost in Space, and if ever you do, then at least pray that the Satellites don't crash throwing debris towards you and if they do, then pray that the Space Stations are made Fire proof, and that the controls and manuals are printed in English, and if you are lucky till here, then pray that you land on the Land and not in the Water!! The movie deserves 8/10 from me, primarily because that was the closest I could ever get to a Space Craft, the Space Station, and the Space itself and not to mention the fear of being lost with no one around for 'light-years' far and not just miles!!"

The best 3D effects I have ever seen, and I am urging EVERYONE I speak to, that if you have even the slightest interest in this movie, anything short of a 3D cinema experience will diminish it too greatly to excuse! You MUST go see this movie in the theater! Trying to watch it at home will ROB YOU OF THE BEST THRILL RIDE OF YOUR LIFE!

I really liked it, there are a couple of mistakes... like most astronauts get to know one another pretty darn well before space flight and walk.

I mean what was the point of me buying recliners for my entire family when you just had to make us sit on the edge of our seats most of the time? How many months were you in space with Tim to know how to make the viewers experience extreme thrills? I hadn't imagined the risks of being an astronaut who needs to repair satellite systems in space, until I watched your movie. I'm actually short of words to express the amazing visuals you've put up behind the characters. It almost seems a billion-dollar project accounting in what NASA must've spent to help you make a film out there¬Ö 'Gravity' is next to the real experience of being an astronaut which will literally take your breath away! It's a brave new height of quality created by an artist who apart from doing all the research, seems to have probably fantasized of being in outer space a lot. Normally when people watch effects taking place in a scene, they can probably figure out what could really be happening, like ropes, computer graphics, chrome screen, etc. you know. But you'll be so lost in the magnifique of the relative background that the next thing you know you'll be catching your breath after the scene's already happened and you won't have time to think of anything else in the world later. It won't give you goosebumps or the chills in your spine but the intensity of the 'silence' itself will reach out to grab you like you really have to be there and then at the same time you're gonna experience ""A hell of a ride"". Not to mention the music is a tool in this movie that's going to affect your shock for worse! If you know how many categories of academy awards are there, let's just say that I won't be surprised if these guys sweep out half of them. Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Tim Webber, Emmanuel Lubezki, Steven Price, you guys have my standing ovation."

","Gravity is the best film I have seen in my life.Right from the opening act, where Clooney's space walking Kowalsky & Bullock's Stone admire the beauty of the Earth from the silence of the space till the final act(I don't want to give it out), this film is an achievement of the highest order. In fact, Gravity is one of those rarest of rare cases, where Cinema takes the form of Art. Not since Avatar or more recently Ang Lee in his Life of Pi, has anyone used 3D so brilliantly that it actually transcends the dimensions of ""make believe"". The music score by Steven Price are to give you goosebumps. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography seamlessly captures the effects & the emotions on the faces of the actors & the results are the best seen in a long long time.Clooney as usual is at his cool avatar but its Bullock who is the star of Gravity. As the lonely mother who has lost her child untimely, & a first timer in space, another catastrophe is too much for her to handle, and Bullock is just brilliant in that. This is where the father son(Jonas Cuaron, what a talented guy!!) screenwriter duo step in. The journey from drifting in space with no one to help you out,hear you out to back home on earth is so masterfully crafted that yes you start rooting for them. But Gravity's ultimate brilliance lies in the fact that while we do root for our space walker/worker duo to come back home,we also think that such a glorious death might just also be just fine.But eventually do they both get back in one piece? Gravity, talks about survival, human willpower & hope like no other film since Danny Boyle's criminally under appreciated 127 Hours. Neil Armstrong had famously said after landing on the moon ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"". Such a thing happens here in Gravity also albeit in a metaphorical manner. I have rated 10/10 stars for Alfanso Cuaron's Gravity. But how do you count the stars in space?? Mr Cuaron...this film of yours is for the history books."
"svizoman","2","39","79","1 January 2014"," bad movie, neglecting the reality
","I can't understand why such a huge popularity when this movie has little to do with the reality. There are many wrongs, let me just count few: -ISS orbits Earth in 45min, so debris at the same orbital hight could not hit it every 90 min. -Hubble telescope and ISS are not on the same altitude and do not have same velocity. Transffering yourself form on position to another takes a space vehicle and advanced planing. -debris traveling at speed of 10 times more than a bullet could not been see. -astronauts can't take off a space suite. They need to spent up to 3 hours in decompression chamber since they breathe pure oxygen at partial pressure, while on ISS there is an air mixture much like on Earth but at a bit lower pressure than on Earth. Also taking a space suite off after decompression is a 3 man job and it take much more than a few seconds and under the suite you wear cooling suite and an adult diaper. -There is no way to operate Chinese space module if you are not familiar with it. -I also doubt that Sandra could be an astronaut since she shows claustrophobia and she makes stupid screams like she's having an intense orgasm. -Chinese station would not fell on Earth by itself. Someone will need to slow down the object to lose altitude and finally enters the Eart's atmosphere. -Durring the atmospheric reentry you feel a strong force of braking, so the object wouldn't just float."

"Kaisa77","10","55","116","11 September 2013"," A masterpiece
","I had a chance to see Gravity at TIFF last Monday. Now, English isn't my first language and I've never felt secure enough to write on IMDb, but I decided to step out of my comfort zone for Gravity. The reason is twofold: First, I've always been very grateful to those few, who watch a movie before the others and provide helpful reviews - now I can try to do the same. Second, I absolutely loved the movie and although I spoke about it to everyone who would listen, I feel like I need a bigger portal to express my overwhelming emotions.<br/><br/>This review contains some minor and major spoilers, so read on at your own risk. FYI: I wasn't able to hide them, but the paragraphs containing major spoilers were clearly marked. <br/><br/>Gravity is a visually stunning masterpiece that got me engaged and interested from the very first minutes. It builds up at a perfect pace - we get to know the characters and the mission, while watching the incredible view on the background. I'd heard the movie was shot using some new technology and since I was too busy or lazy to do my research, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was a little worried that the filmmakers might have been tempted to go overboard and the space/earth would look too cartoonish. I was so happy it didn't happen. The movie is shot in 3D and the tricks you normally see in movies that are shot in 3D (e.g.a bird flying directly at you, etc.) aren't overused. Still, you feel like you're are in there - gliding in the space, spinning out of control... I even felt sick to my stomach at one point, I kid you not!<br/><br/>Anyways, the movie cunningly draws you in for the first fifteen minutes or so and then the crash happens - the Russians accidentally destroy their own satellite, causing the chain reaction. The debris of many broken satellites approaches Explorer at an incredible speed and smashes into the ship and its crew. I'm not a space scientist and I really do hope they had some very bright consultants, who are. I would hate to learn that this wonderful journey and the breathtaking fight for survival could not possibly happen in the space. I want everything to be perfectly correct, down to the tiniest details, because they all did seem to have been thoroughly thought through. What do you think was floating in the Russian station? A chess piece! How about the Chinese station? Yes, you guessed right - a ping pong racket! :) I wonder what would we see in the US station... hm... :) <br/><br/>I expected a grand visual spectacle but I didn't know that Gravity would also be an emotional roller coaster. There are several heartwrenching scenes masterfully scattered throughout the movie.<br/><br/>*** Warning: major spoilers start below ***<br/><br/>When I was watching slowly distancing Kowalsky and listening to his assuring voice I couldn't hold my tears back. A scene with Stone's desperate plea and Kowalsky's stubborn silence was so subtly selfless and courageous. <br/><br/>When Kowalsky came back... I knew he wasn't really there from the very beginning. I knew it because, right before he appeared, I could clearly see Stone's breath coming out of her mouth in the bitter cold, and a minute later the vapour was gone. It was hard to believe, that there would be such an obvious continuity error in this major scene of the movie hailed by everybody. But I wanted him to be there, I wanted him to be there so bad! But when he wasn't, I reluctantly thought: good! it would have ruined the movie.<br/><br/>And when Kowalski was keeping silent to prevent Stone from embarking into the doomed rescue mission, I wish she thanked him for saving her life. Or she could have said something humorous just the way he would have liked. She knew he was listening. :(<br/><br/>*** Warning: major spoilers are done ***<br/><br/>I didn't like Stone's back story too much though. I guess, they thought they needed it to show her personal development and explain the reason for some of her actions. But it didn't work for me. It would probably have been OK for some other movies, but at that point I expected nothing short of extraordinary from Gravity. I think they could have come up with something more creative, something more original. <br/><br/>However, regardless of minor flaws that you might find, go, see Gravity when it opens. I've seen some love or hate movies, but I think this will be love or like one. Even if you don't care for the story and the acting, just sit back, relax, turn off your brain and mindlessly watch the amazing visuals, it'll still be worth of the admission price."

This movie is terrible. I'm not sure how to make this review into the minimum 10 lines because, let's face it, the movie doesn't contain 10 lines worth of content, but I feel like people need to see a review from someone that doesn't just do as they're told and follow what the critics say.

","My wife and I were so looking forward to this movie after reading all the glowing reviews, what a massive mistake that was! The 3 stars I've given the film is for the special effects, that's it! I don't like movie reviewers, never have, but so many raved about this movie I thought they couldn't all be wrong ... they were. Trust me, I'm not one of those people who picks apart plots and believability, I go to the movies to be entertained, I don't care if ""that can't happen"" or ""as if anyone could do that"". For crying out loud I loved all the Twilight movies! The biggest problem with Gravity is that you feel no sympathy or empathy for the Sandra Bullock character, nothing at all. It is impossible to enjoy any movie if it does not illicit any feeling for any of the characters. It cost me $50.00 to see this over rated piece of garbage, next time I'll read IMDb first and continue to ignore the ""experts""."
"stan-836-274532","1","37","75","30 November 2013"," One of the worst films I have ever had to sit through
","Dreadful script, no plot, one-dimensional characters, repetitive action, repetitive visuals. I couldn't care less about what happened to either of the people. I estimate it took about one day of George's time and four days for Sandra Bullock to get her hysterics right and her hot pants to fit correctly. Then off the the CGI studio, and hey, you have a movie! It might be the worst movie of all time, but then that's Hollywood.<br/><br/>I've just had a notice that I have to write 10 lines of text. For a film this awful, that's quite a challenge. Still here goes. Opening captions 'There is no oxygen in space' beats the 'Mediterranean Sea' caption at the start of the otherwise excellent Bourne series. Final shot out of focus with our hot-panted Sandra going nowhere. Everything in between was just as dreadful. Although I laughed out loud every time she pulled out a manual to work out how to 'fly' the space station. Reminds me of happy hours wasted trying to fix my old Morris Minor. Otherwise I struggled to keep awake - but as I couldn't believe the film was so bad, I thought I owed it to my grandchildren - so I could say, 'Yes - I was there, and I lived through it - just.'"

The plot was so incredibly convenient and unrealistic that it completely took me out of the movie, and the repetitive ""action"" scenes grow boring quickly. The acting is nothing special, and it certainly isn't helped by the dialogue. The characters are unbelievable, and anyone who passed middle school science can tell that some of the physics (mainly one of the most important scenes of the movie) make no sense. Overall, Gravity is fun to look at, but just isn't a good movie. The insane amount of hype for this movie made it all the more disappointing."

It's a wonderfully visual, hypnotic and captivating event in orbit. Do spectacular visuals trump the lack of character development and an actual story? Maybe in this case it does.

This movie is gaining great praise so the week willed among film fans want to attach their movie wagon to a critical winner? <br/><br/>Again, I give this a big thumbs up as a visual and captivating event but it's not a true movie by definition.

"danielepinat","Null","4","5","6 February 2016"," Gravity as symbolic of new era
","Gravity Gravity is in fact, a beautiful film. What to add if not to write about the special effects, the characters or the plot. And, what about the symbolic aspects of the film which makes it a desirable film to talk and write about. An aspect neglected when talking about the film. The acute use of symbolism starts at the moment after the first catastrophe when George Cloney breaks away from Sandra Bullock in order for her to survive. She enters the Russian Spacelab and takes off her astronaut outfit. After taking off the outfit, she swings her arms upwards to see her body in full extension to a point that before she reaches a foetal form, her extended body shows her legs as if they had become some sort of a mermaid tale. It might seem far-fetched, yet I would advise to take a close look at that scene again. The, she attains the foetal form where one cable looks like the umbilical cord then we are afterwards launched through a narrow corridor which could be the uterus. From that scene on up until her reaching and landing on planet earth, it will be her growing up experience as the tight tunnel in the Spacelab could be a representation of her coming out of the uterus. But, where would this all lead up to? The only flaw I see in regards to the symbolism and that is, and we could ask a question, at what moment does the shift from our reality, that of a space catastrophe which has been the fault of the Russians and their missile launch on American satellites to bring us to a new dimension as we will discover it at the end. The only moment I see is when inside the Spacelab George Cloney comes back, then, she wakes up alone. I believe the Twilight Zone effect starts at this point where the fantasy kicks in to bring to a deeper level of thinking and plot development. Our reality has disappeared for a new one. How can all of this be linked? Near the end of the film, when she crashes in a lake somewhere which could be China since she used the Chinese Spacelab, it is to ask if there are still people on earth. Now, the capsule is flooding with water and like a mother's womb full of water she reaches the surface like a baby getting out of the womb. As we are shown, we see only her head out of the water, a solitary background, and she reaches shore dragging her way out like the first amphibian that populated the earth before the dinosaur era. And, more interesting, it makes the link to the foetal form in the Russian Spacelab and the mermaid effect, with difficulty, she succeeds in standing up. The camera angle filming her legs is for one reason: To show the new era of humans that will originate from her and the male she will seek since she could be viewed as Eve and her future mate Adam the background almost representing the Garden of Eden. What then, is special about her legs? When one observes the camera angle, her left leg is in full view showing her muscled side which demonstrates human training and exercises. However, the right leg which is further back shows a skinny leg which resembles that of an alien leg feature, skinny. In other words, the new era of humans would be half human and half alien due to her prolonged stay in space and experiences. In all, I would say that a film of this nature is very rare and more should be made. I rate this film 9 out of 10."

","Gravity was a great disappointment. The studio must have paid shills to write glowing reviews so we can waste our hard earned money on this junk.<br/><br/>Given that I was there in the 60's when the real Apollo missions were unfolding and worked for the company (Grumman Aircraft) that built the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) that actually landed on the moon, I am a little more than familiar with space technology and what can and cannot happen.<br/><br/>The first real space movie was Kubrik's ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" which to this day hold a high place in my heart which Gravity failed in every way to capture my appreciation for what I hoped for, and really wanted it to be, a great movie.<br/><br/>I paid extra to see the IMAX 3D version and was not disappointed with the CGI special effects and the implementation of 3D. The 3D wasn't abused like so many other 3D movies just for the sake of being 3D. No feeling of having to duck when objects are flying at you out of the screen. It actually was one of the best implementation of 3D movies I've seen next to Avatar. The CGI was stunning, realistic and believable. This is the only good thing I can say about this movie. <br/><br/>Now for the story line, or the lack of one. My 10 year old niece could have written a better script. After the initial 15 minutes the believability factor started to fade real quick. As they say ""it does not compute"". It starts off as a mission to upgrade one of the satellites, where things started to go wrong. I was waiting and waiting and waiting for the plot to expand and to develop. Unfortunately I waited for 1.5 hours and it never came.<br/><br/>The ending left me thinking what happened to the rest of the movie?

"MartinHafer","10","14","25","28 February 2014"," Absolutely unique and spellbinding.
","I noticed that one reviewer gave this film a score of 1. I just don't get this, as ""Gravity"" is one of the most creative and visually striking films I've ever seen. The only film that reminds me of it, somewhat, is ""Avatar""--where an entire world is created digitally--much like in ""Gravity"". However, ""Gravity"" is very much unlike ""Avatar"" is most every other way and represents an interesting 'what if' scenario in this near-future sci-fi film.<br/><br/>The date in which the film is set is uncertain but is sometime in the near future. In this near future, the International Space Station is still in use, the Chinese Space Station is up and running and the Americans once again have a shuttle program.<br/><br/>The film begins with an American space mission in progress. A scientist (Sandra Bullock) is working on fixing her pet space project while being overseen by an experienced astronaut (George Clooney). Without warning, a series of explosions emanating from a Russian satellite create a chain effect--launching space debris everywhere and destroying the shuttle and severely damaging the two nearby space stations. Unfortunately, at this point only the two astronauts are left alive--but not for long unless truly extraordinary events take place that allow them to return to Earth.<br/><br/>I was worried that I'd find the film boring. After all, 13 minutes into the movie, you are left with two living characters--and you see no others for the duration of the film. Yet, inexplicably, the script and direction keep the film from being dull. There are no lulls--and the action and acting really work well together and suck you into the film. I have rarely felt as tense as I did as I watched the movie and many times I found myself moving about in my seat along with the action.<br/><br/>Technically, the film was amazing. Using the actors' faces, a CG world was created that looked real. You really felt that it was filmed in space and the physics were really awesome. I rarely use words like 'awesome' or 'amazing' in my reviews--but this IS the only way to describe the technical prowess of the film. While I am sure physicists and rocket scientists could spot a few flaws here and there, the film makes it all seem so plausible and real that I cannot help but admire and love the film.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor--see this film and try to see it on the big screen."

"dimoulas-466-176153","10","18","34","4 October 2013"," Gravity is an experience
","The first image in Gravity is a space shuttle slowly floating towards us. Of course, in actuality, the space shuttle is moving incredibly fast but speed seems relative in space. On the space shuttle is Ryan Stone, a medical engineer, Matt Kowalski and Shariff, both astronauts. They are installing a new system to better view the universe, I think, something like that. It really doesn't matter because in a few minutes the space shuttle is going to get hit by debris, sending the story off. A story about a character's will to survive in the most hostile environment most people will never know. That's the story. Most of the dialogue in the film is very situational based. Except for one scene when one of the characters divulges a rather traumatic event in their life. But the film could be completely silent, for the movie goes far beyond story.<br/><br/>In space sound can't travel, a point that is made in many films involving scenes in space. However, most films that contain scenes in space ignore this and when a ship explodes we hear it explode. When a person opens a door in space, we hear the door. To Alfonso Cuar√≥n's credit, he does not shy away from the terrifying silence of space. In moments of sheer terror, the audience is left in the quiet. Most of these moments are filled with musical score, but they would be just as effective without as well. I found myself sometimes wanting to scream in frustration at the characters on screen in these tense moments. But I didn't need to. In the silence, I found the sound of the audience in the theater, yelling at the characters for me.<br/><br/>Most films that employ visual effects, the effects are noticeable. What I mean by that is, when watching an action film, you can tell when a real object shot by a camera has turned into a CG object. No matter how good CG gets, this fact will probably always be true. Space is an interesting place to portray using visual effects. Space is not a place many of us will ever go in our lives. It is a place filled with mystery. It is the most terrible and yet the most awe inspiring place. And the visual effects in Gravity portray space and the events that unfold in it brilliantly. I could not see the filmmaking. I had no idea how they filmed it, I would imagine mostly in front of a green screen, but I just couldn't tell. I thought I was in space. I was completely engrossed. On a side note, I did not feel that the IMAX or the 3D improved the viewing experience. When watched again (yes I have already watched it twice now) in a normal 2D theater, the film was just as breathtaking and exhilarating.<br/><br/>Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are great at playing their prospective roles. The cinematographer is dazzling. I felt as though the cuts were non-existent. I was never aware of an edit, almost as if the entire film consisted of one continuous shot. All the elements of the film came together perfectly to make this movie and to serve the story. But as I said before, Gravity goes far beyond just a simple story. It is an experience.<br/><br/>I truly believe that any film sets up its own expectations for the audience, as to what kind of film it will be, and what the ultimate conclusion should be. Every movie has a beginning, and they all should have a feeling of barreling to the end. And once we get to the end of a great film, there is a feeling that that ending was always going to be the ending. The story was chaotic and out of control as it raced to this end, and it was destined to be this way¬Ö although perhaps I have a more romantic view of film than most normal people do."

Total rubbish.<br/><br/>Sci-fi is a genre open to and full of spurious movies, but adding George Clooney and Sandra Bullock is like trying to polish a turd. No amount of over acting can save a weak plot like this. The way Sandrea Bullock breathes throughout this apology for a movie can only be likened to an asthmatic labrador who has been fed a diet of fat cigars.<br/><br/>Why do I have to write 10 lines concerning this garbage?

","Let's get one thing clear: 3D and special effects don't do it for me. OK, it's nice technology: but they don't make a movie. I look for a story, for actors who can convey emotions. Gravity had almost nothing of that. A far-fetched script, Sandra Bullcok hyperventilating and panicking continuously, George Clooney being ridiculously cool and relaxed: what a waste of the talent of two good actors. And the clich√©s: a ping-pong paddle floating in the Chinese space station, vodka on the Russian station... This reminded me of the disaster movies that came out during the 70s and 80s: thank goodness, those have been forgotten since. I was hoping that an intelligent movie could come out of Hollywood: not this time."

","Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this film because I didn't actually see the whole thing. But that's because I fell asleep; three times I think. I love good sci-fi movies and was really looking forward to this, based on the trailers and rave reviews when it came out. Now I am wondering - did I see the same flick these people did? Lets start with the plot. There wasn't one. At least not one that a third grader couldn't improve on. The Russians ( yes those nasty Russians)have destroyed one of their own satellites and have emperilled space travel for all mankind with the debris they have created. Its never really explained why they did this, but whatever. What follows is endless (and mindless) scenes of Sandra Bullock tumbling through space after the shuttle she and George Clooney are on is destroyed, right up to the predictable conclusion. I would give a 'spoiler alert'here, but whats the point. Anyone with a brain knows how this one is going to end five minutes after the movie starts. And of course, there are the predictable hallucinations of George reappearing and telling Sandra how to save herself after he has been killed. Whatever.<br/><br/>I will give this film one positive- the special effects are indeed spectacular. I don't recall any movie that puts one into space quite like this one. They even acknowledged that there is no sound in space, which I don't think has been done since 2001. Which just made me realize- 2001 had special effects better than Gravity, with 1969 technology.

"Robert_duder","6","16","30","12 October 2013"," Can't jump on the Gravity bandwagon for this one
","From the first trailer for the film I thought it looked intriguing, though the trailers never provided much information. You could guess at the concept and most guesses would be accurate. Its a survival/disaster story set in space with astronauts and no hint of science fiction whatsoever. I was a little surprised that suddenly the film exploded with huge ratings and huge box office returns. So because of that my expectations were high and I was prepared to potentially see a 10/10 film. I didn't hate this movie...do not get me wrong. It was entertaining and had some really nail biting moments. Visually it was good. But couldn't anyone make a visually stunning film with the backdrop of space looking down on earth. My biggest issue with the film is how unrealistic it felt. I am not a scientist and I know nothing about space travel but do I need to in order to know that NASA would not be sending up someone who is emotionally and physically unprepared and watching Bullock's character is sometimes laughable and that is unfortunate. I know I'm not the only one because other reviewers on IMDb have pointed out the exact things that bothered me. She makes poor decisions, completely unrealistic moves and generally is unbelievable in the role.<br/><br/>I don't blame Sandra Bullock as an actress because she is a great actress. In fact what I say doesn't matter because this film is raking in money and likely to get Oscar nominations (a travesty and a joke in my opinion.) Bullock's character is empty and depressing. The addition of her talking about losing her daughter is pointless and forced on you to try and get an emotional reaction and it doesn't work at all. She shows her emotions well when she is in danger but the character is weakly written and you never truly get attached to her in any way. George Clooney is mostly there as another star-power name. He does alright but once again his character does not fit the film. His sarcasm, and humour stands out and is ridiculous at times. The chemistry between him and Bullock could be great but the script does nothing to give them that opportunity. Neither one are riveting and worst of all neither of them are even remotely believable as astronauts. Clooney is supposed to be the seasoned veteran and he's training Bullock out in space...I am almost certain that she would never even remotely leave earth without being 1000% trained. As other reviewers pointed out...Bullock consults training manuals in various languages and then resorts to playing eenie meenie miney moe on a spacecraft trying to get it to fly. Are you serious? How can anyone stomach that and accept it.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n has apparently built a very solid fan base. Children of Men was almost brilliant and Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix was phenomenal. However, I feel like he is one of those film makers that lets stories slide in order to impress us visually or artistically. Children of Men and Gravity are shining examples of this. Cuar√≥n turns Gravity completely bizarre by forcing in absolutely ridiculous art-house scenes (Bullock's ridiculous fetal floating scene, and the end scene of her standing and being shot as though she is about to scream ""I AM WOMAN."") What is he trying to do with this? Its irritating because this could have been a terrific disaster, survival flick and he tried to do more with it than it deserved. One of the things I loved about the film was the lack of sound in space. While it certainly reduces the impact of the shattering space stations it is more realistic and really disturbing to see all that debris and destruction but to hear nothing. As many of you who read my reviews may know, I am NOT a 3D fan. It doesn't bother me but it does nothing to increase the value of a film. I thought Gravity might be the exception to that and it wasn't. There was nothing in this film made more impressive by 3D and that's just a real shame. It sounds like I've really trashed on this movie and I have but I was just so blown away by how much everyone loves this movie and how it mostly let me down. It wasn't terrible and it was reasonably entertaining but I would never go out of my way to watch it again. It was a sub-par and rushed project that Cuar√≥n unapologetically ignores a tight script or research. You will watch this regardless and chances are you will love it because its the mass opinion right now but I have to say how I feel and this one for me was a pass. 6/10"

"hudini669","6","10","17","7 January 2014"," A very beautiful bad film
","I am simply amazed how nowadays people can't tell the difference between a good film and a visually compelling bad film. But, in an era of CGI being valued over talent on screen, I guess it's not that surprising at all.<br/><br/>In my book, 'Gravity' definitely falls into the latter category. Visually, it is breathtaking, an astonishing accomplishment, but what I value the most about a moving picture - the story - is so unbelievably thin and there is no CGI that can mask that.<br/><br/>The premise itself is not bad, and I take it that the environment is represented fairly accurately, but when a story depends on so much national stereotypes as plot devices, it leaves me simply scratching my head in wonder was it really the only way to get the story going. Or maybe I'm simply wrong and Russians really do destroy satellites for fun and keep vodka in emergency modules, American astronauts really do crack stupid jokes and dance the 'Macarena' in outer space and Chinese radio amateurs really can reach outer space when neither Houston nor any other ground control can... I was almost expecting a Mao Tse Tung portrait hanging at the Chinese station, for that matter. The Buddha figurine and the ping pong paddles were already there.<br/><br/>All in all, 'Gravity' is a film that can keep a viewer on the edge of their seat, but most of the time only in disbelief. It is by all means stunning from a photographic point of view, but falls flat short below the surface. Luckily it barely exceeds 80 minutes, unlike most pretentious wanna-be spectacles today, and that adds greatly to my rating, which is otherwise rather generous given my overall impression.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Gravity at first sight may appear to be an everyday space disaster film, and you would be right. Gravity follows a simple concept, on and paper it may seem a bit tedious in fact. However, what highlights this film as one of the most cinematically perfect films ever made is not its story, but its execution.<br/><br/>Visually, Gravity is perfect. The CGI is incredible, and flawless to the eye. It is very beautiful to admire, especially in the opening 17 minute continuous shot which is designed to do nothing but make you admire and immerse yourself into the space 'scene'. During this continuous shot, as you drift around George Clooney in the cosmos it is evident that Cuar√≥n wants you to take a moment and enjoy this scene, before it all goes to hell which it inevitably does. The film is littered with stunning visuals, through the times of calm everyday dialogue and terrifying scenes of peril. Gravity pulls you in and throws you into the scene and with clever camera-work, even you sometimes forget you are sitting in your chair.<br/><br/>Gravity has been anticipated for its supposed realism. Although according to the space pros, its far off from being realistic, the everyday film fan could not spot the flaws. The realism in Gravity, such as the lack of sound in space and the non existence of air creates an atmosphere that has never been experienced in film. Watching a spacecraft get torn apart in total silence is like nothing you have ever seen. How Gravity incorporates the idea of realism and the low hope of survival really makes you empathic for characters, and vouch for their survival.<br/><br/>Gravity is almost cinematically perfect. No question there. Gravity exists to immerse, entertain and to strike that fear that we all have in space back into us. It creates visuals that have never been witnessed before and it is to date the best film to see in 3D. The acting from Sandra Bullock is outstanding, and she deserves credit and a lot of recognition for her role in this masterpiece along with George Clooney. Gravity sets the standards for modern cinema, and creates an experience that will be hard to beat in years to come. 10/10"

Perfect.<br/><br/>Now the acting. Perfect again. Bullock has never given a better performance in her career and - no disrespect -- may never surpass this one. There is a throwaway line late in the film -- what used to be called an ""aside"" in stage plays -- which reads in the script, ""I hate space."" It is tribute to her work here that she not only nails the line but after you leave the theatre (or close the DVD) you cannot imagine any other actor doing that line and making it work as well.<br/><br/>Clooney? During the run of the original CSI VEGAS, the producers were embarrassed by surveys showing that ""Grissom"" was the boss most Americans wanted to work for, regardless of their job or where they lived.<br/><br/>After watching this film, and even though he has minimal screen time, AND ONLY A FEW MOMENTS OF FACE TIME, George Clooney is like the only person you would want to call if you were in a dangerous situation and needed counselling.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","9","8","13","20 November 2013"," Gravity is all cinema should be.
","Gravity is all cinema should be. Perilous, contradictory, cathartic, insightful. It's a film about everyone and a film about just one person. It results in a film that's at once the biggest scale film possible and incredibly intimate and personal. This is a rare event to be treasured. After one of my all-time favourite films Children of Men, the brilliant sensual Y Tu Mama Tambien and the best of the Harry Potter films Prisoner of Azkaban, it was quite clear that Alfonso Cuaron is a talented director who will stand the test of time. Which meant he was free to take his time as it seemed like we were waiting forever for Gravity, coming 7 years after we last saw him. I read the script while it was still playing the festival circuit and even on paper, it was compelling, moving and unpredictable. Even though I knew what happens, I couldn't have been more excited and the hype was the highest it's been for a film in a long time.<br/><br/>And what a total full-body full-soul roller-coaster it was. Like the rest of the world, I had tears in my eyes the whole time with my jaw dropped in awe and my breathing in sync with its protagonist. It captures the human condition in all its physical and meta-physicality. Needless to say about its true star, this is most likely the best visual effects there's ever been. It seems every year we're going to get a special effects laden blockbuster from an auteur that innovates the technology, gathers all the technical Oscars and attempts to use it to its full artistic potential. Sometimes that potential is limited, with Martin Scorsese's Hugo and James Cameron's Avatar disappointing. Sometimes that potential is pretty good, with Ang Lee's Life Of Pi and Christopher Nolan's Inception satisfying enough. But it's never been quite as extraordinary as Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity.<br/><br/>Combined with the careful and stunning use of sound design and Emmanuel Lubezki's thrilling and intelligent cinematography, its conviction provides a convincing and heart-pounding experience. It has ideal pacing as it stays suspenseful yet is able to breathe. There's a priceless excitement and cinematic magic with excessively unbroken shots that films of all genres indulge in, but Gravity takes it to another level in its shots that last over 15 minutes. Sure there was undoubtedly extensive post-production work involved to stitch shots together but that work was meticulous that you can't help but get swept away in the illusion. In the IMAX, saw a trailer for the next Hobbit film beforehand and I immediately regretted what I had gotten myself into. 3D just doesn't seem ready to do justice to its name. I only ever enjoyed it once and that was Toy Story 3, where the filmmakers had control of all the layers.<br/><br/>However, Gravity may be the first live-action 3D film I've seen to actually make it work. Life Of Pi may have deserved some of its acclaim, but it only worked in certain shots. That's because not all the layers were designed for 3D. Gravity has the benefit of having very few layers - often it was only astronaut and/or space station, Earth, background resulting in more control and less to get in the way. In the script the distances between things were often miles apart, but with nothing to obstruct the view. 3D enhances that sense of scale and makes it immersive and utterly visceral. Even now, life still feels so small scale in comparison. Despite its limitations of plot and character, it's extremely rewarding that Gravity is a film where every viewer takes something different and valuable away from it. Whether it be about a woman's plight with gravity, the human instinct of perseverance or simply having a story to tell.<br/><br/>The idea that stuck with me most is the acceptance of death. If not now, if not in an hour, then anytime in the future. It's something that has always motivated art and Gravity hits the spot. While it is thanks to the depth of the writing in such an action packed film, reading the script didn't have the same effect. It's due to Sandra Bullock's committed performance. There's a lot to admire in Bullock and George Clooney's performances. The way Gravity was shot required them to repeat actions to the milli-meter. For them to still incorporate soul into their characters with such restrictions requires genuine talent, and although I skipped The Blind Side, I definitely believe in Bullock. That said, Clooney is getting a lot of the complaints in that he's irritatingly 'just being Clooney.' While I feel I can defend that in the level of precision required in every take that the fact he does 'just do Clooney' is a feat in itself, the film does suffer from its Hollywood cheese-charm dialogue. It does add an essential flavour in the otherwise sparse film, but its timing is the problem, and often it feels inappropriate.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that 'Americanised' appeal added to the film also damages the score, that too often feels invasive and manipulative. It's a great score, but it needed to be dialled down a few notches for a more subtle and graceful effect. Regardless of these minor inconsistencies, Gravity is an instant iconic film for the ages. It may be another special effect heavy film that will most likely play second fiddle to something more to the Academy's taste, assuming the predicted 12 Years A Slave/Gravity love split stays strong til Oscar night, but this time it's a completely worthy one. Even detractors have to admit, in many ways Gravity is simply astonishing. However, the concern is - how will it fare on DVD? Is this exclusively a 3D IMAX experience? We'll have to wait a few months to find out but I urge anyone to witness it in that way rather than tablets and phones. Now I'm going to find an even bigger screen to watch it again.<br/><br/>9/10"

I felt gripped from the start and in my opinion, that is one major criteria of excellent cinema.<br/><br/>It is beautifully rendered. The visuals are beyond stunning and the 3D is brilliantly executed. So very many films have been utilizing 3D which adds no value to the movie and are completely third rate. This film utilizes the extra dimension in the best way possible, to give the viewer the best possible experience. The beautifully crafted film employs visuals that will leave the viewer stunned, mystified and in awe. To prevent spoiling the film, all i shall say is the visual scenes are grand and brilliant in every way. Cinematography at its finest.<br/><br/>However, great visuals only do not a great work of art make. The visual thrills are one of the many sensational aspects in the film. The directing is spot on, masterfully rendered. Visionary if i may say so. The audience is made to feel part of the experience, captured and drawn in as if at that place in time and seeing through the eyes of the characters. The intermingling of a great score and tenderly directed scenes that capture every moment, every emotion and every tiny speck of humanity making this a triumph.<br/><br/>A brilliantly thought up story. One would think the story line is redundant and overdone. Others would question the depth of a story such as this. To these people i implore 'WATCH THE MOVIE!'. A story so simple and yet so intense. One which brings together the elements of a great thriller, with surprises at every turn and elements of great drama, a story that taps into the deepest emotions and into the psyche of these characters dissecting their every thought and action. It is a story of hope, courage and strength from the darkest abyss, despair, loss the power of laughter in extreme deadly situations and the power of fear and what it drives us to. It is a story of personal growth and personal development. A true survival tale in the harshest of environments and what keeps us alive. The psychology is explored and its role in life and the pursuit of survival.<br/><br/>It is the emotional quotient that drives this film, the masterful direction and masterclass acting by Bullock and Clooney. The sheer craftsmanship of this film by its director and stellar cast make this film excellent in every way. Bullock and Clooney are artists, they bring to life, create these personalities and characters who will leave you in awe. <br/><br/>I shall certainly watch it again. And despite the idiot who kept kicking my seat every 2 minutes, even that did not deter my attention. This is a great film. Word of advice: Please do not take little children to this film. I had 2 children sitting a few rows down who were so restless and kept talking the whole way through until a woman stood up to reprimand the parents. The parents received many more complaints."
"frostihe","10","8","13","30 October 2013"," The best film of it's kind in 2013
","This is one of the best movies I've seen, indeed the best of it's genre. The VFX is very stunning and beautiful, I am very proud of Da√∞i one of the VFX directors and a man from my town for this masterpiece. The storyline is simple and can be very touchy at some times. Alfonso Cuar√≥n surprises his viewers with this amazing film which in my opinion should be nominated for the 86th Academy Awards in March 2014 in many subjects. Sandra Bullock is an Oscar deserved actress with great talents and should clearly be nominated for this one, obviously more deserved than the statue she earned in 2011 for The Blind Side. Well after all, I'd say this film is one of the top 30 films I have ever seen."
"jmoney-2","8","8","13","19 October 2013"," A jaw-dropping story about the human spirit and the will to survive
","Gravity is a movie about trying to survive an impossible situation, and its filmmakers do something almost as difficult: Create a Hollywood blockbuster that's so original and eye-popping, it causes the collective jaw of jaded moviegoers to drop.<br/><br/>This thriller about two astronauts stranded after a disaster in space is so harrowing, because its visuals are so believable. It's the rare movie where the effects are so convincing; you forget they are effects at all.<br/><br/>In this day and age when every DVD seems to come with a whole batch of behind-the-scenes documentaries, most savvy moviegoers can spot the tricks of the trade and know how most cinematic illusions are achieved. So, it's enormously refreshing to watch a movie that is wall-to-wall special effects and not be able to discern any of its secrets. Director Alfonso Cuaron is known as an innovative filmmaker (any movie buff who has not seen Children of Men needs to stop what they're doing this instant and go see it). With this film, he devised a whole new bag of tricks to get the movie from script to screen. (One hint: Cuaron reportedly dangled the actors from wires inside a cube of LED lights. I can't begin to fathom how that translated into what you see on film ‚Äì and I'm not sure if I want to know.) The result is a movie that demands to be seen not only in a theater, but in IMAX 3D. Splurge for the more expensive ticket ‚Äì it's worth it.<br/><br/>As it has often been said, the most spectacular effects are worthless if they're not used to tell a compelling story. Cuaron knows the audience must be invested in the characters. Having two likable stars -- Sandra Bullock and George Clooney -- helps accomplish that aim, as does a script that fleshes out their personae, albeit through some clumsy exposition. Clooney and Bullock are the only actors with speaking parts whose faces appear on screen, but they both have such natural charisma, they are all we really need to see. One other key character is heard but not seen: Ed Harris, in a clever bit of casting, reprises his Apollo 13 role as the voice of mission control. (Apparently, it's a law in Hollywood that you can't make a realistic movie about the space program without the star of The Right Stuff being involved in some way.) The character moments are sprinkled into a story that unfolds at breakneck pace in near real time. At a concise 91 minutes, the movie is perfectly structured and a model of narrative efficiency. Bullock's character barely gets a chance to catch her breath, and neither does the audience.<br/><br/>Gravity is not without it flaws, however. Despite the movie's extremely realistic look, it contains a payload bay's worth of scientific inaccuracies. (Allow me to go all Space Geek on you for a moment.) Beyond the obvious fact the space shuttles are all currently residing in museums and that one of the other spacecraft depicted in the movie does not yet exist ‚Äì there are other glaring problems. According to this movie, every man made object orbiting the earth is at the same altitude and latitude. (Fact: They're not.) Some basic laws of physics also apparently don't apply in this film's universe. (I could go on, but I won't.) The movie's accurate depiction of spaceflight, though, is less important than its emotional genuineness. It's a story about the human spirit and the will to survive. Bullock's character, a space rookie, was a doctor in her earthbound life and her backstory is a tragic one. For her, venturing to space is a way of escaping her pain. But in facing death, she discovers a newfound desire to live. It's an inspiring portrayal in a movie that is itself an inspiring artistic achievement."
"jdj2122","9","14","26","20 September 2013"," wow, omg, amazing
","Gravity is the final movie I saw at TIFF, and it was also by far the best. Starring George Clooney, Sandra Bullock, and Ed Harris, this is a non-stop thrill ride that I have so many good things to say about. The story is about 2 astronauts who have to survive in space after having debris rash into their spaceship. Now if you think this movie will be anything like Buried or if you think nothing will happen with two people floating in space, you are wrong. So much happens in the film that it feels much longer than its short 90 minuet length.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is easily the cinematography. The entire movie looks amazing from start to finish. Not just amazing, but better than any movie ever, even Pacific Rim. There is also minimum cutting and there are camera shots that go for a couple minuets, which makes the film feel completely real. Also, seeing it in 3D gives you an experience beyond belief. For these reasons alone I could highly recommend you see this movie in theaters. But the reasons don't stop there. The acting is amazing, just as good as 12 Years a Slave. The writing is also great. The attention to detail is unbelievable. The plot twist are plentiful and you don't see them coming. So much happens in this movie that you will want to watch it again immediately after seeing it the first time. <br/><br/>I've heard some people complain that the movie is too unrealistic, due to there being tons of debris flying around destroying everything but never hitting Bullock's character. Despite this fact, everything else in the movie feels entirely realistic. Also, the movie builds up tension so high to play on the audiences emotions of fear and excitement. The movie is an extremely visceral experience, so breathtaking and brilliant, it has become the best movie I've seen this year. So many parts of this movie are unbelievable, and I can't recommend this movie enough. 9.8/10 stars."
"deloudelouvain","9","6","9","11 January 2019"," That's what I call Entertainment! Yes, with a big E.
","What will never cease to amaze me is the amount of people that have no sense for quality. How on earth can you score this movie with the lowest rating possible? That's just being unfair. The lowest rating possible means this is one of the worst movies you ever saw in your miserable life. Really? You never saw worse than Gravity? I thought Alfonso Cuar√≥n did an amazing job and that for a story with basically only two actors and for the most part just one. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney made me sit on the edge of my seat more than once in this movie. I honestly don't care if it is realistic or not, it's most probably not, I just wanted to be entertained and that's exactly what I got, entertainment. Visually it's just perfect, as the CGI's make you feel like you're in space yourself. The soundtrack brings a special atmosphere to the movie so that was also good. Am I surprised Gravity won seven Oscars? Absolutely not! Gravity deserves all their Oscars as this movie is one of the best of 2013. I wished I watched in the theater though, that must have been impressive. It was already stunning on my big screen television so I can only imagine the sensation watching it in a theater."
"ControlFreak3","10","6","9","14 January 2017"," What's with the negative reviews?
","I know this review is late, but... This movie is a masterpiece. Why are there a lot of negative reviews? Almost everything in this movie is amazing. The story is not exactly explained, but you find out along the way. It's done very well. The cinematography is beautiful. Alfonso Cuaron has really outdone himself. The music is also great and is with suspense. This movie makes you think, ""What would I do if I was in this situation?"" Overall this movie is worth being viewed by everyone. I extremely recommend watching this masterpiece. It's great to watch with anyone, really. Except with the negative science nerds who point out all the mistakes instead of trying to enjoy the movie."

","Not for everyone and very intense. No BEM (bug-eyed-monster) or alien. Death and fear are the monsters here. She is a ""tenderfoot"" astronaut and has to read the plastic cue cards to operate the equipment. She goes in-and-out of consciousness and imagines that her dead partner, ""Kowalski"" (George Clooney) returns and saves her. In fact he does, as his hallucination helps her focus on her own rescue. Everything goes wrong after a failed repair of the Hubble telescope, and she becomes the lone survivor from the USA team. The Hubble gets destroyed by space debris, and so does her spacecraft. I actually felt like I was ridding along with her. Everything was so real and vivid yet some reviewers thought it to be long, boring and meaningless? She makes a final leap-of-faith and ""jumps"" to the rescue spacecraft-capsule, which almost burns up on re-entry. It's only 90 minutes so try to see it uncut. (With 30 minutes of cable commercials, it does drag.) Warning! viewing it on a large screen/3D/IMAX might cause vertigo!"

"TxMike","Null","6","9","5 April 2014"," Three astronauts on a repair mission get into an unplanned jam.
","This movie, ""Gravity"", has received much hype starting quite a long time before its release. As with most highly hyped movies, when viewer expectations are heightened, the actual viewing doesn't quite match the high expectations. We saw it on DVD, a Redbox rental. However it is a very good and entertaining movie with a good share of drama. Will they or will they not survive the surprise rain of new space debris?<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is a PhD scientist Ryan Stone, sent on a repair mission for the Hubble telescope. This is realistic, as that equipment has had similar repair missions. While she has trained for months for the mission, she is not a pilot and will encounter particular difficulties in this unplanned event.<br/><br/>Her main partner is very experienced astronaut and pilot, George Clooney as Matt Kowalski, a carefree type of guy who always seems to have a ""story"" for mission control.<br/><br/>All hell breaks loose during their EVA (extra-vehicular activity) when a Russian planned destruction of obsolete orbiting equipment starts a type of chain reaction and a great debris field orbiting at normal orbit speed, in a trajectory that crosses that of the US astronauts every 90 minutes. Their hope of competing the mission, or even preserving the space station, are gone and the movie is simply about their trying to survive and get back to Earth, back to gravity! <br/><br/>Pretty fascinating effects to simulate weightlessness and working in space, the movie is well-made and entertaining.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Kowalski hooks up Stone to himself via a tether and he uses the power of his jet pack to maneuver them towards another space station. However running out of fuel and oxygen, Kowalski unhooks himself and leaves Stone to try to survive as he drifts away, doomed. In a complicated series of events she manages to get into an escape pod and makes it safely to Earth, almost drowning as she lands in a lake, but the movie ends as she pulls herself up and turns to walk away."
"richardfps","9","6","9","7 March 2014"," gravity iz baaaad!
","i never seen gravity but all my primary friends say its boring(because they are the cornerstone of movie critics). because of this, i think gravity is a boring stupid movie about astronauts in space, WHO WANTS TO WATCH ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE?! now excuse me, i'm gonna go into my dead-skin absorbing jelly bath and eat a lemongrass and seaweed strudel while watching uwe boll's masterpiece, postal.<br/><br/>If you did not catch my sarcasm, then...i was...being sarcastic. But that's not the point, what the point is that people shouldn't be too negative about this movie, sure the plot is nothing special and a few scenes DOES drag sometimes, but other than that, the movie is terrific. The cinematography is stunning, the story was good (but like i said, nothing special), the pacing was relatively consistent, Sandra Bullock's character was interesting/well developed, the soundtrack was hauntingly beautiful and the special effects...THE SPECIAL EFFECTS (i don't even have to say anything about this one). To sum it up, the story and characters weren't revolutionary but everything else was perfect. Now, I can talk all day long about the acting from Sandra Bullock, directing by Alfonso Cauron and the soundtrack from Steven Price, but, i think i have made my point. Gravity is one of the finest movies to come out for the past few decades and i believe it deserved the rightful 7 Oscars it won.<br/><br/>Side note: Now, i know you haters are a bunch of attention whoring imbeciles, but in the end, your ""opinions"" aren't going to matter, the film will/already is being remembered as a masterpiece and it is most likely going to end up as a staple of great film making. So hate all you want, because most of us will remember you as immature school children."
"zeusandtomshow","9","6","9","4 March 2014"," Roger This!
","Excellent movie. It's the fastest 90 minutes in movie history. This movie keeps you so wrapped up in what's happening that before you take your first breath, you're halfway through the movie. Sandra Bullock plays Ryan Stone, an astronaut caught in orbit due to Russian space debris disabling the space shuttle. (Those dang Russians!) George Clooney plays Matt Kowalski, her fellow stranded astronaut. Theirs are the only two faces you will see the entire movie. Which is astounding in and of itself. The sound and visual of the movie is fantastic, they do a great job making you feel like you're there. The writers do a great job of making sure nothing is easy for our heroine, Ryan. She has to struggle each step of the way. I loved the fetus shot of Ryan as she slept briefly. and when she was stepping out of the water at the end, I got the impression of humans rising from the primordial ooze."

","I felt so good after leaving the theater. This movie was so entertaining that I couldn't sit still in anticipation. Yes, there are some scientific errors, but they are so minor that they honestly do not take away from the movie at all. I think people need to list and number all the factual mistakes to make themselves feel smart. It's a movie... Deal with it. I also saw this movie in 3D which really brought to life the special effects. Don't go in with extremely high expectations and don't try to act like a know it all genius.

It keeps you on the edge of your seat and continuously amazes you with some of the most beautiful and stunning sights and visual effects you have ever seen. I do prefer that you watch it if full 1080p / HD quality. Definitely one of the most visually stunning movies in the world. Some people say that there is ""Bad Science"" and I disagree. I believe that only at a couple of parts in the movie, the laws of physics is completely off. If you get a chance to watch Gravity, do it, especially if you see it in 3D (even if you usually hate 3D, believe me, it's worth it). Alfonso Cuar√≥n has outdone himself with this film, it's definitely a must see film. I give this movie 9 because I believe that the story could be a little better. But it is amazing the way it is. Also the special and visual effects are amazing. I definitely recommend that you watch this movie at least 2-3 times before you die."
"videorama-759-859391","9","6","9","27 February 2014"," A great sci fi flick with pull
","Visually, Gravity is the most beautiful and enthralling film I've ever seen. Watching it on just a Dell computer screen, lights off, amazed me. I actually felt I was there, if at times in the actual actor's shoes. Slumped, back in my seat, I just got lost in the cinematography. God knows what it's like in 3D or at the Imax theatre. Our two acting heavy weights, Clooney and Bullock, turn in good performances, especially Bullock, when the helmet comes off. Although she's a stereotyped actress, given these independent woman roles like a few other actresses to name. Clooney, honestly, I just wanted him to shut the f..k up. He really got annoying, whether helmet on or off. The plot borrows or unintentionally borrows the catalyst, similar to that of an old 80's sci fi flick, Starflight One. What we've got here is a space station attacked by chunks of metal from another exploding vessel, puncturing and tearing up the station, leaving Clooney and Bullock, as the only two survivors who get separated, where fatally only one is left standing. Gravity's script starts off better with Clooney and Bullock talking co-ordinates whatever, where later it's just cross conversation but interesting and thought provoking dialogue, from Clooney, still a narcissistic p..ck. Bullocks transportation from space back to ground zero, where in many seconds we're no longer viewing satellite, is something that must be seen like this movie. Though it's not worthy of Oscar nomination for film (no way) Gravity is worth the watch alone, for it's cinematography and it's brilliantly fitting music score."
"Luziferr","10","6","9","25 February 2014"," Almost Perfect Movie
","""Gravity"" is an almost perfect film. One of the reasons for this near perfection is it seems so simple - yet a lot of work went into making this film seem so simple. Bullock's performance is very good and different from most of the other films she has done. Bullock's portrayal of Ryan Stone is very physical and very challenging. As she is swinging and rotating through space, she manages to make us believe in her character's dire situation. Again, it is remarkable how moving her character is when she has so little time to create one. Alfonso Cuaron is a gifted filmmaker. He isn't the most prolific director working today, but he spends a lot of time crafting, shaping and making films that are interesting and unique. ""Gravity"" is his best film yet and one of the best films of the year."

","This movie has a very Alien-like vibe, with Sandra Bullock's characters fighting alone against everything and never being really saved. The acting is brilliant, as can be expected from Sandra Bullock, and the directing is awesome! The way the movie makes you lose yourself in space, until you can't tell up from down is really well-made and makes the movie that much intensive. You really feel as lost as the heroine and you get how seeing so much space, an universe that vast, can make you feel claustrophobic. In short, this is a great movie where special effects really enhance the story and don't crush it, which is rare nowadays."

Is about being in the space, loose your own weight and your more rooted habits. Shows how beautiful is the human body (Sandra Bullock rotating out of her space suit), how beautiful is the earth and how beautiful human beings can be (George Clooney never losing his good mood). The last scene explaining what gravity means for us all is worth an Academy Award for the best finale if ever there will be one.<br/><br/>I am aware of all the criticism raised by others (there are already more than 1.100 reviews while I'm writing my note) about Physics laws not always completely respected but being a nerd myself I can assure you that this will not bother you, not even for a moment, unless you as a kid were bothered when Jules Verne made you travel to the Center of the Earth and return on a brazier coming out from the Vesuvius.<br/><br/>Your eyes will be delighted and You will feel very privileged to be orbiting the earth, live the International Space Station as it were your own place, taste the oxygen blended with excessive CO2 and feel the desperate need for mother planet we all have."

Gravity has finally brought back the interest in space movies since 2000, when a lot of space movies were thrown into the theatres, but most of them were quickly and badly made. Gravity is a must-see in 3D or IMAX, it is pretty much as amazing as Avatar. But do remember, it is a thriller and it might send a chill down your spine for most of the film. One of the key things is that it can fill you with some knowledge of what is ""up there"" and really shows how space debris can cause damage. So just go and watch the movie, you won't regret it. G.

"RobertVarno03","Null","34","74","4 October 2013"," A disappointment
","This film is over-hyped and definitely not the best space film ever made. The plot is centered around two astronauts who become stranded when their satellite is hit by debris. The film follows their attempts to survive and get back to Earth. While on paper the premise is solid the film is hampered by problems that leaves the viewer with a sense of mediocrity.<br/><br/>The biggest issue I have with Gravity is repetition. While the first 10 minutes may be entertaining, the film goes around in circles from there on. I'll be hard pressed to encounter a science fiction fan who doesn't find the plot predictable and shallow. Furthermore the dialogue is bland and whilst Cuaron desperately tries to give the film emotional depth, a forced performance from Bullock and poor writing leave the viewer feeling nothing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film's one redeeming factor is the technical work to create the impression of space. Never before has Earth looked so real. Also the audio was used to good effect to create tension and boost the action sequences. <br/><br/>Despite the technical triumph I still left the cinema feeling average. No matter how pretty space looks, it cannot redeem the story or the failure to connect with the audience on an emotional level."

","This film has great visuals, but that is about it. Boring acting jobs by Bullock and Clooney. I don't know why Hollywood feels the need to put miscast ""A-listers"" in every feature. Personally, I feel this film would have been better with relatively unknown actors, rather than stars like Bullock and Clooney that have the exact same screen presence and speech patterns no matter what film they are in. Hard to believe them being astronauts when they have the exact same screen presence of every other role they've had. Go see it for the visuals but try to look past the mailed in performances of Bullock and Clooney and the sappy sentimental introspective look into Bullock's character...Boring!"
"bob the moo","Null","16","31","20 November 2013"," The intensity of the experience covers up for the weaknesses in the events and writing
","I am really not a fan of 3D; I dislike that everything seems darker and a little bit harder to see and even for the big banner 3D movie (Avatar) it seemed like an unnecessary gimmick that didn't do enough to cover up a not particularly good film. Add to this the number of films that are cheaply retrofitted with 3D for the sake of money and I really have no interest in seeing anything in 3D if I have a normal option. Gravity was the exception since from what I heard it was probably worth seeing in 3D and from seeing it I can agree with this.<br/><br/>As a piece of technology, Gravity is really impressive. I always think that the absolute best use of special effects in films are those where you forget how impressive they are because they really don't stand out as different from everything else but are just part of the construct. That is the case here as space just feels real and the huge amount of work to make it happen isn't made a fuss of and doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film. Helping you forget this is the fact that the film is a real experience in terms of the story as a ride. Within a few minutes you are in the middle of the experience and it really doesn't stop until the end. Visually I did still feel the 3D made the images darker than they should have been and reduced the clarity of my whole field of vision, but in this case the feeling of being ""in"" the film really work and aside from one or two ""thing coming at you"" moments, it really worked. For me equally impressive was the sound engineering; most sound effects are given a really satisfying ""via contact"" sound ‚Äì the sound where the vibrations come via water or another material like they vibrate through your body rather than in the air. This was done so very well and helped me get into it as much as the visuals and effects.<br/><br/>The one thing to say though is that all of this probably only applies if you see it in the cinema and with the full experience because this is what it is about ‚Äì and it would be wrong to get sucked up in the experience and not see the weaknesses within this film. Specifically these are in the content and they will be more apparent on a smaller screen. The events within the film are so unlikely that without these strong aspects drawing you in, they will probably be more likely to push you out of the experience to question what you are watching. Attempts to add character and back story are OK but only as part of an already engaging experience ‚Äì mostly they are only so-so and one or two rather clunky bits of symbolism really don't work. That said it is not down to the cast. Clooney may be very much about his calmness under pressure and his great presence but Bullock does a very good job to be vulnerable and fighting to survive and just like the effects do, her performance draws you in even if the material she sometimes has to deliver has the potential to do the opposite.<br/><br/>Gravity is only 90 minutes and it moves with intensity and urgency that is effective and greatly helped by how great it is as an experience. As such it will work best by far with a large screen and those silly overpriced glasses on because it is all about this and in this context the weaknesses are less impacting ‚Äì but there are weaknesses and they do have an impact and I suspect that as the film moves onto smaller screens, these will be more apparent."

I normally like science fiction. I don't mind one actor taking 90% of the screen time. On that note, they could have gotten someone a little more watchable than Sandra Bullock. The character development consists of George Clooney telling some story that he thinks makes this mission a jinx. Sandra Bullock tells us her 4 year old daughter died when she fell and hit her head. Fine. Let's at least have a realistic plot. Everyone knows she gets detached from her link to the space shuttle. Conveniently enough, there is a Russian space station nearby, that she and Clooney just float over to. Like a walk in the park. Clooney gets cut adrift, so we are stuck with Bullock for the rest of the absurdity. Without giving too much away, she then is able to get to another space station, and is able to get a pod back to Earth for the ridiculous happy ending. I was kind of hoping that she would run into Bob Denver(Gilligan) or perhaps Tom Hanks (Cast Away) when she got to land. Oh well."

","GRAVITY, Alfonso Cuaron's 2nd sci-fi undertaking, is a masterpiece. Beautifully realized, fantastically acted and housing the most spectacular special effects ever witnessed on film, it is a triumph in the utmost sense.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying this is the most gorgeous film, on a technical level, EVER. Never have you seen something with this level of awe and spectacle. Not once do you doubt the cold depths of space and the mechanized behemoths that our heroes trek across in the 90-minute run time. It's this believability that adds to the dread and overall experience. You will feel completely exhausted by the time the credits roll, both emotionally and mentally. Not because there is any real thinking to do, but because you feel you're right there, in the suit, as helpless and lost as our struggling protagonists. You are part of the movie, and this is magnified perfectly by the best-used 3D EVER. This is one of the first times, other than Life of Pi and Avatar, that I insist you see a film in 3D. It wouldn't be the same mind-blowing experience without it.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock, and I never thought I would say this (since she is one of my least favorite actresses of all time), is absolutely perfect as Dr. Ryan Stone. I will be completely shocked if I don't see her name in the best actress category at the Oscars and, unlike her undeserving win for the Blind Side, she deserves the spot. This is possibly her best performance EVER. In fact, I'll be routing for her. George Clooney doesn't give a lot of presence to the film, but I think that's an ideal choice in lending poise and power to Bullocks stellar performance (no pun intended).<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest science fiction films of the past, well, EVER. I know I've been throwing the word around a lot, but I don't often use it so freely. It's one of those rare cases, and I mean very rare, where every aspect of a film deserves the magic word at the end. Most technically beautiful film EVER? Check. One of the most intense and believable films EVER? Roger. The best film of the year and possibly EVER? Copy Houston, and luckily, we don't have any problems.<br/><br/>2 Cox Up! WAY UP!"

","Alfonso Cuaron did a remarkable job in making a space action thriller that doesn't require a life and death situation with aliens or robots, instead crafting a simple story of things that go wrong really bad, really fast. The main attraction of the film is the excellent cinematography, the clever use of sound and silence, as well as the competent performances by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.<br/><br/>The plot is brilliantly uncomplicated, so much so that telling it to you won't even be spoiler. While our heroes are in orbit installing some thingamajig for NASA, Russia shot their satellite which exploded into shrapnel traveling faster than a speeding bullet orbiting the earth, causing a catastrophic chain reaction. Watching Bullock and Clooney scrambling to avert one disaster to another and find a way back onto earth, is surprisingly thoroughly engaging.<br/><br/>Cuaron even manages to fill in some human elements into the story by having Bullock's character Dr Ryan Stone, recount her life back on earth without being contrived. George Clooney does an admirable performance as the cool-headed Lieutenant Kowalski who guides Dr Stone to safety.<br/><br/>Overall, a really really good film. Recommended."

A gratuitous back story, and unbelievable ways for Bullock to get out of situations by figuring out how to read Chinese and Russian, etc., etc. I really expected her to have a shark try to try to eat her at some point in the movie, only to be foiled by the voice of her deceased daughter in her head telling her how to fight off a shark.

"rstrauss-91869","Null","10","18","11 June 2016"," Not flawless but stunning!
","""You have to see this movie on the big screen otherwise it's boring and non-satisfying!"" In my opinion that's just nonsense. Of course the experience is better but even though I didn't get the chance to see it in theater I was still stunned when I saw it at home for the first time. First of all let's get to the overall plot: A team of astronauts are out in space to repair the Hubble telescope when a Russian satellite is getting hit by a rocket and now wreckage of this satellite is about to collide with them. After that the only goal of everyone who survived this accident is to get back to earth alive. Gravity isn't a Science Fiction movie, it's more of a nerve-racking thriller. The main characters are played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who both do an excellent job but this flick isn't outstanding because of the great acting or the story, it's the superior technical level this movie is on. Whether you talk about sound, which of course isn't always around as you are in space, so the most of the time you just listen to the powerful soundtrack, the impressive visuals when thousands of pieces of metal fly by you, or just the camera movement by Emmanuel Lubezki who won several Oscars for a good reason. In the first few minutes you get to see a very long shot which really involves you into the catastrophic events. Even when you are just at home lying on your couch you feel sick in the stomach when crew-members are tumbling around. It's really rare that I can feel for the characters that much as in Gravity, which gets supported by POV (point of view) shots here and there. That's why I don't get why a lot of people are complaining about this movie being boring, as he doesn't let you breathe a lot during the short run-time of 91 minutes. The only concern I got with the film is a very clich√© turning point within the movie, but I don't want to spoil things here so I'll just leave you with that. This aspect gets easily dubbed by all the other great things I mentioned. In the end Gravity isn't just a movie, it's more of an experience you should witness. Don't get turned off by people complaining about watching the movie at home although a big TV and some good headphones or a surround system are recommendable. Overall it's not perfect but definitely worth a watch!"

","Let's get it out of the way - this film has beautiful effects and camera shots, especially in IMAX + 3D.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie. I wanted to be immersed in it and live in a different world for a little while. I was unable to do that so let me try to save you the same disappointment.<br/><br/>The first problem is with the mission team. We have one man in a ""prototype"" jet pack zooming around without a tether while telling rambling stories, another man bouncing around on a tether like a child giddy with zero-g excitement, and a woman attempting to install a device into the Hubble telescope. Houston repeatedly asks the woman how she is doing since her vitals are concerning - it turns out she is very uncomfortable in space and is trying not to freak out or throw up. She is unable to get the device successfully installed.<br/><br/>What? What kind of astronaut team is this? <br/><br/>Soon things go bad, for a vaguely plausible reason. Here, at 10% in, the film ceases to be about space, science, science fiction, humanity, relationships, or anything interesting and becomes a story about one person's inability to cope. In the foreground there are of course the eye candy, the explosions, and the jarring soundtrack, but the drama is forced mainly by character flaw and comes across as overblown and surprisingly misogynistic. The protagonist is also the antagonist. Bleh<br/><br/>This director did a great job with Children of Men, so I guess he should stick to adaptations.<br/><br/>For a better experience, check out Space Cowboys or the 3D film at the Kennedy Space Center of real astronauts doing the real thing which I found much more immersive and exciting."
"ericdrumz","10","25","55","17 October 2013"," A stunning, game-changing, cinematic achievement.
","OK, so I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm in one of those funky-ass, quasi-writer's-block ruts where I've written one of my characters into a corner, and now can't decide whether to solve the problem or just scrap 8 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>Until I do, here's a few quick thoughts about ""Gravity,"" which my girlfriend and I went and saw on a day date yesterday afternoon. I'm not writing this to be read by anybody, mind you. Rather, it's my attempt to distract myself by writing something entirely unrelated to my script, in the hopes a solution to my problem pops up when I'm not thinking about it. Feel free to adopt this perspective in your own situation the next time your boss tells you you're screwing around. You're welcome.<br/><br/>So, Gravity. Yeah. WOW. I suppose the simplest way to sum up this film is to say it is indeed, a truly new experience. In his autobiography, Charlie Chaplin recalled when he first saw Lumi√®re's ""Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat"" (1895), which simply showed a steam engine approaching a station. To him, and millions, it was magic. Such is the case here with what I refer to as director Alfonso Cuaron's cinematic ""Thriller,"" a singular evolution of storytelling that he (or anyone else, for that matter) is exceedingly unlikely to repeat in my lifetime.<br/><br/>Story-wise, though, ""Gravity"" is just your typical survival film which has been made aplenty, though, the elements are different in this setting with only a few broken spacecrafts and endless deep space. Survival films like ""Gravity"" are almost like one-off events, something that everyone should see at least once, but don't often stand the test of time. The allure of a movie like ""127 Hours"" was to see how James Franco would cut off his arm, but can anyone remember the rest of the movie? And does anyone care to? Fortunately, ""Gravity"" does have more going for it than most survival films, which primarily, is the various layers of fear: the fear of the unfamiliarity of space, the obvious fear of time, and finally the fear of not just dying but the question of how will your end come? A question I'm dealing with now in this unconscionable bitch of a script I'm trying to finish, I should add.<br/><br/>But more importantly, if you're anything like the film homer I am, ""Gravity"" is much more than a formulaic story of survival; it is an exquisite work of visual art. Unlike the 3-D technology so overly-hyped in ""Avatar,"" the fact that the screen is so lacking in clutter and action only serves to immerse you in the film. Such was the promise of 3-D IMAX years ago, finally fulfilled here. The 3-D is so seamless and natural, there were moments when I had to remove my glasses for a moment, if for nothing else than to confirm that yes, a 3-D camera angle of a girl in a lake, shot from water level, is frighteningly realistic.<br/><br/>""Frighteningly realistic."" That would also sum up this film, were it not for the fact that a mere moment after walking out of the theater, I was overcome with such emotion, I cried. As of this minute, I still have no concrete explanation for my reaction, except to speculate that while ""Gravity"" is by no means as great a film as ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Casablanca"" or ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (my favorite movie of all time), it is arguably the most beautiful cinematic experience I've ever been fortunate enough to have.<br/><br/>One last thing, I promise. Perhaps the most ironic (and tragic?) aspect of Cuaron's game-changing achievement is that part of what makes ""Gravity"" so singularly wonderful is precisely why it isn't likely to find much success once the IMAX well has run dry: I, for one, will never deign to see this film in any venue smaller than six stories. That'd be akin to going to the stadium to see your team play Game 7 of the World Series, only to sit in your car and listen to it on the radio.<br/><br/>See this, but only as it was meant to be seen.<br/><br/>OK, now back to work before the Hammer comes out here and tears me a new one."

"alex-besogonov","3","18","38","7 October 2013"," Technically stunning, but horrifying symbolically
","Technically this film is stunning. Lots of good portrayals of microgravity with very few gaffes, some of which were clearly thrown in for nice visual effects (like a helmet staying stationary in the center of a rotating and accelerating landing module).<br/><br/>Orbital mechanics are also totally bungled beyond repair: 1) You won't see debris that hits you at hyper-sonic speed - it's too fast to track with your eyes. 2) There's no way to generate such a dense debris fields even if you destroy all the satellites. Besides, it'll take days for fragments from a satellite explosion to collide with other satellites. 3) And of course, flying from Hubble telescope to the ISS using jetpack is impossible - they have wildly different orbit inclinations and heights. 4) To overtake an object far in front of you in orbit, you actually need to _brake_ - this will lower your orbit and you'll move faster. Then you need to re-boost your orbit for rendezvous. If you accelerate towards the object instead of braking, then you'll actually be moving _away_ from it (because you'll boost yourself to a higher orbit with a longer orbital period). 5) Astronauts might lose contact with Huston for a short time, but communication with the ISS and Shuttles is actually done through ground stations, not satellites. And suit radio is powerful enough that ground based amateur radio operators can actually tune and listen to it. <br/><br/>OK, these are minor details. Were they the only problems, I'd give this film 10 stars.<br/><br/>But I absolutely loathe the symbolics of this movie. It's anti-space and anti-intellectual. The whole movie tells you'll never live in space - it's sinister. It'll kill you. You only hope is to crawl back to Earth. <br/><br/>Technology is powerless. It can't even allow you to talk to your fellow humans on Earth. Your only hope is to believe in angels - you can talk with them.<br/><br/>The final scene is the most iconic - to reach the surface she actually had to shed all of the stuff touched by the space. The space suite was dragging her down. And in the one final attempt the parachute tried to engulf and drown her.<br/><br/>For this imagery and anti-progress attitude I give this film only 3 stars."

From the idiotic positioning of the ""brilliant"" engineer, Sandra Bullock, using ""eeny meeny miney mo"" to choose the critical sequence of re-entry control buttons to the preposterous actual re-entry and landing, not in an ocean (which cover 70% of the earth), but over land, and in a lake (which cover 1% of earth).<br/><br/>Finally, after plunging to Earth in a flaming capsule, Bullock emerges, unscathed, and of course scantily clad and barefoot, like a Xenon princess warrior, from the primordial mud of this idyllic lake onto its uninhabited beach. This movie was as nauseating and cringe-worthy as any that I've ever seen, but my daughter took us, so I had to sit quietly, without speaking out or throwing up until I was home alone."

","I thought Gravity did a great job with the special effects and the realism of space and the cinematography. I thought in my opinion that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were great in their roles. The film provides plenty of moments of visual awe and deep tension. So overall I thought the film was pretty decent. The movie is a visually entertaining and fun for audiences who are looking for spectacular effects and truly real visuals.<br/><br/>What made me slightly dislike the film itself was the fact that the background to the characters wasn't explained thoroughly. OK Ryan Stone's (Sandra Bullock) daughter dies but I never really felt the pain that she felt since we never got to visually see memories or her back on Earth with her daughter. Also what kind of person was Matt Kowalski, George Clooney's character. He seemed more like a guy straight out of some hick town bar who had fond memories back at home. The plot wasn't fully fleshed out and the 90 minute span of this film was just flat out BOGUS. This film could of EASILY been 30 minutes longer. Giving the time for the characters to be fully fleshed out, what the true purpose of their mission was and what they truly experienced besides some bloodshed, tears, a little drama and a safe landing home for Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock).<br/><br/>Overall this film was good but not fantastic by ANY stretch of the imagination. Do I find this film overrated? Hell yes! Do I think its a bad film by any means? NO. Its a movie simply built on eye candy, visuals and tension. Yet it had little plot and poorly fleshed out characters as well as the point of the entire mission.<br/><br/>Gravity was OK but its only worth a one time view."

"kaliveach","9","27","62","18 December 2013"," Saw it in theaters three times, just to make sure it was actually this good.
","Let me start by saying that I did not have an interest in seeing this film prior to having a discussion with my coworker about how I don't go to the movies as often anymore because the tickets are so incredibly expensive. Said coworker talked me in to spending the $11.50 for an evening student ticket by telling me that the movie was, ""made for my eyes."" Admittedly the original reason for going was more so the intrigue of gaining insight as to what type of film my coworker thought suited me so well. The first five minutes were a little slow for me. I groaned inwardly at the opening scene predicting that the movie was going to rely solely on stunning visual effects, and come out lacking in significant content. Starting minute six I was genuinely amazed. It's true the movie does contain some splendid digital effects portraying earth as a luminescent orb, hovering nearby with a somewhat omniscient presence; however, I can assure the movie does not rely on this alone. <br/><br/>This review does not contain spoilers, so I will merely state that as a film deserves every bit of hype it's getting from critics and fans alike. Sandra Bullock gives a stunning performance, I found it to be raw and charged with the exact type of nerve required for the role. The movie is full of symbolism (for any fellow lit geeks out there), and touches on some really important struggles we all face on an individual level, such as letting go of the past and not allowing it to hold us back. It has a satisfying ending, I think it can be stated confidently that the ending is in fact perfect for the scenario.<br/><br/>All of this being said, I would like to address some criticism I have read on the film. First of all, the movie does have quite a long run time. It could be a bit shorter, but this small fact in no way holds it back from being a great film (and more importantly a great story). Secondly, there are events that transpire that break the laws of physics like a baseball bat to an old car window. One of the most important skills we can have as viewers is to learn that suspending our disbelief will ultimately lead to our ability to appreciate a good story and film for what it truly is. Realistically, a good majority of films released these days have elements that could no way happen in real life. If you get hung up on things like that you won't every be able to enjoy a good movie. The movie deserves the nominations it has received, and I think deserves to win them as well. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading, I strongly recommend going to see it!"

How could a movie with an average rating of 8.5 can be a waste of time? Impossible. So I went ahead to watch it. <br/><br/>Let me tell you exactly what actually put me off. The movie had no great story. Limited dialogs of actors that really didn't have to worry much about acting since they had this astronaut helmet on most of the time. There is only one woman and one man that you see in almost the entire movie since there're no people just passing by in space. Just a few scenes that had great cinematic effects, totaling around 10-15 mins or so (probably an exaggeration) and that was it. <br/><br/>So if you're in for just a few repetitive scenes of awesome cinematics and that's it then this is a movie for you otherwise like me you'll end up looking at people around you wondering who among them would give this an 8.5<br/><br/>Hope this helps some."

","Gravity rigorously explores the human spirit and the persistence of survival through the most insufferable character possible. Ryan Stone a medical engineer whom has had six months of training is placed on a mission but thanks to the Russians, she is launched into the depths of space floating adrift having to co-ordinate her way to Earth with the help of her imagination and a manual book. Gravity may simply appear to be two people floating in space for ninety minutes to the casual observer, however it's just one. The highlight of the film Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney dies fifteen minutes in and you're left with the wailing Sandra Bullock, her character persists that every time she has been trained how to fly an escape pod in the simulator she has crashed it. Nonetheless under critical circumstances that depends on her life, reading a random page of a manual and praying to get home will prevail. Despite my evident cynicism about the film, I did admire how the film never deviated from it's predictable outcome. Someone survived."

","This movie was simply awful. The only redeeming aspects of this movie was the CG and some of the cinematography.<br/><br/>It lacked story, character development, and basically everything else that goes into making what generally qualifies as a great movie. Gravity was just an excuse to naturally take advantage of 3D where as other movies have 'forced' 3D moments that are out of place. In space though, almost any moment can be made into a 3D moment and feel natural. Also, if your easily nauseated you'll want to sit this one out or sit at the very rear of the theater. The constant spinning of objects, people, and camera shots will make you sick.<br/><br/>After seeing the trailer to this film, I had no intentions of spending my hard earned money to go see this. My girlfriend decided she wanted to go because her brother said it was an amazing film and she would pay if I went with her. So of course I went like a schmuck and figured with low expectations the film couldn't get any worse. I was wrong. I constantly found myself looking at the remaining time. Even she apologized for taking me to the film and said she would never trust her brother again.<br/><br/>If your a Bullock/Clooney/CG/3D nut, then this movie was meant for you. Outside of that, this film lacks everything that makes a film great or worthy of such reviews/ratings its currently receiving.

","These weren't the Mercury- or Apollo-trained astronauts we expect up in space. What bothered me and almost caused me to yell at the screen was that these astronauts didn't always possess that laser-sharp focus so critical in bad situations. I don't want to give away scenes, but there were too many times when a character seemed too pedestrian, no matter how little training one of them supposedly was given before being shot into space. And I still feel compelled to yell out ""Get going already!"" and perhaps ""Put out the fire for Christ's sake before it gets out of hand!"" and calmer, but questioning ""Doesn't that other suit have O2 you can tap into?"" So for me, the movie would have been much better if the characters had been true to their profession.

","In my opinion 3D represents the package of the plot, so if you want to make a good movie, first of all you must take a good plot and wrap it in a beautiful 3D package. Unfortunately almost every 3D movie being made these days by the big production companies are bulls**ts wrapped in ""outstanding"" packages. For a clear view of the quality of a movie, first you must see it in 2D and if it's good then you go to see it in 3D (like I did with ""Life of Pi"", for example). After reading so many reviews I figured it out that there are two kinds of peoples: the stupid, mindless people, products of the consumer society, for whom the package is the most important thing, no matter what's in it and the people who are not too lazy to use their brains and who are disgusted of such a huge amount of mediocrity they try to sell us, telling us, through the voice of the critics paid by them, that they are masterpieces. The fist kind is the majority so they will make more stupid movies for stupid people's money.<br/><br/>I could and I will use this review for almost all the 3D movies they made since 2009's Avatar (which, by the way, in my opinion, it's a decent movie ‚Äì I saw it only in 2D)."

Much has been said about its excellent visual effects ‚Äì but the same is true of countless other sci-fi efforts, so, no big deal there! Similarly, it was acclaimed as a tension-filled two-parter set against a forbidding backdrop: well, this type of film has been done ‚Äì and much more engagingly, if you ask me ‚Äì for years...take John Boorman's HELL IN THE PACIFIC (1968), for one! As space operas go, then, its unabashed references to the likes of PLANET OF THE APES, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (both 1968) and ALIEN (1979) only serve to expose its essential dramatic (and artistic) shallowness ‚Äì enough said! And, frankly, the decision to cast stars (annoying Sandra Bullock and narcissistic George Clooney ‚Äì yeah right, I totally buy them as astronauts¬Öwhich goes to show that very little has changed from the practices redolent during the old studio system, where they used to cast Caucasian actors as all sorts of ethnic types) in what clearly amounts to character roles is ample proof that the producers themselves did not have enough faith that the premise would sell itself! <br/><br/>Thankfully, the intrinsic streamlining also extends to the film's running-time, so we do not get any tear-jerking flashbacks to Bullock's tragic past on Earth; even so, her assumption that she does not know how to pray is as clich√©d as they come! Anyway, the narrative is taken up by scientific jargon (which we have all been suffering from these last 50 years or so), panic attacks (contact with Base is invariably lost early on: incidentally, Ed Harris has been typecast as the voice of Houston ever since APOLLO 13 {1995}!), floating all too easily between various space stations (most of them conveniently unworkable ‚Äì being peopled by corpses, boasting non-English friendly equipment, oddly self-combustible or simply meteorite targets)! As for its visually arresting 'silent' sequences of the extensive shuttle damage, again, this is no novelty (Michelangelo Antonioni did something similar a good 45 years ago with ZABRISKIE POINT!) and, in any case, it eventually wears thin with the repetition! And is it not a downright cheat to have Bullock fantasize about Clooney 'bailing her out' when all hope seemed lost (by the way, his lengthy conversations with the heroine in an attempt to reassure and guide her, while he is himself headed for certain death, come off as comical more than anything else)?! <br/><br/>One might argue that I have said very little in the movie's favour to justify even its ""average"" rating: this alone speaks volumes about the way modern cinema generally leaves me cold ‚Äì with very few titles made in the recent past that I deem worthy of more than a cursory glance...!"

","I've just returned from a 4DX screening (moving seats, artificial wind, etc.), and my childhood dream has come true: I have spacewalked! I studied to be a physicist, I love sci-fi and I did have an idea about the challenges you face as an astronaut - as space is really hostile towards life (your oxygen running out, pressure to be kept, micrometeorites, lack of gravity and it's consequences). Once I heard about the movie's basic setup, 2 astronauts bound to each other after a space accident, I knew what problems they would be facing: the loneliness, the tiny chance for survival, no room for mistakes, but room for heroics, emotions and sacrifice. I thought it's a fantastic setup for a movie-maker to exploit.<br/><br/>Well, let me tell you: I got much more than I expected!<br/><br/>The visuals rip you right out of your comfort-zone on Earth, where you always know where up/down/left/right is. The enormous speed differences in flying objects and you, the fact that you can just drift away with nothing to hold on makes you re-think the rules you are used to.<br/><br/>I've really loved how the story actually gives a great physics education to the audience about how things are in space, without explicitly saying so (great for kids). All this with such incredible visuals that you simply cannot avoid being IN the suit, IN the story, being thrown around, fearing for YOUR life.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock and George Clooney don't let us down with their acting. Clooney is not one bit less than we are used to, but Bullock, she gives as Oscar-worthy performance. In most scenes she is alone, and has to carry the movie along alone - a demanding task ‚Äì but she does with such emotional expression that makes this probably her best film.<br/><br/>I dare to say there's actually a third actor: Earth itself. You've never seen it's face like this before, in so many colors, during the day and at night, and you get a special rare view of something too - I let you find that out in the theatre...<br/><br/>Ladies: even if you are totally uninterested in space-movies, this one will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will give you the emotional catharsis you might expect from a really outstanding movie.

Well, and I did keep my word and finally today I went and watched the much awaited movie of the year (at least for me it was). For people who think that a movie should have an ensemble cast, try this one! You are sure to be in short of words and you are sure to redefine cinema. GRAVITY begins with the magnificent and the breathtaking (literally) view of the mind boggling space that we have seen only on NASA footage and other documentaries. The view positively gives you the wish to join a space research organization. The silence will make you fall in love with it and the darkness will make you fall in love with the loneliness. You are introduced to Matt (George Clooney), Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Shariff (Phaldut Sharma) physically. As an Indian I also liked the Hindi song Shariff hums for a moment. <br/><br/>It is all going well until a Russian missile gets released and the entire mission and their Hubble Telescope are hit and thrashed into pieces. Will all the three survive? Do they have a way for survival when the three are not even etched to each other? Will Ryan make it when her oxygen levels are falling rapidly?<br/><br/>GRAVITY is surely one of the best movies made in the year. For a common man who does not understand the technical or the scientific aspects of the real astronomical world, this is a real breathtaking adventure. When Sandra Bullock counts each of her breath, we realize the importance of the air and the amount of oxygen we 'take for granted'. When George Clooney says 'sip like a wine and not beer', you are drawn into a reality wherein we realize that we are privileged of many things. As we progress with the film the fact sinks in that there is not much of a conversation in the movie (the script writers have definitely saved some papers regarding that) which makes it even more special. The close up shots take us through the journey of Ryan so closely that we start seeing everything being her. There is not a moment in the movie where you feel drifted away from the story or take your eyes off from the screen.<br/><br/>With less dialogues and more to convey through actions, I give it to the entire cast and crew of the movie. And specially take a bow, Alfonso Cuaron, the director of the movie for making this master piece look so real and believable. What shall I say about Sandra Bullock and and George Clooney! Can I put all the affirmative adjectives for their brilliant performances? <br/><br/>As I write this I still have a heavy lump in my throat. I am not that much of an emotional person when it comes to movies. But this I must say, is a definitely not-a-miss movie.<br/><br/>If you had not watched it yet, do not make any plans for this weekend and just go for it. You will not regret this one."

George Clooney beautifully portrays a man that stays calm through extreme situations. This film would not be what it is without him. Sandra Bulloock does a great job some of the time but you feel the sense that sometime she is really forcing portraying the character of Dr. Ryan Stone in some situations but not so much that it was unbearable to watch. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n really out did himself here. The screenplay was well written no complaints there and the music score at the end just emotionally draws you in even more while watching this masterpiece.

More specifically at this moment in time, Matt is trying to set a record for space-walking while keeping an eye on Ryan, who is on her first mission. Bad news arrives. Russia shot a missile into the sky and it hit another satellite, breaking it into bits. Now debris is headed for the USA station. Matt orders Ryan inside yet she is reluctant to leave a job almost done. As the waste comes at them, the station is destroyed, Ryan is hurled into space and Matt is loosely tethered to a part of the station. Yet, although the other crew members have died, all may not be lost for Ryan and Matt. First, the older astronaut rescues Ryan from flying off into space. Then, if the two can make it, space walking, to a Russian station nearby, they can fly one of the Russkies' shuttles home. It will not be easy but, they have a chance. On the way to their oasis, however, landing on the station becomes tricky. Soon, Matt is in jeopardy and he sacrifices himself for Ryan, knowing its the only choice. Scared to the core, what more must Ryan do to make it back to earth? How can she do it all by herself? Ah, but she may have inner resources left, ones she doesn't even know she has! This fabulous, unique film has to be seen, especially on a big screen. Its thrilling story is enhanced by spectacular performances, direction and cinematography.

The shots, angles, lightning and general feel make you believe you are in space.<br/><br/>I don't want to give any spoilers away, but please do yourself a favor and go see this movie."

","Being a huge Scifi fan I was expecting a lot from this film, it blew my mind....it has everything. This could change the way films are made, I thought Avatar was ground breaking but Gravity is ""out of this world""....stop reading this and go see it in the Cinema now...do not wait to see this at home. Its a true cinematic experience beyond anything I have seen before. When you read how they made this film you really can see the talent of Sandra Bullock and Clooney shine through, they are true masters of their craft. Devlopment in technology is taking film making to a new level, films that could have only been dreamt of a few years ago are now becoming a reality and we are benefiting in a huge way. More please!"

","On one level this film is a triumph in 3D technology. It's use is restrained yet glorious in places where it needs to be. In a refreshing twist the trailer gives away all but a tiny fraction of the most impressive 3D scenes. But for all of the gorgeous cinematography and breathtaking 3D action moments where you can't help but hold your breath (nearly the whole film!) where Gravity triumphs are what it has to say about humanity, and what it means to be alive and to be human; We're all infants in the universe but on earth we're all in it together even if sometimes life isn't what we had planned. Gravity explores us to enjoy the ride, whatever that may be. <br/><br/>If I could give my fellow humans a couple words of advice, bring tissues. Lots of them. 9/10"
"BretonFianderAMC","10","5","8","7 October 2013"," This is the most tense I've been in a theatre ever
","*This review may contain minor spoilers! You've been warned* Gravity tells the story of two astronauts who end up adrift in space after a huge chunk of debris hits their ship and have to try getting back to Earth. The first thing I want to say about this movie is that it's intense, OK? Like the title suggests, this was the most tense I've been in a theatre in my life, so if you like movies that are really intense, this movie is definitely for you, if not, I'd skip it. Don't worry, that's not the end of the review.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock in this movie was absolutely terrific in her role, although you could tell she was in the most intense situations in this movie out of her and George Clooney's character, who also did a great job, although I thought he didn't have as much screen-time as he should have in this movie. Speaking of which, the scene in the movie where he's being pulled adrift from Sandra Bullock, that would never happen in a real life scenario, they're in free-fall for crying out loud, she would have been able to pull him back! Come on! Another very big gripe I have with this film is the ending, not that I hated it, but it was honestly fairly predictable, I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but all I'm gonna say is it's either one thing or another. Also, this is a bit of a spoiler review, so if you're reading this you already know George Clooney is drifting in space for almost the entire second half... oops.<br/><br/>Anyways, back to the positive things about the movie. The thing that impressed me the most was that there weren't very many cuts in the movie at all, many of the shots in the film, especially in the beginning were long takes, but one thing I will say is for the long takes and someone screwed up on their lines, man it must have sucked re-doing that. Another thing that I liked is that in some points of the movie, the music gets so loud, and cut to the next shot where it's really quiet, some people might not have been huge fans of that, but I really liked that about the movie. There was also no sound effects where there shouldn't be which I really appreciated, even if there was sound effects in the trailers to make it seem more exciting.<br/><br/>This is also undoubtedly one of the most visually stunning movies I've ever seen, it's up there with 'Avatar', the J.J. Abrams 'Star Trek' movies, and 'Inception', and also other movies that I can't think of off the top of my head. I've made it up in my mind that this will win best visual effects at the Academy Awards, I don't care what everyone else says, it will win! If it doesn't, that's perfectly OK with me, as long as it's nominated, I'm happy.<br/><br/>You know that moment when you can feel/hear your heart beating? Gravity has a lot of those moments, that proves how intense this movie really is, and I feel like the 3D made the movie very worth watching, as it's some of the best 3D I've seen all year, especially when you had debris flying towards the screen, it just looked great and didn't seem like a gimmick in this movie, because they made it work, and I know director Alfonso Cuaron said that most 3D movies are crap, but I feel like this is one of the biggest exceptions. This movie's also intense because this situation could actually happen, it also makes you not want to be an astronaut because of that.<br/><br/>Overall, Gravity is most likely in my top 3 movies of 2013, it's up there with Man of Steel, Star Trek Into Darkness, Iron Man 3, and Pacific Rim, I'm going to give it a 10/10, I didn't really find any negatives except for the predictable ending and the fact they defied physics, but other than that, I think Gravity is a must-see film, especially in theatres, and in 3D. I hope you liked this review, and I hope this entices you to see the film yourself, keep mining guys."
"leluyuhw","10","5","8","27 September 2013"," A space age version of the Life of Pi
","In space, there is no sound. In space, there is no light; not in the way there is light on earth. In space where air is limited, you need to breathe in sips, not gulps; wine, not beer. In space, you need to keep calm. After watching space-survival drama Gravity, I was anything but. In the hours following the rolling of the credits, like Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) midway through the film, I had difficulty breathing - suffering from shortness of breath and light-headedness. Like her, I surrendered to a symbolic death through an imbecilic impromptu interview with a local news channel collecting intelligent quotes from departing theatre goers; again, I was anything but. And like Dr. Stone, I am reborn, with my faculties recollected and my thoughts sufficiently organised to share my thoughts on a film I exclaimed to be a ten from a scale of one to five.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert; I begin with the obvious ‚Äì for me the best part about the film really began when Dr. Stone and I both realised that Ltn. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) was not going to make it. When he cut the cord and drifted off into the endlessness of space, I appreciated - not for the first time ‚Äì the relief of no longer having to endure his trademark smartass sass and smarmy smugness. <br/><br/>Yes. The man is painfully handsome and ages like it'll never go out of style but this film effectively demonstrates the best way to utilise his undeniable charms; with restraint - and sparingly at that. ""Learn to let go,"" were some of his last words to Dr. Stone before his premature departure and imminent screen death. With the archaically unbearable but somehow still requisite 'stud gets the girl' ending common to his oeuvre thus effectively denied, all I have to say is ""K. Thanks. Bye."" And so with the distraction of Clooney blissfully out of the way, the story tightens its focus onto the lovely Sandra Bullock and boy, what a knockout she is. As the emotional centre of the film, Ms. Bullock deploys a masterfully controlled performance; her scenes pendulating between the two extremes of space related phobia - playing out extreme claustrophobia from within the confines of her fishbowl helmet ‚Äì a crown I once thought will forevermore belong to Robert Downey Jr.'s many in- helmet close-ups in Iron Man - all through to the Kegel exercise inducing agoraphobia of open space.<br/><br/>With director Alfonso Cuar√≥n's camera oftentimes stuffed into the limited airspace of her space suit, we are made to share the world from Dr. Stone's limited point of view . What with the panic of her uncontrolled spinning after being forcibly untethered from the spacecraft, her O2 levels running low, when warning beeps was the only sound we could hear, as well as the unparalleled horror of smashing into space freeze-dried colleagues and the terror of weightlessness by proxy, it's no wonder space tourism hasn't exactly caught on and I hope it never does.<br/><br/>All of that amounting to what could possibly be the best cinematic representation of Murphy's law in recent times, Gravity is also an exercise in frustration with the many times Dr. Stone just couldn't seem to catch a break. If Dr. Stone were Asian, she'd be well advised to take a nice long bath in air bunga to buang sial. From busted spacecraft after busted spacecraft to a recurring hailstorm of space debris followed by a near drowning after her re-entry onto Earth, Cuar√≥n seems plenty determined to make the odds for her survival as insurmountable as possible. <br/><br/>In counterpoint to the visual chaos of each catastrophic sequence of events however is the film's eerie but scientifically accurate use of silence. Put together with the various digitally rendered vistas of Earth as seen from space, an apt background is built for the films unexpectedly spiritual exploration of death and rebirth. Cuar√≥n delivers stunning scene after stunning scene - a near naked Sandra Bullock suspended in a foetal curl in zero gravity, a drawn and exhausted Dr. Stone finding peace in the resignation of her impending death, her literal resurrection from that death when she finally lets go of the guilt for her daughter's death, the kicking and struggling of her underwater emergence from the womb-like confines of the spacecraft descent module - the visual metaphors come aplenty.<br/><br/>Headlined by Hollywood heavyweights Clooney and Bullock and a kick-ass digital team, the film could have stopped at being a run of the mill space adventure romp and still bring in enviable ticket sales worldwide. Packaged together with Cuar√≥n's solid story-telling, emphatic acting and its spiritual undertone however, Gravity ultimately sets an almost unfairly high benchmark I don't expect the Hollywood blockbuster space travel genre can reach anytime soon."

"bobvader99","9","5","8","6 October 2013"," Visually stunning, a surely memorable experience.
","When I was a kid, once I dreamed to be an astronaut. And sometimes my friends like to scare me that astronauts might not get back to Earth for several reasons, like running out of oxygen. Now I get to see Sandra Bullock and George Clooney floats around in space, a situation like once I used to fear.<br/><br/>Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer doing her first space mission, accompanied by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). Everything seems smooth and goes as planned, until a Russian satellite was destroyed by their own missile, and the extremely high speed debris are going Stone and Kowalski's way. Out of nowhere, shower of the satellite debris come right at them and destroyed their space shuttle, leaving them completely alone 600 km above Earth.<br/><br/>Low on oxygen and jet-pack fuel, Stone and Kowalski are stranded in zero-gravity environment. The communications with the terrestrial space command are lost, and they have to rely on each other to survive in this extreme environment. And in the next 90 minutes, their hope on survival could get destroyed‚Äîby the debris itself. And things are gonna get worse, believe me.<br/><br/>One word‚Äîor two: Visually stunning. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n‚Äîwhich has been on a hiatus after his last feature film, Children of Men‚Äîmade a great comeback with this critically acclaimed survival sci-fi drama, Gravity, soaring on top of Rotten Tomatoes with 98% fresh and a-96 Metascore rating in the first week of the release.<br/><br/>Cuar√≥n and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki guarantee that you will hold you breath and make your jaw drop for 90 minutes. Yep, right from the start of the flick, a great 13 minute long opening shot, starting with a narration to describe how does it feel to be in space. Every scene is intense, thrilling, and makes you feel like you're also stranded with Bullock and Clooney, trying to survive no matter how. With intense scoring from Steven Price. A score + cinematography combo covers the simple‚Äîor I may call it plain‚Äîstoryline. While Cuar√≥n can't really develop the story any further, the score and beautiful cinematography are what keeping audiences awake and hold their breath.<br/><br/>There are several survival films out there, such as Buried, 127 Hours, or even the classic Cast Away. But they don't give you this 90 minutes full of thrill and seat gripping, heart pounding moments, that's the point. Gravity will make you blown away and rant throughout the film.<br/><br/>The two main casts, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney‚Äîboth Oscars winners‚Äîshowed their true quality in acting. Every emotions, either it is nauseated, nervous, scared, or even relieved is portrayed flawlessly by Bullock. And Clooney? He's flamboyant and charming as usual. No need to doubt their acting skills.<br/><br/>Basically, Gravity is one of a kind cinematic experience. It's designed for you to feel what the main characters are feeling, see what they are seeing. It's designed to be enjoyed on either IMAX or 4DX, while choosing 3D is a must to experience the best. It's up to you to choose either a stunning visual on a huge IMAX screen, or be part of the movie by choosing the cutting-edge 4DX technology.<br/><br/>Gravity in 4DX is one hell of an experience. It's a space simulator, with vibrating and moving seats, it feels like you're experiencing the same thing happening with Stone & Kowalski. Not just that, sharp wind shots and fogs effect that occur several times during the film add additional enjoyment. The 3D itself is amazing, and certainly worth the additional bucks. Just forget that million-dollars space tour, and buy a 4DX or IMAX Gravity ticket.<br/><br/>If you think this Gravity hype is just a buzz, it isn't. Gravity is so beautiful even in regular non-IMAX screens. With amazing special effects and shot techniques, Gravity is a masterpiece. 90 minutes flew so fast, as fast as the debris. A strong candidate for next year's Oscars Best Pictures nominee, and a must see for all you film snobs."

","This movie grabs you by the throat and thrusts you into the action like no other movie in recent memory. Never have I felt the sheer terror, the utter horror of the events that unfolded on the screen before me as if I were right there experiencing it. This is a testament to the fantastic writing and phenomenal direction which let nothing fall through the cracks. The claw marks will likely remain upon the seat I occupied for quite some time as I felt like I was holding on for dear life for the entire movie. Intense, engrossing, visually impressive and persistently memorable. This is the reason we go to the movies! Do not miss this one and if you can see it IMAX-3D, it's well worth the pennies!"
"socrates99","9","5","8","4 October 2013"," What an utterly worthwhile experience this is
","Like me you've probably pondered whether the planet might be better off without us humans. And maybe it would, but Sandra Bullock and director Alfonso Cuaron make a pretty good case for our having some redeeming qualities despite our usually reckless behavior. Early on in this movie I began to realize that there's no one I'd rather spacewalk with than Ms. Bullock, if only in 3-D IMAX. We're meant to care what happens to the lead, engineer Ryan Stone, and the movie focuses on and depends on that performance; I personally am convinced no other actress could have pulled this off like the endearing Ms. Bullock and I'd be very surprised if she wasn't nominated for an Academy Award.<br/><br/>This movie is a wonderful, old-style science fiction movie where ordinary dreamers like you and I get a chance to muse about the reality of being in space. I remember as a kid thinking up pretty much the same sort of not-so-simple adventure as here though not nearly in such detail. That our guides are Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney is just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The earth looms below us throughout and it's made very clear how fragile life becomes away from it. Everything is about oxygen, electronics, and the ship, its fuel and its structural integrity. And one thing more, the daunting dynamics of moving in space play a very large and effective role here. Don't expect everything to be rock solid logical, there's at least one liberty taken, just enjoy the trip and you'll be very well rewarded. Any flaws amount to nothing compared to the soaring achievement of the movie itself as an unforgettable entertainment. For once it's unlikely you'll feel cheated being charged extra for either the IMAX or the 3-D, though I suspect those who see this movie without them will still feel quite well satisfied."
"juicyfruitjrod","5","37","93","19 September 2013"," Great visuals, boring movie
","I was super excited when I heard I got tickets to see this at a free 3-D screening. I am a huge sci-fi fan and I love movies that take place in space. I went in expecting what I had read in other reviews, a great sci-fi thriller. I guess I did not see the same movie as them. I saw a movie with almost nothing to go on except Sandra Bullocks emotions. It relies way too much on the viewer putting themselves in her shoes. She is an incredible actress but just showing her getting emotional and freaking out for an hour and a half is not a good movie. You barely learn anything about the characters. The ending is predictable. The only thing this movie has going for it is the visuals and the sound. The view of Earth and the shuttles and stations look great. This could have been a much better movie. I get that they were probably trying to make it very claustrophobic and wanted you to ride the same stressful and emotional roller coaster as Bullock but it's hard to do when you're sitting in a comfy chair on Earth and barely know a thing about her character. Don't expect an action packed thriller or even a smart sci-fi that makes you think and you might like it. Really, this movie is barely sci-fi. I'm glad I did not pay to see this.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Fairly predictable, boring way too often, looks great."
"jtoeman","6","19","43","13 September 2013"," Good, but not great
","Let me start by disclaiming ""spoiler free"" - I assume you have seen a preview or read at least enough to know the most basic premise of the film. If you truly have no idea what it's about, well, I make references to content used in the trailers. But seriously, if this does describe you, why are you on IMDb and reading a review at all? <br/><br/>The Good: * Beautiful, amazing, breathtakingly phenomenal cinematography. I honestly feel closer to having an idea of what being in space might be like as a result of the way this was shot. * Solid acting. I felt the characters were genuine, and Clooney/Bullock fit their roles quite well - in fact I'm surprised at any negativity toward the acting. * Suspenseful. Cuaron did a great job keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, and had a solid balance between slowly built, drawn out sequences and other ""gotcha"" kind of moments. * Dialogue and characters. Great blends of comic and serious, deep and light, etc moments. Very well put together from that end. <br/><br/>The Bad: * Repetitive events. You know that scene in the preview where someone is grabbing on to some space ship part for dear life, and it appears that if they miss it they will be lost in space forever? Yeah, I've now seen that moment a few dozen times, to the point where I'd predict a Gravity Drinking Game around it. It's just too much, and while I get it that that's a big part of the premise, it becomes nearly comical after the first few times it occurs. * Too many crises. If you've read the trivia around Apollo 13, you've probably noticed they deliberately removed some of the events that transpired in real life from the film, mostly because they didn't think the audience would find it believable. In Gravity, I felt that the cascading series of mishaps were just too many from start to finish. I think numerous moments could've been reduced or removed completely and the end result would've been more gripping. Instead, I kept getting that feeling where my suspension of disbelief was being taxed. * Too many ""last possible moment"" sequences. To avoid spoiling anything, just imagine a caper movie where the bomb is set to go off, and after a ton of action, the bomb is defused with less than a second to go. Now do it 3 or more (I've lost count) times in the same movie. It certainly builds up tension, but also increased the ""okay, now they are just messing with me"" effect. * The trailer. While I'd say it's a tossup between Drive and Hancock as to ""worst expectation setting for a movie, EVER,"" I'd say Gravity's trailer is on thin ice. If you've paid too much attention to it, it's pretty ridden with spoilers (thankfully I had not seen it more than once before going into the movie). But if you also just saw it once or twice, you'd probably be thinking it's a non-stop space action flick. It isn't, and if you are unfamiliar with the director's other works, you should definitely pay them some attention first. The movie paces really well actually, but it's a much more drawn-out film than I think a lot of people will expect. * Annoying 3D. I wish I'd seen the IMAX 3D version, maybe that would change my feelings here. As it is, I didn't, and other than 2-3 ""really cool"" uses of 3D, it was pretty superfluous to the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I have negative feeling about it. Per the above, it was wonderfully put together, but ultimately I felt the movie spent more time trying to manipulate me with unnecessary tension. I think the basic premise was suspenseful and dramatic enough, but had several too many ""and now we'll find a way for *another* crazy bad thing to happen"" moments for me. I wish that weren't the case, as I really did want to like it. Assuming you'll ignore this - my only advice is to definitely see it in the theaters, in IMAX if you can."
"madorosh","3","14","30","6 October 2013"," See it for the visuals, but the film is about theme rather than plot
","One of my absolute favourite cinema experiences was seeing Magnificent Desolation in IMAX 3-D. Having had a long-time interest in Project Apollo, it was amazing to sit in the audience and feel like I was actually on the moon, or in the actual spacecraft involved with the lunar landings. Knowing that I was watching history come to life left me with a lump in my throat, a feeling I still get every time I put From The Earth To The Moon in my DVD player and replay Tom Hanks' 10-part mini-series, which I do on a regular basis.<br/><br/>The visuals of Gravity in 3-D are no less stunning, and other reviewers, professional and amateur, have spoken well to them, in particular the opening 17-minute shot which leaves one feeling as if they, too, are right there, on a mission over the Earth.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film quickly departs from logic. The director has admitted that science has taken a back-seat to story, and this understandable - even forgivable. I can understand a certain necessity to putting all the space stations and ships on the same orbital plane in order to tell a good story.<br/><br/>However, there is no story here either. The director basically has opted to provide a theme - ""rebirth"" - and has used a space setting in order to paint this theme for the audience in sometimes subtle, sometimes broad strokes. This may appeal to the artistically minded, it will certainly clash with those, like myself, who were drawn in by the rave reviews about the technical merits of the photography.<br/><br/>The characterization is minimal, and perhaps most disappointing given her usual brilliant performance, Bullock is used here as a 'damsel-in-distress'. We are led to believe she has been selected for astronaut training and employment as a mission specialist, but we don't get to see her in whatever element she was chosen for. Instead, we see her fumble through routine repairs, dropping tools, complaining about space-sickness, and ultimately screaming in fright, crying, confessing to the strains of single-parenthood, admitting she can't fly the re-entry modules, but managing to do so anyway, through blind luck. And thus she is ""reborn"".<br/><br/>And in case you don't ""get it"", she floats in an airlock in a fetal position, wrapped in an umbilical cord for long, pointless seconds, as Clooney's character drifts off into the void, incommunicado, as she ensures the audience buys into the ""rebirth"" theme, before floating down the tunnel to make contact.<br/><br/>It's not such a bad theme, but the actual space program is about so much more than blind luck and damsels in distress. I understand movies need to have peril and conflict - which can include inner conflict. The device here of having Clooney return was handled so abruptly, I simply assumed it was a bit of science the film-makers had simply gotten wrong, and the gasps and muttering of other audience members in the cinema suggested they felt the same way. It would have been much more satisfying to see astronauts behaving like actual astronauts, and not fretting about whether or not they had ""learned how to pray"" correctly.<br/><br/>There was nothing about any (both) of these characters that made me care about them, and the fact that Bullock's survived by pushing buttons like a chimp in a food experiment actually made me a bit angry.<br/><br/>Such excellent photography and visuals, and two brilliant actors, are wasted here on a non-story by a director who dwelled entirely on theme."
"loco_73","Null","14","30","5 October 2013"," How Sandra Bullock killed Gravity...
","Over a decade ago, I was lucky enough to catch this movie called ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (roughly translated ""...And Also Your Mother"") by this up and coming Mexican director, Alfonso Cuaron. Needless to say that that movie's brilliance put Cuaron on my list of directors whose movies are a must see.<br/><br/>Few directors names alone compel me to see a movie of theirs, but Cuaron is one of those few. Over the intervening years there has been a rebirth and resurgence of sorts in Latin American cinema, and Cuaron had a lot to do with that. Plus, Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna were really brought to the forefront by Cuaron...and that is not bad in my book!<br/><br/>I followed Cuaron ever since and have thoroughly enjoyed his movies. Among them, ""Harry Potter And The Prizoner Of Azkaban"", which remains, for me at least, the best entry in the Potter franchise (I wish he had directed more of them), and the absolutely brilliant and stunning ""Children Of Men"".<br/><br/>So it was with great anticipation that I went to see ""Gravity"". Boy, oh boy, did that anticipation ever crash and burn! I was not prepared for what transpired, and the feeling of frustration I experienced as a movie fan.<br/><br/>Let me say at the outset, that ""Gravity"" is an achievement in technical and visual terms. There are some shots in there that are absolutely stunning and incredible. The film is just beautiful to look at, the effects are just as excellent and the 3D really works and is not simply an add-on as is the case in soo many other big-budget counterparts (the last movie I've seen 3D used in such an efficient manner was ""Dredd"").<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is nothing new under the sun story-wise. A space mission gone awry and the fight for survival which ensues in the aftermath of the catastrophic event which causes said failure. The characters are also nothing to write home about. So all in all, a formulaic tale populated with formulaic leads, yet still a compelling and interesting premise.<br/><br/>George Clooney has a pretty limited engagement in the movie so he is NOT critical mass...<br/><br/>...and then there was Sandra Bullock. Sandra Bullock has to be one of the most mediocre and over-hyped actresses I have seen. She gets by on excuses and allowances that people make for her, which they shouldn't. Her Oscar win in ""The Blind Side"", though the Oscars are becoming more and more irrelevant with each passing year, was unwarranted and awarded truly more on the basis of ""oh well she is America's sweetheart, paid her dues, so this is as good an opportunity as any"". But I digress...<br/><br/>I sat watching with stunned disbelief at how she managed to take apart the movie and really destroy it! Whatever Cuaron achieved as a director, was undone by Bullock's terrible, sub-par performance. This movie is proof positive that casting is truly important, and that it can make or break a film. In this case it broke it! Not only is Bullock not able to carry the movie, she diminishes it. I know this might not be the most popular take on this flick and Bullock herself, I am only writing what I felt as a movie fan while watching ""Gravity"". <br/><br/>The movie literally consists of almost two hours of Sandra Bullock getting tangled, tossed around, floating and bumping into things, all accentuated by her obnoxious, whinny, nasal and anal retentive voice.<br/><br/>If that is your cup of tea, then you'll think that the movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread! For me this film was a downer, especially considering how much I was looking forward seeing it! I can only imagine what it would have been like had another actress been cast...<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I gave this movie 3 out of 10, not because of Cuaron's direction, or the movie's technical and visual aspects or production values. I did so because Sandra Bullock literally killed ""Gravity"" with her performance!"

","Checking the 2014 Oscars Best Picture nominees list I decided to take a shot on the widely so called ""best picture of the year"" or even the 8,2 IMDb-rated movie ""Gravity"".

An emotional-disordered astronaut (I know, it does sound like a joke, but this is just the start) is sent adrift in space after a debris storm hits her spacecraft and tries to survive going from station to station. The things she does to survive and the supposed ""lucky"" she has is an insult to any human being with a reasonable intelligence. There's even a scene where she does the ""eeny, meany, miney, mo"" thing to choose a detach button from a spacecraft! And she makes it in the 2nd try!! I mean, come on, we're talking about a panel with thousands of buttons, each one with dozens of functions. You might be wondering, but how about the so talked special effects? Sincerely, they were ""ok"". Not more than that. Plus, special effects alone don't make a good movie. This movie here is one of the best examples of it. Now, 10 Oscars nominations for this crap? TEN? You gotta be joking me Academy."

"dgabrieli-2","10","3","4","9 September 2018"," An underrated masterpiece
","I'ts hard to believe, at least for me, but a lot of user reviews seem to describe Gravity as
1) a visually stunning movie, and that's all, or
2) a simply bad one.
Don't misunderstand me, it is a visually stunning movie: but that's just the surface. Gravity is a movie about grieving process. It's a story about a woman who, physically and figuratively lost in a cold and hostile universe, has to deal with her inner demons and learns to let go and forgive herself. Notice that the movie is split in two by a scene showing her naked and cowering in fetal position: that's a rebirthing.
In my opinion, Gravity is one of the most touching, well-written and original pieces of cinematography of the XXI century."
"SpaceCritic","9","3","4","20 August 2016"," A Soulful Space Thriller
","'Gravity' is a film that successfully operates on two distinct levels and may eventually come to be considered a milestone in modern cinema. On the one hand it sets new standards in visual effects, while on the other, it simultaneously details the rather poignant emotional journey of its central character, a combination which is not necessarily easy to achieve.<br/><br/>It is perhaps the first film in which there is a genuinely artistic use of 3D that feels fully natural and immersive, distinctly adding to the viewer's experience as opposed to feeling somewhat like an unnecessary frill. But it is not merely the use of 3D technology that makes this film beautiful to watch, director Alfonso Cuar√≥n's innovative use of panoramic views and detailed close ups almost create in the viewer the sense that you are floating alongside the film's protagonists, played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, as they struggle with the disaster that strikes them 375 miles above Earth.<br/><br/>Equally effective in terms of impact on the senses are the use of sound and silence. The excellent musical score and sound effects are only enhanced by carefully chosen moments of complete silence which set a distinct tone to the film in perfect keeping with the stillness of space in which the action is taking place.<br/><br/>But perhaps this film's greatest achievement is its success at presenting the unfolding emotional story of its lead character in the midst of all this silence and space debris. Touchingly portrayed by Sandra Bullock, who holds the screen on her own for much of the film, we learn of the inner personal struggle of this woman who is an emotionally damaged individual, just as the space capsules she inhabits are physically damaged.<br/><br/>See this film not just for its groundbreaking special effects and detailed sense of physical realism, but also for the particular challenge faced by its heroine - the struggle to cope with the crisis at hand and the struggle to find the courage to cope with her own self."
"FrodoPotter","9","3","4","7 March 2016"," Visual experience and should be viewed and rated as such
","I suspect that the majority of the people who dislike this movie have only seen it on small screen and/or in 2d.<br/><br/>Like Avatar, this movie was made to be a visual 3d experience, and that's exactly what it is and how it should be rated (and this is coming from someone who is usually a 3d cynic).<br/><br/>Yes, in 2d and on small screen it loses much of it's impressiveness. But you can't fully judge this movie if you have only seen it like that as that was never the way it was intended to be watched. So I can't really blame you for disliking the movie if you've never seen it as intended.<br/><br/>So please just take my advice: Watch it in 3d and it's a great experience. Watch it in 3d on the big screen and you'll be blown away."

","A Subtle Note: ""A mature audience's view of the film.""<br/><br/>Original Score: 3.5/4 Movie: ***** (5/5) Quality: ***** (5/5)<br/><br/>Gravity. The thing that keeps us down on the ground. Though don't let the weightlessness of the surface of this movie, the inconsistencies, the backlash (Mostly by the audiences, who noticed the obvious flaws of the film.) distract you from the human themes that the film has to say.<br/><br/>Astronauts Dr. Ryan Stone and Matthew Kowalski are on a mission to service the Hubble Space telescope, along with the crew of Explorer, the Spacecraft that they're traveling in. When disaster strikes, the two astronauts are the sole survivors of a wave of space debris and left adrift in orbit. With hope, they must find a way to safely return to Earth. And that's the story of Gravity that defines it as both a survival film and a thriller film.<br/><br/>Up in space, there's no oxygen, no air, and it's freezing cold. Down here on dear old Earth, there's life, there's oxygen, there's air, and there's water and food. Way down here on Earth, is where life thrives. But up there in space, there's no life. Life in Space is Impossible.<br/><br/>At the very beginning of the movie, there is a title card that explains that life in Space is impossible. Then we see the opening of the film, presenting a view of our dear old Earth from high up above in space. Before I continue, here's what you must remember: ""From the very beginning of the film, is a sequence that is filmed continuously for nearly 13 minutes STRAIGHT!"" That right, you heard me. A continuous filming shot is used at the very beginning. When you watch a film, you see that there are many jumps from here and there. Those are editing. But the film Gravity, utilizes long, continuous shots that turn around here and there. Also, there are brilliant performances given by the actors, wherever on screen or off screen voice-overs. On the other hand, you've got to admit, can't beat the view. Up there, looking down on Mother Earth. (What Cinematography and Visual effects!)<br/><br/>Now this is a very human film. The film may look simple on the outside, therefore many might choose to dismiss it as clich√©, predictable, weightless, slow, boring, you name it. Man, they're missing the REAL point about this movie. A human movie, in other words, the film has many things that wants to tell you through it's very human story. I'd define this as a human movie. Of course, there is another definition, which is the exact opposite of that. An inhuman thing. Yep, not just movies, but also certain other contents that can be defined as inhuman. If a particular content is irrelevant, annoying, intended to annoy rather than express something good. Then it's inhuman. Cynicism also goes on that list of things that are labeled ""Inhuman"", in my opinion. I have actually seen quite a lot of criticism directed by the audiences at this movie. Geez, those people are so cynical. Can't they let their experience of watching this film be a life-changing one? You'll learn to appreciate life more after you watch this movie. And as always, by watching this I was once again reminded that movies might be able to change human beings for the better through the great, humane stories that they have to tell. They enable us viewers to share an experience that may change our lives and thinking. Not all movies are like that. For some movies are irrelevant, incoherent, inhuman and evil. This one? It's a great movie. And it enables us viewers to share an experience so powerful and touching (Similar to Hotaru No Haka (1988)) that it is possible that we'll never be the same after we watch them. And therein lies the true power (and quality) of movies.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect, in terms of real life physics and certain things within, there are a few flaws here and there. Still, as I have mentioned above, let this film teach you something, as like many great movies are able to do. Ignore negativity or your cynicism, instead learn something about what this movie (and certain other movies) can do."
"vvp_14","6","3","4","17 January 2016"," Visually entertaining but mediocre
","I'm struggling to see many things in this movie that make a film great: an interesting story, favourite characters, great actors play, dialogues that you remember, thought-provoking ideas, emotional impact, and the list goes on...<br/><br/>Speaking of the plot. There isn't one. It's like watching a cat fall from a tree, desperately trying to grab hold of branches. Entertaining? Maybe. But that's pretty much the story line of Gravity. Sandra Bullock keeps flying from one ship to another, hitting and bumping into everything, making noises until she finally and happily lands on Earth.<br/><br/>It's yet another Hollywood CGI baby with no food for thought and nothing for heart. The recipe is simple and proved: hire star actors, put them in CGI and you get a blockbuster. The actors have practically nothing to say all the film, just meaningless mambo jumbo at the start. Later on, to make things not so obviously empty dialogue-wise, they bring back dead George Clooney's character to fill up some screen time. When he's gone once again, Sandra Bullock's character has no one to speak on Earth to, except to growl and bark imitating a dog. Is that a line to remember? The movie is only 1h 23min long. The empty plot just couldn't stretch any further. Unless, of course, they would bring Clooney back from the dead for the third time...<br/><br/>Despite that, it's good fun to watch, with beautifully done views of Earth and space and adrenaline ride along with Bullock' s character. it's probably worth seeing once."

","I had an excuse for missing GRAVITY when it came out . I wasn't all that keen on Mexican director's Alfonso Cuaron's CHILDREN OF MEN and I wasn't overly impressed with the rather threadbare premise of GRAVITY . Every time I discussed it with someone who'd seen it the conversation went something like this: <br/><br/>""There doesn't seem to much to it . Sandra Bullock gets trapped in space. Is that all there is to it?"" <br/><br/>""Well yes Theo but what it does it does very well and the three D is absolutely fantastic. There's a scene where..."" then I'd get details of how the magic of cinema comes to life to an IMAX large screen <br/><br/>Fair enough but I'm someone who's interested in a strong story and having a film revolve around visual set pieces not too dissimilar to CHILDREN OF MEN wasn't enough to tempt me to buy a cinema ticket for GRAVITY . Somewhat typically after seeing it on my laptop I am now kicking myself that I didn't watch it on a massive screen with 3D glasses on an IMAX screen <br/><br/>When I was about twelve years old I read Nigel Kneale's novelization of his own 1979 QUATERMASS serial and early in the story there's a space disaster where a space station breaks up . Kneale compares it to a shipwreck where the lucky ones are killed instantly because those inside the space station are not protected in the airless vacuum of space and die quickly . Not so fortunate are those space walking outside in their spacesuits and will probably survive many hours or even a couple of days until their oxygen runs out . It is a terrifying , lonely death , almost like being buried alive except being buried alive is a claustrophobic death where as drifting in space is an agoraphobic horror . Cauron nails this horror of a space death very well . What's worse: suffocating in a tiny space capsule or suffocating inside a spacesuit in the vastness of space ? Go on choose one and like every other person who has seen the film we're propelled in the shoes of Ryan Stone where if she doesn't survive the mission she will die a terrible lonely death <br/><br/>As I said the story is rather thin and concentrates on visuals and this is in no way to be taken as a criticism . Cauron uses cinematography and editing so breath taking I could barely believe my eyes . One sequence relatively early in to the film sees the camera pan in to the face of Stone , but it does stop there because the camera then pans in to the helmet of Stone the camera is actually inside the space helmet . The editing is so seamless I was gasping ""How'd they manage to do that shot ?"" . The film continues in this manner where one stunning and thrilling sequence gives way to another . In a recent review of RUSH , another film released in 2013 I asked myself why Ron Howard's movie didn't pick any up Oscar nominations but to be honest no film would stand a chance with the technical merits of GRAVITY which is absolutely perfect on a visual level , a fact reflected by its sweeping of the boards at the 2014 Oscars though it lost out to 12 YEARS A SLAVE . It must be said however that 2013 was an exceptional year for film making<br/><br/>!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!! <br/><br/>Very few films are perfection and GRAVITY is not an exception to the rule . There are a few elements of manipulation going on such as Stone being a mother therefore the audience are supposed to feel for her even more but this isn't necessary and I was totally caught up in her ordeal without the need for any backstory or violins playing over the score . There's a plot turn about two thirds of the way through that I instantly knew was a hallucination . I also have the feeling the laws of astro-physics were constantly being bended if not broken and the ending wraps everything up a bit too conveniently to be entirely credible. When this is said and done however it doesn't really matter because the flaws are very minor and the ordeals and setbacks Stone finds herself in are a testimony of humanity's courage and spirit of adventure while GRAVITY itself is a testimony to the modern wonders of cinema ."

","Sandra Bullock is in the womb (space). Labor pains happen which cause her to to leave the womb toward Mother Earth. The scene when she lands in the water and struggles to to get to oxygen is her entering this world. Notice how she kisses the beach as if it's her mothers bosom. And how she struggles to walk and has such appreciation for life because she just came so close to death. She is born again. Such a good movie! I love the suspense and graphics. My favorite scene is when she is comforted by the lullaby. There is a lot of motion going on in the beginning. The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that it can get you motion sick. So do not watch this movie if you are hungover."
"JohnnyPHreak","8","3","4","8 December 2014"," A sci-fi thriller that doubles as film art
","I didn't know how to start this review. I thought I hate Sandra Bullock was a bit too harsh. Even though it's not far from the truth. Then I came up with I'm a movie hipster sometimes. But I've done that before. What could entice some to read this? I think I have your attention now with my honesty. I could go into my hearing about Gravity and then the trailers not doing it for me. Which is also true. But I haven't seen an Alfonso Cuaron film I didn't love. I'm not saying I loved Gravity. It was better than I expect. And a side note that come to play later, the ending was spoiled for me. <br/><br/>The film follows an American crew in space as they do what astronauts do, do experiments and fix equipment. Chaos ensues when debris from a Russian satellite shoots their way. The crew scramble to find a way back to earth before the debris comes in contact with their ship. No spoilers, that is the plot of the entire film. <br/><br/>These astronauts are dealing with a catastrophe in space. A movie like this in just about anyone else's hands would have a slow burn bore. Alfonso Cuaron doesn't make boring films. The man is an artist behind the lens. The first shot of the film last fifteen minutes long. It goes places I've never seen done in a sci-fi film. He comes up some ingenious angles and trickery. <br/><br/>This is the first time that I can fully say the general movie going audience got it right. This is a movie that should make $200 million dollars or more. It's art at it's core. A small story about two people deal with adverse conditions trying not to die. The way the film is shot is unreal. The only sounds are voice and music. There is no sound in space. And I love sci-fi films in space shot that way. <br/><br/>Cuaron puts the audience in space for 90 minutes. And I would happily go back. He pulls out great performances from Clooney and Bullock. Clooney is a bona fide movie star. He brings charisma and gravitas to nearly every role he takes. He plays the grizzled veteran so well. The story he tells at the start of the film makes me feel like I was there in space with them. It sucked me into his character and placed the tension high. <br/><br/>I could watch a whole film with his character just telling stories. Bullock plays the rookie medical examiner on her first mission. Even not being a fan of hers you get why she's an Oscar winning actress. She goes through a range of emotions throughout the film that any less of an actress would haves failed early. But Cuaron makes sure we are on board with these characters before it hits the fan. <br/><br/>What makes the film standout for me is the tension. I had the ending spoiled for me two weeks before I got to the sit down with the film. By the end of the film my nerves were shot and my hands clammy. That's what I call captivating your audience. The film looks so vivid and smooth. Cuaron is auteur and we should all celebrate his being on this planet. I can't wait for this man to take over the world with his film. I could only imagine what he could do with the horror drama or a superhero film. I'm still blown away about what a fantastic piece of art this film was."

"brando647","9","3","4","13 July 2014"," In a Word: Beautiful.
","I have two major cinematic regrets from 2013. The first is that I believed that A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD couldn't possibly be as bad as the reviews were claiming. I was wrong to trust that the series might regain it's footing. Thanks, Bruce Willis. Now I have trust issues. My second regret is that I foolishly failed to catch GRAVITY in theaters. This movie is probably one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. The plot is fairly simple but the massively impressive production value more than compensates. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n has crafted a thrilling survival film set in the harshest environment humans (well, a select few anyway) have endured: space. It follows the tribulations of Dr. Ryan Stone. Stone is a mission specialist with NASA that has been sent into orbit to perform upgrades to the Hubble telescope in her first assignment. Disaster strikes on her first spacewalk when the Russians destroy one of their satellites and the debris cloud rockets around in orbit, detonating other satellites and creating a lethal wave of shredded metal careening around the Earth at 20,000 MPH. The space shuttle is destroyed and most of the crew is killed, leaving Stone and mission commander Matt Kowalski as the sole survivors left drifting above the Earth and counting the minutes until the debris' next deadly pass. Stone will need to face her fears if she hopes to survive as she and Kowalski must find a means of returning to Earth alive.<br/><br/>I'm a space geek and have been for as long as I can remember. As much as I love science fiction, and I do quite a bit, there have been few films that have ever given much effort to portray space as it actually is. There's always some sort of convenient technology to prevent the filmmakers from having to deal with the harsh realities of space travel. GRAVITY isn't science fiction but is instead a survival drama set in the environment of space, and Cuar√≥n uses the full gamut of hazards that come with leaving the Earth's atmosphere. There are no rocket boots to make maneuvering in space a simple task here. Well, there's a sort of jet pack unit used in limited capacity but the danger still remains that if Stone or Kowalski make one wrong move, they will find themselves slowly drifting off for a lonely, horrifying death as they wait for their air supply to run out. GRAVITY isn't 100% accurate to the trials and tribulations of surviving in space and some liberties were taken for the sake of telling a story, but it's so much more realistic than has been portrayed in pretty much any movie that's come before. Cuar√≥n and his team have found a way of realistically portraying total weightlessness so well that I couldn't wait to watch the behind-the-scenes footage to find out how it was done. I loved that there were no sleek, fancy spaceships and we get legitimate recreations of existing space structures such as the International Space Station.<br/><br/>And the visuals are just incredible. This is a movie that, for the utmost effect, should be viewed in IMAX 3D. I missed out and watched the movie in high definition when it was released on home video, but I saw enough (and was wowed enough) to know that I had missed out on something incredible. The Earth, as seen from orbit, is an amazing backdrop for a film and there was not a single moment of this film that I didn't find absolutely gorgeous. I realize I've spent most of this comment ranting about my love for the film's visuals but that's because it's the best reason to see this film. The story is very simple: Stone, eventually left to her own devices, must confront her fear of death and find a means of escaping her fate. It's primarily just Stone (Sandra Bullock) traversing from one hope to another as she goes from station to station searching for a functional escape capsule while dodging the debris/blender. I hate to undermine it because it's still an exciting story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning. Stone is a sympathetic character and we learn bits about her as the story progresses and watch as she eventually buckles under the pressure of her situation. At this point, we know that Bullock is a talented actress and she does well in this movie where she's pretty much the entirety of the cast for most of the film. Cuar√≥n and Bullock manipulate your emotions and keep you invested until the final frame, and it all combines with the director's amazing vision to create one of the coolest movies I've seen in a long time."

Not only do I find the film an incredible technical achievement, but the symbolism and allegory built into what is essentially a simple story about survival is so intense, I've watched the film unapologetically five times, and I doubt I'm finished. For those watching just for the surface story, you'll be disappointed in the lack of scary aliens and other adrenaline fixes. (And you'll probably nitpick every minor technical goof.) That's your prerogative. But if you want to feel like you're experiencing a film that is not just about space, but about life at it's most primal, watching Gravity will be as profound for you as it has been for me."

","Review: What a fantastic visual experience. I was wondering what the hell the director was going to do for an hour and a half with someone floating in space, but after watching the film, I'm very impressed. I can now see what people are going on about! Sandra Bullock deserves all of the praise that she is getting for her performance. It couldn't have been easy to show emotion whilst floating from all of the place. The director cleverly added an in depth storyline to Bullocks character which made the movie watchable for everyone. The main thing that is great about the movie, has to be how the movie looks and feels. It's extremely realistic and you really do feel the intensity and emotion throughout the movie. The director has definitely upped the bar in Hollywood. A Great Watch!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I honestly can say that I haven't seen a movie like this before. The closest movie that I can think of was Moon which was also based on one character stuck in space, but this concentrates on Bullocks journey to earth. When the debris hit that spaceship, it really did look amazing, which made me think how great it must have look in 3D or in the cinema. Anyway, this I some of those movies that I can watch over and aver again, which is very rare for me. The only problem that I personally found with the film was the ending, but that's just me being picky. <br/><br/>Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $708million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional space movies about a woman's journey down to earth. 8/10"
"Movies3149","Null","3","4","13 February 2014"," No Air, No Sound, No Screams
","At the start I would like to advise, if you have the chance to watch this movie at an IMAX Cinema in 3D then do it. DO NOT WATCH IN 2D. If you can only watch it at home make sure you have all the lights out. There are a few dark scenes that reflect the 3D emptiness of space in extremely. This movie is amazing and horrifying at the same time. If I would be an astronaut that must be the worst case scenario that can happen when you're in near Earth orbit. There are no cars honking and tell you to move because there is no air, so there is no sound and ultimately no one can hear you scream. Only real Astronauts who have been in space will know what it sounds like. So I think the representation of sound in this movie is pretty good as well. The camera work is amazing. There is a new VR (Virtual Reality) set out. I think it is available for around 500 bucks or so. Watching the movie with that set must be awesome, I think. And there is a little homage to Stanley Kubrick's '2001:Space Odyssey'. OK that's what I think it is (sorry no spoilers). All in all I definitely liked it and highly recommend it. Now go, watch the movie and enjoy. .....The end....."
"higherall7","8","3","4","5 February 2014"," Flying Circus in Outer Space
","Gravity has all the flashy appeal of a pop-up book whose pictures you view with 3-D glasses. This is not a bad thing in respect to this film. Outer Space is a marvelous phenomena to experience, and watching Sandra Bullock soar out of the background into the foreground is a wonderful thing to behold. Especially when she is moving through such a vast area of vacuum where orientation to concepts like 'right-left', 'up-down', and 'backwards and forwards' seem profoundly negotiable.<br/><br/>The film has a novel feel of authenticity to it, hearkening back and making one recall '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The truth is just seeing Bullock and Clooney explore the dimensions of their craft and using their tools would have probably been enough to sustain interest in this movie. That along with interaction with their fellow crew members once they returned through the airlock. But an attempt was made to give Bullock's character a back story and as such was passable as it did not detract from the suspense, but also did not really add to the storyline.<br/><br/>These are probably the two areas where the film falls down. This could have been a film about nothing more than the human interaction of crew members in Outer Space completing routine tasks and missions on the spacecraft they were trained to service. Every now and then revealing more and more of each other's back stories as they cheerfully went along; encountering the stray problem here and there. The setting is so novel it really needed nothing more than this.<br/><br/>Recently I read in my studies that people often think of Film as being the bastard cousin of Theater. The actual fact is it is more like the Circus with all its stunts and special effects, visual slight of hand and scenic misdirection. Be that as it may, watching GRAVITY from the very first scene reminded me of going to see 'The Great Wallendas' in Detroit at the State Fair just after that horrible accident they experienced with their impossibly complex High Wire Pyramid Act. There is that same feeling about GRAVITY watching this pair of astronauts do tasks in a highly dangerous environment where the margin for error is razor thin and you are crossing your fingers in your mind that nothing goes amiss.<br/><br/>But, of course, something does go amiss, otherwise where would be the story? At least that would be the traditional line of thinking. We watch and when things do go wrong, they go wrong on a scale of Biblical proportions, enough to make you recall DeMille's special effects in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Whether the orbital mechanics between the objects involved would truly permit such events would require a trained scientist to answer and so I will not venture there. But that it all looks and feels as real as you would imagine it to be I cannot deny.<br/><br/>Here the director scores his most telling triumphs. The authentic look and feel of the environment leaves nothing to be desired. The feats of Indian Jones narrow escapes that Bullock and Clooney pull off make you catch your breath as intended to do. The disasters in Outer Space have all the awe and fury of Acts of God and look and feel like the End of the World.<br/><br/>The film succeeds so admirably on a technical level you almost forget about things like human values. Who needs human interaction with crew members and character back story with these kinds of incredible things happening in the foreground? The strange feeling I got is that this film could have gone straight into the super technical direction or been about the drama of humans beings involved in mundane tasks servicing their spacecraft. The ride as it is proves still to be thrilling and satisfying, but just like The Great Wallendas this is a balancing act where something gets lost in the shuffle and not all the elements of the story make it to the other side safe and sound."

","By the time most of you read this review, Gravity will not be in cinemas. If you haven't seen it on the big screen then you're missing out on its biggest asset. <br/><br/>Gravity is a special effects film. Watched in 3D and on a large screen it's easy to get so sucked into the environment that you could actually believe it's shot in space. Some of this will translate to your home television but I think it'll lose a lot on a smaller screen. <br/><br/>And that's bad, because the plot line underneath isn't up to much. Neither Clooney nor Bullock put in a bad performance here but the story is fairly standard Hollywood stuff which doesn't leave you caring what happens or gripped by the action <br/><br/>Neither of which are a problem in a cinema, where the pretty graphics are a spectacle all by themself. At home? Not convinced."

","Giving this movie 8 out of 10 stars is a huge stretch and I suspect that the fact that Clooney and Bullock, especially Bullock, is in it has a hell of a lot to do with why this film got such high marks.<br/><br/>The movie is predictable and annoying at times, especially with Sandra Bullock and her return to the movie Speed screaming. The camera work and scenery were great, but the plot was slightly better than OK and the acting was about the same.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is very watchable, but certainly not worth all of the hoopla. I think 6 stars out of 10 is fare. A lot of money was spent on this film, but there was a lot more that should've been done to make it more believable for 1 and just better all around in my opinion."

","A pretty short drama, that feels a bit longer than it is, due to a story that is short on cast, short on extras, but not short on visuals. This one is literally out of this world. I really wasn't sure what to expect, who to survive, or how long Stone (Bullock) would have anyone to interact with. It seemed from the previews that she spent a lot of time alone.<br/><br/>Critical reviews for this film were high before I even saw it, so I was expecting greatness. It wasn't necessarily greatness, but not disappointing either. I don't really want to spoil much of what happens, but things don't go swimmingly for Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski (George Cooney), and when you're in space and things don't go well, you usually don't make it¬Ö.cue suspense. I haven't been in space lately, so I'm not sure how accurate the events depicted are, some things seem a bit far fetched, some things seem very accurate. The visuals seem very accurate, and I'm sure are amplified on an IMAX 3D screen. I unfortunately didn't get to experience the film in this format, but I'm sure it would've been a better experience."
"julian-mumford","9","3","4","8 October 2013"," Thoughtful, breathtaking, ground breaking and a thrilling adventure ride.
","Like ""Avatar"" this is a movie unlike anything you may have see before.<br/><br/>Following an extensive tracking shot in space, we meet Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). Dr Stone is a medical engineer completing repairs, on a mechanical arm attached to the space shuttle, in orbit hundreds of miles above the earth.<br/><br/>Jet packing around like a middle aged Buzz Lightyear is Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). Whilst defiantly attempting to break the space walk record, Matt still finds time to trash talk and listen to music whilst floating free above the earth.<br/><br/>We get to hear mission control and all is well until suddenly, not so much any more. Debris from a ricocheting satellite is heading the astronauts way and it's travelling fast.<br/><br/>Houston we most definitely have a problem, events then start to escalate fast with some spectacular destruction. If the debris does not get you on the first pass, it will be back after a ninety minute orbit, perfect movie suspense material.<br/><br/>We then follow the only two characters we really get to meet, as they struggle against adversity and an unforgiving environment as they attempt to survive.<br/><br/>After a while you realise you are witnessing two actors to all intents and purposes acting within a zero gravity setting, even though you know that cannot be true. Once you accept this as the reality you are presented with, it is easy to jump aboard the roller-coaster ride the film then becomes.<br/><br/>Despite being action packed and edge of the seat tense, all within a relatively short running time of 91 minutes, director Alfonso Cuaron finds time to innovate with some classic scenes. Dr Stone slowly rotating in a foetal position, tears floating away in zero gravity and globules of fire suspended in mid air, a few notable examples.<br/><br/>The director makes good use of sound or lack thereof and on occasion, includes vertigo inducing, claustrophobic sequences that may have you staring at the floor in relief, as characters spin out of control into the infinite void of space.<br/><br/>The story is simple but largely effective, how far would you go to survive when every natural element is attempting to kill you.<br/><br/>The effects are unlike anything you may have seen before, the acting from Bullock is first rate, she may never have been better. It is good to see her back on the big screen and in such trim form.<br/><br/>Negatives, Clooney does his usual shtick and is more casual than you might imagine the character would be. One also wonders why Stone is up there wielding a spanner in space, with the emotional baggage she is carrying.<br/><br/>Ultimately whatever the ending, this is a life affirming film and most defiantly not science fiction, with alien monsters notably absent.<br/><br/>How the film was achieved can be found elsewhere but within the acting constraints imposed, Cuaron has extracted an impressive performance from Bullock, who may yet trouble Oscar when the time comes around again.<br/><br/>One of the years best and likely to prove a big box office hit if the early reception is anything to go, this may also be the closest most audiences get to experiencing real space in their life time.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Thoughtful, breathtaking, ground breaking and a thrilling adventure ride.<br/><br/>Like it or hate it, you will not have seen anything like it before, this comes highly recommended especially on a big screen"

"LloydBayer","9","3","4","18 October 2013"," I haven't seen a more engaging film all year.
","The essence of a film lies in its ability to astonish us beyond what we imagine to be possible (or impossible). Every year just a handful of films manage to do this by leaving us in a state of awe and euphoria. For 2013, this is it - GRAVITY is a state-of-the-art film that you experience, rather than just watch on a big screen. And years from now, it will be remembered for setting new benchmarks in the filmmaking industry. <br/><br/>Cinematically speaking, this is not just my best movie of the year by the manner in which it is made or narrated, but because of the way it will change the world of motion pictures as we know it. Last year it was Ang Lee's LIFE OF PI and few years ago it was James Cameron's AVATAR. While the common thread running through these films are generous eye-popping visual effects, GRAVITY is far more superior in style, soul, effects and showmanship. That being said, there isn't much of a story here, and like LIFE OF PI before, the central theme is a white-knuckle do or die survival story. But that's where the comparison ends. The opening scene is an unbroken 15 minute long-take that introduces us to veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) as they repair the Hubble telescope 600 kilometers above Earth. Matt is commanding his final space mission while Ryan is on her first. They joke around a bit, converse with mission control in Houston (voiced by Ed Harris) and a third astronaut working in the background. Then comes the dreaded ""abort"" after Houston warns that debris from a missile hit Russian satellite is headed their way. At speeds nearing 20,000 kilometers an hour, this debris becomes shrapnel that rips through their space shuttle, simultaneously killing the crew and severing communications with Houston. Barely surviving the hit, Matt and Ryan are now tiny white dots against the black expanse of outer space. And that's not even the bad news. Low on oxygen and tumbling through hostile conditions of space, their only hope of survival is reaching the International Space Station before the aforementioned debris returns within orbital striking distance. <br/><br/>Matt estimates they have 90 minutes to get to the space station. Incidentally, this is also the runtime of the film where everything happens in real-time proximity. All through this runtime, Mexican director Alfonso Cuar√≥n maintains a visceral deadlock between the viewer's state of awe and the terrifying ordeal playing out on screen. But even against increasing panic, shortness of breath and imminent death, the narrative switches to a frantic fight for survival by clinging on to mankind's most innate virtues ‚Äì hope. Bullock embodies this in the role of a lifetime by constantly allowing her character to evolve. At first she is a rookie medical engineer on her first space mission, then a terrified individual with a tragic past, before learning to tap into the essence of the human spirit. Bullock has come a long way from driving a bus in SPEED to sidelining (excuse the pun) the competition in her Oscar winning THE BLIND SIDE, to flying an entire space station in this film. THIS is Sandra Bullock at her finest and every iota of her portrayal demands another Academy Award nomination. Close behind but with less screen time is Clooney. Equipped with witticisms and pep, Clooney is exactly what you would expect from and actor-director with a thoroughbred resume.<br/><br/>For most of us, GRAVITY is the closest we will ever get to feeling what it must be like in space. This is Cuar√≥n's gift to the cinema industry and the discerning audience alike. Having co-scripted the film with his son, Cuar√≥n's greatest achievement in this film is the technical nuance that has gone into its making. Cinematography is literally out of this world with some of the most spectacular vistas of Earth. There are scenes where the lens shifts from infinite space to within an inch of Ryan's face - a seamless juxtaposition of the vastness of space with claustrophobia. Sound design accentuated by Steven Price's original score is another contrast between surreal imagery and the eerie loneliness of space. These are not just effects in the conventional sense but a profound manner of grafting special effects with the character's emotions and the darkening atmosphere of the narrative; all in 3D that is not only immersive but in a way that becomes the skeletal binding of the story. Phenomenal!<br/><br/>As an only perceivable flaw, GRAVITY can seem preachy at times, underscored by slim propaganda that says something about the selfless courage of the elite ‚Äì men and women who risk life and limb for the greater good of humanity. Then again, such was the message in last year's Academy Award Best Picture ARGO. At the time of writing this review, awards season 2014 is still a few months away. But from where I was seated, I am looking at no less than nominations for sound design, visual effects, cinematography, best leading actress, directing and quite possibly, Best Motion Picture. And then some."

"harsh007","9","3","4","11 October 2013"," Nerve Wracking and Thrilling Cinematic Experience
","Philosophy Space is Scary, out there no one can even hear you scream. There is no air, no medium for sound to travel on, it's just deadly silence and infinite darkness of the vastness of the universe which neither has a beginning nor an end and if you ever get stranded in such a place with nothing but your relentless desire to live and never ending urge to keep moving no matter how grim the chances are for survival, remember one thing and one thing only; the force that keeps pulling you down obstinately is the force which makes you walk this earth also and no matter how strong the force is we rise, walk, run and conquer. Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is an ode to the stubborn human instinct for survival, the unflinching desire to hold on to life even when death seems imminent which is shown in the most magnificent and intricate way possible. It is one epic of a movie which only comes out as often as Halley's Comet. It is a well-directed, well written and marvelously enacted action-drama which uses more body language and sound design to express emotions than any movie I have seen in a long time. Story When a group of astronauts fixing a damaged device on a satellite are bombarded with a debris of destroyed Russian Satellite orbiting the earth at a speed of a bullet which creates a chain reaction by destroying whatever comes in their way and taking it along, disaster strikes on the US Team Members killing everyone except two out of which one detached from the spaceship is left floating in the ever expanding space with limited O2 (oxygen) and no communication with earth. There is no one to hear them cry, no one to send help. There is this limitlessness and two specs of hope hovering around in enormity. Direction Alfonso Cauron has possibly made one of the most engrossing space movies of all time which is dramatic, cinematic and enigmatic but not because of the exceptionally realistic 3D effects or the awesome CGI but because of the detailed portrayal of human emotions on screen which is perfectly balanced by a great background score. His attention to detail is evident from the way he has recreated every single object hovering around in the gravity‚Äìlessness, from the Ping-Pong bats on Chinese space ships to realistic movements in zero gravity everything has been researched thoroughly which add to the viewing experience Performances George Clooney as Matt Kowalski is incredibly sharp and witty as always. He makes an impression rather inscribes a character in our mind so deep that It will be remembered for a long time. But as the story is one woman's journey for survival, Sandra Bullock steals the show by giving one of the best performances of her lifetime. She is extremely convincing with her body movements and passes across a lot of emotions without words or expressions. She's so good that she might even steal this year's Oscars for it. Background Score Steven Price has created a sound track which is incredibly outstanding and gives an ethereal experience to the viewer's emphasizing on the mood of the movie. Price may not have been present physically in the movie but his contributions to the movie being so impactful are so much that it's hard to imagine Gravity without Price's soundtrack. Final Word Gravity is not only a technical masterpiece but also a nerve wracking and thrilling cinematic experience which like wine will become better and better with time. It fuses exemplary sound design, great storytelling and out of the world CGI / 3D technology to create a marvel. No excuse can justify missing it. Overall Rating: 4.5/5"

","""Gravity"" is a suspenseful action survival adventure that sets new standards in terms of a realistic depiction of what it feels like to be an astronaut in outer space. The visual effects are just amazing and are only surpassed by the unique, claustrophobic atmosphere created by the simple fact that nothing more than the small, narrow, oxygen-filled shell within your space suit separates you from the deadly vacuum out there.<br/><br/>Being lost in space, we - by the magic of the movie camera which is digitally floating in all imaginable directions - literally witness the dramatic struggle for life through the bloodshot eyes of Sandra Bullock who, in a brilliantly intriguing performance, tries to find a way back to Earth while she is irretrievably running out of her oxygen supply; were it not for the treacherous crunching sound of people eating popcorn, the illusion would be complete! George Clooney as the experienced astronaut Matt Kowalsky, always overshadowed by Bullock's powerful play as Dr. Ryan Stone, is the only help providing some hope in a obviously desperate situation. As a rather chattering person, he contributes to comparatively few dialogs that are unfortunately not always free from typical Hollywood clich√©s. <br/><br/>Strictly seen this movie has a very thin plot as the director apparently puts much more emphasis on the space experience itself which is underlined by a great, vibrant score crucial to its' huge success since - apart from some radio transmissions between the protagonists - there is of course no sound in the vacuum we would be able to hear; this lack of sound being another tribute to realism as far as it's compatible with the regularities of a blockbuster: Alfonso Cuar√≥n did not intend to make a documentary about disasters in space instead he delivered a very authentic, minimalistic science fiction thriller that can easily form a line with all the great SF-Classics of movie history.<br/><br/>The little kid in you who has always dreamed of becoming an astronaut will definitely leave the theater being nothing but satisfied."

","To me, 'Gravity' may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be, though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film's merits. However, while it is easy to see why some won't like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say. It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1/10 rating with the visuals, effects and direction being such an achievement, the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron is is an extremely talented director, all his films to date have proved that. 'Children of Men' is especially good and one of the best films of the decade, have always have had a huge soft spot for 'A Little Princess', 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is not for everyone but for me it was a near-masterpiece, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the best directed films of the 'Harry Potter' franchise and as polarising as 'Gravity' is there is no denying that Cuaron's direction and the visuals were exceptional. 'Gravity' may be my second least favourite film of his, with 'Prisoner of Azaban', still very good, faring least, this is saying little and is testament to Cuaron's talent.<br/><br/>'Gravity' does fall short of perfection. Its weak spot is the script, it does tend to ramble, feel manufactured and cheesy and doesn't do an awful lot to make the characters more than mere clich√©s. The story doesn't always grip with a few slow, dull spots, and the ending puzzles.<br/><br/>However, as said already in this review and by previous reviews (acknowledged in most less than positive postings, 'Gravity' is a triumph visually and technically. The cinematography is tremendous, quite possibly the most beautiful and best shot film of 2013. The setting is striking and the special effects are a marvel. Cuaron's direction is exceptional, some of the best he has ever done, a master of visuals and mood.<br/><br/>With that being said, 'Gravity' has much more to it than the visuals and direction. The music is an incredible fit, it's haunting, sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful. A good deal of the story is gripping, with intimacy, tension and great emotional impact.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock gives one of her finest performances here and gives the film a certain grace, while George Clooney has a cool calmness that fits his role perfectly. Ed Harris is also impressive.<br/><br/>Overall, an achievement visually, technically and directorially, but despite its faults 'Gravity' is much more than those things. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

I also loved the score and sound design.<br/><br/>The plot is so small as to be almost non-existent, and the stuff about her daughter would ordinarily have me reaching for a sick-bag, but somehow this seemed much more than the sum of its parts, and at the end of it I was almost on the verge of tears. I'm not usually much 'moved' by movies in that way but this one really gripped me.<br/><br/>The kind of immersive, transcending spectacle I thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make.<br/><br/>If this ever comes back to an IMAX screen in my vicinity I'll be first in the queue."

"keithbrown-90195","9","4","6","11 September 2016"," A Visual Masterpiece and Great Survival Story
","I'm glad to view this with all the hype behind it, because it was at a point where it felt like my thoughts about this movie were affected by all the talk surrounding me. I feel like that can be a good thing in many instances, but when I had many of my friends and family call it ""boring"", or state that ""nothing really happens"" my only reaction was to yell ""you just don't get it!"" like an angry pre-teen.<br/><br/>All that said, I'm glad to say that I still really love this. When it comes down to it, this is a survival story; all the elements are in place: the isolated and inhospitable environment, the loss of a loved one in the recent past, the untimely deaths of those who started the journey by their side, etc. Ryan has a pretty good arc, one that may slide too far into sickly sentiment, but it's very clear and visually compelling.<br/><br/>The visuals have been talked to death. They're great, everyone knows it. What still amazes me is the way they're able to use the lack of gravity to create a sense of disorientation. There is no up or down, and the inability to control body movement creates an unbearable amount of tension during many set-pieces. The camera is always expertly placed, and the movements allow us to see and experience Ryan's journey with her. It's never overwhelming to the point of nauseating; we're in the perfect spot. And I love how much of the story in told with visual information. The barest of information is told to us with words, instead trusting the viewer to remain an active participant. You're eyes are constantly looking around the screen, collecting the same images that Ryan is seeing, trying to find something, anything that will help her get back to Earth safely.<br/><br/>I love the title more and more. Like I said above, the lack of gravity allows the filmmakers to play around with emptiness and camera movement simulating the disorientation and distress of the characters. At the end, when Ryan is back on Earth, the newly added gravity allows her to stand on her two feet and capture that amazing shot of her looking like a conqueror."

But it does not end there.<br/><br/>During almost the entire film, there is a sense of dread, a sense that you do not belong in this world‚Äì‚Äìthat we as people do not belong in space. As you watch the characters, whose leads are portrayed by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, struggle to survive, you feel as though it were you. It is as though it is you that are helplessly floating around in this surreal, visceral world that is so dangerous, lonely, and empty. You feel as though you are floating away (even more if you are viewing it in 3D) to your death, to slowly die of lack of oxygen or to perhaps be ripped apart by space debris. These emotions of fear, anxiety, and sorrow, are all made to be real by Sandra Bullock's acting, which is some of the finest that I have seen.<br/><br/>There is a reason that Sandra Bullock has garnered so much critical praise for this movie, and it is simply this: her role in this movie is completely, utterly convincing. Every moment that her life is in danger, every instance of fear, the feeling that you want‚Äì‚Äìneed‚Äì‚Äìto survive, you feel it along with her. Her performance alone makes the movies somewhat linear plot amazing.<br/><br/>The outline of the plot is this: Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a biomedical engineer on NASA space shuttle ""Explorer,"" on her first mission with Matt Kowalski, which evidently turns out to be his last mission. During a ""routine walk,"" they receive news that an old Russian satellite has been struck with a missile attack. This caused a chain of reaction which causes high speed space debris flying in the path of the ""Explorer."" They are told, by headquarters, that they need to begin re-entry immediately in order to avoid the debris. Before they can do this, however, the ""Explorer"" is struck and Dr. Stone and Kowalski are detached and spiral throughout space. The plot follows their attempts to survive and, somehow, against all odds, make it back home, to Earth.<br/><br/>The plot, as mentioned above, is linear, however, the compelling performances by the leads, most notably Sandra Bullocks, makes it all believable and realistic. When paired with all the technical marvels, and the overall believability, you get one of the best thrillers/dramas that has ever been released."
"rlaine","5","4","6","13 September 2014"," Not exactly what I was waiting to see
","After all the praise and reviews, great IMDb score and Oscars, I was waiting for a different movie. I figured this would be a realistic sci-fi ""talkie"". Instead it's highly unrealistic Hollywood action. Actually I'm not sure if action is the right word, but a lot of things happen.<br/><br/>I was seriously waiting for an intelligent movie where Bullock would be drifting in space - something that would make you think, but instead we get to see how Bullock saves herself from running out of oxygen, space debris, fire on a space station, figuring out which button to press, flying around in space, lot's of tense scenes where she's trying to grab on to something etc.<br/><br/>Even tho it's quite tense at times, the breathers are quite boring. Bullock does OK and the movie looks good, but that's it. There's not much else to it. It's very unrealistic, at least feels so. I'm not an expert on the subject, but I would much rather see Apollo 13 again than this.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie by all means, but I was disappointed."

","I have to say this film kept me on the edge of my seat for the duration however this was purely due to its intensity. I found this film to be incredibly predictable and I know that this was just a movie about a girl trying to survive in space but there wasn't much plot or storyline to it. <br/><br/>Having said all that though I did enjoy this film, one of my main qualms with it though was throughout the film I was asking myself ""would this really happen?"" yes, I am fully aware of how dangerous space can be but would they really send someone into space with such little training and knowledge of how the space stations work and would all of those space stations have been completely demolished by the debris? Surely NASA would have been a lot more prepared for events such as this as I imagine there is constantly debris passing through space. How does anyone ever survive in space if they're that unprepared? <br/><br/>In conclusion this film had me engrossed and I did enjoy it but I felt as if not enough research had gone into the making of the film and it felt like an unrealistic scenario to me, please do correct me if I'm wrong though."

","As a piece of technology, Gravity is really impressive. I always think that the absolute best use of special effects in films are those where you forget how impressive they are because they really don't stand out as different from everything else but are just part of the construct. That is the case here as space just feels real and the huge amount of work to make it happen isn't made a fuss of and doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film. Helping you forget this is the fact that the film is a real experience in terms of the story as a ride. Within a few minutes you are in the middle of the experience and it really doesn't stop until the end. Visually I did still feel the 3D made the images darker than they should have been and reduced the clarity of my whole field of vision, but in this case the feeling of being ""in"" the film really work and aside from one or two ""thing coming at you"" moments, it really worked. For me equally impressive was the sound engineering; most sound effects are given a really satisfying ""via contact"" sound ‚Äì the sound where the vibrations come via water or another material like they vibrate through your body rather than in the air. This was done so very well and helped me get into it as much as the visuals and effects."

","Visuals : 10 ... Script: 0 If this had been a silent film, it would have been perfect, but, sadly, it's rife with banal and irritating chitter-chatter, none of which was used to truly propel the story nor profoundly flesh-out the characters. Everything that needed to be known could have simply been shown in a couple of captions, and expressed through body language/facial expressions. NOTHING needed to be said here, especially not this dribble that was passed off as dialogue.<br/><br/>The special effects and astounding real-ness of this film, however, blew me away! The attention to detail and the shocking realism of the actors' weightlessness is stunning! Though I warn you: anyone who is highly sensitive to motion sickness will want to avoid this film.<br/><br/>Clooney's performance may be generic (due to his weak-water scripting,) but Bullock's performance is impressive, and uncharacteristically physical.<br/><br/>There is a faint hint of ""2001: Space Oddessy"" in the scent of this film, though it clearly stands apart. The not-so-subtle metaphors for gestation, birth, re-birth, and evolution are beautifully illustrated in this film, and give the viewer an eloquent buffet of food-for-thought.<br/><br/>The ecological situation this film presents is quite serious, and not something that one might have been previously aware of... kudos to director and writer Cuar√≥n for approaching this little-known, yet globally effecting subject, which not only effects the environment but also the future of human space exploration and communications. (I recommend that you check out the accompanying documentary, which is offered as a ""special feature"" on the DVD.) Because the dialogue is so painfully stupid, next time I watch Gravity, I'll be sure to put the film on mute and enjoy its visual excellence with some ambient music, instead: voila, perfection!"

I give this film 5/5 for visual effectiveness because the graphics are just fantastic, a real step up for film which I am thoroughly excited about as I am a young director myself. The way everything was done and organised was brilliant but what I can't forgive about this film is the fact that they wasted such beautiful visual effects on a screenplay which is complete rubbish! As an occasional screenwriter too, I really respect a great screenplay with a thriving storyline, but honestly: a 10 year old could have written this film. They are in space, their ship is blown up, they go to another ship - the man floats away (oh no), that ship blows up so she goes to another ship. Now guess what happens... exactly, that ship blows up and the escape pod takes her to earth. Done, screenplay written.

","This film reminded me of when I went to see Jurassic Park for the first time and was overwhelmed by the fact that you couldn't distinguish between the dinosaurs and the real actors. In this it was impossible to think of any of the actors as anything but floating, weightless. It truly is an epic achievement. The effects are notable and the acting, such as it is within a space suit is fine, but even such good performances can't overcome the main flaw in the film ‚Äì the storyline is weak beyond belief. After 30 minutes almost everything was guessable and any sense of suspense disappeared. It was interesting to notice how the restlessness in the cinema grew as the film went on. People simply weren't gripped by what could have been a scenario with exciting possibilities. In years to come when such effects are old hat I fear (or maybe hope) this film will be forgotten."
"swfan94","9","4","6","27 March 2014"," FIrst Viewing: Gravity (Perfect Hollywood Thriller)
","Gravity isn't perfect, but you really shouldn't expect it to be. Despite all of the hype it's gotten, especially with its Oscar wins, Gravity never really feels like it's trying to be anything other than a suspenseful Hollywood thriller, which works wonderfully in it's favor. As a thrill ride, it might damn well be perfect. And that's why it's great. It's just a classic fight for survival story, with the added bonus of great special effects. The characters are archetypes, the destruction scenes are unrealistic (Not that I, or most viewers would know) and everything feels too easy for the main character, as she navigates through each set-piece without really that much of a struggle. Sandra Bullock isn't the weak link there at all, it's just how the film is written. You know she's going to make it, and despite it's all is lost tone, she absolutely does without much that much going wrong for her. George Clooney is nothing exceptional here, as unlike Bullock you never get any real since of fear or loss. He simply does George Clooney things and leaves midway through in an obligatory self-sacrifice scene, which admittedly is excellent. Most of that excellence is due to Sandra Bullock, however, who I definitely don't want to overlook. She is fantastic, giving a performance that's raw and emotional in ways she's mostly never shown before. Her performance here is far better and more Oscar worthy than anything in The Blind Side, and far better than Clooney. Don't let anyone fool you, this is entirely her movie. Despite my earlier comments regarding a lack of real danger, she delivers the kind of performance that makes you believe. Her delivery of the films best dialogue, in which she makes a firm statement to herself that she knows she's going to die, is absolutely heartbreaking. When Clooney disappears, you don't miss him as much as feel how much she does, and that's a great thing to see. The other standouts are of course, the special effects, which are of course as amazing as everyone else has already told you. Really, this is the kind of movie you should watch in a theater. It seems like they say that about everything nowadays, but here it is absolutely true. Because this is what a Hollywood movie should absolutely be. Scary, thought-provoking, heartfelt and beautiful, but never in a way that you can fault it for. It never tries too hard to be those things, it just is, and it ends up a movie you can simply enjoy, once you dig your fingers out of the armrests of your chairs and realize that it's just a movie. Just like it should be."

","Gravity was a flat-out amazing experience at the movies that filmgoers will keep talking about for years. Everything in this movie was absolutely gorgeous, from the visual effects, the perfectly planned cinematography and 3D, the flawless direction of Alfonso Cuaron, the believable script and the unforgettable performance of Sandra Bullock. From the moment you see the opening shot of the Explorer Shuttle get closer and closer to the camera in one shot, and introducing the main characters of Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney, and Ryan Stone, performed by Sandra Bullock; this shot shows how they see space in their own different ways. Gravity is the Citizen Kane of digital cinema.<br/><br/>There are no problems with this fine film; everything in the film has a purpose whether it be beauty in the imagery (especially some of the shots of Earth in the film) or the terrifying experience of spinning into the starry-black abyss of space, out of control, or the character reveals that play out through a scene. If it weren't for Alfonso Cuaron's bold vision of the potential modern cinema can have, Gravity may have turned out to be a very different movie.<br/><br/>Gravity is an honest film in that it knows to use the imagery to full effect and have the visual effects affect the characters, not have them be invincible to giant CGI robots or something like massive explosions. Alfonso wants the film to be an experience that is full of moments that are awe-spiring, beautiful, unpredictable, terrifying, and full of impact.<br/><br/>I thought Gravity was THE film of 2013: a must see that no one should miss. Even if you never got to see it at the cinemas in 3D, still watch however and whenever you can. <br/><br/>Gravity gets a platinum /10/10 stars."

","'Gravity' is a visually stunning movie. It reminds us just how much beauty there really is out there. From the opening shot, right up until the closing one, we are taken on a journey of stunning visuals both from space and here on Earth. But there's also more to this movie than just that. We are taken on a spectacular story of survival told absolutely wonderfully by director Alfonso Cuar√≥n, who is up for a well earned Oscar nomination, both for his film and his directing.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are the only two actors really of significance throughout the entirety of the film (there is also one other astronaut who doesn't last long and a few radio voices including that of Ed Harris). Both are nothing short of brilliant in their roles. Clooney plays a character perfectly suited to him. He's a charming, funny and on to it astronaut. He's calm, cool and collected - just the kind of guy you want around in a crisis. This was a brilliant character to have because at the half way point when he drifts away to certain death and we are left alone with Bullock's character, our sense of agoraphobia (fear of wide open spaces) is doubled. We've had that comfort zone and now suddenly it's gone. <br/><br/>We are always feeling the same emotions as Bullock's character due in part to the wonderful way the film is shot by Cuar√≥n, but also due to the wonderful performance given by Bullock, who has received a well deserved Oscar nomination for her role. She is simply riveting to watch. We feel her pain over the lose of her child and we are always rooting for her to survive. When she's short on oxygen, we are short on oxygen. When she can't manage to grab onto something to stop herself drifting away, we can't either. It's terrific stuff.<br/><br/>'Gravity' is such a unique film. There isn't a huge amount of dialogue and not even really that much action, and yet it's compulsive viewing. It's the only film really challenging '12 Years a Slave' for the Best Picture win at the Oscars. I personally think it's the better of the two films and will be watching closely to see if it can get up. It really is a must see."

As one who worked in CG I could rant on mistakes as they were aplenty, however the film left me deeply moved and reconsidering my own life. Loss of such a caliber is shattering. Moving on so very difficult. Thank you for a wonderful experience, physics boondoggles and irate high IQs who have yet discovered emotions aside, this movie has made me think about moving through pain.<br/><br/>Spoiler: Some people felt howling seemed silly. I was stunned when that happened. Some of you may at some point in your life be so overwhelmed by grief and pain that you find yourself sitting in the bottom of the shower howling until you are horse and the water long gone cold.

","Alfonso Cuaron directs his first movie since Children of Men in 2006 with this breathtaking survival drama set in orbit about the Earth. The hostility and beauty of space is brought to the screen in a quite spectacular manner, with stunning views of our beautiful planet dominating the screen. Its serenity really needs to be seen on a cinema screen to be fully appreciated, although I was surprised the Moon didn't feature at all, even at long range.<br/><br/>Only two actors appear in this film. George Clooney is the veteran Kowalski and Sandra Bullock is the rookie Stone. Clooney is, well, George Clooney as we all know him, acting as though it were all a walk in the park. He might have been on the set of Ocean's Thirteen. This gave centre stage to Sandra Bullock, whose film this was. She has been in a spate of disappointing films these last few years (apart from Crash), so it was great to see her carry this film with no little conviction through some scenes of panic, exhaustion, hopelessness, determination, and whatever emotion is required to confront such an awesome sequence of disasters. I think her performance is worth at least a Nomination for Best Actress.<br/><br/>I loved the long takes and the silences. I thought the 3D was impressive but not overpowering.<br/><br/>I have learned that the interiors of the ISS and the Soyuz modules have been verified by astronauts and after a diet of iPod-style ship interiors from Star Trek I was surprised at the clunky nature of the technology on display. (You certainly wouldn't get me up there in one of those things!)<br/><br/>If I could find a fault (being picky) I was surprised at the length of time Stone kept breathing excessive CO2 at a certain point, I don't think the film would have suffered if she had had a little more O2 in the tank at that point. I also didn't understand the purpose behind the dog howling.

In a lot of modern films throw a lot of effects at you to disguise poor writing and a lack of plot, in this case the story was there first and the effects are used to enhance it.<br/><br/>The film is also realistic and believable, by Sci-Fi standards, OK, there is an element of poetic license, the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 and the Chinese station won't be completed until 2022, however the technical aspects of the spacecraft and stations used are close to reality.<br/><br/>Probably the best Sci-fi movie I have seen this year and I say that as a huge Star Trek fan."
"lloydhammett715","9","4","6","20 November 2013"," Two astronauts are stranded in space after the shuttle is hit by debris
","While veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are on a routine space walk their shuttle is destroyed leaving them alone to survive the emptiness of space.<br/><br/>The comparisons will be made, and rightly so, to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, due to the meticulous attempts of realism within the absoluteness of space. In Gravity there is a film so technically brilliant that Kubrick could only begin to comprehend the leaps that Alfonso Cuar√≥n has taken since 1968. Cuar√≥n has developed from what Kubrick began showing space in its realism, not only in its vastness but its emptiness and its ferocity. <br/><br/>The film opens with a spectacular shot highlighting the nothingness of space and the insignificance we hold within it as the blackness envelopes our earth. The chaos of space is also to be marvelled at early in the film as the camera movement sends us on an unreadable journey as the space shuttle collapses and our characters are flung tumbling out of control into the blackness. There is nothing for us to hold onto and the disorientation of space only grows throughout the film. The commitment of Cuar√≥n and his team in depicting space is shown in the exquisite sequences, whether at a merciless speed or a near stand still. It is a technical masterpiece that immerses you within its world often filming from a first person point of view to show the perplexity of outer space. It is a testament to modern technology that such an experience can be created, and the way that it is harnessed is sure to be inspirational to future filmmakers. <br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n's use of 3D shows how exceptional the technology can be when employed in the right circumstances. It is the depth of the picture that really contributes to the understanding of the limitlessness of space in what is a visually mesmerising work. The 3D of Gravity is essential to the film, as you need to be engulfed by the surroundings; the flat screen is not enough to create the illusion of never ending space. There is also no obstruction of the 3D to the cinematography of the film with the tantalising beauty of Earth constantly radiating in the background as a constant reminder of home. This is not a film to be experienced anywhere other than at the cinema, as the beauty and magnitude can only be transcribed across the big screen.<br/><br/>The narrative is linear without the need to go off course, as there is enough within the immediate fear of the impossibility of surviving in space to create continuous tension. The need within Hollywood to create action and overly complicated plots is often detrimental to any character development, ending in largely soulless films. By stripping the plot down to its believable minimum in this way Cuar√≥n creates a much more intimate character led sci-fi. There is cohesion between the technical brilliance ever present in a sci-fi film, alongside the basics of character understanding in a drama that has become all but extinct in recent years. <br/><br/>George Clooney practically plays himself in this film as the charming veteran whose smooth and calming voice is there to bring Sandra Bullock's up tight and nervy amateur to her survival senses. Sandra Bullock is outstanding throughout the film as Dr. Stone, and is toned down to the bare bones of the helplessness of this character. The tenderness that she plays the role is what makes the performance and constantly pangs at you for her survival, especially as her character grows. Sandra Bullock manages to embody the isolation and loneliness of space that is pivotal to the way Cuar√≥n wants to display it. With a film so heavily based on CGI (although you could not tell) the physical and emotional performance of both Clooney and Bullock is something to marvel at.<br/><br/>In Gravity Alfonso Cuar√≥n has shown true genius, unfolding a film that spectacularly breaks technical boundaries, as well as holding together the purity of its ideals."
"Buddy-51","9","4","6","19 November 2013"," a one-of-a-kind visual experience
","""Gravity"" is that rare movie that, while a tour-de-force on a technical level, also happens to come with a great deal of its own - pardon the pun - gravitas.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock, in a bravura, near-one-woman performance, plays Dr. Ryan Stone, an astronaut on her first mission into outer space, sent there on Space Shuttle Explorer to perform some much-needed repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope. While she's space walking with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), the shuttle is hit by debris from a missile strike the Russians have launched to take out a non-operational satellite. Things go from bad to worse when the two astronauts are torn away from the now-destroyed shuttle and are cast out into deep space with little hope for a safe return to earth.<br/><br/>Director Alfonso Cuaron has gathered together a team of technological wizards to replicate, as closely as is humanly possible, the experience of floating adrift in outer space: the weightlessness, the uncontrollable spinning (warning: take your Dramamine beforehand), the immense size and grandeur of Earth as seen from hundreds of miles above the surface. The purely visceral nature of the movie goes a long way towards mitigating any qualms one might have as to the plausibility of every single thing it is showing us.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Cuaron and his son Jonas does well within the admittedly restrictive parameters demanded by the narrative, which is why the performances of Bullock and Clooney ultimately play so crucial a role in the success of the movie. They make us care about the people to whom this is happening - and, without that, all the special effects in the world couldn't make this concept work. Even from inside a space helmet, Bullock runs the gamut of emotions from queasiness to fear to anger to despair to resignation to hope to determination. It's all there, packed within a taut hour-and-a-half-long running time.<br/><br/>In a way, a film like ""Gravity"" makes movie-reviewing almost superfluous, since it's virtually impossible to convey in words the true nature of the experience. Go watch it for yourself."
"Nirvinia","8","4","6","19 November 2013"," 3D has finally been given a purpose!
","Gravity is a true visual masterpiece. I truly hate 3D films in all possible capacities, they give me a headache distract from details and leaves poor cinema employees (Such as I used to be one) to deal with people who even 4 years later still haven't figured out that you need to wear special glasses to view the effect, but (and this is a 'but' of the caliber Sir-Mix-A-Lot would appreciate) 3D has finally been given a purpose in this film! Cuar√≥n uses every possible technique to keep the suspense at a maximum and does so successfully. The 3D allows the viewer to relate more directly to what is happening on screen, the eternal depth of space, the confusion one would experience while constantly spinning and most importantly, death coming closer and closer at a speed of 17 000mph.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's acting skills shone once more in this movie as she sent me through an emotional roller coaster of panic, relief, sorrow and confidence and even though George Clooney's character at first appears to require few skills if any, as he is just another charming playboy type character, a few scenes reveal Clooney's amazing talent and why he was exactly the right man for the job.<br/><br/>The only criticism I will add, is my personal dislike for the ending. I felt like there was a natural ending to the film when Dr. Stone reenters the atmosphere (and even says that what happens next doesn't matter) and it would have added a nice touch to the movie if it had indeed been entirely in space. So I'll subtract a point for the typical survivor Hollywood ending but stay entirely enthusiastic about the rest of this masterpiece."
"wilsr36","5","4","6","15 November 2013"," Wow! ....then ""Uh,Oh""
","I wanted to like this movie - the subject matter is close to my heart - but it is its own worst enemy.<br/><br/>The CGI and effects are truly stunning, and the loooooooong shots (in time, not distance) left me speechless with the preparation and technology that must have gone into them. Just visualising that opening shot, weaving as it does between parts of the shuttle and Hubble, closing in on the suited astronauts and opening up again to long shot is a tour de force, let alone making the visualisation work in reality.<br/><br/>There were quite a few boo-boos that anyone with more than a passing interest in orbital mechanics would spot, but they come mostly in the category of artistic licence. In particular, the way in which Ryan uses the landing rockets to make an orbital transfer of some 100Km is fundamentally comical. (read any of the original Astronauts' books to begin to understand the sheer complexity of orbital matching and docking). The mistakes generate a little more irritation than they deserve purely *because* of the incredible cinematography and complexity of the spacecraft modelling.<br/><br/>But where the movie is really let down is - like Avatar - in the script. How such accomplished actors as Clooney and Bullock accepted roles that portrayed them as juvenile astronaut (Clooney) and untrained tyro (Bullock) is beyond me.<br/><br/>For the first forty minutes or so the sheer quality of the CGI made me overlook the clich√©d script, but then even the pictures could not make it believable. At no stage was I engaged with the fate of the astronauts and by the end I began wondering how much longer it would last. Even the wet T-shirt sequence couldn't excite me.<br/><br/>I might be mistaken, but I do not remember the first half having much in the way of background music. Unfortunately, the second made up for the omission in spades - a dire, completely inappropriate and overbearing score assaulted the ears and added to my detachment from the film. How much better it would have been had there been the deep silence of an airless space except when the camera was inside a helmet or a pressurised vehicle. But, I suppose, that's Hollywood.<br/><br/>In summary, then, a spectacular example of the technique of movie-making in the visuals: eleven out of ten. Downgraded to a five overall because the dialogue rarely comes above the risible. Am I glad I saw it? Yes, definitely. Would I watch it again? Probably. But, just like the first viewing, I would regret the opportunity that was missed in the screenplay."
"badajoz-1","6","4","6","13 November 2013"," OK but badly over-hyped
","The technical achievement of this film is very very good, but as Dr Kermode said (and I do not very often agree with him!)'it is a popcorn movie.' The plot is a peaceful US mission in orbit round the Earth to repair the Hubble telescope becomes imperilled by a dastardly Russian endeavour to destroy one of its evil satellites, which causes a hell of a lot of metal to go at superspeed destroying anything in its orbital path. The film is about the consequences on survivors, except for visuals of Earth from 600 kilometres up - you do not see the blackness of space very often. Thus we have an Indiana Jones-type set up of jeopardy situations occurring every ten minutes or so, which everyone except Sandra Bullock seems to succumb to in deadly graphic circumstances. There are obvious holes in the plot, eg the speed with which Ms Bullock can get out and in of a spacesuit in weightless conditions would leave Gypsy Rose Lee tut tutting; the number of times Ms Bullock's suit hits hard and sharp surfaces on the outside of spacecraft without one tear or snag is absolutely unbelievable; and her ability to read Chinese and Russian from books while piloting escape pods becomes very silly. The so-called profundity in the film is very shallow - when I got home I switched on a 'B' western from the fifties on TV with the well trodden plot of a handful of people surrounded by bloodthirsty Indians, no water and no obvious means of escape except their own ingenuity. Cue dialogue about living and dying - and 'Gravity' is on the same level. In fact, the dialogue was better in the western! The acting is restrained except for George Clooney's turn as comic relief cum sudden sacrificial hero in places. The effects are very good, but cannot really sustain the bare 91 minutes. The 3D is excellent, but did we have to wait a tedious two minutes or so as Ms Bullock's tears drain out into the audience! And as for the two big visual symbols - Ms Bullock curling into the foetal position during weightlessness and her crawling out of the primordial mud for rebirth - were unwanted and too obvious. Go and see it in 3D and wonder, and then watch a movie with a middle."
"jonruff108","9","4","6","12 November 2013"," One of the Best Movies of the Year and Possibly One of the Greatest of all time.
","This is my first review for this site so just bear with me, please.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is, with almost no doubt, the best movie of the year. (Keep in mind I have not seen ""12 Years a Slave"" yet but I have seen ""Captian Philips"" which was astonishing and brilliant in so many ways, but didn't reach the same heights as ""Gravity""). If there is ever to be a near perfect movie to be made, this is it. Everything from the acting to the visual effects is top- notch and of the highest quality. The visual effects, being the standout here, are so spectacular that many may wonder, including myself, how this wasn't actually filmed in space. The attention to the tiniest of the tiniest of detail is amazing. Every single texture, every thread sewn into their clothes, every particle of the dust floating around in the space crafts, every ray of light emitting from the sun and bouncing off the metallic objects is 100% believable. There wasn't a single moment throughout the 90 minute running time that I didn't believe what I was seeing on the screen. If you are one of the many people who get annoyed with over the top special effects (like me), this movie will be the exception. That also goes for 3D and IMAX. I hate 3D. HATE it. This movie made me realize the potential 3D has for movies in the future. It added a certain depth that couldn't be possible without it. That brings me to the opening scene, which is one of the most mesmerizing in movie history. How can I explain it? There isn't a single camera cut for the first 15 minutes of the movie. Everything you see happens in one shot. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, as it is for the entire movie, but here it really stands out. The views of the Earth from space are breathtaking (literaly!). The silence of it all really emphasizes how alone they really are in space. Throughout almost the entire film, there is no sound except for the astronaut's voices and the vibrations they feel through their suits. So, no, there are no huge explosions or crashes that shake the theater, because, there is no sound in space (anyone remember the tag-line ""No one can hear your screams in space""?). One might wonder if the movie would be boring because it would be silent the entire time, right? Actually, it is quite the opposite. Steven Price's musical score for this movie is phenomenal in every sense of the word. It takes the place of all the noises that you would normally hear in a movie. It makes you really feel a sense of genuine fear and desperateness while also protruding an enormous emotional impact at the end of the movie. This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in my life. When talking of story/plot and characters, some would argue that it could've been better. I couldn't disagree more. The plot is pretty streamlined and simple, but that's the point. It's not supposed to have a narrative that rivals ""Inception"". At it's core, this is a story about the characters. And as impressive as it is technically, this movie has an excellent development of it's characters and takes them very seriously. Sandra Bullock's character is, once again, the stand out here. Her emotional journey throughout the movie has a great affect on the audience and will stay with them long after the movie is over. I haven't enjoyed and appreciated a character arc this much in a very, very long time.<br/><br/>I believe a lot of people are dismissing this movie as a stupid special effects money-maker. It is anything but that. Director Alfronso Cuaron (""Children of Men"") has directed yet another masterpiece that will go down as one of the greatest achievements in movie-making history.<br/><br/>This is only the 4th movie I've ever given a perfect score of 10/10 to."
"CAWaters","10","4","6","10 November 2013"," Heart stopping cinematography, acting, and plot!
","Gravitational force, tangential velocity, and inward acceleration aside, Gravity was the perfect film to get the gears for geeks like my friend and I, a photographer and a geochemist, rolling with its phenomenal views of earth from space, intricate and elaborate details of the insides of space crafts, heart-wrenching portrayal of the struggles with loss, solitude, and despair of the main character, and the amazing attention to details that make the film almost believable in the problem the plot presents to her. In the end, we were left asking as we wandered out of Ward Theater in Honolulu, Hawaii, could this happen in real life? (A discussion to be had over a couple of beers and a sandwich at Big City Diner - for sure!)<br/><br/>The intensity of Sandra Bullock's performance as the main character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is incisive. There are several moments throughout the film where the deep emptiness, loneliness, cold, and despondency that can be found in space (and that was promised in the movie trailer) really hits home. It's gut and heart-wrenching, and for those moments, even this slightly clinical observer was left with a tear in her eye. George Clooney, as Matt Kowalsky, played nicely off of the character of Dr. Stone. His is a charismatic character that appeals to the hard-worker in me - the resentful one that has yet to achieve something of greatness but is ready to be done.<br/><br/>Add to this great acting and desperation that the plot introduces, fantastic visions of the earth and its atmosphere as viewed from outer space, and what we have is a chilling interpretation of what it is like to be completely abandoned by hope and embraced by futility in an environment that is a paradise the character cannot enjoy.<br/><br/>This was an amazing film - the best I've seen in months. I highly recommend it... Oh, and see the 3d version! It's an uncanny experience."
"andre_rox99","9","4","6","3 November 2013"," Stunning in every single way possible.
","GRAVITY is a space/sci-fi film directed by Alfonso Cuaron, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.<br/><br/>The film revolves around two astronauts, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who get drifted off into space after being hit by debris. With low oxygen levels and the possibility of death, they must work together to survive the accident and return back to Earth.<br/><br/>So the first thing that makes Gravity so different from the rest of the mainstream movies nowadays is, obviously, its a movie that takes place completely in space, but, other that that, it has a very different tone to it. Right from when you see the trailer, you can literally see how the directer plays with your senses using the pitch and type of music along with the visual effects. Its truly amazing and eerie at the same time.<br/><br/>I went and saw the movie, in IMAX 3D, because, well, you don't usually see a space film with a plot in IMAX, and I'm going to cut short this and just say GRAVITY IS JUST STUNNING. Thats what everyone's being saying right? But WHY?! Well here's why.<br/><br/>The acting is just first-class. Even there are just two stars in the movie, using a green screen, they portray their character so damn well. They are one of the reasons for the intensity you feel all throughout. Sandra Bullock is one the BEST things in the film; she's as good as the special effects in this film, and that's a really high bar. You can see the fear in her eyes that seems like she's slowly losing hope but still has this unknown push to keep trying. She's just so good in Gravity and if she doesn't get nominated for an Oscar this year, I'm going to flip out. George Clooney's acting is quite decent. Throughout the film, you feel like you're in the head of Sandra Bullock's character, and whenever she's nervous, you're nervous, and to sum it up, George Clooney is the guy who keeps you, calm when you're having a panic attack. He's the smooth talker that keeps the level of intensity just to the right amount. That's another one of the best things about this film. The acting makes you feel like you're another one of the characters in space, feeling what they're feeling. Another contribution to that is the directing, because you literally feel you're right in there with Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>The visual effects and splendid and mind-boggling. They aren't shot with IMAX cameras so that was a bit of a letdown considering they had so much of potential with it, but the visuals make up for it and the 3D is just great, and isn't any of that post-converted crap. The directing and camera-work is great too. The way they zoom in on the face, as well as the views of the Earth. Its all just so realistic.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is extremely suitable for the film. There's this sense of calmness yet drama in it. Its wonderful how its portrayed in the film. The film starts off with the main title flashing across the screen and the music going extremely high and suddenly it cuts to the view of the Earth and there's dead silence. Great way to get the audience involved and feeling eerie. The trailer also makes that pretty clear, and the movie just carries that message forwards.<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple, honestly, but its the rest of the components of the film that has made the film, shine. And to be honest, I have no problems with it. The only issue that some people will find is that fact that they have no gravity-defying action stunts or some cheesy villain driving fast cars. You must have the patience to stay through every one of Ryan Stone's thoughts to actually enjoy it. It is quite slow, but its really intense and just good fun.<br/><br/>And to that I'm going to say Gravity is just amazing. Its visually breath-taking and one of cinema's best achievements yet.<br/><br/>GRAVITY- 9.5/10"

","This review contains mild spoilers<br/><br/>Gravity follows Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a medical-engineer on her first space shuttle mission which is headed by veteran astronaut, Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney). As the two are on a space walk, debris hits their shuttle, and soon the pair finds themselves detached from their ship and stranded in space.<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10 <br/><br/>The acting is amazing.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock gives a fantastic performance as the film's main protagonist Dr. Ryan Stone. This is definitely her journey, as she discovers that if she is to survive, she must learn to let go of her past. Many of the film's best moments focus on her character developing into a survivor reminiscent of Ripley, and it's in these moments that she shines. I wouldn't be surprised if she nabs an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Clooney is delightfully charming as Kowalski, who is on his final trip to space after a long and successful career as an astronaut. A confident and reassuring presence throughout the film, his character summons most, if not all of the comic-relief, which is much needed after most of the film's thrilling action sequences.<br/><br/>Script: 8/10 <br/><br/>While arguably the film's weakest link, Alfonso and Jonas Cuar√≥n script is VERY well crafted. The dialogue is compelling through and through and it only really stumbles while nearing the perhaps a bit overly-dramatic end. The story itself is a simple, yet effective tale of (once again) learning let go of the past in order to have a life worth living in the future. What makes the script better than what you'd get in your average blockbuster, is the way the Cura√≥ns manage to humanize our main character, the way they make us empathize with her, which makes the experience all the more emotional and therefore better. Even better is the metaphoric rebirth Dr. Stone goes through over the course of the movie, starting out as emotionally repressed woman, trying to get away from her tragic past, and coming out as a heroine, prepared to do anything to survive. <br/><br/>Direction: 10/10 <br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n ones again proves that he is a master of his craft. The film's 17-minute opening shot is a perfect example of this, as the camera seamlessly floats around our protagonists providing us with a perfect calm before the storm. What follows... well let's just say that Cuar√≥n manages to keep us on the very edge of our seat. He also paces the movie brilliantly, always giving us a few moments to catch our breath after all the action, before it hits us again. Film buffs will probably spend hours analyzing the multiple symbolisms that each scene offers (some more subtle than others), as the film is rich with those. <br/><br/>Visual Effects: 10/10<br/><br/>Perhaps I should start by saying that for the first time ever, we have been presented with a movie that effortlessly showcases space as it is, an endless abyss of claustrophobia and silence. The visual effects artists have done a phenomenal job at giving us a frighteningly realistic look at what space is really like, making it the definitive cinematic experience of the year. The 3D is also put to a great use, giving the visuals an extra layer of depth, while almost avoiding the ""Look we're throwing-stuff at your-face! gimmick altogether.<br/><br/>Score: 10/10<br/><br/>A truly great score makes you forget that you are watching movie. It takes you to that other place and adds a dimension to the film. Without it, the film will lose everything. Steven Price delivers a perfect score that enables us to feel the weightlessness of space. He also enables us to feel the terror of a moment we cannot prevent. By the end, we feel the triumph of the human spirit and truly appreciate gravity. <br/><br/>Overall: 9/10 An extraordinary showcase of visual effects mixed with top-notch acting and a spell-binding score, I find myself agreeing with Mr. Cameron.<br/><br/>Gravity is the best space movie ever done."

","Gravity is the most creatively genius film of our time. Alfonso Cuar√≥n challenges the entire industry to make original films. Truly Magnificent. <br/><br/>Cuar√≥n decides to compose the film from a series of incredibly long takes. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to not be captivated. The camera's lens essentially becomes the audience's perspective; causing viewers to look on as if they were drifting throughout space with the characters in the film. A truly intimate choice for cinematography that is executed brilliantly. <br/><br/>Cuar√≥n takes a great risk, with not only making a 91 minute film, but essentially conveying that the film is a true minute-to-minute ratio of what the audience is actually seeing. The story clearly takes place over a several hour time period but is conveyed as if what the audience is watching is ""real time,"" with the exception of a handful of jump cuts. Cuar√≥n takes a bold move, and succeeds in essentially tricking the audience and changing their sense of time to further entrance the viewers. <br/><br/>There is only one critique i can give the film: the visuals were so beautiful, innovative, magnificent, and close to perfection than any movie ever made, that the emotional dialogue literally couldn't keep up with the visuals. During the scenes where dialogue is supposed to hit the film's themes home with the audience, it simply cannot. Though the themes are still very simple and obvious, they are not as powerful as Cuar√≥n intended them to be. The audience was probably predicted to cry aloud during some line deliveries by Bullock, but could not due to the fact that they were still in complete shock at what they just witnessed.<br/><br/>Gravity is a combination of modern technology and classic story. Gravity is a testimony that original films still exist. Brilliant."

","I was gripped from the opening 10 seconds. It was at that time I realised there was something different about Gravity. Outside the movie theatre I wasn't absolutely sure what to go and see, and it came down to a toss up between Escape Plan and Gravity. I wasn't in the mood for what I assumed would be wisecracks, explosions and fighting, so I hoped that Gravity wold be one of those movies that really immerses you in the experience. I made the right choice; from the opening sequence I was drawn in, firstly by the visuals and then, slowly but surely by the brilliant acting of Sandra Bullock, an actress of whom I have been rather dismissive in the past. George Clooney was actually nicely understated; I think the space suits reduced the possibilities of either character being out acted, and promoted the dialogue to the fore. Having said previously I wasn't up for wisecracks, explosions and fighting I guess ultimately I got all that, but not in the traditional sense. I will go and see this movie again and rave about it to friends; the perfect timing for the perfect movie, and I say again, for me Sandra Bullock was a revelation."

Or else you can say that these words look just plain simple formation of random alphabets when the jaw-dropping visuals of GRAVITY happen to you in the most extraordinary way that has never been tried before. It's 'out of the world' in literal and every sense.<br/><br/>In an unpredictably splendid scenic celestial beauty, when the crew of a space-shuttle undergoes with a critical accident caused by destruction in another satellite, 2 crew-members find themselves detached from their space-stations to float around in the vast environs of zero gravity world. Oxygen level is dropping down persistently. Connections to the base are lost. Hopes are the only survival instinct. Undying Spirit is the only way out. But aren't these the rules of earth they have left long way down?<br/><br/>Filtering GRAVITY to extract one hero, to credit its success in the name of, will not be an achievable choice. Camera-work that makes you believe what all you see is never done in a comparatively tiny little studio covered in green, is absolutely picturesque and mesmerizing. Watch out for the opening sequence of a 10-12 min long one shot and you will be submerged into thoughts that how could they even think of it. Visual effects and the 3D technology have really gone beyond expectations. They don't just make you jump or cringe into your seats for the sake of it but they grab & grasp you firmly to enjoy every bit of it like you are in there in all of your flesh and with your entire soul.<br/><br/>Oscar award winner Sandra Bullock earns all your emotions to be with her character in all good and bad times. Her commitment to excel is very much visible through her emoting muscles and in physical appearances also. George Clooney plays an 'out and out' charismatic astronaut who, even in the worst case scenario, doesn't lose his calm and the pleasurable flirtatious attitude. Don't miss the softer moments between them¬Öof love 'in no air'.<br/><br/>After Stanley Kubrick's philosophical sci-fi drama '2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY', this is the most astonishing 90-min long trip to space, no one should give a miss.

I looked over at my 13 year old daughter and found her holding her breath several times during the film.<br/><br/>It does drag when it forces too much character background in the middle, this was the only part that spoiled the immersion and did not seem real.<br/><br/>Acting was great and you will connect with the actors even with limited background info.<br/><br/>Do not be late to the film and get ready for a ride.

"ironhorse_iv","8","4","6","18 October 2013"," Houston, we got a good movie, here. The movie is defying gravity and critics.
","There are not many movies out there that you should watch in HQ, HD, IMAX and 3D, but this is definitely one of them. The film's cinematography, visual effects, and realistic ""story atmosphere"" of outer space was great to the point, that it was pretty entertaining to watch. It really did look like you were in space. A lot of critics were writing this movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron as a flop when they first saw the trailers for this film. Trust me, the trailers don't do this movie any favors. First off, the trailer makes it look like a 2003's 'Open Water' with the idea of having two people flowing in space alone after their space shuttle was destroy by debris from a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite. I realize the horrifying idea of being lost in a doom like situation with little to no rescue, but the idea of watching two people in a dark open space waiting until they die, might seem boring because you can predict that by the end of this movie wouldn't end well for the characters. Glad to find that this movie involve more than 2 people flowing in space alone. There is always hope for survival, while building on the intense and the challenges of them trying to survive. I did find the Murphy's Law, a bit harsh. Everything seem to go wrong for Sandra Bullock's character, Ryan Stone. Another criticize about the trailer was that, people didn't think Sandra can't handle this emotionally driven high stress demanding role. I have to say, that Sandra really did prove that she can act in this film. I never saw such a depending will to survive from a female character since Naomi Watt's 2012 'the Impossible'. I have to say, Sandra Bullock's acting in this was pretty OK in this film. I thought, she did well enough to believe that she is a first time astronaut. While, she isn't as well trained as George Clooney's veteran character, Matt Kowalski. I did find her character likable, even if she does mistakes or gives up. Even the silly 'woof woof' scene seems believable, due to her character intense break down. I wanted her to survive. I did find George Clooney a bit too charming for this. I know he is supposed to be the calm storm that helps Sandra Bullock's character get through this tragic event, but gees, can you show a little bit of fear, George. It felt like I was watching George Clooney than a character. Still, I couldn't see original pick actor Robert Downing Jr. in this role, so George would have to work. I like situation horrors like this. I must admit the thought of helplessly floating in space, knowing the chances of survival is basically zero is pretty scary. The scary thing about movies like this is imagining yourself in the situation. I have to say this movie was beautiful shots like POV of space, overhead shot of Earth and lengthy 15 minutes scenes. These scenes does heightened the fear and love between objective and subjective perspectives, by showing the warm face of the planet Earth and the harsh depths of dark space, while showing the chaos nature of life both in claustrophobic and vastness shots. Other scenes might not be as good. There were a lot of cheesy Cirque du Soleil type space acrobatics that makes me laugh. Others scenes are just too dark to the point, you can't barely see anything. It felt like a cheap way to save film. Then, there is a lot of scenes that can cause motion sickness or cause Epilepsy. I have to say that Alfonso Cuar√≥n made this movie work. You can see that he wanted to be an astronaut with this film, but chose to be an director, instead. I like how the director pay homage to other space films like 2008's Wall-E, 1995's Apollo 13, and 1979's Alien with its development of the characters and plot. The movie makes sense with all the science. One thing that I love about this film is that there isn't any sound in any of the space scenes. Replace the sound effects with a great score, and you got a good movie. The movie was very well made with scientific accuracy, but some liberties were taken in order to sustain the story. The technology is a bit weird as I have to think this movie place somewhat in the future since, as of this writing, the real-life Chinese Space station is named Tiangong is barely build yet. It was weird, seeing the space shuttle was being used in the film despite it getting canned in 2012. For the sake of entertainment, I am willing to employ my willing suspension of disbelief for the humanistic story premise this movie suggests. There is a lot of symbolism and metaphors. I like the Houston is God symbolism. Just keep talking, even if nobody is listening. It gives you hope. The film also meditates on spiritual themes both in terms of Ryan's daughter's accidental death, the will to survive in the face of inevitable death, as well as the futility of rescue. I found the rebirth metaphor well done. Her character has just lost a child before the mission, and she's in a peaceful environment, floating in space or water, and then something force her to move out. At first, her life is saved by a wire like a umbilical cord connected to Clooney, but then she has to cut it so she can live. Inside the space station, she's seen in fetal position. Then there is the scene where ship crashes into water and water breaks in, she cries and try to start walking. Intense. Overall: The surviving plot is simplistic, but it consistently keeps you either in awe or on edge. Nothing complicated, yet it sucks you in like gravity! That's how to make a great movie."

Both George Clooney and Sandra Bullock were outstanding in their roles and I totally believed that Sandra was weightless as she floated through the space station. (I read that these scenes took a long time to shoot to get them right and the result was worth the effort). The movie also managed to maintain the tension throughout the film without becoming just another thriller."

","I'll be honest with you readers, I did not want to see this in the slightest. Most of the factors that affected my opinion of this at first hand was the idea: we're stranded in space. It doesn't help that not too long ago there was a cruddy space movie; Apollo 18 or something, and that soured my eagerness to see this. but after some trailer analysis I did noticed a few things, mostly the actors that were even in this film. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock? That's odd, aren't they grade A actors? If it wasn't clear enough, after a critics trailer unveiled it then cemented that this might be worth the price of admission. So I finally saw it; in 3-D I usually don't bother with such technology, and it was worth every cent!<br/><br/>Never before have I been so emerged into a film, I can't recall one now, but it probably wasn't as great as this one. I'll save the visual praise for the end because that's the biggest component in why this is so great. For starters the actors chosen do a very good job, Bullock conveys a mother who lost her child sadly; but thankfully isn't throwing it in the audiences faces, and trying to overcome the darkness/ emptiness of the vacuum of space. To be honest I think ""overcome"" is a common word used in any review of this movie, but it's a good one at that. Clooney is just playing George Clooney; a relaxed cool guy who likes to talk, but knows when matters are at stake and takes situations seriously. I haven't seen many of his films, but now I can safely list this down as one of them. Not only are the actors good in what they're suppose to do, but the minuscule cast itself is what makes this so different. In a movie I expect lots of actors and extras, but for once seeing an infinite space with very little people in it is rather refreshing.<br/><br/>After about a half an hour of viewing I came to an early conclusion that this movie was only good for acting and visual flare, but only until later on did I notice subtle themes of independence and ironically letting things go. I can probably tell that the moment when everybody noticed thematic elements is when you see Bullock; after finally reaching a space station, takes off her gear and then curls up in almost an embryonic way. Not only is this reminiscent of 2001, but it feels earned. Unlike in Man of steel; only to list one of many, that has the hero pose in the Christ formation. This happens only once, and wasn't obvious/clear until it happened. I feel like I might have glossed over why they might of chosen to make the actress to that pose, so I theorize that it shows her being reborn, and that by going through the experiences that she's gone through have changed her into a new being. <br/><br/>Finally the effects and cinematography. My god, this will win best effects for sure, no questions asked. Admittedly, I really thought Pacific Rim was a good contender; and while I still like that film for what it is, it doesn't even hold a candle to this. I always thought of space as the means of showing events, like seeing meteors crash, aliens landing, or even super heroes flying by. Until now I never really cared about what goes on in space, but that has changed. There long shots that both show the significance of their location, and setting the tone. In space there's no gravity; not blowing any minds I know, so everything is just wondering/floating around, and there's just so much creativity that can be done here and they do show it. The tone is very haunting; I also noticed that my theater room was surprisingly small, which added to the claustrophobic feel of space. I find it funny how there's a claustrophobic tones in space, which is infinite.<br/><br/>My final words, this is movie is just simply amazing, I'm glad I finally saw this. It also shows me that the year 2013 still has some hope for good movies; if you were curious the movies that I liked this year: Gravity, the Worlds end, and Pacific Rim, and while I may not watch this as much as say Pacific rim, I can still recognize this as a masterpiece."

","""Gravity"" does things with the sound and cinematography that other movies only dream of doing. Frequently filming from the first person, the film attempts to put you in the place of an astronaut adrift in space. It succeeds in a big way. Be prepared to be on the edge of your seat for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film is visionary. There is never an 'up' or 'down' to limit the camera. A common camera trick is to show the camera at a crooked angle to show uneasiness. Every shot in Gravity is at a crooked angle because there's never a clear up or down. That use of cinematography is brilliant in depicting the overall uneasiness of the entire movie.<br/><br/>The use of sound is nothing short of masterful. The silence makes you lean in close, then the occasional noise makes you lean back. Watching a space station be torn to shreds without sound makes you appreciate with your eyes. Then spending so much time listening to breathing makes you focus on your own breathing. It evokes a sense in yourself that few movies ever reach.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the movie, and I will say this is a fairly minor complaint, is that Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) basically has a 90 minute panic attack. She never calms down. I know that we are supposed to feel what she feels, and for the most part we do, but personally I doubt that adrenaline would last so long in myself.<br/><br/>There's not much to say in words about this movie. It's visual. It's noise. It's the lack of noise. It's brilliant. Go watch it."

To start, the acting was amazing but I wasn't even concerned about how the acting was going to be because its Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. The CGI was incredible! Not that I've been to space, but it looked so real I felt like I was actually there. I also loved the fact that the movie was practically in real time. There were hardly any jump cuts to different scenes, the whole movie was super fluid. Truly, a very intense movie. I recommend seeing this if you don't enjoy movies where you really have to think about what's going on to understand.

First things first, as soon as I read the tag line ""In space no one can hear you scream"" and half way through the trailer, I wanted to watch this movie right away and I did. I'm not a fan of 3D cause it kinda gives me the headache and I don't usually enjoy them but as soon as Gravity embarked on, I changed my mind and I couldn't believe what I was watching through those glasses. I was in the front row (chose to be) and I can't tell how amazing the view of the earth from the Sky is. The CGI is so admirable and I'm sitting here wondering what they had to do to accomplish the level of realism, and the wonderful sights make you believe it IS shot inspace. So, half the time I was impressed just by the CGI, it was almost an experience in itself. The movie takes you into varied emotions and a bit of chemistry between two lost souls in space; director did a good job with the very very suspenseful story. The movie is also fairly accurate with the laws of physics except for here and there but that's OK, if you're a rocket scientist then you should probably ignore flaws and eat your popcorn, it's a movie to begin with. I don't understand some of the outright negative critiques, well, maybe it's just that they don't enjoy Space or just that they are simply emotionless.

","I saw the trailer for Gravity and was distinctly unimpressed... Sandra Bullock is hardly Jodie Foster and looked like a very stock storyline. However, my wife insisted we went and so I got to see it this week in 3-D while away on holiday.<br/><br/>Conclusions... absolutely fantastic, a must see and one of a very short list of films (see below) which re-defines the genre. It is without doubt one of the best pieces of cinematography, nay art, I've seen on a movie screen and whilst the concerns over the plot listed elsewhere on this review site and are largely correct - so what and who cares...? After endless green monsters created using millions of dollars of CGI, here is technology being used to its greatest effect and really advancing cinema as an art form again. Breath-taking from start to finish and genuinely a film that really gains from the 3-D enhancement/effects.<br/><br/>Others on here complain also about the length of the movie... me too, but in a slightly different way. It seemed no more than ten minutes long and whilst the run time if 90 minutes is short by modern, dare one say bloated standards, it literally flies - pardon the pun - by and you won't believe how the time went. I'm not a huge movie-goer and think they are wildly over-priced these days but this was one where I walked out of the cinema and thought I'd happily pay again the same evening to watch it again.<br/><br/>I'm going to ruin my credibility here by making the links now but if you were young enough/old enough to be amazed by 'Top Gun' back in the '80s (for the visuals I mean of course, silly) and similarly the advances that were 'Aliens 2', 'Apollo 13' and 'District 9' then this is, to use the corniest of links, the next evolution of Kubrick's black obelisk and takes the sci-fi genre onto the next level.

The odds are greatly against all of this happening in conjunction with one another, but bear in mind we are talking entertainment here. Ham radios CAN be heard in space and the stations are equipped with them just for emergency purposes. Space debris CAN and DO hit objects, it doesn't happen often, but it does. YES, there are operational manuals on the stations and, if can translate them, you can control other crafts. You CAN access modules and crafts from the outside, it has to be set up right, but it can be done. YES, astronauts have communicated with Huston ""in the blind"" and are taught to do so when they do not receive responses.

Sandra Bullock and George Clooney put on remarkable performances that make you feel a sense of connectedness and empathy for each of the characters. However, what makes this movie truly exceptional is the perfectly sequenced and detailed effects of the CGI. Clearly the filmmakers spent a great deal of time and effort to perfect every detail, which goes a long way to give that audience an experience they've never had before.

","I will be the first to admit that the first trailer I saw for Gravity (I believe during Man of Steel) I was not impressed. In fact I was turned off and told my friends ""how can this be a good movie, the whole movie was in space, people won't be able to relate to these characters. Even after seeing the second trailer and finding out it was only 90 minutes long didn't help to convince me. What sold me was when James Cameron said ""its the best space film ever made!"". When the man who did Aliens and Avatar, two of the biggest sci-fi movies ever says that, you know this movie is nothing short of fantastic. It was, there isn't a lot you should know going into the movie other than the special effects are impeccable. SEE IT IN 3D!! I don't see many movies in 3D because I believe unlike most people, it actually takes away from the experience. But this movie is a true spectacle, not many movies about choosing life or accepting death can be great in only 90 minutes. This is the best feature film in 2013 so far and should win a few Oscars. Sandra Bullock is good as 'stone' in a role that was originally offered to Marion Cotillard. And Clooney is in his comfort zone as 'kowalski'. There really isn't any other cast members in the movie, so enjoy the ride as it is, a true cinema masterpiece. This is what films can be, and should be for years to come. Bullock goes through many ups and downs in this movie and all I can say is that the trailers don't show you all you will get. Yes it's all in space, but it rightfully is. The long scenes are what really show how great the cinematography is. Most importantly the first scene shows how great CGI is now. Sitting with a crowd in which there are so many scenes with each person shaking their head and jumping out of their seat at the screen show how much emotional pull this movie can have on people even with a simple script. 10/10 best film of the year."

","Locally, this movie received excellent reviews. I wanted to see it on a big screen, rather than Netflix, so I did. In today's world of computer graphics,these were nothing special. The plot line was nothing special and, in fact, was quite predictable. Ryan's whimpering was, perhaps, sexist and not commensurate with the training an astronaut, even a medical doctor in the role of an astronaut, and would not likely be sent into space with only one trained astronaut. OK, the writers are entitled to some license, but I think the same results could have been attained with a more realistic portrayal of who we send into space at the cost of millions.<br/><br/>The bottom line for me is that it doesn't come close to the story, special effects and intrigue of ""2001"".

It's pure nonsense to consider Space as a 1200 square mile big , where satellites are falling like domino ! For the characters they are so poorly drawn , Clooney's character has absolutely no depth , none .. Zip , even Sandra's character has very little depth that's poorly performed and written .

"FlySciFi","1","13","28","23 October 2013"," The Physics ruined it for me...
","If Oscars were being handed out for movies being intense then Gravity would get the award and then some. Many of the moments throughout the movie were intense for the viewer and there was always a sense of peril that cast a long shadow over what was going on and in all circumstances (with the exception of the finale) the outcome was catastrophic. I was barely able to breathe; I was having difficulty holding on to my chair and digesting the material as it was being delivered. This is Hollywood and because of the $174,919,886 domestic total (boxofficemojo.com 10/23/2013 @ 10:01 PM MST) as well as general critical response there exists a sentiment of a job well done. But for me, being the harsh sci-fi critic that I am, I have to grade fairly and there were quite a few things that I saw that I stand resolved on - they were just not right. First, there is a scene when Ryan is talking into a radio (blindly trying to send a message to mission control) where the camera is clearly set in space looking into her capsule and we still hear the muffled voice of Ryan as though she were sitting in a chamber that was not within a vacuum. In a vacuum, even if your ear is pressed up against the module and someone on the inside is speaking you won't hear a muffled voice or anything for that matter ‚Äì because there is no atmosphere in space there is no medium for sound to travel in. Next I thought it was a difficult pill to swallow when Matt Kowalski unhooked himself from the tether that was connected to Ryan; there was a physical system in play here and the system was at rest. Because they were in space and neither person was moving and no objects were exerting force on either object (and because there could be no inertia in a system at rest in an environment without gravity) there could be no force pushing Matt Kowalski away from Ryan Stone ‚Äì all Matt had to do was tug at the tether and he would have traveled toward the space station. Were these people really astronauts? My next issue was that I thought it was strangely convenient that the space shuttle Explorer was conveniently close enough to the international space station to make a spacewalk using a thruster pack look like a walk in the park. Kowalski had to use the packs power during their spacewalk (which was almost at an end before tragedy struck), he had to use the packs power again to rescue Ryan Stone, again to get back to the destroyed space shuttle and again to get to the space station. I cannot begin to imagine what 29th century technology had been used to create this device or what Marvin the Martian cartoon it came from. The debris field that orbits the earth every 90 minutes was also something that I took issue with. Please reference the 7:49 through the 10:00 minute marks in ""How the Universe Works"" (Netflix, Season 1 episode 7: Alien Solar Systems) Here we see that a process called accretion (with a recorded experiment at the real ISS test environment) accounts for the construction of planetary bodies. This process starts small and takes a long time. Dust particles and rocks and other debris that collide end up sticking together and do not fly apart (or through objects) as they do in Gravity. So when the debris hits the shuttle or the space station or the telescope or astronauts, while potentially damaging, would not fly through it (as we could see from when Matt and Ryan are looking at their dead spacewalker friends head and seeing the Earth below) This bothered the hell out of me. My next issue was that Dr. Ryan Stone did not seem to be a genuine character to me. She was talking ""blindly"" to mission control and giving her ""go big or go home"" speech and I was simply not convinced or impressed. I think she was trying to be emotional and trying to look flustered but at the same time she gave the impression that she knew she was making a film and contending for an award and seemed to be overacting. I also think I figured out why they are claiming that this film is science fiction and I think it is inflammatory. The Chinese Space station that Ryan was able to eventually escape to does not yet exist and won't be built until the year 2020 (source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_space_station) It is my opinion that the existence of this space station indicates that the film is not contemporary but slightly in the future and that indeed means that this is sci-fi. (i.e. speculative existence of this space station) This of course flies in the face of all the inaccuracies with regards to physics and how special bodies behave when they collide ‚Äì this also requires suspension of disbelief and is ""fantastic"" and therefore could potentially also qualify this film as sci-fi. While I do overlook some inaccuracies in sci-fi movies ‚Äì most notably the sounds that ships make when they are flying through the vacuum of space (because this is generally not critical to plot or story) ‚Äì there were too many issues here. The issues with physics were I think critical to plot and progression of the story and the inaccuracies ruined the experience for me. I apologize to everyone who liked this film ‚Äì I think that it is great that such a work is considered by so many to be moving and intense but unfortunately this movie will get no high marks from me. I want science fiction that is grounded in current human progression of a physical understanding of the universe. Cuar√≥n would have done well to study up before he made this movie if he wanted universal appreciation from everyone.<br/><br/>-SciFiMan"

They both possess similar babbling, er.. acting qualities, but hey, give it a shot I told myself, put your feelings for ms Bullock aside, after all Alfonso Cuar√≥n is director on this one and Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n is one of my favourite movies, I told myself.<br/><br/>Visually, Gravity is stunning, no doubt about that but that's pretty much all it has going for it. This might be fine for some but as a lover of film I prefer something more, a little substance, some semblance of realism pertaining to the rules of the world being portrayed on screen. Gravity, unfortunately fails to cater on any of these fundamental details nay, prerequisites. Instead we are asked that any incredulity that the film so rightly deserves is put aside in favour of the shiny, shiny graphics, like a moth to a light-bulb I feel, is how I am asked to approach it.<br/><br/>To call a film 'Gravity' but then disregard all other rules of physics is utterly beyond my comprehension. I won't go into all the mistakes made in this film regarding physical errors and the like, that has been well documented by other writers already. What I will add however, and something that still bugs me with the plot is why the Russians decided to blow up one of their satellites. How dumb are we supposed to think the Russians are? Surely there are regulations regarding the destruction of property in space, there have to be.<br/><br/>Have they managed to polish the proverbial turd with this film, I keep asking myself? Perhaps not but they made a good attempt at trying to distract from its axiomatic shortcomings."

","Having grown up with and being a fan of the United States' space program, I was very much looking forward to watching the Academy Award-nominated 'Gravity' when we rented it this weekend.<br/><br/>We just watched it. Don't waste your time or money. I can't believe actors could read a script like this and agree to make such a piece of crap. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>I love science fiction, Futurism, science, fantasy and the possibilities of human capability. Well, 'Gravity' is pure science fiction. Very BAD science fiction.<br/><br/>This is Hollywood at its very worst. Yes, movies are storytelling and we allow some leeway due to the entertainment factor. I tried - I really did - to like this movie because I like space and science and adventure and the unknown. However, being a child of the 1960s growing up with Chris Kraft at the helm of Mission Control, hearing historic transmissions of John Glenn when he passed Perth and Neil Armstrong when he set foot on the moon, seeing Challenger blow up in real time and, more recently, numerous videos of shuttle missions that became so commonplace we stopped paying attention to them, you notice things that are routine, systematic, organized and orderly for such cutting edge exploration and discovery - real life source material for movie making.<br/><br/>The director obviously has never video transmissions from US shuttle missions, Mir, the ISS or any of the myriad combinations of the international space mission that have been available for at least the last decade, if not longer.<br/><br/>Simply put, the laws of physics were suspended in the making of this movie. The only setting of the stage is people doing something for some unknown reason with no one else around when an inexplicable event puts them in mortal danger.<br/><br/>Individuals of questionable abilities with unstable personalities that NASA would never recruit are faced with impossible odds and, of course, survive . . . what a load of crap.<br/><br/>Ron Howard did an excellent job on 'Apollo 13'. 'The Right Stuff' was totally captivating in every detail. 'Gravity' doesn't even come close . . ."

If you have nothing to do and need to watch something watch QVC instead, a test pattern is more interesting than this excuse of a movie. The only reason I can think of that people watched this is to see George Clooney and Sandra B. They should be ashamed to take money for this movie. I suppose the reason they chose to be in this is to continue their income stream. It is best watched with the sound off on the TV, actually with the TV off would be a better way to see this movie. Turn off the TV and vacuum the carpet instead, it will be more fun."

How can anyone call this CGI gymnastic a movie? This is a showoff of CGI capabilities that would impress anyone, but is it enough to call it a movie? Sandra Bullock winning some awards for acting? Story awards? Who gives those awards and on what criteria, and where has that man finished his education? Who can save me from wasting money judging movies trough IMDb ratings and trailers?

"suws1","6","7","13","20 January 2014"," Great CGI...that's it...
","Gravity is possibly the most overrated movie I've watched in recent years. Yes it has great CGI, the visuals are stunning, but I think I payed for a movie...This has absolutely no plot, no character development, no story...And an Oscar nomination for Sandra Bullock to look scared and breath heavily...are you serious?! The above is fair warning to those, like me, who think that are going to watch a movie...You're going to watch something that would be a great space documentary. If you wanna be blow away with stunning visuals this is for you. The best CGI I've seen to this day, the attention to detail in every little thing and it really takes you somewhere if you watch it in 3D it looks like you're in the middle of the action. That being said, it is an experience, but not a movie experience. It would be something to try in Disneyland or some amusement park, because it is a ride...It's just not a movie. It is impossible for me to spoil it, because it has no plot to spoil, I can't tell you anything you don't already know going in. I give it a 6/10, because I kinda enjoyed the ride, and it deserves credit for its visuals, but this is, by far, 2013 most overrated movie."
"imdb-45","5","7","13","15 December 2013"," Merely a visual spectacle, otherwise pointless and mercifully short
","I'm going to be one of the few to say what horrendous tripe this movie was. Thankfully we saw it in 3D on the big screen. Anything else is a complete waste of time, IMHO. The beginning of the film starts good with an interesting premise. But once things start to go wrong, everything goes wrong with this film. It would be better titled ""Mission Impossible"" and it's a very short film that tacks on an additional hour out of what could have been a neat 30 minute film.<br/><br/>This won't ruin the film but was one of the funniest lines I heard from the audience, who also felt that this was an empty preposterous story that was as vacuous as space itself. He said ""Let me guess, and here comes the shark!"" You'll understand it when you see it and it will probably give you a great laugh since there is no film that Hollywood cannot ruin."
"danew13","6","7","13","14 December 2013"," Very Dramatic and Panoramic, but also Factually Incorrect, with an Absurd Opening Scenario
","This is a pretty film and exciting. But it ends there. It's based on Hollywood hype and the public's ignorance of science.<br/><br/>First, the initial absurdity was Russia blasting an old satellite with a missile creating a deadly high speed debris field while its own space station was being manned with its people and the Americans out there working on the Hubble Telescope. The Russians aren't stupid enough to endanger lives of crew members in that way,which invalidates the entire film since there would have been no disaster.<br/><br/>Second, their was absolutely no reason for Clooney to untether himself from Bullock and then float off in the opposite direction. He and Bullock, both being tethered together and at one point to the space station would be traveling in the same direction and speed as the station. All he had to do was make slight tug or forward movement and he would have headed into the station.<br/><br/>Third, and the comic relief of the film, is Bullock trying to crash learn how to crash land the re entry capsule from first Russian and then Chinese instruction manuals on how to fly a spaceship. This strained all believability. <br/><br/>Going back to the beginning, Sandra Bullock'a character would not be suitable either in training or emotionally for this astronaut position.<br/><br/>Finally, all such space craft are built for possible sea landings, with the hatch on top so they can't fill with water when opened. Bullock never checks this out and opens the hatch immediately, causing the capsule to sink. But then, she wasn't properly qualified, was she?<br/><br/>Oh, and I couldn't understand why Bullock couldn't make radio contact with Earth through using several different radios.<br/><br/>Aside from all this, the needless small talk from Clooney while the pair are floating in space is absurd and a waste of air. Again, this is a beautifully shot film, but you have to suspend disbelief. The shocking thing is most people seem to believe it."
"verminhater","6","7","13","11 December 2013"," Just OK - not great, not bad, just OK.
","I'd been looking forward to this for some time and the initial reviews singing the praises just heightened my anticipation. I'm at a loss as to explain why anyone would find it worthy of it's current 8.5 rating so here's my thoughts:- <br/><br/>It's a very basic story and a seriously limited cast. The cast isn't merely limited in numbers but also the depiction of the main character. Sandra Bullock isn't hugely convincing as a mission specialist. The last time I checked NASA had very strict requirements for their astronauts in that they are expected to show some initiative and backbone. Her character appears devoid of both and flaps in panic mode for large parts of the film. In fairness to Ms Bullock the script is weighted that way so she probably had little say in the matter and did the best she could with the material she had. I'll blame the script writer. A tougher character similar to ""Helen Ripley"" would have been more realistic and engaging.<br/><br/>Lets be honest, this film is going to appeal to ""nerds"". I'm one! Nerds will find many issues with the film not matching the reality of the situation. You don't need to be ex-NASA to spot them either - basic physics will do. I won't list them as I'd look foolish if I missed one but if you are of the nerdy persuasion you'll spot them and they'll interfere with your view of the film. I don't mind Hollywood taking a few liberties but when you deliberately aim your film at those who at least have some grasp of orbital mechanics you ought to take more advice from scientists and less from writers. Getting details right shouldn't interfere with a story but should enhance it.<br/><br/>The good bits are good though. The cgi and any other effects are very good. So good in fact it's easy to feel it was actually shot in space. That's it though. It's not great, it's not bad. It's an OK film worth watching. It could have been been so much better with that stronger main character."
"ajitpaul-abraham","10","7","13","17 October 2013"," Not a movie... but an experience
","The plot of the movie is Space. That itself is a challenging part for the movie, which is depicted in a brilliant way by the Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n. The Emptiness and loneliness of space is well presented in the movie. The breathtaking visuals and very deep scores is really outstanding and go well blended with the movie. <br/><br/>Technical study done to take this movie is impressive. It shows the dedication put in the details of the film. A pure thriller for almost every audience. Widely based on a proposed theory called Kessler syndrome (look for this after you watch the movie), which deals with satellite chain reaction in space. <br/><br/>Well selected casting. Impressive acting by Sandra Bullock. George Clooney performed his best in the given character sketch. The fear and expressions are well presented. Every single shot has a psychological impact in many different aspects. <br/><br/>A must watch in my opinion for Sci-Fi lovers, space enthusiasts, Thriller .etc."
"Jordan-Belfort","10","7","13","13 October 2013"," Might just be the best film of the year
","As a HUGE fan of director Alfonzo Cuaron (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, which I consider the best film of the series; CHILDREN OF MEN, one of the best films of the last decade), I'd been looking forward to his outer space drama GRAVITY since it was announced. Of course, word of mouth from its film festival premieres was so incredibly good that it seemed like it couldn't possibly live up to this hype, right?<br/><br/>Short answer: YES IT DOES.<br/><br/>Synopsizing the film doesn't do it justice, but it follows astronauts Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a first-timer in space, and Matt Kowalski, a smooth-talking chatterbox veteran who are forced to do whatever they can to survive together after a freak shower of debris destroys their shuttle in the most hostile environment that humankind has ever visited: outer space.<br/><br/>That's really it. The film unfolds in real time, and thanks to Cuaron's vision and the talents of Bullock and Clooney and all of the technical staff, GRAVITY is not only the best film of 2013 so far (and will likely remain so), it's also the most visually immersive and absorbing film I may have ever seen in my 36 years of remembering seeing films. At a brisk but unrelentingly intense 90 minutes, GRAVITY grabs you and it NEVER lets go. The script by Cuaron and his son Jonas isn't just filled with dialogue and action that gets you from one moment to another. It has surprises, and a significant amount of heart as it becomes slowly less about just survival and more about living life.<br/><br/>What really does it though, and this might be where the film might suffer on home video, is the ASTONISHING use of 3D. As opposed to 99.9999% of films that are shown in 3D nowadays, which is just a shoddy post-conversion so that the studio might squeeze a few more bucks out of the moviegoer, Cuaron actually USES the 3D as part of his visual storytelling. There are moments where you literally put your hands in front of your face in order to block the oncoming debris or whatever danger you might otherwise see coming at you. This speaks more to the immersive feeling of the film than just about anything else other than the storyline, performances, cinematography, effects and musical score by Steven Price because all of these things are incredibly well- done. Bullock EASILY gives the performance of her career here, and Clooney does a brilliant job at keeping things grounded.<br/><br/>GRAVITY is not a very subtle film, and it's not designed to be. There aren't layers upon layers of commentary like CHILDREN OF MEN, and there aren't subversive elements like in PRISONER OF AZKABAN. This is cinematic storytelling without the veneer of having to be high-minded. It's pure cinema that will terrify you, exhilarate you, and absorb you like no other film in recent memory. It's a great artist that knows when to cast aside pretense that isn't necessary and just tell a breathtaking story. Cuaron is one of those rare artists, and GRAVITY is one of those very rare films."
"punishable-by-death","3","9","18","2 April 2014"," Can somebody please explain the hype to me? Please?...
","When I first read about this movie, I laughed. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in space. A barely existent plot. I decided that I wanted to check it out, as a movie-fan, I wanted to at least see how bad I thought it would be.<br/><br/>The movie was slightly better than I expected - mainly the elements of tension it occasionally stirred up - but the flaws were overwhelming. I cannot see how people can praise this film. There are so many problems!! And I'll forget the endless plot-holes because one could dedicate an essay to that subject alone.<br/><br/>The camera-work was at times busy, but a lot seemed random and seemed to only occur during a bad event - as if to emphasize the suspense due to the lack of any meaningful dialogue or acting; just Sandra Bullock comfortably floating through a space-station (that is being ripped apart by shrapnel), in her underwear, no apparent fear for what could happen...<br/><br/>Her acting is just.. there. The character development is ridiculous, as it is a dream that essentially turns Bullock from timid to heroic. When the crap started hitting the fan, the CGI looked okay, but it didn't look real. The problem was that it was supposed to look real. I'm not sure what planet they were orbiting either, but it doesn't look like any Earth I have seen a picture of. Perhaps I was hallucinating.<br/><br/>Not much else can be said... There are only two characters, and Clooney makes Bullock look amateur by turning himself into the macho and arrogant, but with a soft heart, lieutenant, without even trying. Compare this to say... his performance in BURN AFTER READING. He was just going through the motions. <br/><br/>And for someone lost in space, Bullock was amazingly bland. The silly story and script didn't help her either: 'Sh!t!', 'Sh!t!"", 'Ugh, this damn thing!', 'Ugh, I hate space'.<br/><br/>Amazingly horrid dialogue, juvenile and extremely typical of Hollywood. This movie was quite clearly a pretty-looking cash-grab and nothing more, and it paid off... if you take any notice of what 'The Awards Season' recognises that is.<br/><br/>3/10 is being generous, but it was better than I went in expecting. So there's that."
"jjgurd","2","9","18","9 March 2014"," Over-hyped and underwhelming
","I really don't get why this film has rave reviews. OK there are some neat special effects and a few head-spinning moments but.... I was expecting to be blown away, instead i spent most of the film irritated by Bullocks' character and annoyed by how much of the storyline has been borrowed from films like Apollo 13. The ending was all too predictable and left me thinking this was a wasted opportunity to to let the audience walk away with questions to answer rather than a neat wrap up. Massively disappointed. Perhaps if i watched it purely for the visual effects i would feel differently but i was hoping to be engaged on other levels as well."
"wasaga-672-617254","8","9","18","5 October 2013"," I Can't Stop Thinking About It!
","I went to see this movie last night at our local theatre and it was my first 3D experience.<br/><br/>I don't usually like sci-fi or space films. They are generally bleak and difficult to follow. This one was simple to follow. A team of 3 astronauts are doing rather mundane tasks when they are told by mission control that some space junk is speeding in their direction. The lead character played by Sandra Bullock is not well, and appears depressed but she is getting her job done when the news of space shrapnel arrives. George Clooney is a seasoned astronaut who admires the majesty of space but treats it like it's another day at the office. His calm is vital for diffusing the life threatening events. I don't want to write any more about the plot than that as it would spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>Bullock's character Ryan Stone is a woman who has all but given up on life. She doesn't see the beauty of her surroundings and isn't sure she even cares if she lives or dies. She will have to make that decision multiple times throughout this film.<br/><br/>This movie must be seen in a theatre. I cannot imagine that it would have the same impact at home on a small screen. The sound is outstanding. There are moments of complete silence - like one would experience in the vacuum of space. The visuals of earth in the distance are so realistic you might believe the movie was actually shot on location. This is as close as most of us will ever get to space travel but instead of being fun - it's terrifying! I would agree wholeheartedly with Ryan Stone when she says ""I hate space!"" See this movie. <br/><br/>Don't go to the theatre expecting Gravity to contain a lot of plot or dialogue. Suspend any disbelief about technicalities. Just enjoy it for the audio and visual masterpiece that this film undoubtedly is."
"Bravesfan17","10","9","18","1 October 2013"," A Feast for the Eyes from a Visionary Director
","Seven years is too long of a wait for a director to bring out his latest film. That is the case with director Alfonso Cuar√≥n. His most recent outing, Children of Men, came out in 2006. But to this movie fan, it was well worth the wait.<br/><br/>Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is on her first space shuttle mission. She is accompanied by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who is on his last mission. While in space, the astronauts find out about debris being through space destroying anything in its way. The mission is aborted, leaving the shuttle destroyed, and the astronauts stranded in space. While Stone is stranded and freaked out, Kowalski comes to her as they only have 90 minutes until the debris returns around the earth. The two keep trying to contact Mission Control in Houston to no avail. They make it back to the shuttle, to find the remaining crew dead and the shuttle damaged beyond repair. There is a nearby Soyuz that they can make it to nearby. However, that is also damaged beyond repair and the ship used to take astronauts home is also gone. They end up at the International Space Station, thanks to Kowalski's thruster. However, his momentum is pulling them both away. But Kowalski's confidence assures her that she can fly the damaged Soyuz module to a nearby Chinese space station with a landing module based on how the Soyuz is designed.<br/><br/>This is a very powerful film with a great story, thanks to the many efforts of visionary director Alfonso Cuar√≥n. His direction keeps the story exciting, entertaining, and makes us wonder what will happen next. The story is simple, yet effective. Cuar√≥n proves that less is more. He does a nice job of combining story and structure. He does some excellent and creative work with the camera and showing us very nice shots of what is happening. Cuar√≥n wrote the screenplay with his son Jon√°s Cuar√≥n. Together, they wrote a simple script, but show that you don't need a lot of words to make an effective script.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock gives the best performance of her career at the front and center of this film. She does excellent at showing the many emotions of Dr. Ryan Stone. She does a great job at being the newbie who is freaked out, but able to get calm and rely on what she knows and what she can do in order to make it back to Earth safely. As an audience, we feel sympathy for Stone and want her make it back. Bullock shows her will and desire, and more importantly her perseverance as Stone. George Clooney is fun and entertaining in his role as Matt Kowalski. Clooney brings his confidence and zaniness to the role. With this performance, Clooney shows us a guy who knows his stuff and can keep calm in a tough situation.<br/><br/>With this story, there are many great technical aspects. The big standout are the visual effects. The visual effects team in this film make us as an audience feel like we are in space with Stone and Kowalski. They also do a very nice job with the efficiency of little things floating in space, and not overdoing with the debris flying. Alfonso Cuar√≥n's longtime director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki does some very beautiful work with the camera, especially with the pans in the continuous shots. Cuar√≥n also edited this, which he collaborated with Mark Sanger. Together, they did a very efficient and compelling job of cutting when necessary and showing us what is important to see in this story. The sound design is also very effective and does a great job at putting together the dialogue of the actors, and hearing the noises of the space stations, and powerful when debris crashes. The other big technical standout is the loud and moving music by composer Steven Price. His score is effective at knowing when things are calm and when trouble is imminent."

I would have expected a different movie, but the previews are so misleading as to make me feel cheated.<br/><br/>The movie plot seemed to be an amalgamation of all of the movies that came before. I came away feeling that I could have assembled this movie by editing together scenes from 2001, Red Planet, Alien, Star Trek, etc.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that the minimum review length is ten lines, but there isn't enough substance to warrant that length.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the movie is visually stunning."

The story is kind of average and there is nothing exciting about it. We can guess what happens in the end the moment we watch 10-15 mins of the movie. Also, sandra bullock keeps on saying that she failed to work with spaceship/simulator in the past.. why would NASA send such person to space??. ""I hate space"" dialogue was ridiculous. I agree that we cant expect much from a movie whose entire storyline revolves around space, but the plot was not upto the mark and you cannot judge a movie just based on its 3D effects."

Other blog's published a complete list of ""big errors"": locally some effect is realistic but the general picture is impossible (the several space stations involved in the movie move at a relative speed of several kilometers/sec, a satellite or a space station takes several days to fall down from the height of several hundreds kilometers, etc.). Anyway what really I could not stand were the poor story, the silly dialogs, the pleonastic and exaggerated recitation: it is a bad film, technics apart.

How spectacular sunrises and sunsets can be. How NASA imagery of the earth makes it real out of the world pictures. And of course an immersive 3D experience created in Macbook Pros. If 'Gravity' is drawing rave reviews from critics who first saw it in festivals - I think we are moving to an age where anyone with a mobile device and 3D editing software will morph celebrity faces to create 'Gravity' of their own, in the near future.<br/><br/>Too much has been written about Cuaron's signature longshots and James Cameron's endorsement of a project which was conceived 4 years ahead of today. But cinema - is it today only about engagement, entertainment and experience OR more about story, reality, script, screenplay, acting and messaging ? I left the theatre at the end - unsure if 'Gravity' is worthy to be screened in theatres or a better fit for screening in themeparks, Astrodomes or Planetariums.<br/><br/>Absurd reality has been as much a part and parcel of Bollywood movies as has been its song and dance. Cuaron can be credited to have consumed a lot of such 70/80s Bollywood absurdity to make a superwoman out of Sandra Bullock. Unlike Bollywood, she does not need to survive after six bullets are pumped inside her, though. <br/><br/>However, if hopping and hiking from space-station to space-station was not enough, - wait till you see use of a fire extinguisher to propel her to a earth return vehicle in a ridiculous sprint against satellite debris as her co-runners.<br/><br/>Great South Indian hero, Rajnikant would watch such an end spectacle and rue the chance of not having Cuaron as director during his heydays."

I hope Sandra bullocks win the Oscars.<br/><br/>my only suggestion is that, when Sandra was talking about her daughter she could have showed a bit of tears in her eyes just to make it more emotional.<br/><br/>overall I recommend everyone to watch ;)"

","Actually, the spoiler is watching the movie itself. I am a total science fiction fan and, like others I was interested because of the high reviews. Well, Hollywood is beginning to bore me to death. The special effect industry has completely overshadowed intelligence and real acting.<br/><br/>Even the suggested astounding special effects didn't pan out. Some of the graphics were not realistic at all which pretty much detracted from the good graphics.<br/><br/>Ever watch one of those airline disaster movies where an engine exploding would be bad enough but the pregnant woman in 34A is going into labor, the only doctor on board just died of a heart attack, the pilots have suffered food poisoning, the prettiest female flight attendant must now fly the plane into a raging storm with the help of 12 year old Jimmy's experience with flight sim software on his computer. Did I mention the cockpit door is locked from the inside?<br/><br/>Yes, it's one of those!<br/><br/>It's full of bad science and ridiculous improbabilities. Can someone please tell movie makers using a drill, sliding circuit boards in their holding trays and debris crashing into space vehicles are utterly soundless in space, which would have been far more dramatic and terrifying than sound effects and music.<br/><br/>When are educated people going to start making movies again.<br/><br/>Here was a perfect opportunity to show something dramatic based on science and the very real possibilities of non survival and THIS is all they could come up with regardless of the fortune they spent - and I haven't even said anything about the pathetic dialog and sophomoric acting.<br/><br/>With a human record of space travel (you know, like a few trips to the moon) and all the amazing tools we have for educating people anyone seeing this film should have felt their intelligence was insulted but unfortunately we're becoming a world of uneducated people with dumbed down expectations to be exploited by sensationalism.<br/><br/>If you want realistic science fiction watch Apollo 13 or Blade Runner and if you want intelligent storytelling try Contact. Don't waste your money or, more importantly your time on this absurd movie.<br/><br/>I don't mind reading the spoilers in reviews before I see the movie. If it's a good movie then it's a good movie and knowing what will happen should not detract from the experience. This is especially true for science fiction as we're not there to see if the butler committed the murder.<br/><br/>However, in this case, if I'd read this particular spoiler in one of these reviews I'd never have entertained watching this movie at all.<br/><br/>*** Now a spoiler ***<br/><br/>How many times do we have to have Eve emerge into eden as the ending of a movie? All the simple minded histrionics throughout the movie were bad enough to swallow but crashing into a lake with a sinking space craft and getting out of a space suit within seconds (that takes hours to get into) and swimming to the light on the surface of pristine waters in an idyllic wilderness was more than I could bear without screaming.<br/><br/>My only wish is that people who make money from a movie like this could be sued for fraud, theft and wasting my time. At the very least it's advertising should have a disclaimer - ""This movie is entirely unrealistic, gives no consideration to science whatsoever, has remarkably bad acting, is full of the most banal clich√©'s and you can have a full refund if not satisfied.""<br/><br/>That'll do."

","Luckily I didn't have any clue about this film before I got to my seat as I would have probably not gone. So here are my observations as humble as they are:<br/><br/>1. Plot -.there wasn't one, or at least it went over my head. Just a lot of panting by Sandra bullock - and space debris. 2. The panting - incredibly annoying and I felt as though I was going to have an asthma attack halfway thru. Take a nebuliser with you just in case. 3. Unbelievability - (is that a word?). An instruction manual for a space ship? Pleeeese... It was like setting up a new dishwasher. Now we know what they do at NASA. 4. Lack of character depth - I hated them all. In fact I wanted them to orbit earth forever. 5. Ripley rip-off - major elements of Alien coming thru as Ms Bullock whimpered around in vest and knickers. Exactly the same colour and design as Ripley but nowhere near as well worn as Ms Weaver. <br/><br/>My closing thoughts - why oh why could a crocodile or shark not drag her under, and what happened to the aliens??! I LOVE space films and this was certainly no classic. What are the Academy Awards thinking? This smells of Clooney nepotism."

","If you're easily distracted by shiny objects, sure, you'll love this movie - and hey, more power to you; it does look like a million bucks (well, lots of millions actually) no question about it. If, however, you like your entertainment having something resembling a plot and/or know anything at all about things moving around other things in space, you'll be brutally disappointed - the plot is thinner than a soap bubble and the science... well... let's just say there's nothing they do that doesn't break physics in some way.<br/><br/>I'm not going to try to pick apart every single thing here from why debris doesn't cascade like that to how shrapnel would either float past fairly harmlessly, zip past completely invisibly fast or not be in your orbit at all, to how there's no ""tug"" on a tether in space once all parties involved stopped moving relative to each other, to how you don't just skip between vastly different orbits at a whim etc; it's not any particular point when things get stretched thin, the whole wreck is running on pure fantasy from beginning to end. Others wrote at length about that already...<br/><br/>But therein lies the problem. There's suspension of disbelief, and there's mandatory lobotomy - this flick requires the latter, sadly. I have no problem with Warp drives in Star Trek or 1m long lasers in Star Wars - because they are admittedly fantasy worlds, never sold as ""realistic"", as something that is actually conceivably happening involving contemporary technology. ""Gravity"" on the other hand would have you believe just that - being in the same class as, say, ""Apollo 13"". Well, fat chance.<br/><br/>I mean, seriously - could you really watch, say, a police procedural allegedly set roughly in the present, in this universe where two cops in New York talk about taking the next lawnmower to Moscow with a straight face...? Would you really want to have your plot pivot on that...? If anything, that would be MORE realistic than the orbit-hopping-with-a-nearly-depleted-MMU-or-landing-rockets in ""Gravity"".<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, all the shiny FX in the world are completely worthless if the movie systematically makes it impossible for me to suspend disbelief, and doesn't at least attempt to reward me with an exquisite plot that would make up for it. ""Gravity"" puts all its chips on lots of 3D 'splodey things and whizzy things, and that is why it completely fails for me. If you can leave your brain at home going to see this, go for it. Everyone else: AVOID."
"gavin6942","7","6","11","20 January 2014"," Less Than Perfect, But Visually Stunning
","A medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) and an astronaut (George Clooney) work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.<br/><br/>Obviously, this film has garnered the attention and accolades it has because of the special effects and visually stunning design. And there is no arguing that this looks amazing, with or without the IMAX and 3D. Some have called it this year's ""Life of Pi"" or ""Avatar"" and there is plenty of truth to that.<br/><br/>Others have been critical of its scientific accuracy, which seems odd. Sure, Bullock is not wearing ""space diapers"" and not everything might have behaved how it would in zero gravity situations. But this is hardly the point. The chances of anyone surviving in this scenario are basically nil, so just accept that it is fiction and give them a little bit of wiggle room to tell the story.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, I was not terribly impressed. The themes of isolation, desperation, hopelessness and hope are all good ones, and I have to give them credit for providing a fair range for Bullock's character. Others have pointed out the spiritual symbolism, which I concede was lost on me and may be one reason I think it was not the masterpiece others have said.<br/><br/>The praise is near-universal, with critic A. O. Scott saying that the film ""in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them."" How do you top that? James Cameron stated, ""I think it's the best space photography ever done, I think it's the best space film ever done, and it's the movie I've been hungry to see for an awful long time."" Which, coming from the leader of cutting-edge film technology, is the highest of compliments.<br/><br/>With regard to the Academy Awards, the film earned ten nominations (tying it with ""American Hustle""), many of which are in the technical categories, and it sincerely deserves to win those awards. Director Alfonso Cuaron, known for his Harry Potter film and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" among others, really went out on a limb here and should be recognized for that. He won the Golden Globe, and I think he deserves the Oscar, too. To helm such a project takes intestinal fortitude few (besides perhaps Cameron) could muster.<br/><br/>Bullock as best actress is debatable. Although much was done by computer animation, and thus amounts to more or less voicing a cartoon, the parts she physically appeared in deserve respect and admiration. Bullock stayed in a special mechanical rig for up to ten hours a day, communicating with others only through a headset. That is dedication that was not matched by Amy Adams or Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>Best score I could accept, though I do not feel strongly about it one way or the other. Steven Price, at age 36, is a relative newcomer, and it would be nice to see him enter the world of Hans Zimmer and John Williams. But is this his time? Lastly, best picture. And I say no. Much like Ang Lee received best director for ""Life of Pi"" but failed to get best picture, I think the same could be said here. The direction and cinematography are excellent, but is this a film that will resonate in years to come? I have my doubts. The emotional impact simply is not there."
"mr-gazpacho","6","6","11","11 January 2014"," A bit disappointing
","Although the special effects are revolutionary the film is a little dull to be honest. It is a real time drama about a stranded astronaut, Sandra Bullock's somewhat whining character haunted by the death of her daughter. The most unfortunate thing about the special effects is that they are actually so good you fail to notice them and the zero gravity scenes become too natural. This leaves you with the basic plot and the acting. Bullock's performance is pretty much by the book plus some excessive heavy breathing. I found her heroine to be a little 2 dimensional ironically in contrast to the 3d. Its worth viewing because it's beautifully shot and is a visual treat, but it's certainly not a classic movie in my opinion."
"votesmall","10","6","11","21 November 2013"," GRAVITY is amazing! Don't listen to the haters!
","What can I say what people haven't said already? This film certainly lives up to the hype!! What I cannot grasp is how there are people who actually do not like this film. They argue that it is only good for the effects. These people are surprisingly common. Trust me, DO NOT LISTEN. They just want to tear down something that so many people love because they are wannabe critics. <br/><br/>You really have to see this one in 3D or the front row of IMAX in order to get the full experience, but you feel like you are IN space while watching it, especially in 3D. This film is absolutely unbelievable. The effects are breathtaking, the music shatteringly climactic, and the acting compelling. I just can't say more about this film other than the fact that it takes a simple tale of survival and adds so much drama and action to it. <br/><br/>If you want character development that is said through long-winded dialogue and takes the whole film, watch the Godfather. This film is able to show us who these people are and get us to care enough that we do not want to see them die an excruciating death in the airless vacuum of outer space without spending time telling us what we already know. Yeah, I know character development is important, but we already have this development and any more would just hinder the film's pacing. <br/><br/>While it is true that George Clooney pretty much just plays suave George Clooney in a spacesuit, a lot of these moronic ""critics"" argue that George Clooney's character was ""too calm"". In case they didn't know, NASA only selects the very best people to be astronauts. Look up how astronauts actually react in a crisis. They stay calm so they can figure a way out of it. Ryan Stone was NOT an astronaut. She was a medical engineer that invented a scanning device used on the Hubble Space Telescope. It is stated clearly in the film that this was her first time in space and she had only been there for a week, so naturally she would be freaking out. Sorry, but these people find stuff to criticize and they cannot do it right. <br/><br/>Of course, I would have done certain things differently, such as having the entire movie take place in the vacuum rather than space stations, but I suppose things had to keep moving for the sake of fluent pacing. Not that I blame the filmmakers for this, but the film could have been a lot more terrifying than it turned out to be. The film seemed to run on more things going wrong at an alarming rate rather than the slow, terrifyingly impending doom I was expecting. Again, not that this is a bad thing, I just see a different way to make a space film darker and more unforgiving and hope to do this someday.<br/><br/>This is a film so complex and breathtaking that it must be seen to be believed. The details are intricate and loving. Every time I learn more about this film, I find something new to adore. The fact that the writers were inspired by Spielberg masterpieces like Duel and Jaws to create a compelling film that took place in a single location or the fact that the entire film was intricately choreographed since the actors were literally acting in front of a green screen just makes me wonder how complex it must have been to make this film. And do you know what that tells me? That tells me that the filmmakers CARED. They actually wanted to work hard to do a risky gamble of a film just because they wanted to do something that had not been done before to fulfill their visions. I can't imagine pitching this to a studio, which just gives me more respect for how this film was put together. The 3D is stunning and surprisingly doesn't exploit the use of 3D technology. This is coming from the guy who hates anything 3D. Let's face it. It was a stupid, cheap gimmick back then and it's a stupid, expensive gimmick now. But not for Gravity. This film uses 3D as a tool to get you invested and make you feel like you are there. Most 3D films just sell themselves out for cheap shots of things coming at the camera obnoxiously to constantly remind you that the film is in 3D. Not Gravity. This film is far too classy for that.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron once said that most movies can be seen with your eyes cosed and you will hear the entire film. This is one of the major reasons he wanted to see a picture like Gravity, to show people how it felt to see the very first movie in a nickelodeon, that movies don't have to be just passable entertainment. Movies can be an experience that requires many of the senses to truly respect and understand. This film is living proof that cinema isn't dead. If future films are as great as Gravity, there is a hell of a lot more to look forward to! Time Magazine once said that Gravity shows us the glory of cinema's future. Since the only good films to come out in the last decade or so are children's films or films that were based on true events or books, films didn't take a lot of creativity to come up with, so I wholly agree with Time. Gravity is a film that dared to show us something we had never seen before. Even if no more films come out that dare to do something different and put effort into something that isn't a boring remake or derivative drama, I can just keep watching Gravity with hope restored that filmmakers in the future still care.<br/><br/>And that's just fine with me. <br/><br/>GO SEE IT."

","Stunning, mesmerising, breath stealing, magnificent, (excuse the obvious pun) out of this world, quite simply one of the greatest films ever......visually. Visually. Not the best film of the month, not the best film of the year; best film in those time-lines visually? Definitely yes. <br/><br/>The film hypnotically captures your eyes and takes them for a masterclass in special effects. Not often can i associate the word beautiful with a film, but with this, every scene draws that description. And it is one small step for special effects and one giant leap for future films to look at and study and pick at and aspire to be like (couldn't help it, sorry).<br/><br/>Now with the deserving plaudits out the way, onto the over exaggeration. Yes it is a stunning film, but it isn't undoubtedly the best film of the year as some critics have stated; clearly jumping the gun and somersaulting onto the bandwagon. And to dismiss Oscar nominated and winning films so rapidly is a farce. In terms of UK release, we have had Django Unchained, Lincoln, Zero Dark Thirty, Man of Steel; even This is the End, Trance and Filth. These are films of the top of my head that I enjoyed more than Gravity. Now of course it is within someones opinion if they enjoyed Gravity more; but i can't see why. As i have said, visually it is hard to compete with, but in terms of acting and the story, they simply don't compete with films out previously. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock can be a great actress as she has shown in The Blind Side, but is there really all that much to her performance? Is there all that much you need to do in that circumstance? Now don't get me wrong, it is understandable that the process she had to go through in filming would have been tough. But in terms of emotion and versatility i found her dull. The story is stereotypical of a movie where everything goes wrong. I do hate to be judgmental of the film, but i feel the acclaim it has been constantly credited with is over the top. And the piles of praise only adds to hype and that only leads to disappointment, because it can't match the hype that has been conjured up by the hallucinating media.<br/><br/>A great film, and worthy of the watch, but don't let the heaps of hype cannonball you onto the ever populating bandwagon that seems to be trouncing the world of films."
"ibuckingham6","9","6","11","20 October 2013"," Not for the weak of heart... literally
","Now if you have a weak heart in any way, do not watch this movie. Im not kidding, this was the single most stressful experience of my life. Watching this movie was a very intense and frightening experience, its definitely one of my favorite movies of the year, and it just works so well, its a must see.<br/><br/>The movie kicks off with Clooney and Bullock in where? Thats right, space. A mission specialist named Ryan Stone, played by Sandra Bullock and a vet. named Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney are working on attaching some new hardware to the Hubble telescope, which will from what I gathered allow it to see much further than it currently can. Now this is where thing really start to go wrong, the Russians are destroying one of their satellites, and the debris from the wreckage has caused a chain reaction to other satellites, which has caused millions of silent killing pieces of shrapnel speeding towards our main protagonists. <br/><br/>Now the silence is key in this movie, because for those of you who know that in a vacuum no sound can travel, as in space, being a vacuum, the same occurs. Because of the silence, you constantly feel like nothing is rely going wrong in the movie, then things get ripped apart. The silence lulls you into a false sense of security, making you feel like every thing is peaceful and calm, but as bits of old satellite come wising past making no sound at all, you just feel terrified. Its one of the most affective scare tactics I've seen in a long time. If these silent explosions weren't, well, silent, it would be no where near as affective. Just seeing a space station silently be ripped apart by speeding pieces of shrapnel is so frightening and exciting, it really made to movie what it is. <br/><br/>The director of this movie, Alfonso Cuaron, loves his long takes, those of you who have seen children of men will be familiar with this. This movie has very long, very interesting and very masterful takes, and just beautiful camera work. The camera moves so smoothly, panning and tracking its way around the characters, it made me feel like I was in space. And the way the characters move is just so accurate from what I can tell. In fact, if someone told me they filmed this in space, I would believe them. <br/><br/>I did some research and apparently all of the space stations, shuttles and other space craft are exact to what they look like in real life. I also red that the fact that the satellites hit the space stations is impossible, that they orbit at a different distance from the earth, but this is just such a minor flaw that I'm sure wont matter to anyone who watches it. Another thing I wanted to mention was the music. This is so key to the scares and tension. The way it just pounds, like a heart beat, and how it suddenly rises up to the point of ear drum bursting, then suddenly cuts out was just fantastic. Because of the way the music is set, you have to go see it in the cinema, or with surround sound to really get the full affect. <br/><br/>I also want to talk about the acting, Im not a fan of Sandra bullock, I hated her in things like the heat, and when I found out she was in this I was honestly put off. But after seeing this, I have to say she has earned some serious browny points. She is so good at portraying the character, that I was genuinely scared for her. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie so much I don't think. Now, as for Clooney, he was great. I really enjoy many of Clooney's work, other than those Nespresso adds, I think his a fantastic actor, and gravity is no exception, however, Im kind of sick of him playing the cocky middle aged guy. He seems to always play this character, and Im a little tired of it. However, he was still amazing in this movie and Im glad he was casted. <br/><br/>This movie is one of the greatest pieces of cinema I've seen I a long time, with its masterful use of camera work, music and acting, it left me wondering what would happen next for its full hour and a half. It was so intense I don't know if I could have taken much more of it without having a heart attack. This was amazing, a must watch movie."

Camera movements, light and sound were just fantastic. Sandra bullock and George Clooney,their expressions were perfect. I bet audience have also enjoyed their conversations. After watching this movie I have felt how lucky i am to be a part of this wonderful world. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is just hilarious. It was so good that even I felt the helplessness of Dr.Ryan Stone right from my seat in the cinema hall. The scenes of collisions and explosions were equally bizarre because there were no sound(and that is normal in the space). The visual effects, extraordinary 3D effects and the thrill which have been maintained throughout the whole movie will definitely make it one of the finest creations of Hollywood."

The movie was 91 minutes, but it felt like 20. It was spectacular, jaw dropping, suspenseful, and the most starkly beautiful film I have seen in a long time. It's hard to put what I saw into words, so what I can recommend is just see it, because it is going to go down in the history books.

"bw92116","7","6","11","6 October 2013"," ""Marooned"" meets ""Cast Away""
","*** Caution: this contains spoilers. ***<br/><br/>I did not see the 3-D version of this; we saw it in a regular theater, so I can't comment on the 3-D aspect.<br/><br/>I will offer one caution for those who are prone to motion sickness: there are almost no static shots in the entire film. The entire scene is usually rotating, and on multiple axes, though rotating slowly, nothing is ever still, not even the background; if you suffer from motion sickness easily, this may be a film to skip.<br/><br/>This film reminds me of some films involving space travel, particularly the spacewalking scene in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), ""Marooned"" (1969), and ""Apollo 13"" (1995), all of which depict a crisis situation in outer space.<br/><br/>It also reminds me of single-person survival story films such as ""The Naked Prey"" (1966), ""And I Alone Survived"" (1978), ""Cast Away"" (2000), ""127 Hours"" (2010) and the book ""Adrift: 76 Days Lost at Sea."" Each one depicts a person dealing with an unexpected life-and-death situation using their own wits.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" beats them all in the visual depiction of spacewalking and the views of Earth from space. The special effects are realistic and convincing. The shot that included the aurora borealis was stunning. Expect this film to be nominated for awards in cinematography, editing and visual effects - all well-deserved.<br/><br/>Where it lost points with me was with the scenario and script, and the overall believability. <br/><br/>*** Spoiler warning again. Spoilers follow. ****<br/><br/>There isn't much expository information of why they are up there in the first place. Yes, to fix the Hubble telescope or whatever it was. But they seem to work carelessly and the character played by George Clooney seems to be like a 5-year-old on vacation, joking and wasting fuel by flying around aimlessly. I would expect astronauts in space to be more serious about their work - certainly during rest periods they can laugh and joke around, but at work I would expect them to be far more serious considering those conditions.<br/><br/>Even when a crisis happens, Clooney's character never really quits the jokes and even flirtations in the face of life-threatening conditions. I would expect a professional astronaut to be more serious, especially during a crisis period. Oh come on man, you're in grave danger and you're still flirting and joking?<br/><br/>The scenario that creates the crisis is a little hard to buy, but accepting it on face value, it's plausible. What I found hard to believe is that it didn't immediately become an international emergency; even though radio contact with Houston was lost there were apparently no other attempts to re-establish communication. It seemed like the world didn't care what happened to the astronauts and they were truly on their own. I remember the Apollo 13 crisis when it actually happened, and the world was worried and many people praying for their safe return. I found it hard to believe that there was little to no attempt at communication from the ground.<br/><br/>I also found it hard to believe that Sandra Bullock's character actually could survive such a series of mishaps and disasters. Any one of them could have easily resulted in the character's death, yet she escapes them all, without even much damage to her hair and makeup. I'm happy for the character she made it through all that but it still seems incredibly far-fetched.<br/><br/>The reappearance of George Clooney's character dropped the believability factor down to zero. It didn't even help to realize that it was just a dream sequence. How would he be able to tell her what to do with the landing thrusters in a dream? What would have been more believable would be if he were to get into radio contact with her again, even just for a minute or two, to tell her what to do about the landing thrusters. That I could have bought as just a lucky break for her. The dream sequence seemed like a gimmick.<br/><br/>The re-entry into the atmosphere and the convenient water landing (and her unlikely escape from the flooded craft) rather than a rough landing on land, with her final ability to just walk away from the whole thing also strained credibility. But hey, when it's your day it's your day.<br/><br/>I did like Sandra Bullock's work throughout the film and her feeling of being happy to be back on solid ground again was palpable. And Clooney did the best he could with the poorly-written role. Two Oscar-winning, A-list actors did the best they could do given a flawed story and script. The cinematography and special effects, though, are the real star of this film."
"parallel_projection","9","6","11","6 October 2013"," A modern masterpiece
","Gravity is a film I've been looking forward to for a ridiculously long amount of time. It's essentially about two astronauts who struggle for survival after floating debris collides with their spaceship, leaving them detached and adrift in space. It's not so much sci-fi as it is drama-thriller, and when I say ""thriller"" I don't mean that lightly. It was literally the most stressful 90-minutes of my life, but I was in awe of every second of it.<br/><br/>Cuar√≥n, who directed, co-wrote, produced, and even helped edit the film, hasn't done a full- length feature since 2006's bitingly poignant Children of Men, but Gravity was well worth the wait. It's one of the best-directed films I've ever seen. Cuar√≥n's use of incredibly long takes sucks the viewer in so that they physically cannot turn away. The film starts out with a 17- minute shot‚Äîno editing, no cuts. It's just the camera moving from one subject to another, in-and-out, close up and far away‚Äîall over the place, really. Space is limitless, and so is Cuar√≥n.<br/><br/>It's tough to appreciate just how masterful this film is until you see it for yourself. Being set miles above earth's surface, every single take is absolutely gorgeous. The visuals are stunning, and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is some of the best work I've ever seen, with Steven Price's electric and ethereal score only adding to the tense atmosphere. The earth itself turns into a character, and it's used brilliantly all the way up until the very end. <br/><br/>As for the performances, well, there are really only two significant roles. George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut out on his last mission, and serves as a form of moral support to Sandra Bullock's character‚ÄîDr. Ryan Stone‚Äîwho's up on her very first mission. Clooney does a fine job and is an integral part of the plot line, but it's Bullock who utterly dominates the screen time, giving a fearless and absorbing performance like never before. <br/><br/>It's by far the best work of her career‚ÄîDr. Stone is so real that it's scary. You laugh when she laughs, you cry when she cries, and you're breathless as she's struggling for air. The emotions that Cuar√≥n was able to elicit from her truly pull you into the film and make this an experience like no other. While the script isn't necessarily the best written, and most certainly skims the line of oversentimentality at times, those issues are secondary to the visuals and performances themselves. <br/><br/>It's truly an out-of-body experience, and probably the closet most of us will ever get to actually being in space."
"virek213","10","6","11","4 October 2013"," The GRAVITY Of This Outer Space Situation
","Probably about as original and realistic a film as one could be that is set in the vastness of space, even if it is just above the Earth's atmosphere, that Hollywood has made after films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, MAROONED, and APOLLO 13, films that it resembles quite strikingly at times, GRAVITY stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts doing a routine repair job on the Hubble Space Telescope who find themselves in the middle of a crisis when a huge debris field, created by the accidental missile hit on a Russian satellite, destroys both the space shuttle and the telescope itself, and the remaining shuttle crew. The horrifying incident leaves the two of them stranded some 300 miles above the Earth's surface, with only their spacesuits for protection against the airless and soundless vacuum of the void.<br/><br/>Clooney sacrifices himself in order to get Bullock into the remaining Soyuz escape pod still attached to the heavily damaged International Space Station; but again, many further complications arise. Only after a hair-raising, eye-popping dilemma does Bullock get into the pod and head for the nearby Chinese space station, which itself has suffered tremendous damage. Bullock, understandably in a huge panic, has only a limited amount of time before she gets into the Chinese escape pod and survives the intense heat of re-entry, not to mention another debris field created by the Chinese space station as it re-enters the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Whether seen in the regular wide screen format, in 3-D, or in the specialized IMAX 3-D (where it would share a further comparison with the 1987 IMAX documentary about the space shuttle program, THE DREAM IS ALIVE), GRAVITY succeeds as great science fiction; and while it is at times overwhelmed with the 3-D process and the avalanche of special CGI effects (though the budget stayed at $80 million), the effects don't overshadow the storyline or the characters, which is a marked and refreshing contrast from most Hollywood big-budget spectacles of the 21st century. What is perhaps most remarkable about GRAVITY is that it was a Mexican-born filmmaker, Alfonso Cuaron (who also directed 2001's Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, and 2004's HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN), who both directed and co-wrote it (along with his son Jonas). Even with all the ultra-high tech bells and whistles at his disposal, Cuaron in general has made a film that has a lot of the grace of ""2001"", the extreme tension of MAROONED, and the dogged realism of APOLLO 13, films that it can stand up to comparison quite well.<br/><br/>Most of the film's focus is on Bullock using her intelligence and hard-won courage to ensure her own survival, which had best been hinted at before in the 1994 action blockbuster SPEED. Even Clooney is on for only the first 40 minutes of this 90-minute saga; and Ed Harris, who portrayed NASA flight director Gene Kranz in APOLLO 13, is only credited with being the voice of Mission Control. In essence, GRAVITY is an outer space character study, and Bullock is the character in question; and she carries that role quite well. All of these things serve to make GRAVITY one of the best films of 2013."
"bruce-149","10","6","11","4 October 2013"," How long can you hold your breath?
","One after another, Hollywood churns out films that are either sequels, prequels, remakes, or reboots. It seems there is a real problem with writers these days, as the ability to make anything original seems to be in very short supply. Want to make a summer blockbuster? Put a costume on, spend some time setting up a story, and then spend sixty minutes blowing everything up. Superman, World War Z, Elysium, and Iron Man 3 would be some good examples. All these films were visually satisfying, but for this viewer, emotionally empty. Which is not to say that I didn't enjoy all of them in some way, along with the popcorn and Milk Duds.<br/><br/>Now we have Gravity, and instead of characters who are larger than life, we have Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone. Maybe that's a key here...the lead is a woman, and while men are logical, women are emotional. So it's easier from that standpoint for an audience to build an emotional connection. Stone is any of us, if we somehow were brilliant enough to make it in to Space, yet she still crashed the simulator, every time. We can relate.<br/><br/>So why do I think this movie is a 10? It really isn't perfect. How much abuse can a person's body take without breaking? This, like many other films, subjects its stars to some serious body blows. There are things that are repeated in its zippy 90 minutes. Still, it had me holding my breath, literally, more than any film since Hurt Locker. Gravity had me feeling that I was there with Ryan Stone as all hell was breaking loose, and I believed that it was possible to survive, to keep living...to tell you a story. Open your eyes, your ears, your heart, and live."

","Short movie review of Gravity.<br/><br/>After being an observer at IMDb for several years, I have decided to make an account, the reason is this movie Gravity.<br/><br/>Just came back from this movie and I really had the feeling I was in space for the last 90 minutes or so. Sometimes the tension was to much to handle, there where some really scary moments during this movie. The effects also tricked me in believing I was really up there, never did I had the feeling that the CGI effects where faked, it looked like the real thing. The 3d effects also where top notch. The acting from SB & GC was also very realistic and both performed very well.<br/><br/>To sum things up:<br/><br/>Best movie I have ever seen! <br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>*Original story (also liked skipping the unnecessary interlude, straight to the action) *Great cast/acting *Fantastic SE *Great ambiance *Optimal usage of 3d effects *It really does its name (Gravity) justice, you will understand this when you have seen the movie<br/><br/>This movie was so good that after seeing it, I would never even (if given the opportunity) think about going to space, it scarred the sh*t out of me, the movie (acting, story, sound, effects, ambiance) really catches the claustrophobic and fragile dependency on machinery very well. <br/><br/>Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie in 3D!!!!"
"apis_arefiz","9","6","11","4 October 2013"," A masterpiece without no doubt.
","Before this I only watched two films that was directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n. One which is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the second is Children of Men. Both of these films especially Children of Men is really one of the great cinematic masterpieces made by Alfonso Cuar√≥n. The only films that I've seen he produced is, his collaborations with Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. Pan's Labyrinth was also a great films with stunning visuals and story. Nevertheless, what Alfonso Cuar√≥n produced is not important here. It is the direction and writing from Alfonso Cuar√≥n and Jon√°s Cuar√≥n that what makes me loves Gravity.<br/><br/>By only seeing his two films, I can honestly say that I loves Alfonso Cuar√≥n films. I knew Gravity back when I saw the poster at my local cinema. Immediately I saw Alfonso Cuar√≥n name on it. After that, I watched the trailer and I am impressed with the visuals shown in it. To be honest, the less you know about the film, the better.<br/><br/>The film starts out by showing fantastic view of the world accompanying with the dazzling score made by Steven Price. In the intro comes Dr. Ryan Stone who is played by Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski who is played by the handsome George Clooney. Both of them including the third astronaut who's an Indian played by Paul Sharma, are on to do their duty. Here, film also shown a glimpse of graphic violence which prove a bit unsettling for some viewers.<br/><br/>The films starts to build up the suspense and thrills when the debris from a satellite crashes into the space shuttle Explorer, destroying most of it and leaving them stranded in space with limited air. A moment of silence used in the films is also spot-on. Every moment of silence in the film is well used. I also noticed there's a plenty of continuous shot used in Gravity. From moment to another moment, most of the shot used by Alfonso Cuaron is a long and continuous shot. That kind of shot is what makes Gravity more authentic and breathtaking. The view of the world from the space is just simply astonishing.<br/><br/>Scene after scene shows the hardness of survival from the aftermath of the debris that hit them. George Clooney performance is well enough to be mention as well as showing the funny element in the film. As for Sandra Bullock, her performance is great. She shows the emotions and acts to survive. Her struggle, determination and persistent is what best to describe her performance in the Gravity.<br/><br/>The plot in the film itself is not that deep, and it is more straight forward but in the mean time, this does not mean the film story is not good. Gravity is one of the most well crafted film made by an impressive filmmaker. The film stunning visual, should be credited to cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, in which it keeps me attached to my seat right along with the astronauts. Gravity is the closest we will ever get to the real deal of being in the deep space. The physics shown in Gravity makes you realize that this film is very hard to make and we can see there's a lot of effort is put to make the film.<br/><br/>The only flaw this film had, is just a small bit which is on the ending. But I don't want to spoil anything here.<br/><br/>Overall, Gravity is one of the most impressive visual films I've seen so far this year. If you are a fan of space drama such as Moon or Sunshine or Kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey, you'll love Gravity. The build up of the suspense, the thrills, the emotions shown and the scores is what makes Gravity one of the best films in this year for me. The authenticity in the movie is just top notch. In the end, Gravity shows that in life we need gravity. It is vital as we're humans need it just like air to breath. Oxygen and gravity is the science elements of life that we need to prosper. In Gravity itself shows there's a lot of message in it. It is showing to us that gravity is an essential part in life in order to live.<br/><br/>To conclude, Gravity is one of the great films I've seen so far this year. If you like sci-fi and space drama with an exceptional visual and great acting plus great story, give Gravity a try. It should be appreciate as a great masterpiece without a doubt. Credit should be given to Alfonso Cuaron because of his direction, Sandra Bullock for her strong performances, Emmanuel Lubezki for the stunning cinematography in the film and also the rest of the crew."

So after the somewhat surprising but not unwelcomed riddance of the √ºber-hero guy, she goes vessel-hopping from ISS to a Chinese space station picking up obscure radio signals rather than any mission control - just saying, the Chinese one could be in reach, right? Instead, the station blows up and she ends up in a Soyus spacecraft where she pushes the magic landing button that made 007's return to earth in Moonraker look like a NASA documentary.<br/><br/>Actually, Clooney did the smart thing.

George Clooney did well to un-tether himself and escape when he did. It probably wasn't in the original script he just came to his senses and decided enough was enough.

"Troy_Campbell","10","7","14","4 October 2013"," Will be revered for generations to come.
","Comparisons to Kubrick's sacred 1968 masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey may seem premature, but I see no reason why Alfonso Cuaron's sumptuous space saga won't be revered just as highly for generations to come. Gravity is undoubtedly one of the most visually stunning and awe-inspiring films of the year - hell, the millennium - with it's flawless CGI, immersive 3D and technically astounding single-shot sequences. Cuaron announced himself as a ground-breaking filmmaker with his superb Children of Men back in 2006, but he outdoes himself here, with the reported 2 years of post-production paying off in spades. Never do you feel like you're not hundreds of kilometres in the sky, floating around gasping finite amounts of oxygen in an environment where no-one can hear your pleas of rescue and your thoughts are louder than the explosions that tear apart space stations. There's never a second of superfluous material or plodding narrative; every frame is meticulously crafted, every word of dialogue essential and every note of music encapsulating, keeping you enraptured both optically and aurally from start to finish. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are in fine form too, generating real emotions despite being stuck in bulky spacesuits for majority of the runtime and occasionally having to handle the tricky proposition of talking to themselves. If you're a fan of cinema then do yourself a favour and fork out your hard earned cash to view the glorious Gravity on the big screen, it'll be an experience you won't soon forget."
"Hello_Im_David","10","7","14","4 October 2013"," ""I Don't Want to Survive. I Want to Live!""
","Gravity is Alfonso Cuaron's first movie in seven years and it's well worth the wait. Once again he proves that he is one of the most visionary directors working today and he delivers a film on par with his masterpiece Children of Men. The movie stars Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone, a first time astronaut who is the sole surviver of a devastating wreckage that leaves her drifting in space. She must fight against all odds to get back to earth. Needless to say the visual effects are amazing, perhaps the best ever seen on film. It is beautiful to behold. The view of earth from space is stunning and the scenes of chaotic debris flying every which way is equally beautiful even as it is terrifying. The 3D only helps to enhance the experience, making the audience feel as through their floating along right next to Ryan Stone. The cinematography is equally amazing. It's fluid motions are like brush strokes on a canvas, and it should finally get Emmanuel Lubezki a well deserved Oscar for his work. Perhaps most surprising though was the great score by Steven Price. The fact that this is only Price's third film score makes it all the more impressive. <br/><br/>But it is not a movie that relies entirely on it's groundbreaking effects. At the heart of the movie is Sandra Bullock's performance. By far her best turn yet, Bullock takes this science fiction thriller and turns it into a very human story. A conflict between the fight to survive and the fight to go on living. Throughout the film it is clear that Stone is distant, almost detached from the other characters. She seems almost indifferent at times to the horror that surrounds her. It becomes clear that she had never come to terms with life after the death of her young daughter. The audience need only look into her eyes to see the cold indifference behind the fear. It is an emotion that is all the stronger when one is in space, and able to see just how inconsequential they are to the grand scale of the world and the universe. The audience, along with Stone, is left to wonder, does it really matter? If you die, the world will continue to spin as if nothing ever happened. <br/><br/>Gravity is more than just a movie, it's an experience. One of the few films that can take you out of your seat and completely immerse you in the thrills, the tension and even the feeling of weightlessness. It is a movie about survival. Pure and simple. Today we often take survival for granted. We have adapted our environment so thoroughly that we no longer have to fight to survive. We live comfortably in heated and air conditioned homes and we rarely think of what it means to survive versus what it means to live. We forget that it's not all about survival. After all, life is not worth living if all you do is survive."
"insessionfilm","10","7","14","4 October 2013"," Movie Review: Gravity is an excellent 3D thrill ride
","DIRECTION The first thing to know about Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity, is that it's not just a visual spectacle, but it's an interesting character piece as well. However, it's the visual style here that places this movie among some of the best we've ever seen. It's the best 3D movie since Avatar and you can tell he's been working on this for years. Many shots specifically rely on the 3D effect to give you the trill ride Cuar√≥n is looking for and it's incredibly effective. The aesthetic is the best I've ever seen for a space movie and is one of the more realistic one's you'll encounter to date. You really feel like you're in space floating around and experiencing something you never have before. The camera almost operates as it's floating around too. It circles often, turns in various ways and it very specific to show you depth and the different ranges of space. The visuals of earth and the sun are absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking. This is easily the best visual effects in quite some time and easily the best of 2013. Buckle up and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>SCRIPT The story is pretty simple on the surface. Ryan Stone, Sandra Bullock, is a medical engineer and is teamed up with astronaut Matt Kowalski, George Clooney, who are working on a new project up in space in lower Earth orbit when disaster strikes. It's a simple survivor story right? Wrong. They both become adrift in space and now have to team up to survive and figure out how to get back home. Throughout the struggle, we find out that Stone has some bad heartache and is still learning to grieve and let go of her pain. Yet, Kowalski, is a fun-loving guy looking to break some space records but ultimately knows what to do in order to survive. Once you start digging beneath the surface, Gravity speaks to amazing concepts of struggle and the fight to survive. This is especially difficult when you don't have anything to live for, but when you find that reason, it's not about just getting by but living each moment like it's your last. Sure, some parts of the script rely on coincidences and luck, but those moments are forgivable and small in the big picture of things.<br/><br/>Grade: A-<br/><br/>PERFORMANCES Sandra Bullock can be hit or miss, depending on who you ask, but in Gravity, she's a homerun. Regardless of what you think about Bullock, she does drama well and as a character who is traumatized in life and now the situation she faces, Bullock shines. Her character has depth and she brings a lot of emotion to her which is incredibly effective. You fall for her character and the struggle that she's in, both as a person and the situation. To me, this is Sandra Bullock's best role she's ever done. George Clooney has less screen time than expected but is also very good. He's the jokster, fun-loving astronaut that has a lot of stories to tell. He's also smart and comes across very engaging. Clooney doesn't have as much to do but is really good for what his character calls for. And you have to love the Ed Harris cameo. He was amazing in Apollo 13 as the NASA commander and is back in Houston as the voice that communicates back to our struggling astronauts.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>SCORE This is by far Steven Price's best score. He was great in The World's End, but his score not only is effective here but it's a critical piece to the film. This movie calls for emotion and is a huge spectacle and Price's score reflects that beautifully. He uses a lot of strings mixed with digital music and even some voice work. It's a good listen outside of the film and is perfect for what this film needed.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS Gravity is a movie you want to see in 3D. In fact, go to the biggest IMAX 3D screen you can find. The visuals are absolutely stunning and gives you the best 3D thrill ride you've seen in a long time. The performances shine and you feel like you're a part of the action in space. If you want to know what it's like in space without ever going there, watch this movie. It's absolutely incredible.<br/><br/>Overall Grade: A+"
"laur-90989","4","5","9","5 May 2019"," Amazing Effects - Terrible Otherwise
","The views of Earth from space are fabulous and the special effects that enabled the cast to float about are great. Its everything else that lets it down.<br/><br/>The soaring music telling me how to feel and the contrived inclusion of a dead daughter to get me rooting for the protagonist are not necessary. Nor is the 'added' tension of having a clueless rookie who needs to use an instruction manual and the tried and trusted 'eenie, meenie, miny, moe' method of flying space craft. The situation and backdrop of the planet Earth is quite dramatic enough and it's such a shame that it wasn't the entire focus rather than Hollywooding it up with unnecessary extras.<br/><br/>And why did the George Clooney character have to go on about eye colour? I found his flirting disconcerting and his questioning of her personal life back on Earth whilst they're floating through space preposterous. And of course he has to be the one who, despite being dead, returns to spur her on to survive in a dream sequence. What a hero.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film but it was just too daft to take seriously."

","I know this flick is classified as science fiction, but as it is not set in the future and clearly refers to real, present-day entities (NASA, the ISS, Soyuz...) I couldn't watch this as a sci-fi movie. If you know anything about manned space flight and care just a little bit about plausibility and real-life physics, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>As many people have pointed out in the goofs section, a lot of the movie is incorrect and implausible, starting from the main character's background and training to orbital physics, to idiotic plot twists. I face-palmed so many times while watching this, my forehead still hurts.<br/><br/>Factuality aside, the script doesn't make up for it. On the contrary, it is littered with clich√©s and platitudes to such a degree that it is embarrassing. While the protagonists stumble from one cringe moment to the next, drama unfolds in the most predictable ways. I could invariably foretell the next 5 minutes at any point, and as such the story is utterly boring and left me completely disengaged. I could not have cared less about the fate of Bullock's character, I even was slightly disappointed she made it out alive against all odds (and no, this isn't a spoiler - this outcome has been telegraphed throughout the film). The acting by both Clooney and Bullock is uneventful and (especially in Bullock's case) sometimes downright pathetic - probably aided by idiotic dialogue written by clueless imbeciles.<br/><br/>The only 2 positive notions are the sometimes grand visuals (but not as spectacular if you've ever seen real imagery shot from the ISS) and the short run-time (I liked this fact a lot - it somewhat reduces your suffering).<br/><br/>My tip - watch some real, grand sci-fi instead, like 2001, Dune, the Fifth Element or such - you know, a movie with good story, engaging characters and nice pacing and effects."

It would be impossible to list all the things wrong with the procedures, physics, probabilities, and command decisions. Good thing she had ""how to pilot the Soyuz for Dummies"" If you want to see a good movie, you have to look outside of Hollywood. There are over 10,000 pieces of debris orbiting the Earth, any one of them hitting a space craft would do severe damage, most likely destroying it. So an accident like the one in the movie is possible. That's why every single one of them is tracked till it burns up in the atmosphere. Again, don't wast your time. Horrible movie!"
"bentgrimes","5","5","9","10 June 2014"," Not what it is hyped up to be
","Is it beautiful? Yes. Is the sound incredible? Absolutely. Is it scientifically accurate? ... Sort of. At least in parts. Is it a good movie? Meh.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's character is the most unbelievable of characters. She is in space, meaning NASA cleared her to be there and yet she has no idea how to do anything. Her knowledge, or lack there of, is so limited that I would wager that the audience could have handled themselves better in her situation. I think it really hit home during the fire scene. Why... oh why wouldn't you vent the oxygen? hell, seal that pod off and let it die out. Anything would have been smarter than panicking and trying to put it out like it's an apartment fire. She even forgets Newton's laws... and she is an astronaut, remember? What an idiot. Pretty sure every space agency has a detailed procedure for fires. Not in the Gravity universe though, nope we just rely on fire extinguishers and frail, untrained, astronauts.<br/><br/>Let's not mention the space cowboy played by Clooney and his hair-brained idea of physics. He didn't have to die at all, though I can't say I am upset that he did. Both he and Bullock were stationary and shared the same orbital velocity, there was no reason for his weight to add any stress to Bullock nor for Bullock to go flying off in response to some unknown magical force. That whole scene made zero sense.<br/><br/>I won't even go into detail on why they couldn't have gotten to the Hubble nor the Chinese space station. No amount of fuel that they could have possibly attained could get them to either of those from the ISS. A quick Google search for ""problems with Gravity the movie"" will bring you all the info you need. I won't bother with this because, to me, I can suspend disbelief enough for that, if it were the only stretch...<br/><br/>OK so beyond stupid characters, gaping plot holes, and inability to suspend disbelief, we have to deal with the fact that the theme of the movie is clich√©' and worse, it is delivered in a terribly boring, albeit beautiful, way. This movie was incredibly repetitive and practically beat you over the head with it's constant ""birth"" imagery. The scene with Ryan in the fetal position floating in her ""womb,"" complete with an umbilical cord, made me literally laugh out loud. Subtlety was, apparently, not the goal here. We get it, will to survive, rebirth, parallels to biological equivalents, blah blah blah. It is still an overdone theme displayed in an uncreative, boring way. Let's not forget the religious undertones; had to throw those in, didn't we? Garbage. None of it was original and none of it was even displayed in an original manner.<br/><br/>In short, what Hollywood and critics have deemed to be the greatest Sci-Fi epic of our time is, to me, the biggest bore in the genre since Clooney's Solaris. Watch it for the visual feast, it is gorgeous, watch it for the amazing sound editing and score- they're phenomenal! Watch it for the realistic display of many physics concepts... sometimes... but don't watch it if you want to see an entertaining, thought-provoking, Sci-Fi film. It isn't any of that."

","I'm hard pressed to point out the worst part of this moving. But I suppose it must be that ""Cliff Hanger"" moment when George is desperately hanging onto Sandra. Hello! There's no gravity out there! But after the drama of the crash, where there was serious change in momentum, after George DID manage to hang on, it should all be over. No more change in momentum. But no, he's clinging desperately, just like in Stallone's Cliffhanger (where there WAS gravity). No you'd think that a movie called Gravity would at least try to be scientifically accurate. 2nd stupid moment is when she's spinning around very fast. No way EVER you get out from that spin. But she did. OK, away from science to plot. Why was George so keen to sacrifice himself for someone he didn't really know or like, who'd just contributed to the drama by NOT stopping what she was doing when he asked? Please!!!"

How the hell did she even get nominated for awards at all is beyond my comprehension and i can understand the technical awards for the CGI work but thats it.. George Clooney in this movie was not that much better ..thankfully his 10 min worth of acting saved us from more excruciating pain of poor dialogue and poor delivery.

George Clooney and Sandra Bullock certainly must have worked their socks off in the acting department and generally they are associated with watchable films.The beginning started off well and the special effects of the debris storm was fine and the 3d screen showed the films best bits at this point.

However, I kind wish I would have taken a day off from fighting those evil spirits and went on a Ramen Noodle diet for a few days in order to see this one in an IMAX theater and in 3D. However, even on the small screen, this movie proved to be too awesome for words.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n really created a movie that was unbelievably amazing and I can't think of a single thing that was wrong with it. The story is very simple but tossed into a new orbit thanks to it being in space, the acting from Sandra Bullock is incredible and she easily gets you to sympathize with her, worry for her and cheer for her survival, the editing and camera work is fluid and natural to the point it just consumed me into the action and the visuals are more amazing to look at than a dragon fighting a unicorn while surrounded by rainbows.<br/><br/>There was, literally, nothing about this film that I didn't like.

Also i was not very impressed with the quality of the video. Had potential for so much more. (could of used a lot more cast) it is hard for me to write such a bad review since George Clooney is in it and he is by far my favorite after but i did not like it. If you think the movie will be different then the trailer I'm sorry but no such luck.

"jkuhn01","3","5","9","5 March 2014"," What a shame! a to-the-point review:
","As most have said, in a nutshell, all of the focus on special effects and cinematography left for a neglected storyline. What a shame! Just watched it last night after much anticipation and wondered where the tension had gone that was exhibited in the trailers.<br/><br/>It wasn't gripping, it didn't make me care about the characters, a lot was confusing to the layman who doesn't know anything about space engineering... the list goes on. Best actor was Ed Harris who opened the film as 'Houston'- couldn't see him, but he certainly sounded the most natural, a great contrast to every line by uttered by Clooney (too bad, as I like Bullock and I'm fine with Clooney when he plays Ocean-style characters).<br/><br/>The only success if I were forced to list one (again, apart from the special effects, which like others have mentioned, lost the awe surrounding them anyway after having grown accustomed to the space views deeper into the film) is that I did feel the exposure and the vulnerability of floating in the vast, black emptiness of space, effectively emphasized by the contrast demonstrated upon re-entry into the relatively safe interior of a spacecraft or space station. But they blew it with the lack of character development, not making me feel any anxiety for Bullock or Clooney in this capacity, only for myself were I put into their situation. Again, a shame. Instead of being engrossed in Bullock's storyline or performance, we found ourselves speculating upon why her hair didn't stand up while inside the cabin in the absence of gravity and other trivialities.<br/><br/>Basically they left the plot line in the dust. This would have been better as a documentary about space, rather than incorporating a fictional screenplay. Glad we didn't purchase it on Blu Ray, not worth a re-watch. It's not AWFUL, but it's boring, so earning at most a 3."

","After having viewed the trailers for this movie I was a bit skeptical, but chose to give the film the benefit of a doubt. It quickly became evident that the rave critical reviews were a load of crap designed to prevent Hollywood producers from ""losing their shirts."" The premise that sets up Bullock's character is plausible, but the storyline goes downhill fast. It appears the entire goal of this film was to showcase Bullock's minimal acting talents and 49 year old sculpted body. George Clooney was added to draw the female demographic to the theaters, period.<br/><br/>The opening sequence was largely borrowed from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. As for the remaining scenes, the amount of suspended disbelief required to see this flick through to the end will require the viewer to have an understanding of physics often demonstrated by famed cartoon character, Wiley Coyote. The statistical likelihood of Bullock's character surviving the situations that occur would be similar to the same person winning the Powerball for six consecutive drawings.<br/><br/>This film joins ""Blood Beach"" on a list of worst films ever made."
"dmcmillan01","5","5","9","12 January 2014"," Amazing effects but no Story
","There were some amazing special effects, lots of excitement and tension, in the film Gravity. However, it lacked enough back story about the characters involved so that we could care about, worry about, and hope for them. If we had known more about who these people were, not just a few paragraphs about them, I would have been much more excited about their reaching earth safely. I'm sure it would have been possible to balance the excitement along with the sense of why I am worried about them, caring about them, and what it will mean if they don't make it safely to earth. And who will miss them should they not survive. Besides the viewer, who in their lives would be distraught about their loss, if gravity won? I love special effects, but I love the drama in the characters lives as much. Since they just gave gravity a Golden Glob award, I find myself disappointed that a film with such a weak story, has won. I wanted to like this film more, and granted there were a lot of exciting scenes, but it just wasn't enough story about the humans involved. Like the title, Gravity was the only star. Too bad. It could have been so much involving. I went home feeling an odd loss due to not caring much about those who were prey to gravity."
"pyx","6","5","9","17 December 2013"," Polished visuals elevate this movie higher than it deserves
","Gravity is one of those movies that is a great watch, but when you get to the end, you realise how utterly contrived and lacking in substance it was. I was particularly irritated but the perfect timing and convenience of the disasters. One, even two would have been plausible, but seven was just stretching credibility (3 debris hits, the suit air supply, Clooney's thruster fuel, the fire on the Russian station, and the Russian shuttle's lack of fuel).<br/><br/>The very opening premise seemed to me to be flawed - after all, it seems extremely unlikely that of the millions of square miles of potential orbital trajectories, the debris would happen share the exact same flight path as all three international space missions. After all, who places geo-stationary objects in the orbital path of a satellite (and if they weren't geo-stationary, how did the debris catch them)? As a piece of switch your brain off story-telling, Gravity was masterful - it had pacing, pathos, emotion, and in spite of the fact that most of the movie features a single actress not interacting with anyone, it never felt laboured or boring. However, you must understand that this movie is all style and no substance.<br/><br/>Ignore the incongruity of a medical doctor working on a space telescope - ignore the incongruity of navigating an escape vehicle a hundred miles on landing jets only, ignore all of the many plot holes, and you are left with a movie that is still implausible on every conceivable level.<br/><br/>Yet for all that, damn it, I still liked it. I think it's because humans have an innate love of the concept of space, and weightlessness, which this movie brought to life superbly.<br/><br/>I see people calling this best space movie ever. It wasn't. Sunshine, Mission to Mars, Event Horizon, Outland, even Alien, did space better than this, but Gravity is certainly supremely polished and tightly edited, although the entire Indian lullaby scene left me cold.<br/><br/>Overall, worth the watch solely for the quality of the space re-creation - everything else is a bonus."

The clever switches from third to first person is excellent and I have to commend this - especially with the 3D, I really can't stress how much of a stunning spectacle it is.<br/><br/>NOW, HERE'S THE PROBLEM: The stunning visuals mask a poor and unrealistic storyline.

","There is not a thing that I would change about Gravity. It's straightforward, and its execution is flawless. This film accomplishes two things so well that it deserves praise, it makes you feel great about being in a theater, and it makes you happy to be alive<br/><br/>If you've heard anything about this movie already, you've heard something alluding to how it makes you feel like you're in space, how stunning it looks, visuals, etc. and its true. Having seen Transformers in IMAX and Resident Evil in 3D, huge wastes of money, Gravity reinvigorates the need and greatness of 3D and IMAX that Avatar promised. Gravity not only joins the field of best 3D movies, but directly challenges for its top spot. Gravity hit closer to home. Cuaron just chose a simpler more realistic plot, didn't waste any time with annoying filler (its only 90 minutes), and reminded us that going to the theater is sometimes really, truly worth it.<br/><br/>This simple premise, of escaping earth for just a moment, tapped into so many themes relating to individual human experience, that it created an unexpected rush and excitement that most action movies can't even accomplish. One of the more important themes that is felt throughout is the choice of truly WANTING to live. The main character has a tragic past, and has simply been carrying on in life without any hope or joy anymore. Suddenly, she is faced with the option of a beautiful death: the truest, darkest, quiet, easy fade into nothingness. And our main protagonist must dig deep into herself to choose to live or not. This kind of theme may have been approached before, but Gravity truly makes you FEEL it.<br/><br/>I will definitely return to watch it again. Beautiful film."

From start to finish it keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing what will happen next. The script is simplistic. It is purely about human survival and how our will to live is so much more powerful than we could ever imagine. Throughout the entire film, Bullock's performance never waivers. It is the best she's ever been and she has the power to move you to tears. The film places you in the position of her character and makes you feel as though you are in space, along for the ride. The visual effects will fool you so well, you'll think you were just transported to space for an hour and a half. The sound design perfectly ads the tension and fear that is pushing you to the edge of your seat. All these elements combined make for one considerable directorial monument for Alfonso Cuar√≥n. 'Gravity' is one hell of a roller coaster ride that deserves, no, beckons to be seen in 3D on the largest screen possible. There is no other way to do this masterpiece justice."

It isn't complicated or have any plot twists because it doesn't need them. Bullock and Cloony keep you invested in their characters from the very beginning. <br/><br/>On top of a simple, but enveloping story and characters, the visuals are unparalleled in any space based movie. I couldn't see where the shot footage ended and the VFX began. The zero gravity effects were completely believable the entire time, and I never felt like the actors were trying to look like they were in zero gravity environment. <br/><br/>The audio was exceedingly realistic, during my second screening, I kept track of sounds, and when they appeared, and when they didn't. It was all completely believable with where the audience was watching the scene from. My favorite audio moment was when the camera passes into Sandra Bullock's helmet. The audio experience is completely immersive, I could feel exactly what she was feeling in that terrifying moment. <br/><br/>Gravity is a fantastic film, I would recommend it to anyone."

No, it's not because I'm a sheep.<br/><br/>The absence of dialogue and the apparent lack of action action give your eyes time to feast on the visuals and your brain to agonise over how in the hell the crew were able to simulate the conditions of space. The way the camera passes through Sandra Bullock's helmet, for example and allows you to see the telemetry on her visor is, although minor, a breathtaking effect that takes you from first person perspective to onlooker seamlessly yet transports you from the confinement of the space suit to the immense darkness of space itself. I'm not sure which perspective was more terrifying but having the benefit of both views enhanced the suspense that was unfolding. <br/><br/>For those who scoff and say that it was unrealistic, what do these people want? Of course the final scene is implausible (not going to give anything away here) but I found myself on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The long shots are jaw dropping and the flowing nature of the direction really draws you in to sharing the weightlessness and disorientation of the astronauts.<br/><br/>The major surprise for me is that the director showed his complete lack of arrogance by not prolonging the film for any longer than in needed to me. 90 minutes for a movie of this budget must be unheard of but in this case, less is certainly more. James Cameron would have found at extra hour of ""filler"" from somewhere.<br/><br/>I, for one, will be going to see this movie again on the weekend just to pick up on all the stuff I missed the last time.<br/><br/>For those who didn't like the movie, I suggest they go watch a film with gratuitous violence and a couple of nude scenes.<br/><br/>If your idea of a complete filmgoing experience is to leave the theatre perplexed and spend the next 2 hours with friends discussing the drama that unfolded, this is a perfect movie for you."

The technical complexity of this film which spent 4 years in development because technology wasn't advanced enough is quite mind-boggling. The opening shot is one continuous 17-min shot and the whole film is comprised of only 156 shots! Despite this low shot count there is plenty of complex camera movement. The visual effects are also very realistic and some of those VFX shots will go down in history as some of the most impressive ever seen.

Reviewers who don't understand the concept of FICTION probably shouldn't be making them about fiction films.<br/><br/>The movie was spectacular. First, the physics of zero-gravity and space travel were spot on; probably the best ever on screen. Second, the plot was moving...not because there were conspiracies or fantasy elements, but because it was more about human survival and perseverance in the most inhospitable environment known to man. Bullock was surprisingly good out of her normal role as a romantic interest of some rich New Yorker. Clooney was both firm (as a mission commander) and comical (as a human) which helped the film get going and, in a wise move by the director, his role was surprisingly short in the film, dampening any negative aspects of his character.

It's visually stunning and has a very emotional element to it that is hard to ignore. I must say, lots of tears were flowing from my eyes. The cinematography is breathtaking. The whole movie felt like I was actually in space with these two astronauts, experiencing what they were experiencing as they tried to get back home.<br/><br/>I saw 'Gravity' in I MAX 3D, which is probably the best format to see it in. The 3D was perfect, and this is coming from a guy who hates 3D. There are only a few films I have seen that actually worked in 3D and this definitely tops them all. Most of the films setting is in space, and I must say, the visuals were absolutely astounding. Every details of space seemed to have been made to absolute perfection. An Oscar for visual effects will be given to this film. If it's not, I've lost hope.<br/><br/>Steven Price's score was the best I've heard in awhile. It's definitely one I'd love to listen to on an off day. The music really made the movie just that much more emotional. Alfonso Cuaron is well known for directed 'Children of Men' and 'Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban', so we know what the man is capable of. His talents are put on display more than ever in this film. He also wrote the screenplay, which is really well written. There's only so much you can talk about while in space, but the screenplay was perfect with such an emotional impact.<br/><br/>I've always had a soft spot for Sandra Bullock. She always gets to me, whether it would be making laugh or making me cry. She knows how to tell an emotional story and make you feel impacted by it. Her performance in this was amazing, with her ability to make me laugh and cry at the same time. I've never seen anything like this from her before. George Clooney was also great in this film. He played a calm and more laid back character. He has some great one liners as well.<br/><br/>'Gravity' will probably be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I'm honestly praying it wins. The film was visually and emotional breathtaking and is something that shouldn't be missed. I was originally not going to see it, but decided to take a chance. Thank God I did. I recommend 'Gravity' to someone who just wants to watch a great film. I guarantee you will be in awe throughout the film. The runtime is perfect. At just an hour and a half, you will leave the theatre satisfied. I'm happy that I'm getting to see all these great films. Usually, I skip out on them to go see the blockbusters. I guarantee that won't happen anymore.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","GRAVITY is an incredible film. It uses 3D to an amazing effect, and I usually dismiss 3D as a gimmick. The cinematography is spellbinding, and you feel as if it was shot in space, none the less feel like you are in space while watching it. The special effects are incredible. They are computerized, but it does not seem computerized, as it just looks like it has always been that way. Acting from Sandra Bullock is just amazing, and I think she will win another Oscar. The script was great too. Alfonso Cuaron has made an impeccable job of this film, and it should be enjoyed by everyone who enjoys good films. I hope that you will enjoy this film as much as i did?"
"dierregi","9","5","9","27 October 2013"," I used to think being an astronaut was great... but for sure you see a hell of a landscape
","As everybody knows there are only two actors in the movie and they wear spacesuits and helmets most of the time. Therefore, acting and human interaction are not the key. Personally, I think too much time was given to Sandra Bullock and her dramatic situation. Clooney would have provided some buoyancy and made the movie more interesting character-wise.<br/><br/>If I have to point out one major defect, I found it silly to have Bullock look so good, with no sign of injuries or dirtiness and with her hair perfectly combed. Yes, she was mercifully make-up free, but otherwise she looked like she had just stepped out of her bed after a refreshing night's sleep.<br/><br/>For me, the film is an ode to the beauty and dangers of space, the only ""virgin"" territory left to explore. I used to think that being an astronaut was great, but I had to reconsider. Besides, the film is an example of 3D put to good use. The three-dimensional effects worked wonders in most sequences.<br/><br/>We see earth and all the meteorological events we observe from down here, we see sunrise from an astonishing angle, small objects float towards us and we even get the ""personal"" point of view of gazing through the helmet of one astronaut. The soundtrack was also great, underlying dramatic moments without being too bombastic.<br/><br/>There was also a major technical blunder which you can found out by yourself, but on the whole I must confess I am a sucker for movies set in space where the space is the main character and I got totally lost in this one."

","As a truly passionate person about space for many years, I wanted to watch this movie in the best conditions ever. It happened to find myself near an IMAX movie theater this Friday, in Rouen (Normandy) so I went to watch it with my heart open and I wasn't disappointed at all. <br/><br/>The environment. Space. That fascinating place where our cosmonauts dare to travel, to work for science, for Earth, for us. Think about the risks and the stress they endure to perform their tasks in non-optimal conditions, as long as the situation allow them to do. Think about that these RARE people who have a no-guaranteed-ticket back to Earth (history has proof, and it's all recent) were trained to go above us all. And unfortunately, there are people who had never come back. <br/><br/>The story. As you can watch in the trailer, a few cosmonauts are trying to repair/maintain something in space, more precisely, the Hubble telescope but something happens and they need to stop the mission. The smallest accident in space may be fatal.<br/><br/>The main characters. While I had no doubts about Clooney, (secondary character) I was afraid Sandra won't fulfill his role. Bad mistake. This is probably the best role she has ever had. I won't enter into details but Sandra is transporting herself perfectly in her role. The emotions she's getting trough are so palpable, maybe I'm going a bit out of the way but just remember Natalie Portman in Black Swan, how she completed her role. Sandra is doing as much as the same. The emotions! George's character is under exploited but it has enough meaning to count in the movie.<br/><br/>The Motion Picture & Visual FX Sometimes you have the impression you are watching a real documentary. The Earth seems to be so real, the lights, the shadows, everything is pushed to another level so close to reality. It feels so real. There are many moments where you are feeling like you're inside a cosmonaut suit, turning around in space at no gravity, while Earth is turning as well around itself and the sun. <br/><br/>The Soundtrack In space, there is nothing to carry on the sound. Excellent job by Steve Price. :) Minimal but sometimes heavily spontaneous, just as like the movie is. <br/><br/>Conclusion. This movie is unique in his style. Survival, Drama, Adventure? One thing is sure, it must be watched in IMAX or at least in 3D Relief to really appreciate the huge amount of work that has been done on this side. I guess it is the only way to totally immerse yourself in this almost-realistic unforgettable adventure of Dr Ryan Stone.<br/><br/>Farewell"
"gerard_chaouat","9","5","9","26 October 2013"," excellent space survival money, BUT NOT scientifically accurate
","The movie itself is excellent, and so far, with the exception of Avatar, it is the only one which really justifies 3D. From the very beginning , very close to IMAX shuttle films, which I have seen in Paris and the National Air and space museum, the movie is breathtaking.The visual and sound (I will come to that) are absolutely flabbergasting,and the efforts to recreate weightlessness conditions are astonishing: compare the single ""floating pen"" in 2001 with the amount of debris hovering inside the ISS, and you will realize what I mean. I must admit I was totally captured by the race for survival of Sandra Bullock. Yet: The shuttle was reformed (alas) in July 2011, if I am right, Tiangong 1 was launched September 2011....Besides, the Tiangong we see in the film is more like Tiangong 3 than Tiangong 1.....so far, I am not aware of a additional Shenzou left over on Tiangong. The Tiangon we see is also more like the still to be launched Tiangong 3 than the present Tiangong ..... ISS and Hubble are on two different orbits The concept that an MMU (or MMU like vehicle, which is the case here) would be able to make a straight on voyage from shuttle (anchored to Hubble) to ISS does not stand. The same applies (even more ) for the retrorockets of Soyuz aiming it at the Tiangong. A rendez-vous needs a lot of maneuvers, even more if you need to change orbits, as would be the case (ISS and Tiangong are,I repeat, on different orbits) The debris should NOT elicit noise outside the ISS, in space (that is paradoxically most frightening). Tiangong is not a mere copy of Soyuz by many respects. It is unlikely, given changes in electronics, etc...that one could have the same functions on exactly the same buttons. Shenzou are,as was/ is Soyuz, not equipped to float..;(this was the case for some ZOND, you know, the vessel which was intended by the Soviets to circle the moon with humans before Apollo 8, but only carried animals, Brejnev refusing Leonov to go with a vessel which did not appear safe enough after failures). Thus, the Shenzhou should have sinked immediately after earthing in the sea (or a lake ??) ETC..... But.... is that really that important ? Is gunfight at OK corral the exact rendition of the real thing ? certainly not...Yet ....it is a classic what excited me in that move is that it is ""accurate enough"" to make you believe in what happens....And in that respect , i certainly delivers One minor point : as for Avatar, I am not sure that even a very large LED 3D TV will give you later on the same effects as a big screen. For my sake, I watched it upon director's recommendation in the Pathe Wepler, and this was breathtaking"
"jnelso19","9","5","9","21 October 2013"," A Team Effort That Must Be Seen in Theaters
","One thing that has been missing in these big blockbuster films in this day and age is the ability to have a solid story and merge it with A- List talent and extraordinary technology (Enter multiple blockbusters here). This wasn't the case for Alfonso Cuaron and despite the years spent in production hell, the payoff was extraordinary. Using his ability to make long takes work in his favor (Children of Men for those who haven't seen it) he makes what could have been a disaster and turned it into cinema gold that doesn't make you feel stupid for spending money on it. Along with Cuaron's incredible directing abilities, there was the extraordinary acting of Sandra Bullock and a briefly seen yet meaningful George Clooney.<br/><br/>As A-Lister's should, they carry the film in ways very few people can and I'm no Hollywood insider, but I can imagine that the films $100 million budget was significantly inflated hiring those two and it was worth it. As Dr. Stone, Bullock performs with her usual excellent acting and because of it, we all relate to her in this film. Someone who has to fight to survive in an environment that you never truly prepare for (Disaster), granted her character is in a situation only few can honestly understand but she represents more than those people. Her character, one can argue, represents the everyday person who has to do whatever they can so they can get home,it's someone who has to deal with work B.S. or someone who deals with issue after issue when all they want to do is complete their day. Dr. Stone is someone you can relate to and that's to the credit of Cuaron and Bullock in making that happen which comes to the biggest thing in films and in life in general (I'll explain that later). Then there's the graphics.<br/><br/>The graphics of this film is to say the least incredible and because of it, makes it one of the very few films that actually deserved the 3-D treatment. The best way to describe it would be to compare it to watching an IMAX documentary about space that's in 3-D it's that realistic. It's one of those Avatar type films that you have to see in theaters in order to truly enjoy the film. The details that were taken into account to make this movie as real as possible really is the deal breaker because if it wasn't considered, the film would be at best average which comes to the only flaw in the film, the script itself.<br/><br/>The story itself is not really anything to ride home about as it can be considered predictable and there are a few things you wish were avoided, but it still doesn't take away from the film itself (Much like Avatar). Then there are the theoretical life lessons this movie brings by having you be a part of Dr. Stone's journey and yes, it's Dr. Stone's journey not Clooney's (even though his performance should not be discounted as he did a hell of a job). All of these things lead to the film that is Gravity which brings this review to a full circle.<br/><br/>When you make a film, it has to be a team effort, if not it's going to a disaster of epic proportions. You can scrap a script together put a couple A-List actors in it and let the rest of it go (Battleship is an example granted only Liam Neeson is A-List but that's not the point). But if you want to really make it work, you have to have a quality director, quality script and quality actors if you want to make it work. That's exactly what happens here and because of it, we're now given a film that could be a strong Oscar contender despite being a film that is usually anything but and that's to the credit of Cuaron, Bullock, Clooney and everyone who made it happen."
"filmfan1991","Null","5","9","20 October 2013"," Shows that space can be both beautiful and scary
","I just went to go see this movie today and I have to say that I was blown away by it. I was expecting what I saw in the trailers but instead I saw something totally great and suspenseful. When I saw the beautiful CG opening shot of the Earth and the space shuttle in space I was hooked. Granted it starts off slow but once the real meat starts its a non stop roller coaster ride in space. I wouldn't even call this a science fiction movie because the things depicted in this film can happen in real life right now.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is that it depicts space in the most realistic way that it can and that also the weight of the film lies on the shoulders of only two actors: George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. The special effects used for the space scenes are some of the best that I have seen in recent memory and out in space there is no sound except for muffled noises which adds to the realism. The cinematography is used to great effect with a lot of first person view shots which adds to the tension. The acting for the most part is great but Sandra Bullock gives an excellent performance as Ryan who gets stuck up in space with almost no way to get back down. When she acts you pretty much feel for her character.<br/><br/>As I said before the movie starts off slow but once disaster strikes the pace picks up and almost never lets up and Cuaron's deft directing hand makes ""Gravity"" tense, suspenseful and just plain beautiful due to the fantastically directed space scenes.(Couldn't expect anything less from the guy who directed ""Harry Potter 3"" and ""Children of Men) (Easily one of the year's best films in my opinion.)"
"HandHStudios","10","5","9","20 October 2013"," A Cinematic Experience Like No Other
","There is no other film experience on Earth like Gravity. Which makes sense, keeping in mind the whole movie was located in space, with only the ending scene being on Earth.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron has struck gold with his masterpiece Gravity. It explores the silence of space where all you can hear are your breaths and your thoughts as you spin around aimlessly. This is usually harmless until a crisis like debris comes into play. From then on, Sandra Bullock puts on an amazing performance which will definitely give her an Oscar nod, and George Clooney is his usual affable self.<br/><br/>One thing that really defined this movie's greatness was its careful attention to being realistic. From the tears slipping down Sandra Bullock's cheeks actually floating off her face, to the oxygen in her suit depleting at a steady rate, this movie doesn't look over any detail or flaw. Instead, it uses simplicity and directness to flow the movie along. Nothing was that unbelievable in this movie.<br/><br/>Even though sound was a luxury in this movie, the emotional side of the film was not. Confined to tight spaces, Bullock couldn't really do anything to hide her emotions. She couldn't run anywhere to hide, or walk into a different room. Instead, we all saw and felt what she was going through, and actually cared about what happening to her character.<br/><br/>Another thing this movie did that was great was switch perspectives of the camera. We went from seeing what was happening from the character's eyes, to a third person view, to a wide camera angle, all in a few seconds. And the best part is, the camera was so fluent and coherent that we didn't even notice that the perspectives were changing until it actually happened. Genius filmmaking.<br/><br/>I could go on about this things this movie did right, because to be honest I can't think of anything I didn't like in the movie, which is extremely rare. Overall, this is a new kind of cinema experience that cannot be replicated again. (Yes, that was a challenge, directors!) Everyone in the target audience and beyond should see this movie because of its realistic sense of things and its careful attention to detail. The cinematography is beautiful, and the views and perspectives this movie gives are to die for. The emotional core, themes, and moral lessons this movie offers should be soaked up with ease. And the way it draws you into the story and what's happening is truly an amazing feat."
"khanbaliq2","9","5","9","19 October 2013"," An unforgettable experience for the eyes and the mind.
","Gravity is the kind of film that doesn't often get made in Hollywood. The film was shot in the United Kingdom and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Director Alfonso Cuaron manages to grab us from the beginning in this science-fiction thriller with majestic views of Earth from space. We get introduced to Dr. Ryan Stone, played by Sandra Bullock, and Lieutenant Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney. The performances by Bullock and Clooney are both excellent. It's Bullock, however, who carries the film like an expert with a performance that makes her character sympathetic but also distant. Bullock is known both for her comedic roles (While You Were Sleeping, Demolition Man) and her dramatic roles (Speed, Crash). Gravity is very much an experience and the film should be seen in a theater. Cuaron combines drama and thrills for an emotionally satisfying result. The excellent visual effects may make some viewers wonder how they were achieved. They make us feel almost as if we're there in space with the characters. It's worth mentioning that Cuaron's work, and especially this film, has been influenced by director Elem Klimov's great 1985 war drama Come And See. If you watch both Gravity and Come And See you'll notice the striking similarities. In addition to Cuaron's expert direction and Emmanuel Lubezki's stunning cinematography we're also treated to an effective soundtrack by Steven Price, which works wonders in some scenes. Some reviewers ranked Gravity on the same level as science-fiction greats like Blade Runner (1982), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solaris (1972). I'm not going to jump to such conclusions at this time, but Gravity is easily one of the best films of recent years. I certainly recommend it."
"rgcustomer","8","5","9","8 October 2013"," A good movie, but not a great one
","I guess I should be clear about which Gravity I saw. I saw the ""IMAX Experience"" 3D version.<br/><br/>(I wish the cinema had been as clear about which IMAX I would be seeing. In the rust-belt Canadian city of Windsor, IMAX apparently means ""standard movie theatre plus reclining seats and oversize goggles"". I'll try not to let my disappointment with this Cineplex ""IMAX"" theatre affect my review of the film.)<br/><br/>I'm told the film was shot in 3D, but not in IMAX. I was not wowed by the 3D in this film. It's no Avatar, and even the up-converted Titanic had superior 3D feel. If you see this at home in 2D, you will not be missing anything.<br/><br/>I think the film is appropriately named Gravity, even though it's not really about physical gravity (until the final scene). Sometimes popular astrophysicist Tyson takes things a little literally. It's also about life and death, and the meaninglessness of life's struggle, which are pretty serious (i.e. grave) concepts.<br/><br/>I wish more time had been spent introducing the characters. It seemed a shortcut to just start in space. I wanted to meet these people (and the others) as they were on Earth, and ride up with them. Budget cuts, I guess.<br/><br/>But I think the film is probably the most realistic (for what it's worth) depiction of low-earth-orbit space that has been shown to large audiences in North America. Nevertheless, when I compare it with 2001: A Space Odyssey, which depicted a journey from Earth to Jupiter, with no CG effects at all, I'm left with more admiration for 2001, and a disappointment in Hollywood for making accuracy such an unexpected thing that people comment on it. But at least we have this.<br/><br/>There are some obvious problems, most notably the locations of various space stations relative to each other and to other satellites. I figured that was BS during the film, and confirmed it by reading a Tyson tweet. Yet, I don't know how else you could have a story like this. We should note that there is no space shuttle program any more, nor is there ""Explorer"", so maybe this film happens in a universe where things are a bit different.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is about Batman trying to save Robin... I mean Ryan, after their shuttle is catastrophically hit by debris. I found the first half to be fairly average, and I blame Clooney. I just can't take him seriously any more. They should have gone with a non-Hollywood actor.<br/><br/>The second half is about Ryan escaping ever-more-desperate situations on her trip back to Earth. The film gets significantly better in this half, so it's worth it. For atmosphere, I draw your attention to Le salaire de la peur (1953) (The Wages of Fear). These movies both patiently build a tension that have you gripping the arms of your seat.<br/><br/>In terms of effects, I'm going to assume that almost everything that wasn't fixed in place in front of an actor was CG. That's a lot of work, and it was mostly good. But I was disappointed with the fire. The fire was good for 1999. For 2013, it was pathetic. Unless fire in space looks like poorly-animated CG fire, in which case it was spot-on. At least there wasn't a lot of it. <br/><br/>The ending was somewhat of a let-down (see what I did there?). Here we have a person who has just been through an experience that no gods cared to help her survive, and that will render Earth orbit unusable for humanity, and she both thanks gods, and tells Matt to say hi to her dead daughter. How cheap. How predictable. If this film wanted to make a statement about religion, her capsule should have crash-landed in an Islamic republic, where should would have been sentenced to whipping for being discovered improperly covered at the beach. All the knowledge, all the heroism, all the humanity embodied by this character would be instantly irrelevant, reduced to an object at the whim of religious nuts. Now THAT would be a statement worth making, if anyone would dare.<br/><br/>I really disliked the music. How many times do we have to suffer the clich√© of crescendo orchestra followed by silence? I think I noticed three, and three more during the credits, because they are such suspense! <br/><br/>Was the frog at the end an homage to launch-frog? I'm going to take it that way.<br/><br/>In any case, this is certainly one of the better films of 2013, and is probably in the top three 3D films of 2013. I just wanted it to live up to the hype, and it does not."

I found this particularly inspiring in a male centered industry, where usually the hero is busy answering the damsel in distress calls. The plots develops fast, keeping the tension up all of the time, yet suitable also for young (i.e. 12 years old) audiences.

I'm betting Bullock and special effects get Oscar noms. Yes, there were some Hollywood liberties but overall B+ verisimilitude. Felt like I was there.

","I walked into the theatre not expecting much and I came out completely upset. And for the first time in my life I wanted to walk out of there while the movie was playing just out of pure, raging annoyance. <br/><br/>Aside from the breath taking CG (which makes me glad I watched in AVX 3D) and Sandra Bullock doing a good job with her acting (which I am not surprised by), there is nothing to this movie. <br/><br/>Gosh, where to I start. The script might as well have been written by a high school student with a beer in his hand. utterly juvenile and unsophisticated to the point that not only it distracts you from actually getting into the movie and believing the characters, you almost hate the director for for having wasted such good CG with this script. so much potential wasted. Throughout the movie, it literally spoon feeds you the message they are trying to convey: ""no matter what, it'll be a good ride, so don't stop fighting"". The characters just spell them out in their dialogue like you are 7 years old needing help getting the key message. We can think and interpret on our own, thank you. Plus, I think we all knew, going into the movie theatre, that there will be a crash, and they will survive. doesn't take a genius to figure out that's what it would be all about. They could've made the script so much more sophisticated.<br/><br/>Then the countless amount of completely unrealistic features. like Kowalski (Clooney) wasting his engine on joking around (I actually once watched a broadcast of people working on ISS to fix something outside. that kind of obscenity won't happen). like Ryan (Sandra bullock) being in space only after 6 months of training. Her panicking and panting nonstop like a complete idiot that leaves her with low O2 (I kept wanting to yell, didn't you learn NOT TO breathe like that?!?!?!?) the part where she is running out of O2 and trying to get to the airlock which was supposed to be done with so much urgency but she mumbles on and on (it is unbelievable how long she can stay alive and functioning with almost no O2) then at the last minute, she somehow gets the strength to travel from one end to the other of the space station. I kept on asking, why would NASA waste their money on sending someone this incompetent? also, wouldn't have they known she has lost half the reason to live with her child's death and is still depressed? plus, why on earth would anyone like that go through the immense trouble of going to space?? SO much question just attempting to believe the character. Then she enters the Chinese space station somehow and manages to mini-Mani-mo her way into operating the rescue pot. and what was that about, Chinese radio frequency getting caught (if that's possible anyway)? Chinese gov is not stupid to send astronauts who don't speak English. and the part where she pretends to be a wolf? so cringe worthy I turned my head away from the screen. and the part where Kowalski enters the pot in Ryan's hallucination? you just immediately know that's fake/dream given she isn't dying with her eyes popping out.<br/><br/>whoever did the CG will get the Oscar. whoever wrote the script (I don't care if it is a big name or not) should be ashamed he/she completely butchered a potentially amazing movie."

Welcome to Space camp.<br/><br/>Despite what you may think, Gravity is a surprisingly conventional popcorn thriller. I'll read you the summary. Which clich√©'s will we use? Eeenie, meenie mineee, mo... Gravity is the story of an astronaut who doesn't follow orders. The story of how crashing the simulator 100% of the time will still get you onto a space shuttle. The sexist story of how a woman is rescued by a man. The story of an astronaut who ""hates space."" The study of how everything apparently occupies the exact same orbit above the Earth, which is utterly ludicrous. The story of another Hollywood movie where people run away from fire balls down a hallway. The study of how in space, there is no sound except for that of the orchestrated musical score. The story of monster's closet dead body scares. The story of how you don't need to orient the spacecraft on reentry to avoid vaporizing: they apparently just fly themselves even when the circuit boards are on fire. Space junk alright.<br/><br/>Yeah I'm going to be one of those people. I don't understand why they couldn't have made a movie about a smarter woman who has the drive and cunning to survive. I guess dumb and luck is more interesting, than smart and driven. Gravity gets a 5/10 simply for the mighty filmmaking craft in the first half hour. After that, they ran out of money and we end up not with great space effects. No, it's back to three guys off screen rocking the camera around and endless rebirth symbolism that is anything but subtle.<br/><br/>There's a great tale in this material, but you would find it in the true story of the legendary cosmonaut Vladamir Komarov. His story won't offer the convenient ending you get in Gravity, but you do get a story of somebody fighting to survive in the most inhospitable place we know. But not here. Just like in real life, Gravity sucks."

"Teft","2","6","12","6 April 2014"," Yet another opportunity lost to great visuals
","I believe we've reached a point where special effects are so amazing in their look and feel that we are losing sight of the power of characters and stories. Gravity is the perfect example of this. The visuals are actually emotional and powerful and the necessary setting for such a story. But they should not be what truly move us. Gravity lacks so much of what many of the great science fiction writers provided us with, the chance to see events that have not happened, but could, and the effects on human beings beyond the obvious fear and panic (Ray Bradbury's incredible Kaleidoscope of course is the standard by which any lost in space story is measured). No doubt the intent was to show only Stone's experiences from her point of view but it would have been interesting to see Kowalski's journey and thoughts.<br/><br/>Another problem with Gravity in my opinion is the obvious references to Alien, 2001 and other science fiction films. And it seems totally ridiculous to take off your space suit when the danger of a lack of oxygen or pressure is everywhere. But we all know why that happened.<br/><br/>I'm positive that the brave astronauts in our space program have always been the best of us without being perfect. Their skills, courage and inspirational lives are what I wanted Gravity to capture. Instead it seems to either trivialize their quality or distort it depending on the particular scene. The courage to fear ratio is definitely off in Gravity and the character's reflections and conversations are irritatingly shallow.<br/><br/>So many lost chances to explore events which our astronauts have always had to deal with potentially. I was very disappointed in this film for that reason above all else."

We would be forgiven for thinking that In this day-and-age, Writers,Directors,Producers,(i.e. The whole Movie-making world)would,with such Information technology freely available on such a massive scale,no longer make obvious mistakes regarding the laws of Physics In Space. Sadly, many such silly mistakes are evident throughout this Movie and there really Is no excuse for It. But the main problem Is...It's boring! Okay,so space Is pretty empty (on a Human scale,of course) and so we can't expect much In terms of 'Interesting' photography at the best of times,but let's face It,In this case the vast majority of the dialogue Is far from thrilling either.

"gasboz","4","6","12","22 January 2014"," Don't believe the hype...
","OK,so this movie receives 10 Oscar nominations, everyone rants about how good it is and that it leaves you awestruck after watching it. As a sci- fi enthusiast you go and see it...and...surprise...it's the Avatar effect. Through the roof CGI, which cost enough money to feed half of Africa, but that's about it. Cheap character development, absolutely no story, no back story, multiple situations which I am sure Nasa would say are all 1:100000000 to survive and Hollywood sequences in which the ""hero"" always gets saved in the last hundredth of a second. It gets really boring really fast. <br/><br/>Let's get the obvious out of the way: the CGI is amazing (although not better than Avatar). Everything is perfect and visually you really enjoy it. And for those of you who think that CGI makes a movie: yes, Avatar and Gravity are the best movies of all time...(for those of you who agree, you can stop reading this and just go watch the movie).<br/><br/>The moment this movie begins it's just, I can't explain it any other word, SILLY. Three astronauts are making repairs on a satellite, while one of them floats around, jokes and sings with ""Houston"", while happily using his ""gas"" inside the suit to propel himself onwards (of course later he runs out of gas in a crucial situation - I guess NASA astronauts aren't really that smart...). The other astronaut is making repairs while being sick (?!) - usually you don't go out of the house when sick, but hey apparently ""Houston"" approves of going into OUTER SPACE (again - ?!). <br/><br/>So things start to go wrong: and after that the whole movie becomes a series of Hollywood ""they're not gonna make it but then they miraculously make it in the last second"" situations. After the 3rd situation you start to get seriously bored. You wait for it to get good, but honestly it doesn't.<br/><br/>There is no character development and you don't feel for the characters. You don't care if they die, because everything is so unreal and silly, that you just don't believe it. I will say the worst thing you can say about a movie: you know the whole time that it is a movie. When you watch Alien (1979), you know the alien is not real and that the chances of it existing are next to none, but you do feel scared, you feel anxiety...and that is what good film making is about. You don't experience such a feeling in Gravity (maybe a couple of minutes). <br/><br/>Someone on the board said it right: this isn't actually a movie. No plot, no character development, everything just happens. It's more of a documentary. <br/><br/>OK, I know that the whole movie is a metaphor and is representing the hero's struggle of coming to terms with a certain accident in her life, but there a couple of other such movies, which are sooo much better. This one just isn't believable.<br/><br/>When I heard that it received 10 Oscar nominations, I seriously lost all the little respect I had left for the Oscars. I guess a realistic depiction of water drops in zero gravity is enough to be nominated for 10 Oscars in our time. Again, don't believe the hype."

Loosing a bolt. Not having tools tethered. The astronaut George chit chat chat-up rather than focusing on job.<br/><br/>When the debris hits the shuttle all of a sudden the debris has more mass than the shuttle and knocks it around like a toy.<br/><br/>The unprofessionalism showed by supposedly trained astronauts spoilt the film, let alone the lack of real following of physics.<br/><br/>It would also seem Nasa no longer have any ground radio transmitters or Russians or Chinese for that matter.<br/><br/>It just goes on and on with error after error.<br/><br/>No astronaut would remove their helmet before leaving capsule.<br/><br/>The final sequence I almost wished there was a shark in the water to eat astronaut Sandra or she would be shot as a spy. <br/><br/>I know films are entertainment and sometimes they take liberties with the facts but this film it was continuous one after the other. I was expecting some but it could have been so much better if they had some proper advise before they committed to film.<br/><br/>I love space films but they completely spoilt it for me with the story line and lack of understanding of physics and how well trained astronauts are.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film was only 90 minutes long."
"universalview11","1","6","12","15 January 2014"," If you know anything about space business, turn off brain before watching.
","The reason I was disappointed is that I was given the impression that finally, after years of mediocre and silly space flicks, we were going to get a real space movie. A movie that was designed to make you think, and a movie that rises philosophical questions about what it is to be human in space (2001: A space masterpiece). In addition, I was given the impression that for once, the science and physics were going to be on target, even though a certain level of artistic license was to be expected. We got non of that. None. The plot is so thin and far fetched, right from the get go I was mildly annoyed about having to swallow the concept in order to enjoy the movie. The dialogue is so cheesy, unintelligent, cringe worthy and poorly written, it is reminiscent of what we were served in the utterly ridiculous film ""Armageddon"".<br/><br/>That's right: Despite all of its CGI glory, superb looking imagery, and attempts at creating the illusion of realism, at the end of the day ""Gravity"" is no less silly than ""Armageddon"". It certainly has the looks of a better movie, but it doesn't have the depth of a better movie. In fact, I'll take ""Armageddon"" over ""Gravity"" any day if only for the entertainment value of ridiculous cheese. The words uttered by the characters in this flick, are supposed to be those of astronauts - not your average truck driver. Maybe they should have made this a little bit clearer, cause they almost had me fooled. The astronauts portrayed in ""Gravity"" are in every respect as far from the real deal as you could possibly get. <br/><br/>The movie starts off with Dr. Ryan Stone - a suicidal medical engineer with six months of space training - working on the Hubble telescope(!). There. Let that sink in, cause the standard has now been set with regards to the level of realism one can expect for the remainder of this ridiculous space melodrama's running time. There is so much wrong with this film, I don't have the time or will to put my mind through every little detail one more time. As for scientific accuracy, sure, there are a lot of inaccuracies at play here. Countless, actually. But one scene in particular completely took me out of the experience: The Clooney exit - the most unnecessary death in a movie ever. When Kowaski and Stone finally get to the ISS, they bounce down the side until Stone gets her foot tangled in the backup Soyuz's parachute wires. Kowalsky is still connected to Stone by a tether, but he unclips himself to save her, and floats off into the void. At this point, the two astronauts' velocities relative to the ISS was zero - thanks to that parachute wire, they had really parked there. So literally all Stone had to do was tug Kowalsky over to her, and they both could have found a temporary safe house in the ship. In the movie we see Kowalsky completely nonsensically being pulled away by some mysterious force unknown to real life science. That scene is the equivalent of someone jumping off a cliff and falling upwards.<br/><br/>This is just one of the many, many annoyances that made gravity a mediocre watch. Oh, and the utterly pathetic attempts at emotionally manipulating the audience fell extremely flat and seemed to be directed toward a five year old. So they have a script that lacks everything, but figure throwing a dead kid into the mix will somehow make me forget that? Puke! I don't know what's wrong with all the critics who are apparently so easily duped. I'll end this on a positive note: ""Gravity"" does indeed contain some truly amazing special effects.Ôªø"

Nothing but glowing reviews in and out, I mean come on 96 meta score rating, and not to mention 98% on rotten tomatoes. That is damn near a perfect movie in most peoples eyes. In saying all that when I arrived at the movies I expected to walk out and feel the same way, seeing one the best movies of not only this year but of all-time. Boy was I disappointed.<br/><br/>We can start with the good of the movie. The special effects on this movie were great, although we should expect that giving it took 4 years to make the film. Next the acting. Sandra Bullock gave a great performance giving the circumstances. I give her a 8 outta 10 just because as an audience they provided very little to none backdrop of her story except she was a Dr and she had 6 months of training yet she was the one chosen to do the job. (Kind of a big job to give somebody with very little experience). Clooney although not being in the film for all of 15-20 minutes had a good performance. Give him 7 out of 10. Would be higher if in the movie for a better portion. OK I'm done with the ""pros"" of the movie.<br/><br/>Now to the negatives. Weak plot and predictable. I don't want to walk in a movie already knowing how it will go and what is to come. Let me explain. You watch the preview and see that while being in space the ship they came on clashes with debris from a Russian craft. (That they blew up on person). With that being said, after seeing that you automatically can determine that the movie would just consist of bullock trying to fix the crafts and getting home with a few tough twists and turns because it would not be easy. Lastly the ""believable"" factor. Without going into gory detail because it's not worth it, bullock avoids the debris coming straight at her 3 different times with all the debris just flying right by her. Not buying it. We also have Clooney who at the beginning of the movie is just strolling along with his jet pack on his back having a good ole time wasting his thrusters for when they really needed them. Honestly your out in space wouldn't you save that just in case something were to happen??? Guess not. Not to mention she boarded 3 different shuttles pretty easily and used a fire extinguisher perfectly to navigate through space. <br/><br/>Now I know that I am being harsh and I blame it on myself because I went into the movie with to high of expectations and was flat out disappointed. It's comical to me how people rank this movie damn near perfect. That debris that was flying everywhere throughout the movie must of really came out the screen in 3-d and hit some people and brainwashed them. Point blank. Period."

Once the initial momentum had been absorbed, no additional tension would have remained on the tether. She would have been able to retrieve him with only the slightest pull (he's weightless).

","Gravity is a film with fabulous visuals strung together over an appallingly substandard plot of clich√©s and director-indulgent moments. Yet again Hollywood has wasted millions on great CGI without bothering with decent writing. Part of Gravity's $100 million budget was surely spent on paying marketers to front-load sites like IMDb with 10-star reviews. It's a trick that works. But if you want to know what moviegoers really think of a film, wait until it's been out a couple of weeks, THEN check the user reviews ‚Äì you'll get a more accurate picture of how good or bad the film is. I give Gravity a 6. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock seems like a great person, the kind of cool, smart chick you'd like to hang out with, whose pleasing combination of poise and humility makes her fun to watch in feel-good movies like Miss Congeniality. Unfortunately, Sandra Bullock is not a great actor. In Gravity she plays protagonist Ryan Stone, the focal point of the movie, practically the only character. Given Gravity's extremely weak story, the film REALLY needed an amazing actress to play the part of Ryan Stone. A stronger actor like Charlize Theron or Jessica Chastain might have been able to bring much more to this role to help fill out the weak plot with a nuanced and powerful performance. But even a great actress couldn't turn Gravity into a movie that was more than just great CGI."

Ironically, Cuaron goes on to prove that even with a master like him at the helm, it is possible to make a substandard film.<br/><br/>It is shocking that Cuaron who is usually known for his memorable characters and gritty portrayal of human relationships has come up with such a marginal script (co scripted with son Jonas) and absolutely no gripping characters.<br/><br/>Sample this - Sandra Bullock's Dr Ryan Stone is the last person who deserves to be on any mission forget a critical space mission. Given that she is prone to panic attacks and her first reaction to any situation is negative, chaotic and that of hopelessness. At worst, Dr Stone is a nervous wreck and at best she is following orders without questioning. Old Jungle saying ‚Äì if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. What in the name of Prometheus is Dr Stone doing in space? Watching Dr Ryan Stone fumble her way through space made me instantly crave for Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) from ""Alien"".<br/><br/>George Clooney's mission commander Matt Kowalsky is well, George Clooney, throwing his one liners with panache and being the gorgeous, sexy , funny counterfoil to dim witted, slow and helpless Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>Background score from Steven Price makes sure that we all know in advance when a perilous event is just waiting to happen. Price overwhelms us with the music, instead of intelligently using the loneliness, the vacuum and the deafening silence of space at crucial moments in the movie.<br/><br/>With such one-dimensional characters and predictable linear storytelling, Director Alfonso Cuaron's salvation comes from fellow Mexican, old partner and Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki Morgenstern (The Tree of Life, Children of Men, Sleepy Hollow) who shows us in all its glory and fright what it must be to float in space. This is as real as any of us ordinary mortals can come to experiencing space first hand. Lubezki is the shining star of this space misadventure. And it is for his contribution mostly that I award ""Gravity"", 7 out of 10.

I rarely use the word masterpiece but, if this isn't one, it's damn close and as close to a perfect movie as I've seen in a long time. Gravity's story is simple, a crew of 5 astronauts in the space shuttle Explorer are working on additions to the Hubble Telescope. Mid-mission they receive news that the Russians have destroyed one of their own satellites with a missile test and debris has been sent rocketing close to their proximity¬Ö news which becomes a dire warning as the satellite debris has impacted other satellites and now a cloud of wreckage is heading right for them at an increasing velocity and they have moments to abort their mission and get out of harm's way. Despite their efforts to get out of danger, the debris hits them full on and only Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who is on his last mission, are left alive tethered together with with Kowalski's jet propulsion pack running out of power and Stone running out of air. Can they reach the International Space Station and before the cloud of debris orbits Earth and returns? And if they do, are they even safe there? Co-written (with Jon√°s Cuar√≥n) and directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Gravity is 90 minutes of one of the most emotionally gripping and suspenseful movie going experiences you're likely to have as he quickly establishes two very likable human beings who are put in one of the most frightening scenarios one can imagine. Cuar√≥n not only gives us two people to root and care for but, his masterful camera work and the flawless SPFX create a vast and frightening void that is as beautiful as it is intimidating. One false move and you can be lost in the vast empty coldness and with no air and no one coming to your rescue. Cuar√≥n uses a lot of POV and stunning camera shots to put us in space right there with our two stranded astronauts and we experience what they do and feel their fear every step of the way. Not to mention that the Children Of Men filmmaker gets two Oscar worthy performances out of Clooney and Bullock and these veteran actors create two very endearing three dimensional characters we embrace all the way and are right along with in experiencing every heartbreaking setback and grasping every glimmer of hope. The film is truly an emotional roller coaster ride that most movies promise but, few can actually deliver. By the time the credits rolled I felt I had been through everything the characters had and thanks to Cuar√≥n's skillful directing and wonderful script, I had. An exhilarating, harrowing and wonderfully suspenseful movie that is more then just a film, it's an experience. A must see movie!

Sandra Bullock was astonishing. Almost half the movie time she is on camera alone. Her eyes, her face, and even her breathing convey her emotions, fears, and what few hopes she might have had. Frequently we only saw her from within her helmet or from a reflection in a window. She sweeps the viewer along from one life threatening event to another. Her emotions were palpable. George Clooney who played Matt had the absolute confidence of a seasoned astronaut, who had seen it all. He was relaxed and cool, but always in command, the kind of person anyone would want along when trouble occurs. When Bullock's character was floating freely in away from the troubled space station, Matt's remained calm and cool. He knew exactly what had to be done. Eventually he calmed Bullock's character, thus saving her life, at least for a minute. But Gravity is Sandra Bullock's show. And she deserves what ever accolades that come her way. The film was beautiful, compelling, and frightening....In a sense the camera pulled the viewer into the movie. We become a participant even though our tether is our theater seat. Outer space was magnificent, awesome, and The movie 2001 was pedantic...deliberately so, dealing withe the metaphysical evolution of life. The director chose to hammer the viewer over his head with his philosophy. However, in Gravity, the director and the writer dabbled in symbolism but certainly not into the metaphysical.For example the last few minutes of the movie makes makes a beautiful statement about humankind. <br/><br/>There was little humor in the film 2001. However in Gravity, there were some great moments especially in the beginning where Matt is establishing his character. Also there is a dandy send up on a Bugs Bunny cartoon. And don't miss the ping-pong paddle floating freely in the Chinese Space Station. <br/><br/>If possible, see this film in 3D and IMAX. I got a stiff neck dodging space debris ranging from pens to hunks of machinery.... And I go back to Bwanna Devil and the The House of Wax, the very early 3 D hits."
"shepardzilla","10","6","12","6 October 2013"," One of the best science fiction films not just in years, but of all time
","Gravity <br/><br/>Directed By: Alfonso Cuaron Written By: Alfonso Cuaron and Jonas Cuaron Starring: Sandra Bullock, George Clooney<br/><br/>The beauty of it all- the Earth from space, is the opening shot of visionary director Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, which could describe the film in its own right. This film is the best of 2013 so far, and quite possibly one of the best science fiction films of all time. I have seen no other film like it, and don't think I ever will. The story follows Dr. Ryan Stone, a brilliant astronaut on her first voyage to space, played by Sandra Bullock in the best performance of her career. Dr. Stone and her colleague, veteran astronaut Lt. Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney with plenty of charm and lots of focus, are stranded in space when space debris comes in contact with their spacecraft. I won't reveal any other further elements of the plot, because it isn't worth ruining. This film is so absolutely well-written, that it is all unpredictable. It deserves to be a surprise. An average moviegoer would go in thinking that it's a stupid concept and asking his or herself how they could make a full film out of it. Well, Cuaron succeeded in creating one of the most intense, mesmerizing, and breathtaking 90 minutes in all of cinema history. Bullock is a tour de force as Stone, and plays her with such humanity and power that you are rooting for her throughout all of this king of underdog stories. Clooney is full of wit and control as Kowalski, truly perfect for his role. The cinematography, by Emmanuel Lubezki, is beyond gorgeous, working in long, continuous shots (the first shot is nearly 15 minutes long). Steven Price's score is one of the best in years, and should prove himself, with this film, as one of the next great talents in film music. The effects, mostly computer-generated, should win all the awards, because they look shockingly real compared to most films. The techniques invented for this film work astoundingly well for simulating near-perfect, if not perfect, zero gravity movement. This is also the single best use of 3D, ever, in a motion picture. It is worth all the extra money too see it in 3D and on the biggest screen possible (in most cases, IMAX). The scientific accuracy and attention to detail are phenomenal aspects of the realism. When the debris hits, there is no sound (which makes it all the more horrifying and isolated in feeling), and you can only hear from Stone's perspective and the score throughout the entire film. This is also one of the most completely terrifying films I've seen, scarier than most horror films, but it has one thing that horror films generally lack, a sense of hope. All of it is wrapped up in the final shot, the struggle and plight of Stone, the hope and will to survive that drove her, a final shot and film that deserves a standing ovation. Gravity is one of the single most incredible cinematic experiences to date, and every man, woman, and child should see it for that reason."

","It only took 45 years for someone to top Kubrick's 2001. And now it finally happened. Not only was it technically near perfect, but Gravity had a solid story and great acting from Bullock and Clooney to boot. I'm trying to picture another actress in Bullock's role, but I can't imagine anyone who could have done a better, more believable job of it. I've been a fan of SF films (although, this isn't really SF) for about 60 years now and started reading in the SF genre when I was about 10 years old. My two favorite films to date, until now, are 2001 and Bladerunner. Of late, the only one that even came close to them was Avatar (3rd best). You may be able to find some technical glitches in this film if you look real, real hard, but I bet they'll only be trivial. All I can say is: move over 2001 and Bladerunner; you just got some brand, new competition for my vote.<br/><br/>Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron - Nice piece of film work, indeed."
"starsandpopcorn","10","6","12","4 October 2013"," The New 2001: A Space Odessey?
","Few cinematic experiences are quite as immersive or as complete as Gravity, the tightly developed and much-hyped space drama by writer/director Alfonso Cuar√≥n ‚Äì and the director's first movie since 2006's highly acclaimed Children of Men.<br/><br/>With Gravity, Cuar√≥n gives audiences a vastly different experience than he has before, one so unique in its presentation that it's curious any studio would finance it (to the tune of $80 million) and give it a wide release. Warner Bros. took that chance, and early buzz indicates it might pay off.<br/><br/>And yet there's something familiar about Gravity, especially within the science fiction genre. Anyone who has enjoyed a small-cast science fiction film ‚Äì say, the Sam Rockwell vehicle Moon, or the horror classic Alien ‚Äì will similarly like Gravity, which epitomizes the sub-genre. It follows a medical engineer on her first mission to low-Earth orbit (Sandra Bullock) and a nearly retired veteran astronaut (George Clooney) as they struggle to survive floating untethered in space after a barrage of debris violently destroys their spacecraft. A title card in the film's opening frames sets the stakes: ""Life in space is impossible.""<br/><br/>Except for a few transmissions with mission control (voiced by Ed Harris) and some quick, jarring shots, Bullock and Clooney comprise the film's full cast. It's just the two of them in stark contrast with the infinite and hostile vastness of space, low on oxygen and fuel, struggling to make it to safety. Turns out there isn't a lot of that in space.<br/><br/>The film begins with a single extended shot that lasts ‚Äì so I've read; I didn't time it ‚Äì some 17 minutes. Cuar√≥n is a master at the extended shot (the one-take war shot near the end of Children of Men was one of the last decade's best scenes), and Gravity is full of them, but the beginning is striking. It starts quietly, serenely, with gorgeous shots of Earth and space, as Cuar√≥n plays with the lack of stable perspective inherent in zero-G, but once the action starts, it doesn't stop. There are plenty of nerve-wracking moments and a number of shocks and surprises, with some of the tensest moments saved for the final scenes. But to say much more would diminish the fun of this movie.<br/><br/>Gravity is a technical masterpiece on all fronts, an all-out sensory blitz with deft, cleverly utilized sound editing and production. (My favorite touch was at a moment when Bullock hits her head hard, followed by several stressful seconds of ringing.) And the attention to detail is mesmerizing, with Cuar√≥n making only a few minor physics missteps ‚Äì mostly necessary, even intentional, in order to advance the plot. Clocking in at just 90 minutes, the film doesn't spend a lot of time ruminating on philosophy, which is perhaps a missed opportunity. But it feels tight: Every scene, every frame, is necessary to tell the story, and every aspect of the film's production works in concert to create one of the most engrossing films audiences are likely to see.<br/><br/>But it's the film's astonishing visuals that make it so thoroughly captivating, thanks to some amazing special effects and the camera-work of frequent Cuar√≥n and Terrence Malick collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki. Astronauts who have caught early screenings have said that Gravity is the closest they have felt to being in orbit without leaving Earth. If you lean back and let yourself get lost in the cinematography, you'll feel the same. I've never felt so immersed in a film as I did watching Gravity. This is definitely a movie to catch in 3D.<br/><br/>It's still early in awards season, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Bullock, Clooney and Cuar√≥n were expanding their award shelves in anticipation. On many fronts, Gravity is probably the year's best movie to date, and if you don't pick too many nits about orbital physics, you will likely agree. Just get lost in the experience, and be sure to unclench your fists when the credits start rolling."

"TheMovieDiorama","10","4","7","2 October 2016"," Time to fully review my favourite film of all time.
","Space, the endless emptiness that holds many wonders and anomalies. It's been the setting for hundreds of movies through the years. In fact many masterpieces have been set in space:¬†Stanley Kubrick's ground breaking 2001: A Space Odyssey, Ridley Scott's terrifying Alien and Pixar's animated feature Wall-E. Then came 2013, a year that seemed to be full of standard summer blockbusters and a few indie films...just like any other year. But in the fall, critics went crazy. ""Nothing could ever beat Avatar, visually"" they all said, including myself...but i was wrong. The behemoth that took the cinema by storm came out...Gravity.¬†I remember being so excited going to the cinema to watch this, I went on release day with my family. After the film finished, I was on the edge of my seat...sweating with my eyes widened at what I just saw. From that moment, I¬†knew this was the greatest thing I ever watched.<br/><br/>For a film that consists of essentially 4 actors (3 of them on screen and 1 voice actor), I was completely engaged and convinced that I was with those characters. Sandra Bullock was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for her role but it was tough year and unfortunately did not win, but the nomination alone just shows how incredible she was. George Clooney was witty, comedic and re-assuring as the most experienced astronaut in the group. The chemistry between Bullock and Clooney was brilliant, given the circumstance of what happens during the film. This overall however is Bullock's film, she has the most screen time and has to convey the emotions of what she is going through by herself...and also inform the viewers what is happening etc. ¬† Alfonso Cuar√≥n, who also directed the underrated Children of Men, takes directing duties for Gravity and is absolutely outstanding. I mean the first shot of the film is all one take and goes on for 10 minutes. The man is a genius when it comes to controlling the camera, so many great one take shots which just shows the confidence he has in order to pull them off. He balances the dialogue with the thrills perfectly so that it never becomes boring. The fact he won the Oscar for best director just proves all of this. Emmanuel Lubezki is the cinematographer and also won the Oscar for best cinematography for this movie (deservedly so!). There is also one scene where the camera moves slowly towards bullock's character and then (still in the same shot) goes through her helmet to see her point-of-view...it's just genius.¬†Cuar√≥n also wrote the script with his brother, and managed to bring in emotion, courage and humour within the 91 minute runtime.<br/><br/>In space, you cannot hear anything. Gravity does something very clever in which we hear the sounds of space through the space suits, so if a character touches something that is shaking we as the viewers hear the reverb through the suit. It's this kind of sound editing that makes this an enthralling experience, especially when viewing with surround sound. Steven Price is the composer and also won the Oscar for original score. The soundtrack to this film is masterful, in fact one scene towards the end is so epic because of the composition behind it...really gets your heart racing. ¬† The star of the film however are the visual effects, never has space looked so good! The detail of Earth in the background and the sun shining in the distance is breathtaking. Even during scenes of intense explosions with pieces of metal flying around, it's just sublime to look at. The way they filmed this was to have Bullock and Clooney in an LED light box and then add the visual effects in after (all done by a British team of visual effect experts). This is one of the few films designed for 3D viewing and I can honestly say it is on par with Avatar for best 3D effects. The ultimate way to view this film is in 3D so if you get the chance, don't blink twice...just watch it! ¬† What else is there to say? Gravity is my favourite film of all time, everyone who knows me knows that I adore this film, I physically cannot find a flaw. It's a masterpiece. Unfortunately it's a film that a lot of people like to hate and sure everyone has their opinions, but hating a film just because it's highly rated is not an excuse. So if you haven't seen Gravity, go out to the shop, but the 3D Blu-ray, but a massive TV with surround sound and enjoy it. No thanks necessary, you are all very welcome!<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

","Many others have pointed out what a stinker this film is, but no amount of criticism is truly enough. So I'm adding my own.<br/><br/>Gravity fails in two ways.<br/><br/>1. Physics. Yes, physics. If you base a film in space, and pretend to be realistic, you do need to have a grasp of high-school physics. And when major, MAJOR plot points depend on a total violation of physics, what you've got is an epic failure of a movie. I liked the realistic silence, but when George Clooney 'falls' away from Sandra Bulluck, despite there being nothing whatsoever to pull him away, I stopped caring about further events in this film.<br/><br/>2. Story. There is none. Well, very little - but what there is makes almost no sense. Sandra Bullock is in a disaster, and she miraculously escapes. She's a trained astronaut who has all these weird emotional problems? She fantasizes about Clooney's ghost? She manages to figure out a control panel labeled in Chinese? Oh, please, spare me.<br/><br/>I've seen space adventure done better in B-movies of the 1950s. Above all, this film is mis-titled. It takes place in free fall, therefore 'gravity' plays no role in it! A better title would have been 'Action and Reaction.' But the writers clearly didn't understand such a deep concept. So they went with Gravity because it seemed catchy. Ugh.<br/><br/>If you want to see how this kind of space-survival story SHOULD be handled, read Andy Weir's brilliant The Martian. Let's hope Ridley Scott doesn't spoil that, in his upcoming screen adaptation. But it would be very difficult to dumb it down worse than Gravity."
"bmaskew","1","4","7","2 April 2015"," Google Earth is better...
","So you would like to watch the earth from the space? Sure? I'd say, you'd rather spend some time in Google Earth rather than floating here around with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Like too often, don't be fooled by the actor's reputation... In this film, they must have been bored as well.... There is almost no action, and if, then you can already guess what happens next. You could think, that the only reason of this film was to show the latest technology for space filming. This very film is not only unrealistic, it's also boring, impossible and a pure time loss. Fortunately, I could borrow the film from someone else and didn't pay anything for it. You are warned."

","My first attempt at watching this movie ended in failure, I didn't even reach halfway through before hitting the eject disc button. Several months later I decided to strap myself into the settee just to see if my previous assessment had been a bit harsh. Alas not one bit - I have to declare this is possibly on of the worst Space/Sci Fi movies ever made, I find it incredulous it has received such a high rating and Acadamy awards. <br/><br/>The Plot - just complete nonsense,from the start the audience are immersed with the two main characters scientist Dr.Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) & Astronaut Matt Kowolski (George Clooney).For some reason together with other crew they are on a space shuttle orbiting above the earth - mission never explained. Stone & Bullock are on a space walk with the latter just jetting around doing nothing apart from constantly joking as he talks with Stone.The chatter between the two is nonsensical - particularly as any mission of this type would be a a most serious professional affair. <br/><br/>Out of nowhere we have an explosion somewhere in space with debris heading their way - no urgency or suspense when suddenly the debris is upon them - total destruction ensues,the rest of the shuttle crew are killed but somehow Stone & Kowolski still outside the shuttle in their space suits remain unscathed.Totally ridiculous as any catastrophic event such as this would have ended in certain death for both. Stone's screaming and constant 'no no no no'ing ' just added to the unrealistic scenario - she is supposed to be a highly trained professional.<br/><br/>Kowolski then spots an unmanned Russian space station which they head for - just incredibly annoying is the pathetic joking banter from Kowolski to Stone - looking down at the earth his attention focused on how beautiful it is from such a precarious situation they are in !! <br/><br/>Managing to reach the Russian station Kowolski then cuts loose the umbilical cord he is connected to Stone with. Good riddance I though as he drifts off into the stratosphere somewhere - his silly joking attitude never to be heard of again. <br/><br/>Stone manages to open the exterior hatch and climbs inside the Russian ship and then devolves into some type of mind flip which has her chattering on about nonsense - absolutely nothing to do with piloting the ship with the scientific knowledge she is supposed to have. At one point she imagines Kowolski banging on the outer door of the ship then sitting back down beside her taking control - thank goodness this was just her imagination !!<br/><br/>So yet another disaster occurs with the Russian ship catching fire and disintegrating - by yet another miracle Stone escapes via an escape pod once again without a scratch. From here yet more nonsense when she spots an unmanned Chinese ship.Heading for this one she Jetisons from the pod with nothing but her suit and a Fire extinguisher as propulsion to reach the Chinese ship. I really have had enough by this time hoping that some monstrous Alien will swing by and gobble the whole thing up - the End!<br/><br/>But no - more incredulous happening as the Chines ship starts to break up on re-entry to Earth,astonishingly Stone escapes in the landing pod landing in a sea\lake somewhere - which signifies the end as she swims to shore to walk off into the distance¬Ö.<br/><br/>Absolutely shocking movie."

The very idea that one could randomly push buttons to eject a Chinese landing module and arrive safely on earth was just silly.

"llaurenthellama","8","4","7","6 August 2014"," Gravity should be treated as a cinematic parable, not sci fi
","Upon my first viewing of Gravity I found it entertaining and a bit on the slow side. It was very suspenseful, and I found myself ignoring whether the science was right or not and surrendered to simply enjoying it as a science fiction movie. <br/><br/>However, as I watched it a second time, by myself on a quiet night, I found so many deeper meanings to each scene. It was to the point where I was seeing the entire plot of this supposed space mission as an allegory to the healing the main character Ryan needed to process before moving on with her life after her daughter's death.<br/><br/>Every scenario has an explanation in regards to her freaking with and over coming this grief. In the beginning, Ryan stated that she enjoys the silence of space. She had no one back home, she doesn't really seem to have much excitement about being in space. She's anxious and seems to only have a vague understanding of what she should do. George Clooney's character we could see as her conscious, walking her through the process to being while again.<br/><br/>We only learn about the loss of her daughter after the unavoidable accident during their space walk. This symbolizes Ryan's loss of her daughter, and Clooney's character even says they couldn't have avoided the loss of their crew.<br/><br/>Ryan is forced to go through her journey through space alone because this is the only way she will be able to go on living, if she forces herself to survive.<br/><br/>Every scene, the seemingly horrible luck she has with the fire on ISS and nearly giving up hope and killing herself on the Chinese station is part of her fight to survive inside herself. When she has chosen to survive and live on, she tells Clooney's character to give her daughter a kiss from mommy.<br/><br/>The story is about the strength it takes an individual ( man or woman, as Clooney even started ""ryan is a terrible name for a girl"") to overcome the seemingly impossible. This is not literally a science fiction movie about a space walk gone horribly wrong, it is a story of survival simply for the sake of surviving, even after countless things attempt to spin you out of control, suffocate you, hurt you and drain all hope. Gravity is not titled after one of Newton's laws, it is the force which pulls us back together when we feel like falling apart."

This is not just a movie, this is an experience the universe at first hand (I guess we can not closer) and recommendations for every lover of this uncharted expanse (that includes yours truly). The film was made for 3D and it should be taken care of, be sure to look for better 3D experience, but generally run from movies where you should wear accessories (glasses). Bad things in the film are the main actors, Bullock and Clooney are not among my prefer the actors, to put it mildly. However Actress managed and it holds the entire movie.

","I can't understand why so many people rate this movie so low. This is a precious film. I don't care if it's not accurate in terms of facts in physics or spacecraft knowledge. But while I was watching it, I felt like I was being put into the space and experience how it feels and how difficulty life can be for human when we are without ""gravity,"" how the earth is beautiful and created just perfectly to be our home. I don't think the point of the movie is to make a perfect scientific film. It has a much deeper meaning about human being and our place in the universe. It also has a theme about not giving up, stop dwelling in the despair and give life everything you have although you don't know if you will make it to the destination. Not matter how it turns out, life ""is one hell of a ride!"" It is a film with a spiritual message, particularly that scene that makes the main character get back her courage and her will to live. (Some people think that the scene is ridiculous but to me it's so beautiful and carries a very good meaning. I love it.) And I also love the way they put the belief about afterlife into it, not much but just enough to make this film precious and worth more than the whole crap of non-sense scientific film from Hollywood today. Watching this film...I gain back my courage and the will to live, and I'll try to be thankful for every moment of life, and for the earth that we are living in.<br/><br/>Besides, I think it is smart that the film uses only a very small cast and put most effort into special effect, creating a fascinating picture of what is like to be out in the space and be without gravity, making it look so real. The storyline is good. I enjoy the thrill ride from the beginning to the end. It was a very entertaining film to me as well. I give it a score of ten just to balance out those who give it one."

","A Russian satellite has incurred a missile strike. Who fired the missile? Why? We learn that debris is heading in their direction from satellite destruction, which has started a chain reaction. It's revealed that some Russian morons shot down their own satellite for no reason other than their right of disposal because it was a spy sat that went bad. What do you mean went bad? Somehow they weren't aware of creating a chain reaction of debris or didn't bother to check if there were astronauts operating in the area? Why didn't they go fix it instead of wasting money by destroying it? This contrived setup isn't believable. The debris slams into the satellite and Ryan breaks off. The issue with their interaction is the stark disparity in how they view the situation. On one hand, Ryan is in state of complete shock, but has difficulty executing basic commands like flashing a light and telling Matt what her display readings are. But Matt doesn't appear to be fazed as he resorts to joking about how handsome he is. They're polar opposites. Ryan is completely helpless to the point where she may as well not be an astronaut, while Matt doesn't seem to show any concern: each character is operating on the extreme side of the spectrum.<br/><br/>So the two are on their way to the space station while Matt proceeds to ask Ryan questions about herself even though she only has 2% of her oxygen left. It's not logical. Why didn't he ask these questions sometime during the past week? This is the only time we get any character development in the film. The most important thing we learn about Ryan is that her daughter died from hitting her head at school, and since Ryan was driving in a car when she heard about it, she's been driving ever since.<br/><br/>Ryan and Matt reach the station and try to grab hold of anything while Ryan yells, ""what do I do?"" like she has no experience instead of doing what Matt instructed her to. Ryan has her foot caught on a thin rope that isn't able to sustain both of them, so Matt sacrifices himself for Ryan. This is probably the best moment of the film in terms of execution, as the dramatic music elevates the intensity of the moment. It's just a shame that I never cared about Clooney's character, and had he been developed more, this scene really could've been emotionally impactful.<br/><br/>Matt's still able to talk to her, and it's revealed that Ryan crashed the flight simulator each time during her training at NASA. Why would they allow her to partake in this mission if she's that incompetent? How was she allowed to pass if she failed a flight test numerous times?<br/><br/>Ryan enters the station and there's the deep ""rebirth"" metaphor as she goes into a fetal position while some ropes behind her symbolize umbilical cords. The idea of ""rebirth"" suggests that the character undergoes an immense change and I didn't see that here. We learn about Ryan's daughter dying but the subject is never explored, and her character didn't change to me. She doesn't become more capable or experienced in terms of finding a way of getting back to Earth, and she certainly doesn't seem to encompass a new life perspective. If the narrative had delved into more depth about how much her daughter's death affected her and then displayed her differently, this could've really worked well. I feel as though the daughter shouldn't have died or that it should've been reworked somehow, because then Ryan would have a real reason to return to Earth besides just her basic survival instincts. Ultimately, the entire metaphor fell flat and was unconvincing to me. <br/><br/>Ryan tells everything she's doing to the audience rather than showing it, hence it breaks the traditional principle of showing rather than telling. In the film All is Lost, the protagonist says nothing and the writer trusts the audience to figure it out. The approach used here is lazier by comparison. <br/><br/>The dumbest part of the film then unfolds. George Clooney enters the lifeboat. His light-hearted charm diminishes the emotion that the previous scene had built up as he slugs some Vodka. He says some motivational sentences to Ryan that can be summarized by saying, ""get back to Earth,"" which is what Ryan's been trying to do all along. He doesn't provide any new insight. It turns out that the whole scene was a hallucination/dream sequence. So, not only does this scene not add anything the story, and not only does it act against the mood of the previous scene, but also undermines his dramatic send-off by bringing him back in ghost form for no useful purpose. But hell, given all the nonsense that's already happened, it wouldn't have surprised me at all if he actually had survived somehow and made it into this lifeboat. Ryan talks about her daughter for a little while to dead George Clooney in her mind, and this is emotional, but doesn't build up as much as it should due to the previous scene. I think it would've worked better if that scene had been cut entirely.<br/><br/>Ryan enters another abandoned space station and goes into another shuttle, where she presses buttons at random because she's incapable of properly operating it. Her guesswork must've paid off as the shuttle descends quickly into Earth's atmosphere and finally plunges into a lake in what appears to be the middle of some random jungle in South America. Luckily for Ryan, this spacecraft is somehow able to establish contact with Houston and they inform her that they're issuing a rescue mission for her.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that the film is immensely overrated and logically incoherent in many respects."

","So you've sat down in the dark theater or maybe in the comfort of your own home. The movie quickly brings you into the world of space where no sound can be heard. As the movie goes on you realize that the lack of sound is actually the reason you are drawn in more and attached to what little sounds you do hear. The characters are brought to life with organic sounds heard through their suits. The heartbeats and breaths they take make you hang by the edge of your seat. Will they take their last breath or will they have just enough oxygen to take one more breath and make it to the destination. The use of sound in this film is what really drew me to want to watch this film. Ultimately I would recommend it to anyone. The story line is strong, and the character development has a good pace. They don't give it to you all at once but in gradual stages. If you haven't seen this movie, go out and by it right now! You won't be disappointed."
"tikhei-dennis","10","4","7","13 March 2014"," Gravity: What's the point of living?
","It is tremendously difficult to achieve cinematic brilliance, as it is challenging to make the right balance between various elements in a film. However, under the incredible vision of and script by Cuaron, and the breathtaking performances of Bullock and Clooney, cinematic brilliance is achieved. <br/><br/>Medical engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and a group of astronauts are involved in a space mission. After the collision between high-speed debris and their space shuttle, Stone and Kowalski are the survivors. Determined to stay alive and return home, the two of them drift in the dark and dangerous space to other space stations. Unfortunately, facing obstacles, Stone turns out to be the sole survivor of the accident. Facing loneliness, lost of Matt and haunted past experience, Stone keeps on encountering more challenges and life-threatening situations. With her own determination and self- encouragement, she returns to Earth safely, and goes back to Earth as a changed person.<br/><br/>How did Ryan survive? She did not survive because of her knowledge in driving the space shuttle. She also did not survive because of anyone, who would look up to the sky on Earth and remember her. Although Matt accompanied her, it was only half of the journey. What is the motivation for Ryan to survive all that? Why didn't Ryan just continue to drift in space and allow the oxygen in the shuttle to run out? What was the point of surviving?<br/><br/>Perhaps it was a decision in Ryan's mind. She opted for a different attitude and view things from a different perspective. Despite almost losing everything she valued and facing solitude, she decided to stay alive, because her life still has value. Also, because she understands that she might have a chance to live if she tries, but she will certainly die if she does not try. She lives because she believe that no matter the consequences, dead or alive, ""it will be one hell of a ride"".<br/><br/>So, how did all this end? Some say that the ending is rather weak as the events after Ryan landed are not specified and mentioned. However, the main point is that Ryan survived and she changed after what she experienced. She stands up, finally, whispered ""thank you"" and walks toward her new life.<br/><br/>The story and the message was quite simple, and it is even quite old- fashioned. The story would not be moving at all if it was put into other situations. Thanks to Alfonso and his son, who came up with the screenplay, they presented the message in a real way, without anything contrived. Also, the authentic and heartbreaking performance given by Sandra Bullock, the nerve-wracking atmosphere, along with the amazing special effect and epic cinematography helped build up the change in psychology of Ryan Stone and make the storyline believable.<br/><br/>This film is not merely a visual experience, or a 90-minute of epic and tense scenes. Through the film, we experience the journey and change with Ryan Stone, and finally the film makes us believe that there IS a point of living, and we can always stand up and confront challenges in our lives."
"cutegirlbutts","9","4","7","6 March 2014"," A new cinema experience
","Alfonso Curon's film is just pure evidence for why we still need and should be going to the cinema. It demands to be seen on the biggest 3D IMAX screen you can be find, boasting an excellent sound system. I wish I avoided the trailers (which were essentially extended scenes) and went into this one blind. The spectacle of this film is wondrous and you find yourself deeply absorbed in the blackness of not only your massive multiplex but in the space the 3D screen provides a window towards. The film offers you some of the most incredible imagery you've ever seen upon the screen, intense survival action and great character work (Bullock's performance outside of a genre film would be heralded even more than it already is). If you didn't see this at IMAX when it came out or the biggest 3D screen you could get to I pity you, but then again you were probably told enough to do so. I won't be watching this again for a very long time, because without the beautiful technology to back it up you're not doing this masterpiece justice. I've never seen anything like this in my life"
"JanicePf77","9","4","7","4 March 2014"," Amazing feeling of Being There
","As a space enthusiast, no other movie before has given me the feeling of being along for a space trip as Gravity. It eclipses, by far, my previous favorite of Apollo 13 (which is also a great movie).<br/><br/>Much has been written about Gravity so I won't rehash any of its (admittedly threadbare) plot details. I won't even talk about its fantastic technical merits.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is the closest any of us will get to actually being up in space. Isn't that alone worth the price of a movie ticket? I thought so.<br/><br/>For once I didn't care all that much about a deep story or deep characterizations. This is a 'day-in-the-life' disaster-experience movie and doesn't pretend to be anything more than that."
"jacobclark512","8","4","7","4 March 2014"," Technical Dazzle Matched by Real Film-making
","Gravity is the most technically astounding and visually stimulating film I have ever seen. The immersive cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki lays the building blocks for fantastic visual achievement. It is built upon by amazing editing that makes the film seem seamless, with multiple- minute shots quite common. The awe-inspiring visual effects are laid on top, creating an incredibly accurate picture of space. The sound editing also accounts for the fact that no sound can be heard in space, as we only hear what the astronauts themselves can hear. This allows the film's score to take center stage, and it does just that. The score creates another immersive facet of this film due to its eerie tone and sudden stops. The production design is also top-notch, accurately portraying all of the spacecraft the astronauts utilize. <br/><br/>Now, all of this would be for naught if the story and acting were lackluster in any way. Thankfully, they both excel. The story has a very deliberate pace that excels at balancing character development and suspenseful action sequences. Because the movie is short, it never truly drops its pace, allowing it to pack quite a punch. The acting is truly impeccable. Sandra Bullock gives arguably the best performance of her career, while Clooney supports her nicely as Bullock's foil. Clooney, playing the more experienced astronaut, remains calm during the crises on screen; Bullock panics quite often and is always tense, being the rookie. Subtleties like these manifest themselves quite well on screen and fill in several unspoken pieces of character background. In conclusion, Gravity's technical dazzle is completely matched by its highly competent story and acting, creating a groundbreaking masterpiece."
"weavelblade","10","4","7","2 March 2014"," Edge of your seat ride!
","This is the first time that I have felt sufficiently impressed in recent times to put my hands on a keyboard and actually express my opinion about a film.<br/><br/>Gravity is a mind blowing extravaganza of 'edge of your seat suspense' and the perfect example of what pure movie magic is about. From its stunning cinematography, superb acting (with a limited cast), faultless production, and exceptional use of 3D CGI, Gravity is a terrifyingly accurate portrayal of lifelessness in space and the sheer struggle of life over death in the most hopeless of situations. Gravity whilst sharing it's disaster theme with many other movies is something new that goes deeper, particularly in the scenes where Ryan talks about her daughter, at least thats how I saw it. A huge technical achievement and a film that will stand the test of time. Bullock deserves her 15% cut of the movie grossing's for this performance! <br/><br/>10/10."

","Many other fine people have used many words to say why they loved this film, and I pretty much agree with all of these reviewers, so rather than recover old ground, let me just say a few words about why I disagree completely with so many of the very low reviews this movie received, and leave it at that.<br/><br/>I think i can best sum up my feelings towards these negative reviewers, all of whom I can count on for getting almost every film that i like completely wrong, (and who are all males,) by relating a question one such person asked, at the beginning of his review, ""What am I missing here?"" The movie, is my least stinging response to that question :) - Also one of the main complaints about the Physics of this film, IE why would the safety line between the two main characters be tight, is easy enough to answer... it has to do with viewpoint... IE, if the camera is moving in the same way that the objects around it are rotating, nothing appears to be moving... or as Einstein said, all objects are relative to all other objects.<br/><br/><ul><li>I would also like to note that the members of the Academy are really a bunch of tight-assed little wimps... such that when they can see that a particular movie is going to win a bunch of Oscars they will yank the Oscar for the leading lady in the film... This never seems to happen to leading men. A good example of the same exact thing happened to ""The Piano"", the last film that I really agreed with the academy on their choice of best film-director etc., except here again they yanked the obvious choice for best leading female role solely so as not to appear too partial to one particular film!</li></ul><br/><br/>Stupid choice then, stupid choice now!"
"narcissus05","9","4","7","18 January 2014"," A masterpiece on its own
","A simple, almost minimalistic storyline, is just an excuse for a reflexion about the hostility of space, and for one of the most scientifically accurate movies about space since 2001.<br/><br/>There is a remarkable and well thought management of camera planes, which constantly gives the viewer an almost uncomfortable sensation of buoyancy and dizziness, sometimes even nauseating. I do not think there is another movie that so powerfully generates in the viewer a sensation so close to a weightless trip on an EVA, i must admit that sometimes i felt space-sick, or what i believe could be accounted as such.<br/><br/>Not every movie around has to be a brain dazzling exercise of metaphors. Gravity is much less pretentious, absolutely linear, hardly more than just descriptive. But it is so visually outstanding, the story although simple is so well told, the movie just flows naturally.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is perfectly fitted for the role, she delivers what she is supposed to, and maybe even more than you would expect.<br/><br/>So, if you like space movies, but you want them to keep at least a minimum grade of scientific honesty, while being an incredibly well developed piece of entertainment, go and see it."

And there's Gravity, a movie truly live up to the title of Art.

The shock, the fear, the despair, the hopelessness, the courage, the craziness and at last the happiness. That was what happened in the movie. I think i developed spacephobia just from this movie. <br/><br/>Never noticed Sandra as an actress, but in this movie, to move on Earth like she's moving in space was stunning.

Personally, I tend to steer clear of 3D movies, feeling them a bit of a gimmick, but seeing this in the cinema was like looking through a window back at the Earth. In general, it's a life-affirming film against a stunning backdrop - and don't be put off by reviewers who will try and patronise with a 'couldn't happen' attitude - true, the complete storyline is, at best, un-plausible and at worst outrageously exaggerated but it's 91 minutes well spent. The experience - heightened by the soundtrack - is something quite special. See it before it leaves the cinema. (I went back to see it a second time, something I never do.)"
"siderite","9","4","7","29 December 2013"," Beautifully done. I loved that it was very technical.
","Normally I would have given this an above average mark, but not too large. The thing that made me grade it with a 9 is the decision to stick to technical details even if, as my wife proved it, some viewers might be put off by them. So, if you imagine that a movie with Clooney and Bullock must be a romance, don't go watching this film.<br/><br/>The film is almost like a screen play with a lot of special effects. Practically there are only two actors, Sandra Bullock being the lead and George Clooney a supporting actor, with a few other actors voicing mission control and so on. The film is only superficially an action movie with the characters fighting for survival, with the real story the interactions of people with outer space and the feeling of isolation one gets over there. In order to fully understand the physics and orbital mechanics, I would direct you to (a lot of) space blog posts from specialists discussing and praising the accuracy of most of the concepts in the film.<br/><br/>As for my subjective point of view, I liked the movie, but mostly because I am a space buff. Some of the scenes - like the one when Clooney untethers - were pointless, while others over the top with special effects and way too loud music. The soul of the movie, though, stands up to scrutiny and I am really glad Cuaron made the effort to bring his vision to the big screen.<br/><br/>A lot of people recommended watching the film on the big screen in 3D. I did not have the opportunity, so I saw it low res on my computer. It's just as awesome. Perhaps for less technical people or uninterested in space, it would not be so pleasing. My wife did not enjoy it. For me, most of the concepts in the film were already known, but it was damn nice seeing them on the screen like that."

"mandyleigh1010","8","4","7","17 November 2013"," Good film, beautiful, with many layers
","There is definitely depth of story, I found it a many layered film. What I mean by layered is ‚Äì the overlap of the visual, the action, the technical, the characters, the story - that the real depth of the film line only occurs to one later (in my case the next morning as my usual wine and discussion didn't happen on this occasion). The underlying (slower) layer as I see it is that Dr. Ryan 'chooses life' after a period of depression due to the loss of her child. The silence of space being the time a foetus spends in the womb in preparation for life; the ensuing struggle for survival being the contractions and the baby's journey through the birth channel; her nearly drowning and emergence out of the lake being the newborn baby emptying his lungs of birth fluid in order to take his first breath of air .. it's a story about rebirth. If you reflect back to the images of Dr. Ryan in the space pod they also remind one of images of unborn foetuses in the womb, even down to the umbilical cord. Aside from the birth metaphor, there's also a possible spiritual layer in the visit from Matt - you can see it as a hallucination induced by lack of O2 or as a spiritual kick-start ‚Äì as Matt had as much O2 as she did - which is the catalyst for her choosing life and re-joining the 'birth struggle'. So, in a nutshell: on the beautiful backdrop of 3D space, a life and death struggle, often from inside the helmet (you'll need a hot bath afterwards to soothe your stressed neck) that is so intense that the deeper meaning may filter through only when you're on the wine in your bath. The music I found intense and heartstabbing, bringing the visual and dramatic layers right in."

I don't think he went with any expectations either, and a few minutes into the movie our jaws dropped and remained like that for most of the remaining of the movie. <br/><br/>Gravity is an incredible cinematic experience and deserves the good marks that it is receiving. I would avoid the opinion of those miserable pedantic internet wise little people talking about script/plot etc. Seriously. It doesn't try to wow you with epic phrases or a plot involving anything other than potentially real situations in space and strong and specific characters, it does wow you by traveling with you in the skin of the main character, making you feel what she feels. It also wows you with stunning, realistic and memorable scenes, and some symbolism to take its meaning a bit further. <br/><br/>I absolutely recommend it.

It is a prime example of how it can be used successfully and effectively, it really pulls you into the film as if it is you exploring life in space, looking down on a beautiful Earth.<br/><br/>But onto the review...<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock, a somewhat acquired taste at times I find, completely owns this film. It really is the performance of a lifetime, a sure fire contender come Awards season. She manages to reach that standard that many struggle with; She doesn't play the character, she IS the character.<br/><br/>Visually, Gravity is second to none. The camera work is incredible, most shots continue for 5 or more minutes and the way it zooms into a character and then turns so you see what they see is so smooth and clever that you are plunged into the film and only realise that you weren't experiencing the events yourself until the credits roll.<br/><br/>The story is gripping and tense, your heart will pound and you will find yourself willing on Bullock as she struggles to survive the harsh environment and the difficult surroundings. Alfonso Cuaron (Director) convinces you that the film really was filmed in space. Soundless crashes and little use of the film's score add to the tense and spooky story and setting, they also show perfectly the film's scientific accuracy.<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen, Gravity delivers the knockout punch of the Awards season.<br/><br/>A winner for sure."

In Gravity, she delivers a master class in physical acting and a truly moving and emotional performance. It is much to the credit of Cuaron and Heyman that they had the courage to cast a female in a leading role in a movie of this nature. A first, I think.<br/><br/>The suspense level is high throughout, there is no gratuitous action scene, whatever happens, happens for a very good reason and not to deploy awesome special effects or to add the often inevitable Hollywood touch. The characters, as portrayed by Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney, are utterly believable, and because of that, the viewer cannot help being emotionally involved in what happens on the screen from the very first scene.

If you haven't seen it yet, you better hurry on down to your local theatre at once - because this is an experience that is intended for the big screen. I was very lucky - only 2 other people in the theatre with me (I viewed it at non-peak times), and this just added to the integrity of the film. The second the first frame comes into focus you really have to appreciate the aspiring atmosphere and view of Earth from space. <br/><br/>The movie is fairly short with a run time of just 90 mins. However, I felt that if the run time had been extended, there would have been too much dialogue and unnecessary sequences, which would distract from the overall experience. I really can't admire Sandra Bullock enough for her outstanding performance in this role, and I fell she performs even better, and incorporates more emotion into her performance than in her Oscar winning film 'The blind side'. <br/><br/>The visuals are something that needs to be seen in 3D. The depth is incredible. Alfonso Cuaron does not attempt to use any cheesy 'pop out' 3D spectacles, but instead uses subtle elements to really place the viewer in the moment. Such might include a small crew floating past the screen or a water droplet. If you thought 'Apollo 13' looked amazing, just you wait. <br/><br/>Clooney is also good for his role..<br/><br/>But what's important here is the film was pulled off to a exquisite extent and incorporates loss, hope and the beauty of life all in one short package. I will be buying this in 3D bluray upon release, but as I have previously mentioned, you must see it on the big screen to fully appreciate it for what it is.<br/><br/>...I'd like to see Star Wars VII top this, visually..."

","It was Amazing! Realistic Pictures, amazing actors, and good set! Just plain awesome!The Graphics were well made. The 3-D effects made it really realistic and horrifying, looking like the objects were going to fly on you. The dream caught my by surprise, Thinking that he was actually alive but he wasn't. Wouldn't want to go up to space after watching this movie, just imaging the troubles. This movie is a 10/10 no exceptions what so ever. Would love to see more from this director! The movie experience was just amazing. Would love to see another space movie or even a Gravity Two, To see if the guy actually died, or if it was a lie to her and he still had gas inside that engine. That would be a really cool freaky twist, with the objects still flying around in space. So amazed by the production, well done cast, and production team!"
"matthewssilverhammer","9","4","7","2 November 2013"," A breathtaking thrill ride that will renew your love of going to the movies.
","This year, there's yet to be a wide-released popcorn movie that succeeds in both complete originality and sheer mass enjoyment (excluding maybe ""This is the End""). With ""Gravity"", Cuaron has given movie-goers a reason to get excited, creating possibly the best space movie since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""Gravity"" is a breathtaking sci-fi thrill ride that will renew even the most cynical critic's faith in going to the movies. It follows two astronauts struggling to survive a disaster that occurs while working on the international space station. Outside of that, it's difficult to discuss the plot without spoiling the many turns the film takes. What can be revealed is that this is genuinely brilliant and brave filmmaking. In lesser hands, the awe-inspiring spectacle of the long uncut takes and the groundbreaking CGI would be an excuse to slack in other areas. Fortunately, Cuaron pulls zero punches with the butt-clenching tension and still manages to create a supremely personal film through the guise of an epic dilemma, with help from a particularly heart-wrenching performance from Bullock. There are some clich√©s I would like to apply here that, while overused, are totally applicable. ""Gravity"" is like riding a ride. ""Gravity"" is like no experience I've had at the movies. ""Gravity"" reminds us of why we go to the movies. Hackneyed as these statements may be, they are apt in describing ""Gravity"", the best film of the year¬Ö.so far."
"Kcpjhp","10","4","7","28 October 2013"," of the rare variety that will actually inspire people to get into making films...
","The story is pretty straight forward and easy to encapsulate. A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.<br/><br/>With the aid of a video reference book, I once estimated that I have watched about 4,500 movies in my lifetime. I especially enjoy movies that entertain through fantastic settings or story-lines.<br/><br/>You've probably heard and/or read a fair amount about this movie. It did very well at the Cannes Film Festival. It's IMDb rating is very high (8.6 average after 100K votes) and it has been #1 at the box office its first 3 weeks of its release. As is fitting with a movie about space, (a.k.a the final frontier), I have ventured into a new frontier myself with this film. I dropped $ 13 for a single ticket and watched the IMAX 3D print.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with extremely high expectations.<br/><br/>They were all surpassed. <br/><br/>GRAVITY is, to be honest and objective, one of the greatest motion pictures I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I predict it will continue to make piles of money. I further predict it will be nominated and could very well win the Academy Award for best picture of the year.<br/><br/>Where it works : (get comfy, this will take a little while) Photography - It's being said that this film sets a new and very high benchmark for cinematography. That is an understatement. Not only do the effects and use of mirror or ""stereo"" cameras give you the sense you are in space, at times you seamlessly move from being next to characters, to inside their spacesuits. It is shot in such a way that you get the sense, through point of view and lighting effects, that you are weightless. Music - Steven Price's score is a character in and of itself. Exciting, rich, somber, emotional, triumphant. Visual Effects - I view 3D, even with its impressive modern enhancements, as a gimmick to bump ticket prices. While this film didn't make me change my mind about that, I will say this....I paid $ 13 for a single ticket...and I got my money's worth. The effects in the film are nothing short of jaw-dropping. The 3D was utilized very well and IMAX allows you to be swallowed up by the stars and the action. Tension/suspense - Take just about every disaster movie, space movie, chase movie, and action movie....think of your top 5 to 10.......do you have them in your head ? This film is going to make you reshuffle that list. I was gripping my armrest, eyes wide, through 90 % of this film. The oft used phrase ""Edge of your seat"" was originally penned for experiences like this one. Acting - Bullock and Clooney are consummate professionals. No shock they are going to do well. Sandra Bullock owns this movie. Could very well see another Academy Award on her shelf by this time next year. Story/plot - What would appear to be a movie about survival, is more about dealing with unforeseen and/or undeserved consequences, and moving on (in the face of INCREDIBLE adversity). -CLICHE ALERT- This is a film that leaves you feeling lucky and glad to be alive.<br/><br/>Where it doesn't work as well: ((((crickets)))) If I have to pick something, some people might find it too strenuous or come away with the thought, ""really, are they really going to have to deal with all of that ?"" But, the sheer beauty, impact, and power of the film makes that criticism seem petty.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't recommend it strongly enough. GO SEE IT. If you can afford it, SPEND THE EXTRA $$ ON 3D and/or IMAX.<br/><br/>This film is of the rare variety that it will actually inspire people to get into making films, acting, directing, or photography. <br/><br/>I went with a friend of mine who ""loved it"".<br/><br/>My personal rating: 10 out of 10 (Masterpiece)"
"valadas","7","4","7","26 October 2013"," Dreadful and wonderful
","Through a succession of terrific adventures and incidents after an accident in outer space we follow two astronauts, a man and a woman fighting against adverse conditions resulting of the total absence of gravity in which they move most of the time in open space, floating and sometimes drifting helpless at random The appalling visual scenes are filmed with great mastery and the performers do a great job with special mention of Sandra Bullock. The visual effects are of excellent technical quality. This movie has practically no story or plot since its main theme is made of the astonishing rhythm of dreadful and wonderful scenes that make the viewer to hold his breath most of the time. This is the more important aspect of the movie and makes it worth to be seen. Of course we must take for granted the unlikelihood of a few scenes like it is usual in this kind of movies"
"paavanpshukla","10","4","7","14 October 2013"," Nearest space experience 99.998% of us will experience!
","This film transports you to space in every cinematic way possible. The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space. The opening shot is 13 min long¬Öand not once you think that they are doing it too long. There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso Cuar√≥n's space thriller ""Gravity"" possesses and manages to sustain through out the run time! The whole movie is shot in just one room plus some world-class CGI. Which is breathtakingly amazing! The detail to ISS,HST and the earth view is top notch. But Its not just the graphics that keep the movie together. Its Sandy bullock's performance too! Though George Clooney's role is kinda short but still I enjoyed every minute of it. Bullock takes this science fiction thriller and turns it into a very human story. A conflict between the fight to survive and the fight to go on living. Throughout the film it is clear that Stone is distant, almost detached from the other characters. She seems almost indifferent at times to the horror that surrounds her. It becomes clear that she had never come to terms with life after the death of her young daughter. The audience need only look into her eyes to see the cold indifference behind the fear. It is an emotion that is all the stronger when one is in space, and able to see just how inconsequential they are to the grand scale of the world and the universe. The audience, along with Stone, is left to wonder, does it really matter? If you die, the world will continue to spin as if nothing ever happened. The cinematographer is dazzling. I felt as though the cuts were non- existent. I was never aware of an edit, almost as if the entire film consisted of one continuous shot. All the elements of the film came together perfectly to make this movie and to serve the story. But as I said before, Gravity goes far beyond just a simple story. It is an experience.<br/><br/>The movie is not entirely dependent on CGI and Sandy B, But writing is also its strong part! So is the background score. Sometimes the way it transits from the heavy heartbeats to silence¬Ö.Just perfect! The dialogs are very good too!<br/><br/>There are times when you think you can predict the story but I bet you cant! I would recommend this movie for everyone! Even if it's a 10 yr old..I am sure they too will enjoy mind blowing effects! Gravity is a sure-shot Oscar winner for Best film, Best actress, Best background score and Best director. I really really hope that Clooney too gets something for his supporting role. Maybe for best editing too! A hard 10 on 10!"

The acting was superb. I think Sandra bullock should definitely get an Oscar for her performance as well as Alfonso for best director. The CGI and cinematography were very well executed and how space was visualized is just beautiful and breathtaking. I have to say this is probably one of the best movies done this year so far but that's just my opinion.

","many people want to say it wont have a story because there is no way you can fit 90 minutes of space into a film. BUT It did have a story. it goes into the Drama/adventure Genre. Adventure being a journey. People say there's no compelling story, but (small spoiler**) the journey is them going back to Earth.** The hobbit's story (among a few others interlaced within) is them making their way to a destination, with all the mishaps that happen during the trip. <br/><br/>there are four types of literary conflict: Man V Man, Man V Self, Man V Situation/Nature, Man V Social. This Film is Man V Self and Man V Situation/Nature.<br/><br/>The reason it's so foreign to many people is that the most common in films lately is Man V Man. This one, however is not man V Man in any way. <br/><br/>this is a film where it's best to watch it in 3D, and imagining yourself in their shoes. 3D because when people walk in space, they feel disoriented because there's no true orientation of X, Y, and Zedd axis, and the 3D mixed with the camera floating around freely helps put you in THEIR place. I saw it in 2D but it just doesn't work for this film. <br/><br/>I LOVED this movie. I watched it twice. once on my own and another with a group because after them seeing my excitement after the film they were compelled to see if I was right, and They all agreed: this movie was awesome. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL: They didn't bend the real laws of physics in this film, at least not in an immediately noticeable way. The cinematography is brilliant. Color is amazing. Acting rocks! don't expect action when it's not needed, but don't expect to be disappointed when there is action. the score ROCKS! Steven Price did an AMAZING job with the soundtrack, filling the gaps of would be near silent audio. sound editing is brilliant, I don't want to give a whole lot away about the feel of the film, but the underwater no- air sound was done extremely well. I was jaw dropped through the majority of the film. there was never a dull moment, and when you put it all together, you get 15 minute cuts. some entire scenes are done with just 1 or 3 takes, but don't expect it to feel like a tripod shot. you'll hardly notice and even forget that there wasn't many cuts. <br/><br/>the point i'm trying to make here, is that, ignore the trailer, the actual film itself is one of the best of this year, and one of the best from and for many years to come. it's up there. the boundaries in every sense has been pushed. I will be wanting to watch this again VERY soon."
"ahirjoy","10","4","7","13 October 2013"," Fantastic - Only Comparable to Apollo-13
","The best science fiction ever made in last decade, a masterpiece, in fact it can only be compared to another ground breaking movie and my all time favorite ‚Äì Apollo-13. Friends, please don't judge it by downloading in your computers, you will get nothing out of it, it is a 3D marvel. Sundra Bullock was never considered to be in the league of highly extraordinary Hollywood actresses, but here she has given performance of a lifetime, kudos! You will feel the horror, the fear, the loneliness, the desperation; even more than the astronaut thanks to the director. I am a great sci-fi fan and love aliens and monsters :-P, but this movie is a great example that you don't need ugly aliens or horrific martians to make an impact, all you need is to create the right atmosphere. George Cloonie also has made a great impression though his on screen presence was much less than that of Sandra's. The 3D visions of beautiful earth from space was just mesmerizing, so was the debris of the satellite coming towards you. Coming to the story, a Russian satellite which was destroyed intentionally started a chain reaction and turned the mission to a struggle for existence. But unlike Apollo-13 you don't have Ed Harris to save you out from Houston, you are all alone and nobody can hear your scream! Though it's a adventure/sci-fi genre, few of the conversations were really touching, specially when Sandra got hold of a Chinese wavelength where a father was singing to an infant which did not help her anyway for survival but reminds her of her dead daughter. It shows so beautifully that whichever language we speak, our emotions are all the same, we are only human.5/5 from me, an excellent cinema experience, MUST WATCH!"

","Even though my boyfriend convincingly explained some lacks in the storyline to me after we watched the movie, I still thought it didn't take away too much of its entertainment value. I gave Gravity a 10 since I thought it was the perfect mix of suspense and comedy. This movie is perfect entertainment. It is the opposite of long-winded - my boyfriend and I looked at each other one scene and when we looked back to the screen, the protagonists were already in a different place. Sandra Bullock played her role very authentically and added the drama to the story while George Clooney added the humor. Even though the movie was very suspenseful and the characters were in a desperate situation, there were still a few moments I had to laugh. The 3D effects were great also."

"moviexclusive","9","4","7","12 October 2013"," Everything you heard about this space thriller is true ‚Äì it is a great piece of cinematic work
","If you have been reading movie new and reviews online, you'd probably know by now how everyone is raving about the greatness of Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's latest work. This review will tell you the same thing, but instead of gushing about visually stunning it is from the on start, let's begin by discussing how this writer is actually impressed with female lead Sandra Bullock's performance ‚Äì for once.<br/><br/>Don't get him wrong, this columnist has nothing against the Academy Award winner. His first encounter with the 49 year old actress was in 1994's Speed, but as anyone would kindly remind you, the attention was on a certain Keanu Reeves. The actress then went on to make a name in movies like Miss Congeniality (2000), Crash (2004) and The Lake House (2006). She finally won an Oscar for her role in The Blind Side (2009), which, with no offence intended, isn't a particularly outstanding performance, at least in this humble writer's opinion.<br/><br/>It is with this space thriller that this reviewer is convinced that Bullock is a credible actress. She plays a medical engineer on her first outer space mission with a veteran astronaut. The first shuttle mission goes amok when a seemingly routine spacewalk becomes a disaster, leaving the shuttle destroyed and the two of them completely stranded and alone in outer space.<br/><br/>You'd wonder, how much acting can Bullock showcase when she's in a space suit most of the time? Some clever scriptwriting will actually have her character out of the suit (in a body fitting tank top, no less) and impressing with her personable and surprisingly poignant performance as a grieving mother whose life is on a brink. We will not be surprised if she picks up acting nominations during the upcoming award season. There's nothing like giving recognition to the actress who has been working hard in showbiz starring in a hyped up film like this.<br/><br/>Enough about Bullock for now, so what's in it for viewers who are interested in, to put simply, a good movie? Lots, apparently. You may have heard how this is the best space movie ever made, how this will leave you terrified and awed at the same time, and how it immerses you in an unforgettable viewing experience. Truth is, the statements are all spot on. Without sounding like a fan boy, we'll encourage you to experience this movie yourself. Although we didn't watch the film in IMAX3D format, we can assume it will be one memorable 91 minute movie you actually won't mind spending a few extra bucks on.<br/><br/>Does Cuaron's (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men) cinematic masterpiece have emotionally affecting moments? While movies with characters reflecting on life whilst staring at death in the face are aplenty, this one works, probably due to the commendable performance by the leads.<br/><br/>Yup, there is another cast member acting alongside Bullock, and he comes in the form of the irresistible George Clooney. While he plays a supporting character, you cannot deny the actor's screen presence. His every line in the movie will leave you assured that he is one dude you'd want at your party.<br/><br/>And oh, do watch out for the sequence with floating tear drops. Trust us, they are even more awesome in 3D."

"PeriSubhash","8","4","7","12 October 2013"," A beautiful walk into space
","Ever heard of the famous movie quote ""Survival is the spirit, the soul""? - Well Alfonso Cuar√≥n's ""Gravity"" more or less depicts the same. It's the story of two astronauts on a typical outer space mission and an out coming peril of a collateral event of satellite debris, loss of communication and face of death by lack of oxygen. Cuar√≥n's selection for the cast ‚Äì George Clooney and Sandra Bullock justify their respective characterization. It's more of Bullock's show than Clooney's.<br/><br/>The director portrays the turnaround events in a sumptuous way amidst the rapid screenplay that takes the viewer's experience to the next level. The plot is inventive and unpredictable. The movie flows smoothly from scene to scene with ambient effects. The mechanics of the movie were too good. The haul of microgravity, the wafts and drifts in space is something to be lost in as a viewer and every scene backs it up. It's like a beautiful dance in space.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" not only offers you some of the most vivid images, but sound as well. Composer Steven price's score befits each and every moment from complete silence of space to the chaotic crashing of the shuttle and satellite debris. It feels as if your ear drums were going to blow and then the next moment you could hear a pin drop from the silence.<br/><br/>The story goes too fast that there's a slight lack of hoist to it all in that regard. Everything is so immediate that when it ends, it more or less just relieves the viewer feeling satisfied - not really left with as much as to stick with you. You don't so much watch the film as experience it.<br/><br/>Notable scenes: 1) The scene when bullock's tear simply floats off her cheek was brilliant. 2) The heart beat pounding in some intense scenes. 3) Bullock enacting the howl of a dog while inside the Soyuz space capsule and the same done by dog over the radio impart something bad happening. 4) The climax scene where Bullock tries to stand up on feet after spending a brief time in zero G can be related to a baby who tries to stand up on its feet.<br/><br/>A good 8 out of 10. Likely to win some Oscars."

","The first 10 minutes I couldn't touch my popcorn because the film was so quiet (well, it's space duh.); I didn't want to disturb the others, also it was one of the most beautiful opening sequences I have ever seen. Visually the most pleasing film of the year. Cgi is used for good purposes (vis-√†-vis art, cf. The Tree of Life). Direction is so masterful (and it's the most powerful part of the film) that it becomes an experience. Themes are life, struggle & death. Ryan's story is very sad (I was close to tears). It's a survival film. But we haven't got a survival film like this before. After watching thousands of films, it's surprising to see a film which can have a huge impact on the audience. Sandra deserves an Oscar for those emotional long takes. Quickest 90 minutes of my life."

","I rated a 10, exceptional, and that it is. I have rated 3 movies with a 10, so it is not my custom way of doing. Certainly better films will come, but today it is one of the best I ever seen. The subject is unique and it is a very hard one not to make a boring movie. It is NOT, you are nailed on your seat. Only 2 actors, George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, no site stories, no chases, just Sandra and George and their story to survive in outer space and to try to save themselves. Such a ""clean"" movie and such a thriller. Lets make it clear directly : This is a Sandra Bullock movie and she does a superb job. This time George Clooney is just George and providing the movie of some relaxing moments. Sandra Bullock is a good actress and in this movie she proves it. In fact she already did so in Crash, but this one is to confirm it. She has to survive, but she will also overcome her personal problems. Just good acting ! Why she bothers to evolve herself with some crap movies?! You have to see it in 3D, it is a must. The movie will loose a lot when seen in 2D. Their are some fantastic visual shots of earth, of the debris passing by the ISS, of the water floating in space, better said in the theater. The camera-work is done in an almost excellent way. For example when the camera moves in the helmet of Dr Stone, in 3D, it is like you are in her place. The visuals on earth and space is an eye festivity. The story is well done, not complicated, just find the way back you could say and 1:30 hrs is just the time to do so, not boring at all. May be you want to search for some mistakes in the movie. Well there are, obvious. But which movie doesn't have ? Example : On a certain moment it seems there is gravity in space when holding some objects ... OK, that is it. Just go to see it in 3D. It is a masterpiece of today's possibilities in movie making."

The details, the physics, everything just makes sense, it keeps you watching and interested. It's a 1 1/2 hour long film and it feels like 2+ hours. One thing I do recommend, watch it in 3D.

"nikashvili","8","4","7","9 October 2013"," Don't Let Go! any chance of seeing it
","Do you know, why 3D was invented? I do. Because we had to see this in 3D, because Gravity is the best film experience I've ever had, just like Life of Pi last year, and Avatar four years ago. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n managed bring absolutely different experience of breathtaking visuals, bright colors and great directing.<br/><br/>Gravity follows a medical engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and an astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) working together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space, where even one mistake can cost you a life. Since there is no one in the film except those two and Dr. Stone is left alone quite shortly after the movie starts, there are no much dialogues, however it still manages to keep you tense and stressed any minute of it, mostly because technically perfectly made visual & 3D effects.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki is finally getting his first cinematography Oscar, for doing and outstanding job of capturing Earth from space, using lights to show us sunrise and making space very real for us. Gravity is the only and first space movie that actually shows how beautiful world is from the astronaut's view. The hardest part for cinematographer as usual is to properly deliver the reflections on real object in mirrors, glasses and etc. The scenes, where astronauts are spinning in the open space seems to be very carefully done and watching/realizing this brought so much enjoyment.<br/><br/>And of course, visuals are massive, effective and thrilling, they totally bring tensity and scary emotions of being out there. Additionally, music composed by Steven Price absolutely gorgeous, making each scene more beautiful and involving. I personally think that he's one of the front-runners in this year composer race.<br/><br/>What I did not like it the scenario how everything was happening. Movie repeated every scene time by time: they're under attack, they stay alive and reach new destinations, the are under attack, they stay alive and reach another destination and so on. It seemed a little artificial and boring. The same time, there is no much material for writing, because of quite few dialogues. But some Clooney's jokes were actually funny (and he entertained a lot).<br/><br/>However, I should admit that Sandra Bullock is at the top of her acting career. In Gravity she did the best performance of her ever. First, because it's not easy to play that role, to deliver emotions at its finest, be strong and weak the same time. Second, she definitely has better awards material than in The Blind Side, so she can easily make final top 5 at Oscars and Golden Globes - woman, who's sentimental to her dead baby, fighting for survival in the space, attempting suicide and staying alive - it's kind of winning formula.<br/><br/>But Alfonso Cuar√≥n is the one who really deserves applause because he combined sensation, visual beauty, tension and great acting in one movie, which almost never happens and brought it to the screens in most entertaining way I could imagine. Directors who shot action-based Sci-Fi thrillers have one of the hardest jobs to do. They have to capture things that they have never seen in reality (in this case space) and to make the viewers experience the most realistic feelings. I had the sense as if I was floating in above the Earth.<br/><br/>All in all, Gravity is technical perfection, but there could have been done more in writing part. However it's already a landmark in Sci-Fi, as it's been Avatar when premiered."
"MovieDude1893","9","4","7","8 October 2013"," Gripping tension and visual splendor. A true movie event.
","Gravity (Cuaron, 2013, A) <br/><br/>To my mind, those who knock the script are mostly failing to see the forest for the trees. Problems are there to be sure, but to avoid seeing this would be a regrettable miscalculation. For me, the script worked in a terse, elemental sort of way as it pokes toward transcendent themes that are better evoked through the visual and aural landscape than the dialog. But I think the story elements stand solely because Bullock lifts them on up on her shoulders and ultimately her performance not only deeply impressed me, but moved me. I believe most writers (and I fall squarely within this camp) lack the necessary vocabulary to express the wonder of these visuals. Thankfully, they speak for themselves. Yet, perhaps I am most pleased to find a film, so rare in the current American mega-production model, that is precisely as long as it must be. I can't speculate how this one will age (even four years have not been kind to AVATAR) but for now it is miraculous.<br/><br/>Final thought: For a much more eloquent assessment, I suggest you consult MZS's review at RogerEbert.com (www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gravity-2013) or AO Scott at the New York Times."
"brickmoviereviews","9","4","7","8 October 2013"," Gravity Overview
","Gravity is a movie that takes on a whole new perspective of astronauts. The movie takes you on a journey with a space crew and their final space walk to set up a telescope on a space station. While you are watching the movies you can really feel the zero gravity and will even find yourself breathing at the same rate that the crew does. The environment of space is portrayed beautifully. In the beginning, the movie stresses that life in space is impossible. This makes it very clear that literally nothing is in space. No sound, no air, and nothing to slow you down if you are caught drifting. Overall, this is a very well written and made movie. There isn't much to say about 'Gravity' without spoiling it because the movie will keep you guessing from start to finish. The main focus of this movie is persistence. 'Gravity' makes it clear that without persistence you are doomed to live without any happiness, and then life becomes pointless. Without the amazing character development set up in the first scene we would be forced to watch a long and drawn out movie. Luckily that is not the case. If it wasn't for Clooney's and Bullock's performance we would have drifted through space with blank characters. With the interesting stories that the characters tell each other while in the void of space we are entertained all the way through the movie. With the acceptation of a couple of minor plot holes and a few scenes that were a minute to long, Gravity is a must see.<br/><br/>Check out more of our reviews at www.brickmoviereviews.wordpress.com"
"moedizmel89222222","8","4","7","6 October 2013"," Slow but steady
","I did not put much expectation for this movie in the beginning. Firstly, hats off to the Cuaron brothers for their original story. Its not the usual and common science fiction story you watch everyday such as asteroid alarm, alien attacks and war between two planets. The story focuses on life on space,how unpredictable it could be,how helpless we are outside the atmosphere of earth and gravity and also hope. <br/><br/>Secondly, graphic was good and realistic. I realized the team did a pretty good job on making the movements of objects and person as how it could be when there is no gravity acting on them.<br/><br/>Next,acting. Sandra Bullock gave her best since her performance in The Blind Side. Sadly its not Oscar deserving. She brought the role perfectly but not the emotions. It seems not natural. She failed to shine during breakdowns or when under pressure. Well credits for her initiative to befriend astronaut Andy Coleman in order to understand their lifestyle in space. George Clooney, well his role can be clearly seen as supporting actor which did not suit him. He is an astronaut so he could had been more serious and less romantic and funny maybe. Nobody jokes when we are in the outer space. <br/><br/>Few mistakes here and there but great screenplay. Finally, then ending. Few moments to the ending tend to be biased to make her survive. It didn't take me long to realize that she will survive every single obstacle till the last Chinese capsule. I would prefer if she died trying in the ending. <br/><br/>Shooting was completed in 2011 so i assume a lot of time was spent to edit and improve the visual effects. Kudos to the team. Overall i would give this movie 8/10 for the vast amount of effort put by the actors and staffs to produce this original and almost realistic piece of work. Thank you."

","Four films come to mind when I think about Gravity: Mission to Mars, Deep Impact, WALL-E and, of course, Apollo 13. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.<br/><br/>As others have said, this film is visually stunning. It's best to watch it on the biggest, clearest screen you can. An IMAX screen is ideal. 2D is fine. 3D is fine, too, but unnecessary because the 3D effect is used only occasionally.<br/><br/>Despite ideas lifted from a certain Brian De Palma film and a certain Pixar film, Gravity is thoroughly enjoyable. As a side note, the similarity between George Clooney's character and Tim Allen's Buzz LIghtyear in voice and appearance is so close I kept expecting him to say, ""To infinity and beyond!""<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie. The action begins nearly right away and continues nonstop. I've seen 80-minute films that felt like 3 hours. But this 90-minute film felt more like 5 minutes. The action and the immersive visuals will give you the feeling you're on a theme park ride, not in a regular movie. Once it's over, you'll want to go on it again."

Technology blows my mind every year and Visionary Directors like Alfonso Cuar√≥n himself knew exactly what he was doing. -The story itself? An incredible journey. That's all I can say without spoiling.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if this film wins Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Actress in Leading Role, and even BEST PICTURE.<br/><br/>Great film.

"Benedict_Cumberbatch","Null","4","7","5 October 2013"," A technical wonder, a visual stunner
","James Cameron has called Alfonso Cuaron's GRAVITY ""the greatest space film ever made."" I want to believe he means... ""after 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY,"" although that should be a given, right? Nonetheless, Cuaron's follow-up to his brilliant CHILDREN OF MEN (2006) is another landmark in the sci-fi genre. The premise is simple, but the execution is what makes it a work of art. Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer from Illinois, and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), must find a way to survive after an accident leaves them lost in space. The universal themes of survival and resistance (in space!) give room for Cuaron and his troupe to create some of the most beautiful visual effects you'll ever see.<br/><br/>As of 10/04/2013, I have seen only 3 films that have used 3D technology to really complement storytelling: Wim Wenders' PINA (2011), Martin Scorsese's HUGO (2011), and GRAVITY. However, even though GRAVITY is just as impressive technically as the aforementioned titles, it is my least favorite of the three because of its lead actors. Clooney is just being Clooney, and although this is the best Bullock has ever been, that hardly means much to me as I think she's a very bland actress. That soulless stare remains there, and I can't help but wonder what someone like Jessica Chastain could have done with this role. In Sandra's defense, I can also say she doesn't compromise the overall quality of the film too much, but she is my major complain about it (there's even an obvious ""Oscar scene"" written just for her).<br/><br/>GRAVITY may just fall short of masterpiece level, but it's still a fascinating film for its technical achievements. If the Academy does not recognize the work of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki this time, they never will. Go see it in 3D as it's supposed to be seen, and enjoy the ride."
"giorgiothesmurf","9","4","7","4 October 2013"," Visually striking and out of this world!
","I walked out of Gravity feeling goosebumps all over my body. The whole movie is seasoned with drama, suspense, and a bit of comedy. When you watch this movie, you feel like you are going to drift into the Cosmos. It really brings you into the emotions that Ryan is feeling. Not to mention, the acting from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are top notch. The story is terrifying in a good way. Imagine being in outer space by yourself, that would be a nightmare. The dialogue in the movie is very well written with memorable lines. And last but not least, the visual effects are amazingly phenomenal. <br/><br/>There is only one bad thing I have to say about this movie, it is only 1 hour and 30 minutes long.<br/><br/>9/10"
"rivertam26","10","4","7","4 October 2013"," Cinematic Brilliance
","When I see a truly great movie it leaves me speechless. There's so much going through my mind. Because a great film is one that can't be taken at face value it inspires thought and leaves an imprint on you. At it's surface Gravity is a Hollywood popcorn movie about survival in space during a horrific accident but underneath it and most importantly it is a film about the human experience. From it's wonderfully entrancing opening shot Director Alfonso Cuaron immerses you in the environment of space. It's the closest experience many of us will get to actual space travel. We meet our central characters executing their assigned tasks and goofing off a bit, and than they get an emergency message that debris from a damaged satellite is heading towards them. It strikes with no sound, because there is no sound in space. it's a truly nightmarish sequence that leads to some of the most horrifying moments you've ever seen on screen. The film is a tour de force from beginning to end. A monumental technical achievement, terrifyingly beautiful but what makes this film so successful is in the way the heavy effects that drive the film blend with it's emotional core making for a truly engaging experience. When Sandra Bullock sheds her suit and floats in a fetal position you can feel the subtext of rebirth as well as finding the will to survive and echoes of that in the films conclusion. Gravity is a film about death but it's also a film about life and loss and the will to survive not just in the events that are happening on screen but everything that happens to us on a day to day basis. Director Alfonso Cuaron a master film maker directs the film with an eerie simplicity challenging us with nearly unbearable tension and delving deeper into something truly spiritual. George Clooney leaves a charismatic imprint in a small but important role and the central performance by Sandra Bullock is truly remarkable and quite possibly the best of her dramatic career. She's a definite shoe in for a best performance nod and anyone going against her will have a hard run of it. The movie flows like liquid cinematic poetry covering every inch with cinematic brilliance. Gravity isn't just one of the best films I've ever seen it's an amazing experience. *****/5"
"angrypancho","9","4","7","4 October 2013"," The director Cuaron must have been born under a lucky star
","I've read both Angelina Jolie and Natalie Portman were ready to play Sandra Bullock's part. Neither would have reached the delightful heights Ms. Bullock does. Trust me, out of the three she is far and away the best choice; halfway through this arresting movie I was thinking how completely perfect the casting was, and that casting is of Clooney and Bullock. Apparently this movie was blessed from the beginning in being able to land the one star who was capable of lifting this movie way beyond even its lofty ambitions.<br/><br/>The idea of bringing a story like this to the screen is a completely reckless one. There are so many obviously impossible shots in this story only a madman would have agreed to tackle it. And yet it works. From the moment it started I was physically engaged in the action. For once, it paid to watch it in Imax and 3-D, but I'm not sure the movie's impact would have suffered if I watched it low tech.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one of survival in space. But that's enough to make it utterly unforgettable in the way only the best basic science-fiction used to pull off when I was a kid. There are leaps of logic here, but you won't mind them, if you have any heart."

","Space nut here. (If I wasn't such a coward, I would have signed up to go to Mars.) So, I was tense throughout the movie since I read a lot and watch a lot about space (""the final frontier"")- non-fiction - and know some of the dangers.<br/><br/>In addition, the way the film is written and directed, I felt I knew the characters right from the start, so I felt for their plight. Slightly teary was I.<br/><br/>So, although physically tensed in my seat, and teary-eyed, I found this a thoroughly enjoyable film. And even though I am somewhat well informed, I am not informed enough to be distracted by anything that didn't ring true. An excellent film with beautiful visuals."
"nebk","7","7","15","23 December 2013"," Gravity Pulls You In
","This movie is surprisingly good even with its flaws. I didn't know what to expect before seeing it but was pleasantly surprised by some aspects of it, <br/><br/>The premise is that a group of astronauts is hit by by debris from a Russian satellite which the Russians accidentally blew up, and their shuttle is destroyed and most of the crew is killed. The two survivors played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock now have to make their way to the International Space Station and further without any help or communications as most of the communication satellites were destroyed. Dr. Ryan Stone played by Bullock is running out of air and Matt Kowalski played by Clooney is running out of fuel for his space suit's thrusters. I don't want to give too much away but obviously things happen which make the rest of the movie very suspenseful. <br/><br/>The good parts of this movie are firstly the way it was filmed. The scenery is fantastic and at times I started feeling queasy when the astronauts were spinning. At times you feel like you are there. The view of Space & Earth is amazing. The movie is extremely suspenseful and obviously the two actors were great as was to be expected. Although to be honest, Clooney is basically playing himself in a space suit. <br/><br/>What I didn't particularly like is the fact is that Dr Stone is made out to be a novice and has almost no experience in space or operating and landing shuttles. It is even mentioned that she failed in the landing simulations. The situation that she finds herself in would be difficult enough for even the most seasoned astronaut to deal with, let alone someone who has no experience. The movie would have been better and more believable if she was a seasoned astronaut who didn't go through anxiety attacks or pick buttons by random in the landing vehicle whilst going Enny, Menny, Minney Moe. The fact that she seems to operate a Russian and then a Chinese landing craft with ease also wasn't believable. There was also no need to have her howling and going woof woof at one point. This was used to show her mental strain and what she was going through but it wasn't effective, just plain weird. <br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like is that everything starts when the Russians accidentally blow up their own Satellite thereby starting the chain reaction causing debris that destroys all the communications and stations in its path. I think that Hollywood should move away from the stereotype that Russians are all inept alcoholics or mad and wacky and cause accidents. The movie would have been more serious (and could be taken more seriously) if a natural occurrence was to blame or an equipment malfunction. Not oooops, the Russians did it. <br/><br/>I didn't have a problem with the dialog between Kowalski And Dr. Stone even though some reviews have pointed out that it seemed inane, silly and irrelevant at times. I think the purpose of Kowalski keeping the conversation light and pointless at times was to get Dr. Stone to calm down as much as possible whilst they were floating in space given the fact that she was exhausting her already almost-depleted oxygen supply. Also it's one of the rare moments where some character development can occur. And there is very little character development to begin with. <br/><br/>Overall I wouldn't rate this less then a seven given the suspense and the way it was filmed. The action sequences were thrilling and well made. It's a shame that the flaws prevent it from being a fantastic movie. It's still good though and worth watching."
"p-stepien","8","7","15","23 December 2013"," Space Thriller
","Alfonso Cuaron's gripping 3D extravaganza finally delivers a movie well-worth its 3D special effects, which puts to shame the simplistic idiocy of ""Avatar"". Around the Earth's orbit a team of American astronauts are repairing communication lines on a space shuttle. While scientist-engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) focuses on the technical issues, experienced, slightly cowboyish Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) frivolously space-walks engaging into boyish banter of 'did I ever tell you of the time...' When a Russian destruction of a obsolete satellite results in the a cascading domino effect of catastrophic scale, the shuttle is destroyed with Kowalski and Stone drifting in space with oxygen slowly running out.<br/><br/>Not exactly a sci-fi, as basically the only element that hints at anything remotely other-worldly is a short dream sequence near the end of the movie. Apart from that, save for some small script liberties, this is a factual riveting thriller, basically as down-to-earth as cosmic space stories goes as possible. Sandra Bullock returns to form with her great portrayal, grasping all the moments from despair and panic to resignation and the will to live. She is also expertly paired up with the whimsical, but stoic, Kowalski, together with some superb visuals and perfect building of tension, bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase: In space no one will hear you scream...<br/><br/>The dramatic/philosophical edge to the movie may not work as well, with the whole backdrop of Stone's dead child somewhat struggling to add relevance to the story, nonetheless this is in no way written or delivered in a substandard way, thus not of any detriment to overall enjoyment.<br/><br/>Required watching. Just for the thrill of it! If nothing else."

","So, I gave this film three stars for the interesting editing and effects.<br/><br/>Was this film written this way? Was the main character always supposed to be a woman? If so, why bother accrediting her character as a doctor and an astronaut when you never had any intention of letting her save herself?<br/><br/>Beef #1 - From the opening scene until the end, the film revolves around a whiny scientist who is scared and uncomfortable in space. Why would she ever be up there? Perhaps it's a punishment for letting her daughter die? Give me a break.<br/><br/>Beef #2 - Why in the HELL did Sandy Bullock ever need to appear in her underwear? Was this really necessary? I know nothing about space, but I can tell you that I do know that a space suit protects an astronaut from the freezing and lethal environments in the space vacuum. If I knew that the ""shelter"" I was about to enter would be hit by flying debris at any moment, I would not shed that protective suit down to my undies and curl up into a ball in front of a window. REALLY?<br/><br/>Beef #3 - So, we let this character be a doctor, and an astronaut, but we couldn't let her save herself now, could we? We had to necromancy and bring a man back into the picture to save the day. Gag me.<br/><br/>Smaller beefs - I don't need Clooney to hit on ever woman he ever stars opposite. It's disgusting. Sandra Bullock is a woman, not a meat bag. Who cares about your cute eyes or ass or anything between the two? Can men and women just be colleagues, ever?!<br/><br/>By the end of this film I was hoping that upon re-entry, she would drown. Sad. I'm a horrible person, but it seemed realistic given the powerless stance that the character was given."

Incredible space views of the Earth and special effects probably make this movie the best space sci-fi ever produced. <br/><br/>However, the writing is quite predictable..Yes, we cannot put this movie in the same league of Fight Club, Schindler's List or Forrest Gump as current IMDb s rating is suggesting. This will be an easily forgettable movie, starts well, slow down to a point where you will start to be bored in the middle of the movie. <br/><br/>To conclude, I think this movie deserves a 7 out of 10. 9 visually and 6 for the writing."
"aditya_vashisht","10","12","30","30 November 2013"," Try getting out of the theater. 'Gravity' won't let you.
","For years film makers have been trying to convert cinema theaters into warp zones for traveling to new vistas. The result, is 'Gravity'.<br/><br/>Don't say the question ""what would one do if stranded in space"", never came to your mind. We have seen the images in Kubrick's ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" and Danny Boyle's ""Sunshine"", and those left us pretty scared. Whoa, we got ourselves a new genre - SPACE HORROR!! But Alfonso Cuaron's 'Gravity' isn't just a movie, it's an experience. Sitting in our seats we feel the anxiety, emptiness of space (adoring the beauty at the same time) and gasping for air. Its a story of survival, embracing our fears and making decisions when the most necessary of all resources are absent. Do we let the situation take control of us and lose hope or take a grasp on our life? This experience is not as empty as the vast vacuum of space.<br/><br/>Its surprising how convincingly real the images are. The cinematography and the lighting leave us awestruck. And the most amazing part is the physics of the bodies in space. The 3D immerses us further into the scene and wow - we are floating. Alfonso Cuaron, after giving us visual masterpieces like 'Children of Men' and 'Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban (my favorite of the eight movies)' lands a benchmark in every way. Difficult 15 minute shots with no cuts, visual transitions from third person to first in the same scene are rare achievements. <br/><br/>Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has just enlisted himself among best cinematographers ever in history. Is there any stopping him? He stunned us with his work in 'The Tree of Life' and 'Children of Men'. He has even surpassed himself.<br/><br/>Flawless in every way, 'Gravity' is the cinema experience that happens only once a decade and opens our minds to new stories and fresh approach."
"ieuah","9","8","18","22 November 2013"," A phenomenal technological feat.
","I went to see Gravity at the IMAX 3D,and I was not disappointed. The size of the screen, coupled with the technologically magnificent use of the medium, staggered me. The use of occasional first-person camera views and the 3D camera really put you in the shoes of the characters. Although some might have found these scenes boring, I found the broad sweeping views of space, the utter silence, and the sheer scale of everything, a humbling experience. The CGI creates a sense of reality as opposed to a world of imagination.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the film is two surviving astronauts, after having their shuttle destroyed and being flung into space, attempting to survive. But it is not just floating around space the entire film, it's a heart-pounding thriller, as the characters are faced with almost continuous danger throughout the film. <br/><br/>There is a fair amount of symbolism and philosophical subtext to a lot of the film, much of it centered around rebirth and self-realization. Bullock and Clooney are portrayed as having hugely divergent reactions and outlooks to the crisis and on a deeper level, life itself. The debris could be viewed simply as just that, debris. It could be viewed as the tendency for humans to abdicate responsibility (out of sight, out of mind) on a global scale, but it is always at our detriment. Or it could be viewed on a personally psychological level, as things we push aside and avoid coming back to haunt us. Gravity is hugely multifaceted, as are it's characters, and as such every viewer will view it and connect with the characters differently. The script is very well written.<br/><br/>I highly recommend that you see this film in the full immersion experience of IMAX 3D, so you can fully appreciate the wondrous cinematography. But don't worry, if that's not an option, Gravity offers so much more. Quite easily my favourite film of the year."

","I was very excited to this movie because of the trailers and the amazing reviews I read on IMDb, and amazing reviews from critics. I really wanted to like this movie, and I tried so hard to like it, but the movie was really slow-paced and boring and repetitive. I expected so much more from the supposed ""best space movie in years"" but it fell short. The first 20 minutes were really interesting, but I was bummed that it starts off in space right away. You didn't know anything about the characters until after the first accident happens, which makes it more difficult to connect with the characters. Not only that, but the characters are the stereotypical clich√© cocky guy and scared, weak girl. <br/><br/>Then, the rest of the movie is a series of repetitive events that I could have sworn I'd already watched. Also, spoiler here, but when they showed Ryan talking to Matt, I thought he was actually with her, and they didn't make it very clear that she was having a dream, so that scene was very confusing.<br/><br/>I thought it might get better, but it didn't. The ending was very cheesy and unrealistic. And the ending doesn't conclude anything about the story as much as I hoped it would, it just kind of ends... I was just extremely disappointed because I was really excited about this movie, but overall it is just a bunch of hype. Sure, the visuals were stunning, but that's all this movie has going for it, which isn't enough to keep you entertained for 90 minutes. The scenes were painfully slow and boring, I found myself falling asleep. And the plot was so repetitive with Ryan just floating around trying to grab on to something. It felt like a waste of time and money. I wouldn't watch it again."

","I love ""hard"" science fiction, where what you see is entirely within the laws of physics, a re- made true universe in which human beings are subjected to the most unusual of ""true"" circumstances not found on earth. The level of accuracy here is quite amazing, and only minor truths are changed to advance the plot and keep it compact and breathlessly well- paced.<br/><br/>Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney shine in this spare and amazingly well-paced movie. This is not a 90 minute movie stretched to 2.5 hours, this is a 90 minute movie presented as it happens. Outstanding!<br/><br/>Ms Bullock's best ever role, after a mostly wasted career (in my rarely humble opinion). She is a mission specialist, not a ""full blown"" astronaut, with limited space training, as compared to Mr Clooney's faultless performance as the seasoned, ""true"" spaceman. The balance between their performances is nuanced and true.<br/><br/>This is the first movie (after the jungle scenes in Avatar) which truly benefits from the 3D treatment. I wish we could return to active-shutter 3D glasses, the current ones noticeably reduce brightness and color, sadly. But nonetheless, the 3D adds amazing depth in the optical airlessness of space.<br/><br/>I also found shades of the first Ripley re-born in Ms Bullock's space girl. She truly grows in the roll before our eyes, showing that women truly can be just as competent and creative as any man.<br/><br/>I award this movie my highest rating. See it on the big screen NOW."

You're going to wish you'd spent your time more wisely! <br/><br/>The writers, the Cuar√≥ns, don't seem to understand an awful lot, namely: space, technology, people, NASA, reentry realities, how people speak, philosophy (their attempts at philosophical statements are so corny and vacuous they sound like cheesy coffee cup sayings from the 1960s), and more. The writing is vapid, empty, unbelievable, the comments at times of crisis incredibly cheerful and unreal... <br/><br/>Example: the character played by George Clooney (whom I admire and is the one shining light in this dreadful film, which he couldn't save in spite of his efforts) asks the character played by Sandra Bullock what town she's from, to get her mind off a crisis in space. Come on, guys! These astronauts would already know what towns they're from by this time in their lives! The writers are just...dopes! (Sorry!) <br/><br/>Another example: Bullock's oxygen is low yet Clooney has her talk to him incessantly (and it's all stupid small talk that makes you want to puke) to stay focused - notwithstanding that this very activity (in real life) would cause her to use up her oxygen all the faster! <br/><br/>This movie is an insult to the viewer's intelligence. It plays out like those childhood games we used to play on the playground - you know, hey, push this button, see if that one works! Hey - it does! No need for training, eh? Dumb, dumb, dumb - and you're going to feel stupid if you watch this flick. <br/><br/>The only thing good are the visuals but those don't sustain a movie and they're not exactly the most state-of-the-art stunning displays of creativity ever. In fact, you don't feel you've seen anything new at all. <br/><br/>I'm just really angry that Hollywood felt audiences would be so uninformed and unsophisticated that they would think this movie was anything other than what it is, namely, space trash! <br/><br/>Want another example of how very stupid this is? Sandra Bullock spends much time in space, bare-legged and barefoot and actually returns home from space bare-legged and barefoot and essentially wearing underwear! Come on!<br/><br/>The ending, too - without being a spoiler - is just so fantastically unreal as to make you shake your head. What was the studio that put out this hopelessly clueless movie thinking? Did anyone at all research what real space flight was like? Doubtful.<br/><br/>Regardless - this movie's ignorance of its own subject is one thing. Its dialog is another. It's so amateurish to make one wonder what made these guys think they could get away with their incompetence."

","This movie is full of lame clich√©s, poor dialog and a pathetic storyline. The ONLY thing that makes this movie remotely watchable are the special effects.<br/><br/>Firstly, the story line is total garbage and unoriginal! As usual, the whole fiasco was the fault of the ""Russians"" Seriously?? Haven't we moved passed the cold war and the whole ""evil Russian empire""? Then we have the main character, Sandra Bullock. Here we have another sad clich√©, as she plays a woman with scars and a tear jerking past who is trying to find meaning and redemption in her sad and empty life out in the depths of space. Awwwwww. George Clooney plays the standard heroic all American good guy who is totally fearless, selfless and willing to give the ultimate sacrifice, all with a sense of humor..... makes me wish i was an American *sarcasm*<br/><br/>Secondly, we have the story, which is so unbelievable that it defies logic, and Sandra Bullocks character is the most gifted, most intelligent and luckiest person in the history of humanity as she survives one unbelievable catastrophe after another. Not too bad for an underdog who flunked her flight simulations and has virtually no skills as an astronaut. <br/><br/>Seriously, this film is an insult to your intelligence and it seems to be marketed to people who believe and fairy tales and unicorns."

","New 42"" HDTV and a Blu-Ray player recently. Loving it!<br/><br/>Gravity... so much hype and so many awards! Turn the lights out and get immersed! It had my full attention!<br/><br/>By the halfway point I hated it. Why? It was all about the visuals, the CGI, the clever swirly camera shots and mind-blowing shots of Earth with ambient music (The Orb's ""Blue Room"" would have been perfect)<br/><br/>Other than this what was there? A bit of trivial chat between ""Cool and Calm"" Clooney and ""Doctor"" Bullock. Please tell me why this movie was in any way good apart from this? I thought Avatar was rubbish because apart from the visuals the script was awful and story derivative.<br/><br/>Films that are about being stuck in space? Dark Star and Silent Running had low budgets but were far more emotionally involving than this movie. The film was a Hollywood ""tick the boxes"" Oscar movie. Am surprised Tom Hanks didn't take Clooney's roll first! Ol' Hanks loves those ""Oscar"" roles!<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock put in a great performance as a scared woman who looks nervous all the time and breathes heavily a lot (but always with perfect make-up). Then there's a scene where she gets all emotional because she is alone in space. Well played by Sandra, she did it well. She is a great actress. <br/><br/>If you LOVE special effects and it contributes to your movie going experience, then this movie will impress the pants off you. Effects never-before-seen and it moves ""the bar"" in terms of visuals...<br/><br/>If however special visual effects take second place to a story and words spoken, then you might be underwhelmed a bit. It's a big budget Hollywood movie with fancy-pants effects.<br/><br/>The ending could well be used for a new deodorant commercial!<br/><br/>Dark Star and Silent Running were miles better!"

","No amount of CGI will redeem this hocus pockus of its presumption. <br/><br/>A bunch of clearly juvenile people in cosmonaut suits try their hand at satellite repair in orbit. One insane mission commander does a merry go round the shuttle as he plays music and sings when his delinquent engineer fiddles on with the space telescope hardware and the Arab guy is doing something similar to a yo yo act on his tether. It's like seeing children from school on a space picnic, literally. The test chimpanzee from the Chinese module viewing through his porthole must have felt like undertaking an EVA just to discipline these morons.<br/><br/>So when the debris starts flying, Nasa asks the commander to start reentry procedure. Yeah sure, the space shuttle is like a trike, just start the engine, climb down and park.<br/><br/>Btw, did you know that space stations all hang about close to each other. So its pretty simple, if you loose your space craft just hop over to the next station.<br/><br/>Anyway, eventually the engineer is caught in a dilemma over whether to let go of said mission commander or not. What I don't understand is what was pulling on the commander? gravity? I think not cause he floated off the other way.<br/><br/>When she finally does get into the ISS the engineer strips down for a much needed stretch and then gets into the Soyuz reentry capsule. She reads the Russian manual written in Russian for Russian controls labelled in Russian and maneuvers the capsule to the Chinese tiangong space station. Once there she reads the Chinese manual without success but operates the Chinese controls labelled in Chinese successfully to start an escape sequence and does a successful reentry.<br/><br/>In a matter of minutes the movie goes from a show of NASA astronauts to showcasing the life of space hobo's with debris thrown in for good measure."

"H_Spengler","10","5","10","11 October 2013"," One of the best movies i've seen in a long, long time.
","I can count on one hand how many times i've seen a movie and have been completely, utterly enraptured and on the edge of my seat. Cauron once again proves his competency as a director and storyteller. (see the excellent: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as reference to his excellent work.) <br/><br/>This is one of them. I've seen it twice, once in 2D, and the other in 3D IMAX. <br/><br/>The 2D experience:<br/><br/>1.) Visuals: Absolutely breathtaking. The CG used here is so well done, and seamlessly blended I couldn't tell what was CG and what wasn't. The colors and rich and vibrant. <br/><br/>2.) Attention to detail. Was meticulous. I liked ""no sound in space"" I liked that the only sound we had was in the presence of air, and the reverberation through and in the space suits of the using of tools, etc. I enjoyed the physics and realism, the sometimes clunky and awkward movements of the astronauts as they are limited by the bulky space suits, and lack of gravity or air pressure to assist.<br/><br/>3.) Clooney and Bullock do a spectacular job, I was invested and concerned in the story and felt real emotions at the unfurling of events. I CARED what happened. <br/><br/>4.) I found myself leaning, shifting, and making gestures with my hands, face, feet, whatever (as if that was going to alter the outcome of what was happening.) Not to mention muttering under my breath ""look out!, ""go,go,go"" ""grab that!"" amongst other things.<br/><br/>5.) The score was spectacular. (And not overwhelming,) powerful and appropriate. I believe this is Steven Price's first ""big"" work. Well done.<br/><br/>6.) Kept me guessing until the end. I honestly didn't know if this was going to be a happy ending. All the signs of good story telling.<br/><br/>The 3D IMAX experience. (everything great from the 2D experience, and some bonuses!)<br/><br/>3D is something I rarely invest in. Usually it's pointless, annoying and adds nothing significant to what i'm watching. It's just a way for me to part with extra $$ for no real reason and a disappointing experience. <br/><br/>Gravity is an exception to the 3D rule. And seeing it in IMAX is a special treat. The expansive screen swallows you whole and makes you experience space and the unfolding events as if you were actually there. <br/><br/>3D is well done and well used. I've become accustomed in my 3D experience to things popping out of the screen towards the audience, things, in the foreground separated from the background, fireballs, etc. etc. etc. <br/><br/>I cannot recall one instance in any of these previous movies where I actually flinched, blinked, and raised my hand up as if to protect myself from something coming at me.<br/><br/>I did this for Gravity. To me that debris was coming straight at my head. <br/><br/>To the naysayers and nit-pickers: all I'll say is ""really?!"" How much better do you get? I dare you to find a more realistic space movie.<br/><br/>Whatever way you view this movie, the important thing is you do. I highly recommend the 3D IMAX version (Something I rarely do.) Blu-Ray will be spectacular, but nothing will touch seeing this in a theater. <br/><br/>Bravo gravity, Bullock, Clooney, Price, and especially you Cuar√≥n. I will see you come awards season.<br/><br/>10/10"

This films graphics and special effects are very beautiful and realistic looking, but that's about all it has going for it. There is virtually no plot, just one person roaming through space with one thing going wrong after another. Apparently, there are a lot of scientific mistakes (none that I saw, because I am ignorant on the subject) so if you're a science stickler, avoid this movie! Overall, if you want to see this movie to experience superb picture and a feeling of being in outer space, it could be a good watch.

","I was not disappointed with the CGI effects but was TOTALLY disappointed with a story line (if you could find it?)This was CASTAWAY in space without a plot. There were some exciting moments which made you do Ohhhh's and whoa's! On the whole they were far and few between. Clooney was his charming self and Bullock did a great job making her role semi believable. When you think of Ron Howards version of space (Apollo 13) which was true. He did an amazing job even with the fact he had reality as his governor. This movie was fiction with all the room in the world or out of this world for story development and still crashed in that area. Its fiction for God sake come up with something new! Why did they go through all the time needed to create all the exceptional visual effects if you were going to trash a story plot. Seems like something Spielberg would do these days because he does stand on ceremony. Wait for DVD unless you need to get out of the house!

","I went to see this movie because of its multitude of positive reviews and the fact that I like the movie The Fountain. So of course I went into this with great expectations and got very, very disappointed. The reason that the Fountain worked with its metaphysical exploration of life and death is because you got to know and liked the two leads. In this movie you quickly like George Clooney's character and quickly dislike Sandra Bullock's character. She is whiny and incompetent. She needed a longer training time. I would have quickly left her to die. She just didn't garner any sympathy because of the way her character was written, <br/><br/>Well, now for the good things. The visuals were stunning for sure. But the drama seemed force, almost horror movie like. <br/><br/>I wish Cuaron had done better."

","I feel the need to share a different view about this movie . I went to the theater expecting to see a mind blowing movie, as all the reviews and marks indicated . Instead, I saw a linear plot, with a 100% typical character for Hollywood movies . It's not bad from a visual perspective . It is not bad for a commercial movie which does not have to say anything new compared to hundreds of movies done before this one. Unfortunately it is just that: a decent visual commercial movie for popcorn eaters . The spoiler alert is marked because there is nothing to spoil :D , it's the plot u saw again and again and again in countless movies . What Gravity delivers is so much lower compared to ""2001 a space odyssey"", from where he borrowed some nice tricks . <br/><br/>My grade for the movie is 5 due to the fact that is not even close to what it's supposed to be."

Without spoiling the movie for anyone, I will tell you that these two are the only people you see on screen, with the rest of the very short cast list appearing in voice form only. the director Alfonso Caron once proofs again that he is one of the smartest guys in Hollywood. i had really no expectations, but believe me: after this space-classic you will look differently to the sky!"

The opening 13 min scene in space is so beautiful and sets the pace for the rest of the film. I have never seen a movie so intense and emotionally griping as this one. George Clooney and Sandra bullock have performances of a lifetime. I can easily see these two getting award nominations for this movie. This is the best film of the year so far it's a movie that must be seen in theaters. Some look at the trailer and only see 2 actors and space and will immediately turn away from this film but, this film was directed and paced so perfect. this is a 90 min roller coaster ride that never lets up. You'll be at the edge of your seat the entire movie wondering what's going to happen next. This is a must see movie do not miss this experience. If you can afford to see it in 3d I recommend it the visual effects are so perfect that the 3d adds so much more to the movie. I have never been a fan of 3d but this is just so beautiful. 10/10.

","Hello, My name is Andrew. <br/><br/>Let me first say that I saw this movie expecting action, suspense, and a good story line.<br/><br/>But to get to the guts, I was very disappointed. There was no action per-say, because the ""action"" is comprised of space stations blowing up... And that's it. The first is not very well explained even why it blew up, (no it is not aliens, its some weird meteor shower or something). The suspense was non existent as the movie is completely watching a woman floating in space... There is nothing suspenseful about it because it looks like she's just floating in water. And the story was a total flop. As I stated already, the movie is completely watching a woman floating in space and occasionally seeing a space station blow up, and there's the story. <br/><br/>I have heard this movie was made to showcase special effects... But what I saw could have been put into a 3 minute video much easier for a much lower budget than $100,000,000. All around, I do not recommend this movie for someone looking for something worth watching. If you want to blow some money and have time to waste, check it out.

"christopherbinder","9","6","13","6 October 2013"," Rebirth and Giving Birth in Zero-Gravity
","The theme of rebirth and the visual motif of human pregnancy runs prevalent throughout Alfonso Cuaron's long awaited new film, Gravity. The film I think first takes a scientific view and then gradually moves towards a more spiritual, religious one at the end. We first see Earth and then the space shuttle and Hubble appear as a dot getting bigger and bigger as we (or they) come closer and closer to the screen. It's when they first appear as a dot that I got the feeling that I was seeing a picture of a Hydrogen atom orbiting around it's nucleus (the Earth). Hydrogen, as we all know (or should) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, yet it is also the smallest and simplest one there is on the periodic table. The first shot mimics this idea of the Macro and the Micro, with us starting off in extreme long shot and eventually going in on a single bolt that Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) has to retrieve for Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). Nuts and bolts are also very small, simple things that are essential parts of bigger structures, much like Hydrogen. We then hear via Houston (Ed Harris in a genius bit of voice casting) say that the Russians have sent an anti-satellite missile that has inadvertently caused a lot of high speed debris to hurtle towards the shuttle. While this is the inciting incident that kicks the rest of the film into gear, we never see the missile hit the satellite. However, you could interpret the missile and satellite as a sperm and an egg respectively. A sperm and an egg coming together is what causes the chain reaction that leads to a baby being born, just as the missile and the satellite coming together causes the chain reaction that leads to Ryan's rebirth.At the beginning Ryan is actually referred to by her last name, Stone. Like a stone, Ryan is essentially lifeless more or less, oblivious to the wonderful view of Earth and the stars around her. She is only focused on completing the task at hand. It's only later on that she is called by her first name, when the re-birthing process has begun and she has started to become more characterized. Another thing I found intriguing was that there are three main places in the film: the shuttle, the Russian space station, and the Chinese one. They remind me of the three trimesters that make up a human pregnancy, which, when added together equal nine. The film itself is 90 minutes long, which can also be divided up into thirds, or the typical number of acts that make up the story structure of a feature film. Three is also a reference to the Holy Trinity in Christianity although we get an interesting close up shot of a miniature Buddha statue in the Chinese Shenzhou capsule. Take that to mean whatever you want it to (or anything else I write here for that matter). One shot shows Ryan in a fetal position in the Russian station, which is more or less the same position a fetus is in when in it's second trimester. When Ryan has decided to give up and commit suicide, it's like an attempted abortion. Ryan attempts to ""abort"" her own rescue mission after finding out the Soyuz has no fuel. At the end when Ryan finally does make it back to Earth, she has to strip down to her underwear as her space suit is drowning her. She takes her first gasp of air and drags herself out of the water into the earthy mud. Water is an elemental symbol for life and earth is the stuff we all came from originally (if you believe in the bible. I do for one). Ryan then then offers up her first ever prayer, ""Thank you,"" to whatever deity she has now chosen to believe in, then gets to her knees, then to her feet, and then takes her first steps, reborn as a new person, facing a green wilderness of unknown possibilities.<br/><br/>Other thoughts: I enjoyed the references to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Having there be no sound in space, the prevalent breathing sounds of the characters while in their space suits, effectively them fish out of water in the ocean of space. Even the fetal image of Ryan reminded me of the Star Child.<br/><br/>A bit of a reference to Alien with Ryan announcing over the headset that she was the only survivor of her crew, and the fact that she's a woman.<br/><br/>Gravity feels like a companion piece to Children of Men. I'll let you draw your own conclusions as to why.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the score, especially the rising musical Que associated with the menacing debris field. Reminded me of the Joker's theme from The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>I thought it was very silly having Ryan move around with a fire extinguisher. It reminded me of Wall-E.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly like the shot of the satellite burning up in the sky. Looked too much like the Columbia. Just a quibble but it made me cringe a little bit."

","I've been looking forward to this film all year, and decided to see it in 3D for the effects. I consider Sandra Bullock to be a fine actress, but the thing that really got to me was her constant gasping for air - and running out her oxygen.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be a trained astronaut, folks. Basic training should have extensively covered what to do in an emergency, or she never should have been allowed into space! <br/><br/>What I found most unbelievable was she finally gets to 1% oxygen, and then somehow survives at that level for the next TEN MINUTES while moving around and talking. Sorry, but if you're breathing CO2 for that long, I expected her to need resuscitation when she finally made it inside.<br/><br/>The other thing that really got me was her WASTING fuel in the Russian escape vehicle while trying to free the deployed parachute. I was sitting there yelling in my mind, "" Those things do NOT have unlimited fuel, lady!! ""<br/><br/>*spoiler* Shortly after this, she actually gives up and attempts suicide, prompting George Clooney to --come back from the dead-- to kick her ass and get her moving again! At that point, I whispered to my friend, ""I knew it!"" (that he wasn't really there.) */spoiler* <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, theatrically the result is very impressive from an effects standpoint, especially given the limited budget. But the overall experience would have benefited from more editing. After the first half of the film, I was no longer rooting for Stone because she was making one dumb-ass decision after another. *spoiler* And given the preceding events, there was NO WAY she should have survived! */spoiler* It was great to look at, but basically the film violated my suspension of disbelief one too many times."

Congratulations to Alfonso Cuar√≥n and his son Jonas Cuar√≥n on this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Gravity has now not only become my favorite space film, but also my new favorite film in general. What people need to understand is that this is not a film that's meant to have extraordinarily fictious and theoretical views like Interstellar, but instead a realistic and terrifying space film. If you walk into this movie with the correct mindset, then you too will see why this movie is one of a kind."

","The suspense got me because I honestly didn't know what would happen. It didn't occur to me that the only 2 people in the film were Sandra Bullock and George Clooney - it didn't need any more. The outcome was not predetermined and I felt that anything could happen, even at the end. The CGI was obviously very impressive. Having now seen the International Space Station on TV from the perspective of British astronaut Tim Peake, I think I probably got more out of this than if I had seen it beforehand. I knew that if an astronaut is floating in space, they have to grab one of the handles on the outside of the space craft and preferably tether themselves to it. I wasn't surprised to see Russian writing in the Soyuz and that Sandra Bullock's character was not fazed by that - she was trained. I feel that the response of a highly professional scientist to a dire emergency in space was realistic. Even though she was facing death, she remained relatively calm (most of the time). Recently, I have had cancer and faced death myself. The calmness shown in this film is genuine, and believe it or not it is possible to be accepting. I am getting better, by the way.<br/><br/>In summary, I found this movie very exciting, gripping and believable - almost. The disaster may not be realistic, but the human response to it was convincing. I applaud the achievement."

","Summary: Gravity is stressful, well-acted and consistently frightening, despite its thin plot. 94/100 (A-)<br/><br/>The film takes you into a suffocating atmosphere and plays with your mind at times. The visual effects are mind blowing and it does not matter if you watch it on 3D or 2D, the experience is great. It does not have the greatest plot ever, but it is quite curious that a movie does not need to be rich in storyline to be great. Gravity has enough visuals and superb performances to succeed. I watched it with very high expectations and it did not disappoint me. This film definitely deserves its high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic (96/100 and 97% respectively). It was worth the hype. I could not breath during the whole movie and my heart was racing. I almost had a heart attack watching this.<br/><br/>Gravity is undoubtedly the most thrilling film of 2013. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all along. I am calling it now one of the best movies of the year. It did not need a complex storyline or a brainy script to be a good movie. The plot was quite easy to follow and understandable to me. I felt connected with the characters. They are not boring scientists, they are humans, and the dialog between them felt very genuine to me. Moving on, it does not matter if you watch Gravity on a small TV or on your laptop the experience is still great. Damn, I could watch this film like a hundred times and never get bored. I also want to add that the musical score is astonishingly masterful.<br/><br/>On the upside, Gravity is highly entertaining, scary and unforgettable. It has top-notch visual effects, and its final act is neat. Watch it if you have high expectations or if you are a fan of the horror genre, also if you liked some other films from this amazing Mexican director. I am pretty sure that fans from the writer-director Alfonso Cuar√≥n will not be disappointed. On the downside, the plot may seem short for some people, but as I said above, it does not need a vast plot to be an excellent film. In conclusion, Gravity is a terrific piece of work that boasts: the best CGI I have seen in a film, a heartbreaking performance by Sandra Bullock, and an impeccable direction by Cuar√≥n. (A-)"
"mjloedolff","1","3","5","16 November 2015"," Absolutely awful
","You only need half a brain cell to know that this movie is absolutely terrible in every single way. I do not care how many awards Gravity won, it's still a pathetic movie. The acting wasn't even that great. The producers and director probably just threw in a bunch of famous actors and a whole bunch of unrealistic special effects to make it seem that this movie seems good. I was bored out of my skull throughout the movie. I do appreciate movies with little to no action as well as action packed movies. This is a massive slap in the face of everyone who ever made a genuinely good movie. I have no hope for anyone that claims Gravity is any good. I cannot begin to highlight all the errors involved in this film without giving too many spoilers. I highly recommend you don't watch this."

","The major advantage of having much of Gravity being digitally rendered digitally are those gorgeous and frightening long takes, none more impressive than the 17 minute unbroken opening shot. The camera moves with such a deliberate stillness and calming influence reminiscent of 2001, the inflated average shot length unveiling the world of outer space with ease and beauty and a sense of real time. That last element is very crucial in building tension in the foreground of the gorgeous Blue Marble that occupies much of the background in the 90 minutes. Cuar√≥n never relents, whether it's a gracefully silent and serene shot of Stone in a fetal position symbolising a baby in the womb, umbilical cord and all, or through the chaotic barrage of space debris. Lubezki's camera movement is never needlessly dizzying or disorientating, somewhere that many films falter, and that makes it all the more panicked when Price's foreboding and dominant score chimes in. The lack of the necessity to cut is used by Cuar√≥n sparingly and to great effect; midway after surviving the first barrage, Stone discovers the lack of fuel stores in the Soyuz and starts cursing and hitting out in anger, before a well placed cut immediately silences her screams and the score and starts a slow zoom out, re-contextualising the claustrophobia of the spacesuit and the small space-pod within the vast endless swathes of space. <br/><br/>Of course it wouldn't be all possible to empathise without the wonderfully fragile performance of Sandra Bullock. Clooney plays the senior astronaut, the assured and confident voice in the chaos who tries to calm Stone and keep her focused even as all hope seems lost. It's a familiar role for Clooney and he plays it well, perhaps with a little too much ease for one in such a perilous situation, but anyhow Bullock is the stand out here. Her endless little monologue to herself is quiet yet spirited, never feeling like forced exposition. There's great emotion from a thin back-story; my favourite scene of the film involves her quiet contemplation of her imminent death, picking up a tiny strand of humanity through the radio. She finds the non English speaking Aningaaq, and they communicate with the only mutual sound they can, the soft howls of dogs, and find a brief connection via the cry of<br/><br/>There are a few tiny little bumps along the teleological narrative that slightly hurt the overall film. Price's score is imposing and the electronic pulses add much intensity to the silent wastelands of outer space, but are bombastic at times, most notably just before the climatic descent and right after Stone finally reaches land and stands upright for the first time in the film. It's slightly overwhelming and guilty of exaggerating the danger of the scenes at times, although these moments can be papered over unlike in other cases (Interstellar comes to mind). Of course there's also the myriad of plot holes and scientific inaccuracies I'm sure that many fellow IMDb users have listed and complained about endlessly, but those should and must be brushed aside in a film like Gravity. It's a growing symptom of modern film criticism to be easily inclined to refuse to suspend our disbelief and be outraged at a piece of non fiction's lack of complete logically coherence. Despite ourselves living in such a world where people panic and make mistakes, although few will have been in the situation of Stone's. <br/><br/>I've been told that Gravity is a magnificent film to watch on the big screen, and even more of a marvel in 3D. Unfortunately I probably won't ever experience that sort of wonder (3D makes me dizzy) but even on a small screen Cuar√≥n pulls off a spectacle. Despite being 90 minutes long and focused exclusively on a single, linear storyline, it never drags or rushes and paces itself evenly. Gravity is a film simultaneously taunt with both terror and beauty, never relenting on its chaos and frenzy."

","After the testing of an anti-satellite missile goes disastrously wrong; the debris quickly hits other satellites causing a snowball effect as more and more debris is created. This debris is heading at very high speed towards the crew of a US shuttle who are on a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope. When it strikes there are only two survivors; Ryan Stone, a female biomedical engineer on her first mission; and Matt Kowalski, a seasoned astronaut with many missions under his belt. With the shuttle effectively destroyed they must find another way home and understandably the choices are limited. There is a Soyuz module at the nearby International Space Station but that has been damaged in a way that makes re-entry impossible; it may be able to travel to the Chinese space station where there is a similar module but that is a hundred kilometres away.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film with a deep plot and lots of twists then this is not it; once the disaster strikes the only route home is quickly established. That doesn't mean the film is boring though; the action is spectacular as the two survivors struggle at each stage. There are some surprises too but I'll try not to spoil the main one! The cast does a fine job; Sandra Bullock carries the film as Ryan Stone nicely portraying her fear and determination, she is ably supported by George Clooney who plays Kowalski; a smaller part but equally important to the story. The special effects are amazing bringing the viewer right into the action even when watched on a small screen¬Ö although this is the first film I've watched on a television for some time that I thought I would have liked to have seen it in the cinema. The tension is maintained from the moment the disaster strikes right until the end with very few moments when it didn't feel like disaster could strike. Overall a gripping film that I heartily recommend."
"gmonger","3","3","5","31 January 2015"," Gravity is light on dialog too
","This is a visually stunning, spectacularly shot movie about outer space. The special effects are perfect. The movie is about outer space because it sure isn't about any people. The real problem with this movie is that you don't know or care about any of the three characters. Cowboy Joe, who goes tooling around in his space-go-cart, wasting precious fuel, that, gee, you may just need it in case there is an emergency. Then there's Doctor-Science- Annie, who after way too little training, doesn't even belong in outer space, and then there's Abbu, I don't know anything about this guy other than he dances around on his tether like a drunk monkey. I hope to God, NASA isn't really sending anyone up like this. The faulty O-rings are bad enough but with these loose nuts in space, we may have stuff crashing on our heads any minute now. The little you do know about these characters, just annoys you.<br/><br/>It is the type of movie where you imagine there is no script. Seriously. There is no dialog. Unless you consider constant NASA chatter, dialog. It is all procedure and dry and unfortunately very boring. I usually do not do reviews about movies I do not like. But this one got so much hype, I feel I had to counter it to some extent, being this is a vastly overrated movie to the point of being one of the most overrated ever. This movie has great special effects and is, as aforementioned, visually stunning, but all studios larger than a garage do CGI nowadays. All the Jurassic Parks had seamless special effects, that was a decade ago, it is not so special anymore. It is expected. Character development and crisp dialog hold up in any era and this movie has none of that. If you want a gravity less space movie, see this. If you want to actually hear dialog and care about the characters involved, then avoid this one."

"avik-basu1889","10","3","5","9 December 2014"," Spectacular celestial existentialism !!!!
","I have always been a fan of Alfonso Cuar√≥n. Whenever he directs a film, you can rest assured that the movie will not be superficial and will have deeper undertones.<br/><br/>Gravity on the surface is a survival film about two astronauts(Bullock and Clooney) hopelessly stranded in the emptiness of space and their unrelenting attempts at an improbable survival. But it is thematically much deeper. Some people have criticised the film in the context of making errors related to the science of space missions and physics. But I will argue that this is actually not a film about space. The film is about letting go of the past no matter how tough it is to do that and getting reborn and starting your new life in a fresh manner. Some have said that the dialogues in the film are cheesy and a forced attempt to make the viewer have empathy for the characters. But for me, after considering the themes the film is dealing with, it seems those dialogue exchanges were essential and very relevant.<br/><br/>The visuals in Gravity are groundbreaking. The cgi work in the film is probably the best I have ever seen in any film. Cuar√≥n successfully makes the viewer experience the horror of the situation that the characters find themselves in. The camera effortlessly at times seems to glide inside Sandra Bullock's helmet and we are shown what everything looks like from her perspective. The explosions in space are violent and scary,but also inaudible. Along with the larger than life,grand visuals, we also get some calm, serene and surreal imagery which are thematically brilliant. There is a lot of visual symbolism throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is fantastic. This must have been a very challenging role and she knocks it out of the park. Clooney isn't given much to do, but his charm oozes in every scene he is a part of and his role is very important thematically. <br/><br/>Cuar√≥n has made a film that is not only visually marvellous, but also thought provoking. After Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n and Children of Men. Gravity cements his position in my mind as one of the very best directors working today. <br/><br/>On the surface, Gravity is an unforgettable visual spectacle and a thriller in space. But underneath its surface, it is a meditation on existentialism dealing with the challenge of overcoming a traumatic past and having the courage to start a new life."

","I have heard a lot of buzz about this film with its massive success and I must say this film is absolutely superb. This film documents a medical scientist and a retiring astronaut attempting to survive a disaster in space that can bring out new leases on life for at least one of them. Now there are really only two performances in this film from A-listers Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and they both deliver great performances. Bullock really carries the film and she delivers a great performance by making the audience buy into her character and really believe in her situation as she panics like you do. Clooney has a slightly smaller role but is still great with his calm and cool character and it seems Clooney may be hitting his stride again. The story at first could have seemed a bit generic but it really hits home just how severe this situation has become and how it affects Sandra Bullocks characters life. The script was one thing that could have hurt the movie because the dialogue between Bullock and Clooney had to be good because they are the only people in it, and I must say I thought for the fact that it was only them two I thought they did a very good job with the script. But the best part of Gravity and the thing looked at the most is the style of the film, the cinematography of space is fantastic and everything shown including the destruction involved in space just everything about it is fantastic. This film blew me away and coming in at an hour and a half is the right length and is the superb demonstration of space films."
"Wally-217","9","3","5","25 August 2014"," A treat for all the senses.
","As I'm not an expert in any form of physics or aerospace engineering, I can't comment on how ridiculous the plot or plot holes may [ /may not] be. With suspension of disbelief and allowing yourself to accept the movie as realistic, it becomes an intense movie, especially in 3D. I especially appreciate the hard work that goes into creating a film with this level of CGI. The film is beautifully crafted with superb acting and life-like visuals. In 3D you get a better feel for the movie and the audience is transported to the empty vacuum of space with the cast. The movie does, however, require the dedicated attention of the audience at all times; Gravity avoids exposition and instead relies on visual imagery, usually in the form of text seen on dials or displays, to explain what is happening, usually these important details are only on screen for one or two seconds and are very easy to miss if the audience doesn't read them fast enough. This is made even harder in 3D as the text will often have some blur or minor distortion."
"zotwot","8","3","5","22 June 2014"," The Worst Case Scenario
","In many ways this reminded me of the film Wall-E, and not really because of the space link. For most of the film there is hardly any speech and we are stuck with just two characters trying to survive a disaster. This makes it a challenging watch to get into but clearly most people do manage to get through this challenge. <br/><br/>Let's face it, this film is about two things. 1) The visuals. The whole film looks gorgeous, with incredibly real shots of the Earth from space and various space-craft. Perhaps the most clever thing is the fact they managed to nail the views, making it really feel like the astronauts were being flung around helplessly. <br/><br/>2) is the thriller aspect of it. It takes only a few minutes before disaster strikes and the rest of the film is a desperate race for survival. You spend the whole film suffering along with the characters as you will them to survive and it takes until the last 30 seconds before you actually discover if they do or not. <br/><br/>The danger of having it all set in space, the whole film focusing on one event, is that of limited character. There is just about enough time to develop the two leads, especially Sandra Bullock's character. It's just enough to make you care if they survive but actually you realise you still know virtually nothing about them at the end. It is a credit to Sandra Bullock and George Clooney that they make the thinly stretched characters come to life.<br/><br/>The other problem with this is that though it goes for realism, the events that happen are very unlikely. Yes, everything in the film could happen but the likelihood of it all happening at the same time is incredibly slim. It is literally the very worst scenario that could possibly happen in space. <br/><br/>Fortunately though the sheer spectacle and thrill of the film mean you can pretty much see past the few issues. A tense but enjoyable watch."

","If you can switch off your common sense and just look at the visuals then you can maybe massively enjoy this adventure, preferably on a big screen. 3D was nice too.<br/><br/>But it made me kind of sad that it wasn't remotely believable. People tend to think ""it's only a movie, take it for what it is"". Yes, but even Star Wars needs to be believable within its own universe, and it is! Even James Bond, most of the time. A movie like Gravity cannot take short cuts on the laws of physics.<br/><br/>To illustrate my point: My 10 year old son pointed out to me halfway through what I had noticed all the way, that things didn't make sense. Minor SPOILER to follow: Like when Clooney and Bullock is hanging by some wires like there are gravity involved or like they are dragged behind the space station in motion. Eh? One of them even bouncing back and the other ""falling"", or was that wind because they were too close to the atmosphere? It sure didn't look that way. If the idea here was to develop the story then there are so many ways it could be done so much more believable. It's like the film makers think ""sure they wont notice"". Well we do.<br/><br/>I gave it 6/10 just because of the visuals and the overall feeling, drifting around in orbit, despite awful dialog, despite Bullock and the physics going mentally insane."
"HaveWisdomWillTravel","6","3","5","28 April 2014"," A Visual Feast and An Insult to Real Astronauts
","What this movie is really trying to say...<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is very fit for her age. George Clooney is so cool in a spacesuit. We deserve to win awards because we care about realism in this science fiction. We did this and that research and training with real space professionals etc.<br/><br/>What this movie ended up saying...<br/><br/>Hollywood has its own idea of scientific realism. George Cloony looks old even in a cool spacesuit. <br/><br/>Oh, and, there's crazy amount of space junk up there - which will one day come back to bite all of us down here. All it takes is a meteor, or an X-flare, and a chain reaction. When that happens all a space technician could do? <br/><br/>Panting and spinning uncontrollably in space.<br/><br/>The disasters on the ground produced by this kind of massive space junk apocalypse event will likely kill more people on the ground. Yet we are to focus on one very important haplessly spinning space-walker who could barely save her own very fit physique.<br/><br/>Panting uncontrollably - every step of the way and even after being repeatedly told to calm down and to conserve energy - consumes already dwindling oxygen supply, and shows how untrained, ill-disciplined and unprofessional the astronaut is (and how lazy the writer/ director/ actors are) <br/><br/>Lead character is apparently a certified emotionally-unstable and technically-mediocre, panicky, random-button-pushing astronaut. Still given the job. What an insult to real astronauts.<br/><br/>At least 40-something Bullock tried her best to look 35 and succeeded. 100% silver hair and nonathletic Clooney looks completely his post-menopausal age, and by any account should not be in a spacesuit, nor strutting about some expensive space station low on insulin supply. Another insult to real younger, taller, fitter than athletes astronauts.<br/><br/>Which brings us to another possibly unintended effect...<br/><br/>China looks like the real space master. Not sure if that's already true in reality. But unlike this ""realistic"" Bullock astronaut, Chinese astronauts would likely read Russian buttons, or at least breathe calmly, and take more calculated risk when in doubt. China certainly won't send a charming but aging male out there and risk their billion dollar investments.<br/><br/>And the plot...<br/><br/>What plot? There is no plot to give away. Just lots of spinning above glorious earth, hyper-diligent space station cockpit shots, panic damsel panting audio, and Bullock's super fit body parts on display.<br/><br/>Scientifically, 'Gravity' is one of the worst ""insult to real professionals"" offender of this decade, especially given the stellar budget and the ""we care about realism"" hype. Just admit it is a blatant Bullock star vehicle and stop elevating it to some hard science fiction pedestal.<br/><br/>And because it is more about ""making Bullock like-able"", it became less about character realism. Apparently female astronaut still needs to pant in damsel in distress style to elicit audience sympathy and to seek daddy figure reassurance just so that she could function coherently. A weak-minded, vulnerable, unfocused female leading character is not my idea of female hero, but designed to be appealing to the Bullock fan crowd. Another annoyance throughout this film for me.<br/><br/>Still, even with all of the above, the movie managed to entertain me due to one single factor: the setting. I just happen to like geographic or space documentary. The movie should be called ""Above Earth"".<br/><br/>Aiming straight at Bullock and Clooney fan club. Watchable for non-science buffs. Will likely annoy hard science fiction fans."

I take the general theme of the film to be about walking through the fire, taking strength from adversity.<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue is corny. But that's not why you watch this film.

Then the cinematic trailer came with a bang, and it did give me chills. A space tragedy it is.<br/><br/>I've got the chance to watch the film on IMAX 3D which expressed the film two times excitement and 3 times realistic feel. Alfonso Cuar√≥n's stellar movie about a tragic event happened in space, which stars two Academy Awards hall of famers; Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality) and George Clooney (The Descendants) in the attempts to escape the cosmic wilderness caused by an unforeseen chain of satellite misfortunes.<br/><br/>I was blown away by how difficult it was to create because of the accurate/perfected movement from things to the actors themselves. How detailed it was in the creative process. The depth of the movie was out of bounds affecting; which will give you the empathy of what it's like in space plus a tragedy.<br/><br/>I loved Bullock's performance! Her magnificent charm to channel fear and hopelessness in the movie was transparent. I root for her in the Academy next year for her stunning performance.<br/><br/>I love how fear and breathlessness came about, and due to that fact: for me, the infinite intergalactic scenery made me feel claustrophobic with limited bodily actions that make it feel heavy yet perfectly portrayed.<br/><br/>I also noticed the amazing cinematography Cuar√≥n did. The angular modifications in perfect rotations especially on the scene where Dr. Ryan (Bullock) entered the shuttle and took off her suit then slept floating with the sun glimmering behind the transparent glass with the CGI tubes making her look like a big fetus. BRAVO to that!<br/><br/>The whole film was a mixture of struggle and art (story and cinematography play). I enjoyed watching every bit of the film, although the film was just a simple here and there; a struggle to survive, but the difficulty, style and portrayal were the winner of it all.<br/><br/>Review is seen on One Setting at a Time http://onesettingatatime.com/2013/10/11/gravity-2013-movie-review/"

Let her get herself back to Earth ‚Äì with a little help from George Clooney, of course.<br/><br/>The film's pure and uninterrupted structure gives it power and allows Sandra Bullock as Dr Ryan Stone to dominate our emotions for 89-90 minutes.<br/><br/>The film doesn't only operate as a thrilling actioner. There's a quiet symbolism of birth ‚Äì or rather emotional rebirth ‚Äì in the umbilical tether between Stone and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and in the beautiful image of Stone rotating in a near-foetal position inside the International Space Station. Comparisons to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey come to mind. And of course, I saw a strong influence from the character of Ripley in Alien in Dr Ryan Stone.<br/><br/>The opening shot ‚Äì a single and unbroken 12-minute shot ‚Äì is also a directing feat. It's amazing to think they whole thing was blue-screened."

","With the only introduction of some uncomforting music, the viewer get's thrown into space and the theme for the rest of the movie is set immediately. 2 people are doing maintenance on a shuttle, Ryan (Sandra Bullock and Matt (George Clooney) and you know they are not going to have an easy time in space. Ryan is a conflicted woman and it looks like she is literally trying to escape her problems by being in space. Only to find way more trouble up there forcing her to face herself. <br/><br/>It's amazing to see planet earth from a distance in the background during almost the entire time and it's an remarkable achievement how they manage to recreate space. The fact that almost everything take's place in there make's this film even more fascinating. <br/><br/>Of course the idea of astronauts¬† in space getting in trouble definitely isn't a new thing for horror/science fiction movies but the way Alfonso(director) handles this subject is really refreshing. This is because although this film is labeled as Science-fiction, there isn't really something futuristic in it and Alfonso tried to keep it real and personal in terms of the story and thank god there aren't aliens showing up all of a sudden. Let's be honest, the idea of being stuck in space is already horrifying enough on itself. Especially because it's so dangerous and yet we still know so little about it.<br/><br/>The film really plays out like a kind of horror movie because in the end¬† it's all about escaping death and trying to survive. It sucks you in from the start and doesn't let you go until the titles roll 80 minutes later. This is also mainly because of the marvelous presentation. This kind of movie magic¬† is really rare to happen I personally think and i haven't seen it for a long time in a big Hollywood production. The last time was with Christopher Nolan's Inception.¬† It really depends on having an talented director with his own vision and giving him a large amount of money to play with. Of course this has been going wrong a lot of times but once in a time you have a director who is able to do something special with it. He really creates a fascinating setting and uses the budget to enforce the experience instead of using special effects only for the wow factor. This is a thing which is to be seen in a painfully lot of big budget Hollywood movies. <br/><br/>There's only one small drawback for me in this movie and that are the actors. Sandra bullock does a descent job portraying an woman alone in space trying to survive and George Clooney is playing the charming guy as always. It's just that for me, this movie would be way more believable if I didn't have to look at actors i've seen an dozen times before, but instead just some unfamiliar faces who could be anyone. Of course it ain't a big problem because¬† you have to link famous names to an big production. This movie really is an new landmark in Hollywood after inception, creating something special with large amounts of money instead of making an special effect show-reel out of it."
"Wirxaw","5","3","5","8 March 2014"," Another marketing fake
","Let's start off directly - critically acclaimed with 8.2 rating. Since I can't vouch for mental credibility of critics, I can vouch that they have been properly paid, just like for other big titles.<br/><br/>Now a bit more detail. Movie isn't bad. There can be worse, certainly. Movie has visuals, some music, some acting, some plot. If watching this is not an expense to you - it's worth it. However, there is nothing to expect from this movie. Absolutely.<br/><br/>The only possible positive thing about this movie is the atmosphere. Duh, a movie about atmosphere has atmosphere! Well, better than the opposite. To some it may be boring and redundant, but I can more or less understand the purpose of depicting how helpless a person is in open space. This is the catch of the movie, and it is achieved. At this point the movie COULD in fact have 7-8 rating. But...<br/><br/>The amount of stupidity in this movie can only be competing against Promotheos. How did this specialist get in space? Last time I checked, space program isn't some university teaching. You can't just be an ""expert"" or ""specialist"". Unless all of that is an urban myth, only people with perfect health\physical condition, mental stability proved by multiple tests and extreme perception are allowed to actually go there. And that is regardless of your ""role"". And it is for the very reason that things that are shown in the movie - do NOT end like they did. What do we see? Well, mentally unstable, physically slender ""expert"", who has issues in basic centrifuge situation(and that IS one of the tests). Oh, and I hope this isn't much of a spoiler, but apparently she also has never succeeded in emergency simulations. We are supposed to believe that she was allowed up there... On top of that - the dialogues are very plain. The whole movie can be summed down to protagonist whining and being babysat by her officer in charge. Twice in the movie the protagonist stays on the brink of death... for unnaturally long time. Let's put it this way. Over the course of 10 minutes, the Oxygen amount has been reduced from ~10% to 1%. In the next ~15 minutes of active talking, breath and moving - this 1% is as good as full. Seriously, no. Just no. And, of course, there is one decompression scene that is worse than Ripley in Aliens.<br/><br/>If you are a visual fa.. fan - you will probably award it 7-9, as you'd do to any other CGI motion picture. If you are a scientific person... well, you will be offended. Totally. This is probably not the safe movie to watch."

One of the best representations of Space in the history of cinematography further enriched with long uninterrupted shots (the opening shot lasts some 20 minutes!), complementary ''auditive landscapes'' and monumental pictures which create an outstanding experience. Despite some clich√©d situations in the scenario, the bare fact that the actress is the central figure for the most part of the film, that there is no a forcibly imposed love story, without an excess of pathos, additional characters and explosions..., we can conclude that it's a miracle that such a CG film has happened in nowadays Hollywood."

For ninety harrowing, white-knuckled minutes you're tethered to Sandra Bullock's character as she fights for survival in the cold, black vacuum of space.<br/><br/>But the movie is more than just F/X wizardry. The performances by Bullock and co-star George Clooney anchor the story and give it a beating, human heart. It does get a little sentimental and existential in the final act, but I forgave this because it felt earned.<br/><br/>Like 'Avatar' before it, 'Gravity' is bound to be one of the seminal sci-fi movies of the early 21st century."

","By definition, Gravity is a technical wonder. All of the details were meticulously orchestrated by Alfonso Cuaron in a very masterful way. Given the incredible work that was put into this part of the film, it's quite understandable that the story is a bit overshadowed, at least in my estimation. It's not a bad story by any means and the fight for survival is always an interesting enough subject to portray in cinema, especially when you take into account the complications that our leading star goes through. Still it fails to impress when compared to some more complex stories at this year's Oscars. As far as other aspects go I must say that Sandra Bullock handles her role very well as she brings a lot of intensity throughout the entire 90 minutes of the movie. Much like Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years A Slave, although in different circumstances, Bullock is the central focus of the movie and therefore must be very convincing. There are mostly two aspects that I'd like to highlight in the movie. The first is the amazing job Alfonso Cuaron did directing the film. You could really tell this was a passion project and the end result was something quite outstanding. On the other hand though, one can't be a little turned off by the simplistic story of survival in outer space, one that while well constructed, ultimately fails to capture the dark yet beautiful magic of the world that is Gravity.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"
"troy-manatunga","5","3","5","16 February 2014"," Ain't that Great!
","Contains Spoilers! 10 nominations for the big showdown at the Academy Awards in 2014 GRAVITY deserves them all but one. The idea of having this movie nominated for the category of the Best Motion Picture of the Year is clearly overrating this motion picture. This movie is great but not that good to stand alongside all the other titles that have made the nomination cut. Maybe the concept of ""Life in space is impossible"" was an intriguing theme to many a viewer that this movie clearly has made it to the top. This was all that I was thinking the entire 91 minutes; I mean the movie was great ¬Ö but come on!! This ain't Oscar Nominee material. Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), Mission Commander Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Sharif (Phaldut Sharma) for some reason is outside their space ship trying to rectify a matter which is absolutely irrelevant to the plot when they are caught in the middle of a astro-debris shower which destroy the spaceship they were on killing all its crew except Ryan and Matt (What a surprise- Now I didn't see that coming). Floating in space without any clue as to where she is Ryan cries for help only to be rescued by Matt and his jetpack. Matt and Ryan make their way to the ISS (International Space Station) which conveniently happens to be just there, with the hopes of finding a ship to use for reentry back into earth. With all hopes lost they look out and see the Chinese Space Station (How Convenient again!!!) but only one survives the journey. I expected much more. Having won the Golden Globe for Best Director I was actually hoping to see a LIFE OF PI experience. Alfonso Cuaron just did not get through to me. Don't get me wrong. The motion picture is great and I enjoyed the uniqueness and subtle intensity and brilliant acting, but having watched movies such as DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, 12 YEARS A SLAVE, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS & American HUSTLE I went in expecting big things. I walked off disappointed merely since I set the bar too high myself. Oscar Winner Sandra Bullock once again has backed the right pony with the script. Evolving entirely around her and only her she is magnificent. I must say that if for one moment she faltered I would have fallen asleep. She kept the pace. She built the intensity, she juggled between hope and faith, she pulled out all stops and she was fantastic. Sandra Bullock has been nominated for the category Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role but it's highly unlikely that she would bring home the gold a few weeks from now. What she does though I doubt anyone could have done better. She is the ideal candidate for the role. It's hard to even picture another actress to be put in that spot and still turn up a performance of this caliber. This truly is a display of talent. As for George Clooney; it's not even a role, to me he is just background noise and a face for publicity. VERDICT Class A acting by Sandra Bullock. She will make you feel the fear and Pain. Breathtaking Visual Effects and Film Editing. Too predictable at every turn.

But it holds in it several physics ergo holds many plot failures that make it improbable and plain simple... leaving alone the script. In the acting department everyone makes a fine job showing you how scary space can be; especially if you haven't experienced space that much. It certainly is Sandra Bullock's best work.

"goodkingbob-914-59592","10","3","5","3 February 2014"," Hope And Spirituality In Space.
","Here are my thoughts on why GRAVITY is a unique masterpiece and a moving spiritual journey.<br/><br/>The caption on the screen 'Life in space is impossible', immediately captured my attention that what I was about to witness was something beyond my imagination and something truly impossible. What I am going to write about here is not about the acting or technical aspects of the movie. I can rest assure your minds that this movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron is simply breathtaking, masterfully directed and so well done that I am already seeing Alfonso Cuaron on stage holding his Oscar for best director in next year's Oscar Ceremony. Yes it's THAT good.<br/><br/>But what I want to write about here is how Gravity is such an incredible spiritual moving movie. Upon seeing the preview you might get the impression that this is a 90 minute space movie with the two main stars either screaming or hitting metal when disaster strikes. Gravity is so much deeper than that! Gravity is an experience that draws us in and never let's go of our senses even after the final closing credits role. It's such a powerful experience of a movie that you will exit the cinema, carry on your daily duties, go to sleep and wake up the next day still feeling that what you have just witnessed yesterday gives you hope to overcome your daily problems as if life in space is impossible, life on earth IS possible.<br/><br/>Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is faced with the danger of dying. Death is hanging over head, she is waiting to die. There is NO hope. It's pitch black, she is alone, there is no communication. Her partner is nowhere to be seen. This is the setup we are pulled in, we cannot not notice what she is going through. We are witnessing all this sitting comfortably with our 3D glasses on, but our mind is right there with her, feeling exactly what she is witnessing. It's in front of our eyes but there is nothing we can actually do...but hope that she survives this..<br/><br/>There is where the movie excels, this is the moment were Stone's character will surpass all that is impossible in space and make it possible.<br/><br/>We have two choices, we either give up or stand up and turn the word impossible to I'm possible.<br/><br/>Gravity does not force us to believe in God, but what Gravity does, is show us that the human spirit longs for something more higher and more powerful when faced with death and danger. In a striking scene we hear Stone desperately trying to pray, she says I don't know how to pray as no one ever taught me how. This is an amazing moment and a moment that we wish to reach out to stone and comfort her. As I have said Alfonso Cuaron leaves the religious aspect open, one time we see a picture of St Christopher carrying Baby Jesus, our minds seeing this picture cannot but force us to look up to a Higher force that we need someone right NOW to carry us through this dark moment. In another scene Stone sees a small statue of a Buddha. These two religious icons we see actually seem to set Stone's spirit to fully awaken. We learn that stone has suffered a lot and was very depressed on the loss of her child. This is the flashback moment, the pitch black moment were our spirit feels that we have nothing to live for anymore, there is nobody to hear our plea, we are clinging on to nothing....but we must seek the small light of hope and most importantly now... faith... whatever you believe, your spirit cannot give up on faith and hope.<br/><br/>The Buddha icon we see may very well represent that Stone will be re-born again if she allows her spirit to awaken in this final moment between life and death....<br/><br/>Gravity must be fully experienced on the largest screen, and if possible in 3D. Enjoy the special effects as they are truly mind blowing, but I also hope that you let the movie take you to a place where you can examine your life, and upon exiting the cinema you feel that nothing in this world is impossible if you let that small light inside of you shine."

","After all the hype and expectation it's time to bring Gravity back down to earth. Yes it is a spectacular film and a crime not to watch it in 3D on a big screen but even though I did, Gravity was still missing something. <br/><br/>At the start you are in awe of the wonderful visual effects and feeling of space, once you dive into the story though you find yourself wondering why you don't care more about Sandra Bullock's character Ryan Stone, and Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney. Don't get me wrong, Gravity does stay away from another silly Hollywood space film but in the end the script is just not strong enough. <br/><br/>Everyone raved about the performances in this film but really Clooney re-plays his cocky, smug character and Bullock spends most of the film panicking.

","Well where to start, Gravity in my opinion is the most overrated movie of the year. The special effect don't get me wrong are great if you like that sort of thing, however I feel all they do is hide the mediocre script and the boring storyline. My first problem is that the film feels slow and lacks the real edge to grab you off the edge of your seat, some would argue that it does this however I just felt that I never really got in to the story line and why anything was actually happening. Clooney plays his character very well and this is one of the few areas this works well. Bullock on the other hand lacks any real heroism in my opinion and I feel that I never really actually cared about whether she survived or not. I know this may sound harsh but if you compare gravity to Apollo 13 a very similar type of film then in Apollo 13 I actually felt connected to the characters unlike in gravity where they just seem a touch boring. However I must stress this, I did not aviator or life of pi for this exact same reason. All in all I thought it was pretty average but I do recommend going to see it because the special effects which are first class."

However in gravity the visuals are truly breathtaking, in fact some of the best parts of the film are the establishing shots of the earth which are truly stunning. The visuals are clearly at the forefront of this film from the outset with the acting and plot taking a back seat, however if you had worries that the plot simply consisted of Sandra Bullock floating around in space for an hour and a half it is far from that with some truly epic space disaster scenes, in which the 3D is used yet even more effectively.<br/><br/>A must watch if only to see how 3D should be done."

Instead the 3D is used incredibly well to illustrate depth and space in a way that is seminal. Seriously, no other film has ever made you appreciate or experience space like this as well for so long, it kind of harks back to the impact that 2001 must have had on its release.<br/><br/>It is very much a lesson in how to use 3D properly, and some of the views are beautifully done. 3D really needed a shot in the arm, and this film has even led to arch critics of 3D (such as Mark Kermode of the BBC) to accept that this film is a game-changer.<br/><br/>The story is almost theatre, as it really only involves two people. Yet it works perfectly. The acting is exceptional in this 'disaster' movie as our leads try to get to safety after their space walk all goes terribly wrong. The story is good and the action wonderful and believable, a lot of tension in this and you'll be on th edge of your seat.<br/><br/>I can see this film leading the charges for awards in time.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this highly enough, easily for me the best film of the year."

","Wow. <br/><br/>Director Alfonso Cuaron's has really made the use of 3D into powerful theatrical tool. This picture will really lose something crucial when viewed in 2D at home. <br/><br/>Obviously the film is entirely CGI'd, but from the opening scene Cuaron's use of the camera gives a sense of disorientation to the viewer. The camera pans in and out and around the space station, whizzing past the characters at odd angles. It really gives a sense of being in space, where things float by and dart around with uncontrollable trajectories. The film is a total immersion into the vastness and unpredictability of space. <br/><br/>It is a great performance by Sandra Bullock, who is largely the only person on camera throughout the film. Clooney, although billed as a joint lead, is not really in the movie after the half-way point. Bullock gives a very convincing account of the terror, panic, resignation and determination of Dr Stone - which is effectively displayed in various points via a concentration on the character's breathing. The real co star in the film is Cuaron's CGI background which is equally breathtaking. <br/><br/>The plot is good but it does leave the viewer with a feeling of ""oh what next?!"" when things continue to go wrong, although this just builds up the intensity. The film is only 90 mins long so the action is really packed into a short timescale which adds to the anxiety it leaves on the audience. <br/><br/>This film was all about the spectacle for me. The disorientation of the camera work and the eerie silences really conveyed the solitude of space throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Cuaron has raised the bar."

Well, this idea has been around for a while, but the technology has only recently been sufficiently advanced to enable Alfonso Cuaron to commit his concept to celluloid (or the digital equivalent).<br/><br/>Space has never been so realistically depicted, and the the meaning of the title - or, specifically, its absence - is conveyed in a stunning unbroken 13-minute opening shot in which the camera joins George Clooney's Kowalski in roaming, unfettered, in three dimensions as the scenario is set up and the first disaster occurs. Saving only a couple of moments where I wasn't sure that Newton's laws meant that things would move exactly like that, the visuals are flawless, and it is mind-boggling to consider the thinking process involved in visualising such a sequence.<br/><br/>Even taking for granted the visual perfection where one cannot tell what is digital and what is physical, one then has to factor in a simple story where the pace and intensity never lets up, and an astonishing performance, both emotional and physical, from Sandra Bullock as the initially not-very-likable Dr Stone.<br/><br/>This film is must-see stuff, a visceral experience which benefits enormously from 3D."
"joshh2007","9","3","5","14 November 2013"," It's like nothing I've ever watched
","I walked into this picture not knowing what to expect. On the one hand I'd seen the trailer which truly whet my appetite. On the other I'd heard various critiques from people saying the film was boring/unrealistic. <br/><br/>Well let's just say it leaned towards the first hand for me. From the opening scene you realise how beautiful this film is going to be as the camera pans round Earth in the background. I hate the use of 3D in films, the glasses annoy me, it's more expensive, and most of the time its completely unnecessary. Not in this film. The 3D is used in a way which literally means you feel like part of the film. <br/><br/>In the main I'd say the majority of the attraction to this film would be for the way it's shot and the excellent use of 3D. That's not to discount the story though. <br/><br/>I've heard/read a lot of people doubting the believability of what happens, well don't listen to them. Don't get me wrong most of the time I'm a stickler for believability but not here. I don't profess to know anything about the physics of space, the general layout of space, or if what Ryan does up there is truly possible. Neither do I have any idea about the inside of a spacecraft or whether there are similarities between say, the Russian and Chinese(which doesn't yet exist) escape pods. So why question it? Miracles happen on Earth every now and again comparable to her feat. In any case I'd rather watch what was set out before me than for instance, Ryan and the rest of the crew being killed in the initial debris hit. Boom, ten minutes, film over. <br/><br/>On to the story. From the very opening scene the tension starts to build and doesn't cease until the final minutes of the film. I don't want to give anything away so I won't go into it but every time you begin to feel comfortable this film throws another curve ball at you. It's also emotionally powerful, in one scene Ryan breaks down and begins to hallucinate. Then using her vision as motivation to continue and fight on. You've got the whole package here, action, drama and something for everybody in general. In fact there is only one criticism I'd direct at the film and that is the comparatively thin storyline, why the hell is she actually up there!!!!<br/><br/>If I put the experience into one sentence that sentence would be, 'It's like nothing I've ever watched'. In my eyes a very apt title for this review. All in all it's a unique cinematic experience I'd recommend to anybody."

Some of the shots of Outer Space were simply breath-taking , and it was easy to live the drama alongside the two Actors . Bullock is fantastic . You can really believe in her character . Clooney has a few of the best lines , and basically plays himself...but gives a decent supporting performance . No doubt there were a few holes in the plot...but nonetheless...surely one of the top films this year . Im not sure its quite up there alongside 2001 , as it isn't the sort of film where you need to ""think"" . Its more pure escapism , where the increasing tension is more important than the actual story ."

","Gravity is a tremendous experience. I can't say if this comes closest to experiencing space without being there, because: first, I haven't been there and second, this is the only space-themed 3D movie I have watched.<br/><br/>Having said that, Gravity sure is ""one hell of a ride"". After a brief lull in a space station in the few minutes initially, all havoc breaks loose and people in space suits are flying all over the place, er space, untethered and unanswered. It is as panicky as Alien, although in Gravity, it is just the vagaries of space itself which prove sufficiently hazardous, rather than another class of organisms to add to the terror. Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, created four decades back, was a masterpiece for both the realistic depictions and the taut treatment. Gravity scores high on both these counts. The situation is fraught with danger and with at least one of the two primary protagonists lacking the steel for an unexceptional situation of a dreary death mid-space, the tension in the vacuum on the screen is palpable in the theatre air.<br/><br/>The visuals are fascinating, with enough time to savour the unparalleled ""view"", as a protagonist calls it. And this is a beautiful achievement of the film ‚Äì slowing the pace down amidst the frenzy for the viewer to lose himself/ herself, albeit briefly, in the vast arena and literally out-of-the-world scenes.<br/><br/>Despite all its splendour, it would be interesting to see if Gravity can make it to the ""great"" bracket from the ""good"" which it certainly deserves. I have my doubts because, in spite of the brilliant effects and credible performances by the two leading actors, Gravity misses the extra bit that is required to make the transition. In terms of outer space dramas, 2001 is the all-time great which is a benchmark for its genre. Gravity, 45 years since that film, does not really take that experience to the next level. 2001 created an eerie atmosphere, a strange uneasiness. Gravity does not match that. In terms of creating an atmosphere of terror, it is closer to the Alien and Prometheus category but then again, fails to match the tremendous panic and suspense of those. In terms of a human drama and its ""jailbreak"" theme, The Shawshank Redemption is again the seminal work, and the famous climax of that masterpiece almost gets a tribute in a similar climax here. But somehow, though this ""escape"" was certainly way bigger in scale, the drama of Shawshank was goosebumps-inducing. In Gravity, it merely lifts the film from a sci-fi thriller to a drama.<br/><br/>In all, Gravity is definitely a treat to watch and an enjoyable movie. Though not astoundingly moving or possessing the power to shake the viewer, it deserves to be watched for its spectacular visuals alone."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","5","2 November 2013"," An experience of a film unlike any other
","We waited long enough to see what Alfonso Cuaron had in store for us next, but no one expected a visual effects game-changer. ""Gravity"" is an experience, something you might expect to see at a science museum in IMAX but with an intense plot. And even though its minuscule cast and real-time feel expose it to plot holes and improbabilities, it is truly something to behold.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock stars as Dr. Ryan Stone, a genius engineer on a mission to update the Hubble Space Telescope with a crew of veteran astronauts, including Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), on his late mission before retirement. When a Russian missile strike on a satellite goes awry, it causes a field of debris to come flying at their shuttle, but before they can entirely abort the mission, the shuttle is obliterated and Kowalski and Stone are sent hurtling into space with little chance of survival.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" shares qualities with both disaster films and sci-fi space opuses. In the context of outer space, Cuaron's long takes are reminiscent of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but ""Gravity"" is less intellectual and more of a survival tale with poetic aspects. It consists of a range of tones, from intense to reflective, from claustrophobic to vast and empty ‚Äî all within a 90-minute run time. You'll feel this movie in your bones after you get up.<br/><br/>No matter how you feel about ""Gravity,"" taking the time to consider how the film was made will turn any opinions into total admiration. Although none of us can truly relate to the physics of space, creating a movie in which gravity does not exist (notice the poetic irony of the title?) has to be considered a hell of a feat. And Cuaron doesn't just make a movie set in space, he insists on making it feel as though it were filmed in space. He tries just about everything with the camera, from shots inside Stone's helmet to seemingly endless tracking shots. Pulling this off with as much authenticity as he appears to have, is worth nothing short of a high commendation.<br/><br/>The lack of characters in ""Gravity"" puts a lot of pressure on Bullock and Clooney to be interesting enough to capture our attention. Bullock's constant panic is painful, but in doing so she maintains the film's adrenaline rush, and her humanity wins enough sympathy to make the quest for survival at the heart of the story work. Without a strong performance here, ""Gravity"" would in fact slowly drift into obscurity; she provides a vested interest in the outcome of the disaster.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" contains very few traditional storytelling devices. Only the sequence of events has a Hollywood feel to it in that it's rather contrived; there's no way Stone manages to come out unscathed during various debris showers, for example. Moments of disbelief will crop up all over ""Gravity,"" so when you add in the slower, imagery-driven moments along with some dialogue that's squeezed in so that we get to know Stone a bit, it's a surprise that the reaction to ""Gravity"" has been so universally strong.<br/><br/>Without question, ""Gravity"" demonstrates what 3D filmmaking is supposed to look like and be used for, and should set the bar for filmmakers aspiring to use it. Considering Cuaron directs the film to be an immersive experience, the 3D magnifies this effect to a considerable degree. Few films have conveyed the ""experience"" of a movie the way ""Gravity"" has, an accomplishment that makes fretting over the script contrivances feel like a petty waste of time that totally misses the point. ""Gravity"" will long be remembered as a defining example of the history and development of filmmaking in the 3D era.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"juliette-lobert","9","3","5","2 November 2013"," A movie to see on big screens, for sure.
","Gravity is the masterpiece everybody promised me. We're immersed in space after the first minutes, through incredible technological qualities. We discover at first some friendly characters, whom gradually become more and more human, to slowly get into the skin of the character of Sandra Bullock. We're receiving her feelings, her fears, we understand her reactions. The fact that there is no pause or flash-back in the movie is revolutionary. Some scenes are extremely long... that's what Cuar√≤n wanted. It gives more realism to the situations and let us time to understand the psychological aspects.<br/><br/>And finally a movie reconciling me with 3D ! Without doing too much with unnecessary effects, there is just what we need to fulfill the function that 3D should fulfill in every movie : feel ourselves further into a movie.<br/><br/>That being said, I can't wait to see Gravity at home, and feel a little bit nervous about what it'll be on a small screen..."

","Alfonso Cuar√≥n has done it again... We have seen thrills in water, we have experienced chills in snow and air.. Now you will be at the edge of your seat when you see Sandra Bullock drifting in space.. Gravity is a movie about Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock)... One is an astronaut and the other an engineer working for NASA.. The excitement starts right from the word go where we see Matt spacewalking...Soon the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston confirms that Space debris from a Russian satellite has caused a chain reaction of destruction and they were instructed to abort the mission...The debris struck them before they could take any action killing all the crew members except Matt and Ryan.. Ryan was drifting in the space when Matt rescued her and tethered her to him so that they can move together...While they were moving the oxygen level of Ryan was decreasing..They planned to go the ISS (International Space Station).. In the way we get to know that Ryan's daughter died in an accident and Matt motivating her that they would survive..As they approached ISS they see that the crew has already left it with the Soyuz..Matt suggests that they could use the remaining Soyuz to go to the Chinese space station and use their Soyuz to go back to Earth.. While they were approaching the ISS the debris storm strikes again where Matt had to sacrifice himself to save Ryan... Ryan goes to the Chinese station after a lot of hick ups and manages to survive and return back to Earth.. As the movie progresses the excitement increases.. Brilliantly shot movie with a power packed performance by Sandra Bullock..Great camera work to show incredible pictures of earth at night and the sunrise.. Alfonso Cuar√≥n's direction has proved gold in the past..He has shown the ultimate road trip(Y tu mama tambien), the fantasy world of Harry Potter (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) and a brilliant science fiction (Children of Men).. Don't watch this movie in DVD or download it.. Go to a theater, get a 3D glass and experience space.. Where 2001: A Space Odyssey talked about evolution... I think Stanley Kubrick had the power to see the future and he saw Gravity coming..."

","Don't believe the haters , I went to this based on good press & intrigue & was so pleasantly surprised I had to write a review. When a film doesn't have many characters in it you know that it wont be long , it has to look good & it may not work. Moon with Sam Rockwell works , for me 127 hours doesn't , this sure does. From the opening sequence it takes you on a breathtakingly stunning visual journey . I would strongly strongly recommend seeing in 3d & I am not normally a fan of this , I wish I could have seen on i max I am sure that's even better. Nothing looks CGI although it obviously is , you have a clear idea of what may happen to the central characters but that doesn't stop you being dragged repeatedly to the edge of your seat. Clooney is Clooney , but Sandra Bullock holds the screen effectively throughout , but what surpasses both is the visual impact,give yourself a treat for the eyes go see."

","This is probably the best space sci-fi movie ever made.. It was so hard to grasp any mistakes at all, i Couldn't find any.

The 3D effects of the movie were amazing, especially the re-entry scene.<br/><br/>Its not just a must watch, it would be a shame to miss this movie. Acting by all of them were great, the sound effects were amazing and the movie was perfect in terms of filming and direction. This would be the best movie of 2013 for me, surely an Oscar deserving one..<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, just go and watch it. I'm looking forward to watching it again this week..."
"TheSquiss","10","3","5","23 October 2013"," Wow! Just, wow!
","Wow! Just, wow! <br/><br/>Let's deal with the negative aspects of Gravity first, which are few and almost negligible: I was forced into seeing Gravity in 3D. It wouldn't have been my choice but that was the format of the screening. There are one or two cheep shots (bolts flying into the face) that are nothing more than gimmickry but, to counteract my criticism, I haven't seen 3D work this well since Hugo or witnessed the impressive depth of field afforded by 3D since Avatar. Secondly, George Clooney coasts along in a Doug Ross performance that blends sincerity with a jokey bedside manner. However, it works. Gravity isn't a movie of Oscar-winning performances (though watch out for the nominations and the clean up at the technical Oscars) but of spectacle.<br/><br/>Astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final space shuttle mission, onboard Explorer, accompanied by debutant Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). During a standard spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, they are struck by debris travelling at great speed, destroying the shuttle and leaving them spinning in space.<br/><br/>After watching the trailer, I had two thoughts: 1. The trailer gave away the entire film and 2. How the heck could co-writer/director Alfonso Cuar√≥n fill 91 minutes with two people floating in the great beyond? It took approximately two minutes to forget my fears and marvel at his achievements.<br/><br/>Stunning, amazing, fantastic, superb, beautiful. Pick your superlative. All are apt. Gravity is a ridiculously tense film that had me close to tears at one point and frequently pushing my feet hard against the floor in a vain attempt to help the astronauts survive. Grab it, stop, for the love of god grab something¬Ö <br/><br/>The digital work is astounding. It's like climbing into an ever evolving painting and making it one's own world. The sensation of weightlessness is achieved flawlessly through wirework and digital magic. Space has never looked so beautiful nor been so devastatingly destructive. Every wide shot could be frozen, framed and mounted above the fireplace.<br/><br/>It's not often I am compelled to mention the camera work but the shots here are at times staggeringly good. There is one particular fluid shot where the camera sweeps slowly before Ryan's terrified face, turning slowly to slide through her helmet and present her point of view before seamlessly retreating along the same arc. For this cineaste, that was a moment! <br/><br/>The screenplay is sparse on dialogue, in comparison to most big screen offerings, but not a single word is wasted. Co-written with his son, Jon√°s, Cuar√≥n's screenplay is at times gently amusing and often taut with clipped utterances. Like oxygen supplies in space, words are not to be squandered. The visual feast before us tells us more than the dialogue and Steven Price's magnificent, atmospheric score completes the experience as strikingly as the elongated silences. With all the ingredients blended, Gravity is ridiculously tense! It almost hurts to watch it but it demands repeated viewings and my second will be tonight.<br/><br/>Though there are peripheral characters, notably Ed Harris as the voice of Mission Control (just one of many references to space and sci-fi flicks gone by), Gravity is a film of two actors who are frequently isolated on the screen.<br/><br/>Clooney is a natural, formidable presence. If one were lost in space and facing possible death 940,000 miles from home, his Matt Kowalski would be high on the wish list of companions in doom. Largely a vocal performance (it's difficult to see much of him behind the helmet), his performance is a tangible aspect in a situation we could never fully appreciate. He leaves us in no doubt as to the urgency of their predicament while refusing to carry a scythe and read the last rites. Matt is the astronaut equivalent of a surgeon finding the humorous benefit of weight loss via amputation.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock has never been better. Not even when earning her Oscar for The Blind Side. No, she may not strike double gold with Ryan, but what on earth is she doing trudging through bilge like The Heat when she is capable of this? It is very difficult to carry a film as (frequently) the lone performer with no-one to bounce off but Bullock's performance is beautifully controlled and profoundly affecting. Perhaps the backstory is a little contrived but that is not her fault and, more to the point, it makes Ryan human and allows the events to unfold as they do. Watching Bullock in Gravity, one wonders if we have seen the birth of a career butterfly finally emerging after 25 years from a comfortable chrysalis.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm going soft, maybe I'm hormonal, or perhaps I've just been lucky this past three weeks and seen three fantastic films (after The Kings of Summer and Captain Phillips), but Gravity is stunning. I emerged from the screening drained and I have to see it again.<br/><br/>On a slight tangent, earlier this week a certain BBC presenter referred to Gravity as 'this year's Life of Pi.' My heart sank as I thought he implied that none of it had actually happened and that perhaps Ryan would awake to find herself at peace in another place with it all having been in her mind. For those who heard the same report, fear not. The comparison comes from Matt and Ryan being shipwrecked, albeit in space, and the phenomenal special effects. There is a crash, they are floating in space and Gravity is nothing short of an exquisite film.<br/><br/>With all the eloquence I can muster, wow!"
"cobiecreston","9","3","5","28 October 2013"," It could not get any better than this...!!!
","After hearing so much about this movie, I decided to check it out. I was not disappointed! In fact, this was way beyond my expectations. My wife isn't a great fan of sci-fi per say, but this blew her mind too! I watched this 3 times already. What I liked most about this movie, is it's whole setup. Almost shot entirely out of space, this gripping thriller keeps you on the edge. Sandra Bullock is fantastic actress, this proves so yet again. Clooney's sense of humor gives you a good laugh or two. Visualizations are fantastic, and gives you feel of actual space. I honestly don't know what could have made this any better.<br/><br/>So, go on, watch it, if you haven't already! I'm planning for watching it again."
"nathanwevers","8","3","5","27 October 2013"," Visually stunning!
","The aspects of this film are visually stunning. The vivid feel of the dangers that take place in space, and the actors relationship to the emptiness that surrounds them are truly apparent in this film. A masterpiece in regards to direction, cinematography and visual effects, however the actors performances being well portrayed, where unfortunately distant in grabbing hold of me and truly impressing my previous perceptions of what talent they can offer. Bullocks performance was well, just perhaps not Oscar worthy? Despite the lack of performances, this film is a must see. It reminds us of what it means to be human, our relationship to our home (Earth), and that in the end this place is all we have. The beauty that surrounds us and that all we could possibly need to thrive is all around us. Bullocks' character wanted escape the reminders of earth, to see the frontiers of space, yet in the end she craved the familiarities of home and what she couldn't leave behind. Cuaron's intention to wonder the viewers could not have been more spot on. His envision is perhaps what makes this film great. No doubt that he can produce a film about our home so surreptitiously but yet so blatant. Oscar contention for sure."
"stephenbell2006","10","3","5","26 October 2013"," A True Cinematic Experience.
","Alfonso Curaon and Emmanuel Lubezkis sixth motion picture together, produces one of the most spell bounding, mesmerising pieces of art that has crossed the big screen in a long time. It is a film that works on a visceral level and on a cerebral level.<br/><br/>George Clooney brings his usual cool demeanour but it's the surprise casting of Sandra Bullock that demands merit. Playing the role of Dr. Ryan Stone, Sandra Bullock rolls back the years to produce a performance that I hope will gain her the recognition she truly deserves.<br/><br/>Similar to their earlier collaborations, the Camera work plays a massive part, immersing you in the very heart of the film, to the point where you might believe your name warrants a place in the end credits. The opening scene reminded me a lot of the ""roadside ambush"" in Children of Men, where the camera intertwined between one scene, truly remarkable.<br/><br/>Once we relieve ourself from the majestic cinematography and CGI, there lies many deep philosophical question's at the heart of the film. Covering, religion, spirituality, overcoming our past demons, taking control of our lives, the birth of mankind (the ending), it's all in here. Similar to the ending of 2001 Space Odyssey, this is a film where relive your own story.<br/><br/>I believe this film to be one of the most remarkable films I've had the joy to witness. A true cinematic piece of cinema."
"amillerz3","10","3","5","26 October 2013"," Gravity: Cuaron has topped himself
","There are very few directors with a reputation like that of Alfonso Cuaron. He is one of those directors who doesn't really put out content very often, like maybe once every two or three years, but when he does make a film, it's just...wow. And yet, with Gravity, Cuaron has SOMEHOW managed to top himself.<br/><br/>To those who are well-versed on Cuaron's films and his style, you know that Children of Men is his other big science-fiction film (besides Harry Potter, with which Cuaron was just jumping in to fill shoes previously occupied by Chris Columbus, so he couldn't really use his traditional long- shot style too frequently). With Children of Men, he was able to use his style very frequently, establishing himself as a director who knows how to use the camera and how to utilize mise en scene to its fullest extent.<br/><br/>Let's get back to Gravity though. It has been a solid 5 hours since I stepped out of that theatre, literally screaming at the people in front of me who were saying ""I mean I didn't really like it,"" and things of that nature, and I am still in a state of shock. Gravity takes you out of your seat, and puts you into space with Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski, two astronauts, a newbie and a retiring veteran, who stare death in the face as they tumble away from their destroyed shuttle into the unknown. Their struggle for survival becomes your struggle to breathe as they overcome an obstacle only to find another and another and another. You may ask yourself, ""Where can the story possibly go from here?"" Believe me, I asked myself that question as well. You will never want to slap yourself in the face more than the moment you realize how much more can and does happen.<br/><br/>Never before has a movie been so visually and emotionally encompassing. From that opening 17 minute shot to the final cut to black, you won't know what to do with yourself besides gasp for oxygen and hold on for dear life (as they do). And I've been limiting my film nerdiness in this review as much as possible but THAT OPENING 17 MINUTE SHOT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I HAVE EVER SEEN WITH MY OWN TWO EYES I CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH THE GLORY AND THE SOUND DESIGN AND THE VISUAL EFFECTS AND THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND JUST EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. My freak out for this review. it should be the last.<br/><br/>Go see Gravity. Advisable to see it in IMAX 3D; it is well worth the extra few dollars. Previously my favorite science fiction film was Cuaron's Children of Men. Now, it is Gravity."
"kaya-amigo","9","3","5","26 October 2013"," Gravity will absorb you!
","Gravity glitters on the screen with pureness¬Ö Lack of futile effects, non existence of stupid-illogical action and void of American Hero based story (Maybe George Clooney could count on it) brings a solid sci-fi movie in front of us. Gravity is not just a cool example of this genre but also a brave and visionary visual feast in terms of cinematography. The storyline and the script are not revolutionary but the way they are presented is flawless. In short, Gravity is one of the best movies in sci-fi genre which surrounds you with its stirring visual atmosphere.<br/><br/>The story is not something new, especially, after the movies such as Apollo 13, From the Earth to the Moon, In the Shadow of the Moon and so on. Our lovely and bold astronauts encounter a devastating problem in outer space and they have to deal with it. However, this ordinary story is held under from a little bit different perspective. Sandra Bullock is the main engineer who is responsible to render her abilities for a broken satellite. George Clooney is the pilot of the mission and in my opinion, he is the ""American Hero"" kind a guy to smoothen the tension of the movie. While our fellas are working outside of the satellite, fragments of an useless and old Russian satellite which has been bombed by Russian government start moving towards American satellite waiting for repair. Wrong calculations of Houston and Russian Government somehow cause the disaster so that all the fragments of bombed satellite hit our guys with a bullet speed. American satellite falls into pieces and our astronauts become homeless in deep space. From that point they have to follow the human nature and survival instincts to be alive but wait! Imagine yourself in emptiness. It is the feeling that movie give you how ridiculous trying to stay alive in space after a situation like that. The incident raises the question: ""What would you do to go back home?"".<br/><br/>As I've emphasized a minute ago, the movie gives more than an improved clich√© sci-fi story. The environment (space itself) is incredibly suitable to grab audience and force them to emphasize with the astronauts. The big applause should go for the director Alfonso Cuaron. He did a brilliant job to create such a stressful atmosphere with a minimalist approach which I couldn't experience in the other astronaut- space movies. I say ""minimalist approach"" and it may seem quite trivial if you consider the movie is a big budget shot, also going in space. However, our main characters are generally troubling in little space shuttles or strolling in the space. In other words, attributes of the environment are so minimal. Alfonso Cuaron manipulates this emptiness that pops out from the environment surprisingly well. You do not get tired because of flashy environment changes or cripple camera movements since the environment is so stable (obviously space) that every action, explosion and disaster during the movie hypnotize you. There are no suffocating visual effects. The visual effects are as smooth as water and your brain drains every entertaining scene. If you already watched one of the Transformers movies, you will get the difference. In the movies like transformers, visual effects are trivially massive and inaccurate. You feel that something visually brilliant is going on the screen but you cannot feel the flow of it. Gravity is revolutionary because of its artful and flawless visual effects. You do not need to squint to comprehend the details of the explosions as they are in Michael Bay's movies. Every action scene resembles an art exhibition in Gravity and 3D technology makes it more tempting inevitably. <br/><br/>When it comes to the stars of the movie, I must confess the true success of Sandra Bullock. Among all the acting skills of her, she is so convenient to this role thanks to her physical appearance. Let's imagine Nicole Kidman or Jennifer Lawrence in this movie! I wouldn't imagine such a sexy and dainty astronaut trying to get back to world after losing her satellite. Bullock is like a full pack with her appearance. She has that feminine strength the movie needed, she is not a baby doll which is not stereotypically supposed to be convenient to a female astronaut and she has the action movie charisma coming from her discography. She is tremendously brilliant to give audience the loneliness feeling in the space. She forces you with a convincing desperation to emphasize her fear and struggle. George Clooney is the passageway of this movie. He represents the cool, brave and oddly arrogant American Hero stereotype. The funny part is that his role did not bother me. On the contrary, I believe that his character is determiner of the movie's tension. His arrogant serenity eases the tension after a massive action scene and then suddenly, surpasses that flow with sudden up-side downs. Fortunately, Cuaron keeps his role limited and as adequate as the movie needs. That's why, it would be delusional to come up with a concrete judgment about Clooney's acting success in the movie with his limited role. <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, I would generously say that Gravity is one of the best visually successful movies in the cinema history. Even though story is not that original, storytelling and its presentation with incredibly beautiful visual effects (I would claim them not effects but true arts) grab audience and make them feel how astronauts could feel if they are stuck in space and not able to go back to mother earth. 3D technology makes the movie even better and I have to confess that I hated 3D technology till this brilliant movie. Director Cuaron should be dignified because of the success to come through such a movie and turn it into screenplay."
"andrewphillipsegal","9","3","5","24 October 2013"," great movie
","Big science fiction films are all the rage this year (Oblivion, Elysium, Pacific Rim...) and Gravity is finally one worth watching. From the trailers I had no idea what to expect. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock floating around in space for two hours eventually became my best guess. I rushed to see the film at Harkins in Tempe Market Place and when someone said they were showing it in 3D, I was half tempted to leave the line. I usually don't like 3D movies, they give me awful headaches and I don't see the point of them. As soon as Gravity started, I changed my mind.<br/><br/>The 3D definitely adds something to the film. The opening shot of earth and space is absolutely beautiful. The film starts up fast enough. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are both out doing repairs on the spaceship when Houston warns them the Russians blew up their own satellite and accidentally destroyed every other satellite there is. Debris is coming their way and they have to get back to earth as soon as possible, and without a spaceship they must find another way home.<br/><br/>George Clooney basically plays George Clooney in a space suit (a funny self-loving character also often played by Robert Downey Jr) and Sandra Bullock plays a doctor who was trained a few months for this mission only. George gets very little screen time but Sandra shines throughout the whole film. Despite her being alone, I would say there is quite a lot of action in the film. She's alone out there and you feel you are too. The film takes you in space and it feels claustrophobic to be there. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Throughout the film, you see Sandra's character growing as well. Not only is she trying to get back home, but she's finding the will to do so as well. <br/><br/>The film is a visual masterpiece. Yes there is a lot of CGI of course (basically everything you see on screen is fake) but it never felt like it. For once, the 3D definitely adds something to the experience. You get the depth of field you need to truly experience the movie and feel as though you're right there with Sandra. She gives an absolutely stunning performance, acting to absolutely nothing, yet always being right on the spot.<br/><br/>If you get a chance to see Gravity in theatres, go for it, especially if you see it in 3D (even if you usually hate 3D, believe me, it's worth it.) Alfonso Cuar√≥n has outdone himself with this film, it's definitely a must see for sci-fi lovers."
"richieandsam","9","3","5","23 October 2013"," Amazing from beginning to end!
","GRAVITY<br/><br/>When I found out that I managed to get tickets to a preview screening of Gravity, I was so happy. I have been waiting for this film for ages. Ever since I saw the trailer I instantly wanted to see it. I thought the trailer looked amazing. So, there I was sitting in the cinema waiting for the film to start, 3D glasses on and thinking to myself ""I really hope this does not disappoint"". I had the same feeling about Open Water. The trailer for that looked good¬Ö it had the potential to be a good film, but when I watched it I was so disappointed. I thought it was very boring and felt let down. I didn't want that feeling again, so I tend not to get too excited about a film, but with this I could not help it. Thankfully this film was amazing! Far better than I thought it was going to be.<br/><br/>The film is about a group of astronauts that are in space fixing a satellite. All of a sudden there are reports of a missile destroying another satellite and the debris is heading towards the astronauts. Their ship get's hit badly and they have to fight to survive being stranded free floating in space.<br/><br/>The story is so gripping. It has been a very long time since a film has had me glued and worried about the characters as much as this. I spent the whole film so tense. I could not relax at all. I even found myself holding my breath a couple of times too. You really find yourself getting into it. You don't really know the characters before everything kicks off, but that doesn't matter. There is no time to introduce the characters as it is pretty much action from the start. You grow to like these characters a lot and all the way through I had no idea if they would survive or not. I like this because it was an original story. Yes, there have been other space disaster movies, but this felt completely different than anything I had seen before.<br/><br/>The casting was perfect. Sandra Bullock takes the lead role. She was really good and convincing. I always said she was better in serious roles and this is, in my opinion, the best film she has ever made. There are talks of her getting nominated for an Oscar for this¬Ö I think she deserves it. It was also really good that Sandra made this film with no make-up on at all. It made it feel more realistic. It is a brave move really for a big Hollywood actress to be seen on screen without anything to make her look made up. George Clooney was the other main character. He did a fantastic job also. You really like his character. He has a laid back more relaxed attitude in space just cruising around with his jet pack on. But he seems to be the character that takes charge. I think he should get some good recognition for this too.<br/><br/>The film was shot really well. Space looked amazing. The film was visually beautiful. There were so many shots where I was wishing I was up there. As a photographer I would love to be taking photos of those views. The other thing I really liked about this movie was the soundtrack. The music was very well put together and made the 0065perience even more tense. I also loved the fact that when there was an explosion in space or a crash you heard nothing but the music. In space there are no sounds so it is great that this film kept it real.<br/><br/>If I was to say anything negative about this film I would have to say that the 3D could have been better. It was really good in places, but in other places, it was not very good. There were a few places where you could see there were bits that were meant to come out, but didn't really. But this did not ruin the movie too much. I am also thinking that if I watched this in 2D it would be a bit weird because a couple of times you could see it was made for 3D. It might look a bit out of place in 2D. But it shouldn't ruin the film too much. This film is one that has to be seen in the cinema, in 3D¬Ö watch it in IMAX if you can¬Ö you will not regret it.<br/><br/>I loved this movie and will give it 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>""No, no, no, Houston, don't be anxious. Anxiety is bad for the heart.""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","I don't want to give any spoilers so I am not going to mention scenes here. <br/><br/>I heard and read a lot about Gravity from my film fraternity friends and colleagues. Everyone said "" Don't miss it"". I am a George Clooney fan but never was one of Sandra Bullock. I entered the theater hoping to see George Clooney in space suit and having wise cracks at every other character. <br/><br/>By God, I was surprised to see Sandra Bullock giving such a matured and nuance performance. There were a few plot holes but the effort of the director and screenplay writer to keep audience engaged through out the 90 minutes with no major geographical changes is commendable. <br/><br/>In space or even in life you never know which can trigger a disaster. In such case losing yourself is pretty easy compared to fighting for survival. You can lose your hope in a minute and give up for all good but to sustain the hunger to live and prosper gets even difficult with every passing moment. <br/><br/>This film shows you the way to keep the belief going and survive this momentary loneliness. The camera work and Vfx are breathtaking. Recommend you to watch it with an open mind even if you do have expectations film can live up to them. <br/><br/>This film is a classic case of either you love it completely or hate it. Hope you find and experience the former emotion. Space is too big to hate!!"
"Anurag-Shetty","9","3","5","22 October 2013"," The most realistic space movie, ever!
","Gravity is a thriller set in space. An astronaut named Matt Kowalski(George Clooney) & a doctor named Ryan Stone(Sandra Bullock) are stranded in space after their shuttle gets destroyed. Now, they have to survive at any cost in the harsh conditions of space. <br/><br/>Gravity is the most visually stunning film, set in space. The events that take place in the film are believable & accurately depict what might happen if a person is drifting through space, without a shuttle or a space station, to go back to. The dangers that the two characters face, get repetitive after a point but, I was on the edge of my seat throughout. The 3D has been put to good use unlike some movies, that are converted to 3D just for the heck of it. The CGI is the highlight of the film. To create the entire Milky Way galaxy from a computer is just awe inspiring. A note on the performances. Sandra Bullock is outstanding as Ryan Stone. George Clooney is brilliant as Matt Kowalski. Gravity is a must watch. It may feel like a documentary about space & space shuttles at first but 15 minutes in, you'll be hooked!"
"Dfschohr-532-549658","10","3","5","22 October 2013"," Gravity Review
","In space there is no sound, no oxygen, and no gravity. But Im sure you knew that. ""Life in space is impossible,"" is a title credit line that sets the audiences up for one of the most thrilling and suspenseful journeys through the vast reaches of space. <br/><br/>Bio-Medical Engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are the survivors of the space shuttle Explorer, which was was destroyed from satellite debris. Stone and Kowalski are now on a mission with low oxygen, to get to the ISS, International Space Station and board an escape pod back to Earth.<br/><br/>George Clooney is terrific, he adds a great bit of humor throughout the course of the film, which helps counterbalance Sandra Bullock's more seriousness. Sandra Bullock gives the best performance of her career. Bullock carries us through most of the film, every bit her journey you feel for her and while watching the film my body got chills, tense, excited, happy, etc. every time her character of Dr. Ryan Stone felt those emotions. Thats rare for me to say that about a Sandra Bullock film, because I've never been the biggest fan of hers, I thought she was descent and I like films that she is in but now I see how strong of an actress she is, and look forward to seeing more work from her. I think I need to go back and watch her in A Time To Kill. Bullock deserves a nomination and even a win, she is extremely solid and remarkable.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron has succeed with every single one of his films, he made the best Harry Potter, Prisoner of Azkaban, he wrote and directed Children of Men, which will always be one of my favorite films and I can now add Gravity to that list. Cuaron has this amazing seamlessly fluid one take motion of directing and its quite enthralling. The film is paced perfectly and has some of the most beautiful space shots. It also uses the use of 3D and IMAX to its fullest and it looks insanely gorgeous. 3D IMAX is the only way to see the film.<br/><br/>The sound is also another thing to note. Gravity has the best sound design and mixing. Everything is almost perfect, when satellites collide with the space ship, there is no sound, just a rumble and the characters voices, with the exception of a scene where a character uses a fire extinguisher in space and you can hear the squirt of the extinguisher. The film is still absolutely enticing and adrenaline pumping.<br/><br/>Gravity is sure to garnish up some acting, directing and even technical awards as well. I feel that Alfonso Curon has made a film for everyone to marvel at and love. Gravity is one of the best cinematic space dramas ever, up to par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. I give Gravity a 10 out of 10"
"jakelawvideo","9","3","5","21 October 2013"," An amazing Realist Epic Thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat
","Gravity was probably one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It was very REAL every single thing that happened in the movie, could have happened in real life and could have played out quite similarly. The Realistic approach combined with the spectacular acting with the story was very intriguing, thrilling, and kept my eyes glued to the screen the whole time. Sometimes when a Realism theatrical show is released, they cinematography falls to the basic Naturalistic almost, 'stock' state. This Epic kept its realism approach across the whole spectrum bringing me into the real void of space above the earth through its picture, sound, music, and special effects. This story Follows that of Ryan Stone as she is trying to fix the Hubble Telescope and things go drastically wrong with another satellite. As her story is followed, the developments leave you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. The story also follows the realism concept and is in true-to-life setting that still has the amazing cinematic thrill that I seek in a movie. One thing I MUST recommend is that if you go to see it, you see it in 3D. There is no other way to see it, the 3D did not hurt my eyes at all, and it was so good that I jumped 3 or 4 times in fear of something hitting me! And although I did love the 3D, my mother, who was with me, said that she did get a bit motion sick, but not from the 3D, it was just the fact that the camera was spinning. Overall, this story and movie was one of the best I have ever seen, It comes highly rated, and deserves just as much! Its portrayal from Actor, to cameraman, and from Grip, to concept designer, was absolutely perfect! I will watch it again and again!"
"sones11","9","3","5","21 October 2013"," Great musical score, CGI and acting--particularly Clooney
","Is George Clooney the most underrated actor out there?<br/><br/>While this is obviously Sandra Bullock's movie (and she's great in the role), I'm not so sure you would have cared as much, had Clooney (and his character) not been present. His calm and selfless demeanor was the counterpoint to Bullock's natural overwhelming fear when things began to go bad. I can't think of another actor in that age range who could have pulled off Matt Kowalski's role--maybe Brad Pitt on a good day?<br/><br/>Just a nit: Bullock's character referred to Matt Kowalski as ""Lieutenant"" twice. I have to believe an officer of Kowalski's age and experience (shuttles since 1995) would be higher up the food chain (minimum Commander, most likely (Navy) Captain."
"rlandmann","9","3","5","17 October 2013"," The closest that most of us ever get to experiencing space for ourselves
","Gravity is a strange mixture of the ridiculous and the sublime. For me, the latter eclipsed the former almost all the way along: the beauty, wonder, and grandeur of the film let me quickly forgive the few truly facepalmy moments.<br/><br/>Let's start with the bad and get it out of the way. What little story there is here is completely linear, paper-thin, and relies on howlingly bad science to create a crisis and then howlingly bad science to resolve it. The few characters are presented as professional astronauts yet, as introduced, two of the three behave more like twenty-somethings on a package holiday. Did I mention how oh God the science is really bad? It's the astrodynamics that suffers the worst: all kinds of ludicrous orbital impossibilities are depicted. I know it's only a movie and supposed to be a fun way to spend 90-odd minutes, but I found this stuff as jarring as a movie set on terra firma where a hoodlum on a skateboard in New York snatches a handbag, darts off down the street, and in the next scene is swapping the skateboard for a bicycle in Beijing. It really is that bad (indeed, it's actually worse than that!)...<br/><br/>...except when the science is really good! The title ""Gravity"" is perhaps a little misleading because gravity doesn't (directly) play much part in the film. Rather, it's ""Conservation of Angular Momentum"" that's a recurring theme. For the most part, aside of one very very obvious and annoying gaffe, Newtonian mechanics are well respected, and I found the terror and desperation of characters in the grips of ""the cold equations"" palpable at times.<br/><br/>So what else does this movie do right? Well, for a start, I think it's the most beautiful cinematic depiction of space since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"": the cinematography is stunning in an ""enlarge any frame and hang it on your wall"" kind of way. It really has been 40 years since space has looked this good. The vistas of Earth from orbit are really breathtaking; in particular, a gorgeous panorama of Egypt sticks in my mind. As I was watching that sequence, I was wishing a little that all attempts at a story had just been excised from the finished film. Set to a mellow jazz or classical score, I think I could watch those spacescapes for hours and hours.<br/><br/>Finally, I found its depictions of real (or close to real) space hardware and working in microgravity really, really convincing and immersive. When a character loses a tool at a crucial moment, I (like they) had a very strong sense of panic about not ever ever getting it back. And it's the spacecraft of the film‚Äîa space shuttle, a Soyuz TMA, and a Shenzhou. all lovingly rendered and presented‚Äîthat to me were perhaps the real stars of the show. To me, these felt like real spacecraft, and I felt like I was there aboard them.<br/><br/>I highly, highly recommend this movie. You might get into the survival story‚ÄîI could take it or leave it, but I think it was credibly done‚Äîbut watching this on the big screen in 3D is likely to be the closest that most of us ever get to experiencing space for ourselves."
"jayant-choudhary35","9","3","5","21 October 2013"," A Must Watch
","Gravity satisfies you, you feel every moment. The best 3D movie so far, some scenes are amazing. Best combination of creativity and technology. Alfonso Cuaron is the man, he did and intensive research on space. Everything is perfect,making this movie was a really a very tough task, how can anyone imagine such scenes. he spend 6 year on this project and now it ll be a case study in film making. I given up my dream of becoming a NASA scientist after watching this movie, this was the impact on me. I felt everything even nausea in zero gravity scene i was literally feeling no gravity & in scenes where object comes towards screen i really tried to save myself from those more then 3 times. Sandra did a fantastic job, without her acting this impact was impossible to create, with only 2 character gravity bounds you till the end. Cuaron made special instrument to shoot the film and all his hard work now been paid off. Whole world is praising this master piece."
"bobbysing","10","3","5","20 October 2013"," An incredible space journey without wearing the special suits and oxygen cylinders.
","More than a decade before when I first saw Ron Howard's APOLLO 13 (1995) and then Stanley Kubrick's epic masterpiece 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), it simply made me awestruck witnessing the unbelievable kind of execution by its immensely talented makers. Besides I truly regretted the fact that I couldn't see such great films on the big wide screen with an outstanding sound system playing its enjoyable musical silence, providing that out of the world experience to the viewers. Moreover the films also gave me the thoughts, that what if the astronauts have to repair their space shuttles by themselves by moving out manually in the unknown black vacuum and what if they need to ask help from any other country's space shuttle standing at a distance, in a state of crisis and then have to reach it somehow covering the blind gap.<br/><br/>Thankfully GRAVITY is here with all the possible answers to my thoughts and the regret of not seeing any such space adventure in the theaters is now taken care of in an outstanding manner. In simple words, if you ever wished to feel the space and its deep silence like the trained professional astronauts, then here is your chance to live those otherwise unachievable moments in the theater, at the cost of only 300 bucks and that too without wearing the heavy space suits and oxygen helmets. The film takes you into that black soundless region like never before and then makes you feel the excitement, tension, loneliness, pain and discomfort of being in the space all alone with just the mechanical gadgets and machines. Capable of transforming you into a different world (space) altogether, GRAVITY is unarguably one of the best space adventure movies made till date, which actually makes you wonder that was that beautiful, absorbing ambiance all digitally created or they really shot those sequences by going into the genuine scary space in a shuttle? Further opening with a ground breaking long shot introducing the theme right away, GRAVITY not only keeps you absorbed with its breathtaking execution but also keeps you guessing through an engaging, original script written around a rare space disaster.<br/><br/>Though for many viewers it might have less dosages of entertainment as expected but as a matter of fact, GRAVITY rises much above than any recent spectacular gem such as AVATAR or LIFE OF PI, because it is not really talking about anything fictional or deliberately created by the makers in order to provide a mesmerizing, magical treat to their viewers. It actually talks about the real existing space and the sudden, unexpected catastrophe which possibly can happen with the people up there in the space shuttles, anytime, any moment. Secondly the film gives you an entirely different and much superior experience as a 3D film (comparatively) since the technology is used quite wonderfully here, matching its subtle yet electrifying subject matter, moving ahead than any other 3D film to be precise. Talking about this personally, I have never seen a 3D movie by not taking off the glasses several times in those two hours to get some relief. But here in GRAVITY, I never thought of taking them off even once, other than the intermission and was constantly watching it with the glasses on for the first time ever.<br/><br/>Thoughtfully & skillfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron, GRAVITY is a film which gets perfect contribution from every single creative person involved in its making, superbly led by the Sound, Cinematography and CGI departments in particular. Though its silent moments speak for themselves in those tense sequences, but the timely inclusion of many enjoyable dialogues and the well composed musical notes enhance the overall impact of the venture to many folds. Brilliantly performed by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the actors successfully make a solid impact on the viewers, even when you don't see their faces properly in a substantial part of the film till the end. Particularly this is Sandra's another absolutely stunning performance of her career and she reportedly spent six months of physical training, preparing for this role to play it in an authentic manner.<br/><br/>Interestingly apart from GRAVITY's technical, artistic and creative attainment, the film has a proud Indian link too wherein you get to hear one of the astronaut singing ""Mera Joota Hai Japani"" and then we have a duly acknowledged contribution in its soundtrack made by Delhi's own famous music producer, Gaurav Dayal.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, I would like to write about GRAVITY's less discussed, rare spiritual or meditative feature, which truly gives you an enlightening taste of that supreme invisible power, hidden within this huge, complex but smoothly working universe and its unexplained phenomenon. The film takes you into those never ending, silent, infinite black spaces of the universe, which simply make you realize that how tiny, ineffective and momentary is our very existence on this planet Earth. The Earth, which itself is a very miniscule part of such an enormous universe and its numerous elements.<br/><br/>In fact, this humble thought is very well defined in the last scene of the film itself, when Sandra somehow manages to reach back planet Earth safely, landing into the sea after a miraculous escape. And the moment she again touches the solid surface of mother Earth¬Ö¬Ö..there are only two words on her lips with eyes looking into the sky¬Ö.. and those two words are¬Ö.THANK YOU.<br/><br/>GRAVITY ends on this very note giving us a fabulous thought to take back home, indicating that the human race is only capable of saying just these two words in gratitude towards the beautiful existence. And there is simply no other way we can repay back for such precious gifts showered upon ourselves by that Supreme Power since ages."
"fawn_jane","8","3","5","20 October 2013"," White Woman in Trouble.... In Spaaaaaace!
","This movie is actually pretty good - for what it is. The movie is an experience, a wild ride, feels like a first-person-shooter video game at times. I saw this in 3d and was treated to amazing special effects. I mean, seriously, how did they even film this stuff? CGI is pretty good these days...<br/><br/>But I must level some criticism at this film: In the beginning, our protagonista keeps breathing too hard. Sounds like a petty complaint, but it really grated on me. I mean, c'mon lady, you are a trained professional, you are not physically exerting yourself, and you know you are running out of oxygen, so stop breathing so effin' hard all the time. But fortunately eventually the film stops emphasizing her breath so much.<br/><br/>And some parts of the movie didn't flow right. Like what happens with George Clooney's character was not very convincing. The movie doesn't care about him. At. All. He's in the same situation as Sandra Bullock's character, but when any little thing happens to her, it's Drama with a capital 'D', but when anything happens to him, the film wants us to feel like, ""oh well, it's not happening to the pretty white lady so no matter"".<br/><br/>A few things seemed kind of unrealistic, not as bad as most space- thrillers, but it's there. And the plot is a little bit too non-existent, the ending a little bit too open-ended. But oh well, that's not what they were going for now was it.<br/><br/>Despite my criticism, I highly recommend this movie. It is a truly state- of-the-art movie, technologically and cinematically. This is what movies in the 21st century are supposed to be like! The first scenes of the movie are amazing, such beautiful shots of space, and the film masterfully builds up suspense like nothing I've ever experienced before."

Gravity has a simple story, one of the simplest, but it catches your heart and opens your imagination like none before. The visuals in 3D were amazing and the acting was very good. I really liked Sandra Bullock and I'm sure she will be nominated for an Oscar. 'Gravity' was like a short, totally filled with knowledge, space encyclopedia.

It was unpredictable and full of excitement. The images are amazing and you feel as though you right there with Bullock completely and utterly alone (scary).

"ckolet37","6","3","5","20 October 2013"," Best film of 2013 so far-
","Before this film, in my opinion the greatest special effects of all time were in Avatar. Everything was so realistic, you could see sweat on their faces. This film not only trumps everything that Avatar has brought us, but I really don't see these effects aging for a long, long time. I could be proved wrong, you could see the models in Star Wars, the shark looks like a dummy in Jaws, but this might be different. I am a big fan of Cuar√≥n's style as a director. I love the darker tone that he brings to his films, his point of view shots in his films are flawless. He went all out, he pushed the boundaries for not only what he could do, but what a director can do. Same with the acting. Sandra Bullock gives a great performance as Ryan Stone. If she was any lesser of an actor than the effect that this film had on us, would be lesser. Bullock is one of those actors that you root for every time. She has that charisma, you want her to survive. In my opinion, the most atmospheric and powerful moments of the film is when she is alone. This is a tremendous feat, considering she is in front of a green screen 99% of the time. George Clooney brings a likability to his role, his character was very entertaining and a relief, when the film was at its darkest. This is the movie event of the year so far, no doubt about it. If you haven't seen a film that you enjoyed so far this year, go see this film if you haven't already."

I humbly apologize for my snide comments about her previous flick, we all make mistakes. 'Gravity', what can I say? It is an eyeful, a masterpiece. This woman can act, and what a captivating performance. I usually am not a big fan when stars play second fiddle to CGI and special effects. Films like that usually never enhance one's talent but bolster the cast-members' weaknesses, so I try to avoid that kind of visual-vomit. But in this movie, the strength of Ms. Bullock's talents easily overcame CGI and special effect. This movie was all about her character. Granted, some George Clooney guy was there ‚Äì eh ‚Äì he died. Her performance allowed a lot of character insight and inner strength to come to the surface. Her struggle with solitude educated her in letting go, moving on and rejoining the human race. OH ‚Äì and did I see anything spiritual or religion related ‚Äì oh for crying out loud ‚Äì this is Hollywood. I am glad they did not go near that topic - the movie would have been a major gag. This was strictly entertainment (kind of what Hollywood is supposed to do.) Was this her best movie? No way. Was this one of her best? Yes. Fantastic movie and I do highly recommend it.

","Gravity is one of those movies that one has to watch to be part of film history, it's a turning point in the film history time line. A new film narrative is born, the movement of the camera takes the audience into a different way of understanding the beautiful weirdness of space. It made me believe that I was there in space; what an achievement! It is the director's job to make us feel the emotion, to be part of the story, to experience what the characters are going through, and Cuar√≥n just nailed that part. Frame by frame it is perfect, I can't easily say ""My favorite scene is when"" because it has so many awesome moments and it is a movie shot and edited so carefully, with such detail; that each frame can be analyzed and be semiotically interesting. It is indeed a very smart use of 3D technology and this movie's success also proves that audiences love good surprises, people need to be thrilled.

","Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, as they star in Alfonso Cuaron's (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) sci-fi spectacular, Gravity. Houston, we have a problem. <br/><br/>Tonight's weather forecast ‚Äì ""clear skies with a chance of satellite debris."" Medical Engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and NASA Special Commander Matt Kowalski (Clooney) are on a repair mission in outer space, when a Russian satellite shatters and its shrapnel races towards them. Mission Control (voiced by Ed Harris) initiates an emergency abort, just before all telecommunications to Earth crash.<br/><br/>When you're suspended in the cosmos and the narrative is thus restricted to a single location, all there is to relish, besides the remarkable views and special effects, is character development. However, this is as far from a bad feat as our troops are from home. Where it is easy for a sci-fi to get carried away with itself, Cuaron's profound characterisations of our spacewalkers, who share extraordinary on-screen chemistry, grounds the spectacle in reality; so much so that science fiction appears to be science-fact.<br/><br/>Gravity is predominantly based in one location with one objective, yet the Mexican-born director does extremely well to grip our attention and the mesmerising visual cinematography makes it a pleasure to concentrate.<br/><br/>Clooney renders Kowalski with unbelievable strength of character, able to take the responsibility of the interstellar jester, despite the severity of the situation; ""I know you never realised how devastatingly good-looking I am, but you need to stop staring"", he says to Dr. Stone, as they cling together in the abyss. <br/><br/>Advised by fellow-director James Cameron, Cuaron delayed production for four and a half years so that the technology could catch up and meet expectations. The wait was certainly not in vain as Tim Webber's visual effects are simply groundbreaking. ""There is no weight in space. There is no sound in space and the only light is what bounces off the Earth"", explains Cuaron during a Gravity masterclass. The dramatic thriller gives testament to these interplanetary conventions to an expert degree.<br/><br/>In true Cuaron-fashion, for the first 15 minutes there are no cuts. The long take soaks in the sights at the same time as it lures the spectator into a false sense of tranquillity. Kowalski's wit and charm, as he playfully floats about, sends us further into relaxation; Clooney refuses to shrug off his debonair persona and proficient flirtation even in the face of death 600 kilometres above the Earth's surface. <br/><br/>All of a sudden, we get a sharp succession of cuts as danger ensues. The camera becomes very dizzy as it stylishly coils around our troubled astronauts; instead of the actors moving, the camera does all the donkeywork. The debris tears through their shuttle and telescope, leaving the duo adrift.<br/><br/>""Although there is no sound in space, there is music in film"", declares Cuaron. The music in Gravity, composed by Steven Price, is harmonious and at times, even terrifying (unless of course we're talking about the Hank Williams Jr. country western jive that plays out of Kowalski's radio, epitomising his breezy persona). <br/><br/>Driven by pure heart and the will to survive, this story about letting go toys with symbolism of birth and rebirth, paying unspoken homage to Children of Men in where humankind loses the gift of fertility. As the loss of her daughter plagues her mind, Dr. Stone on several occasions showcases foetal characteristics. When her oxygen supply plummets, Kowalski attaches a tether cable, symbolic of the umbilical cord, to the distressed space-newbie in order to get her to safety. Stone is later seen poised in a zero gravity pod and her behaviour is strikingly symbolic of a foetus, as it curls inside the womb.<br/><br/>Gravity is out of this world.

Yet the will to live can be so strong and powerful ‚Äì because we have someone we care for and we respect life ‚Äì whether it is a dog woofing, a baby crying, or a frog swimming. <br/><br/>Up there in space, there is no boundaries, no orientation, no nationality or even language barrier. Whatever you believe in does not matter anymore. Whatever we strive or fight for on Earth is not such a big deal anymore. Our hung ups should not be bothering us anymore in that absolute space. It echoed what an astronaut I interviewed years ago who said when you are up there in the space shuttle, you would not think of your national background, just found yourself a global citizen, or resident of the Earth. May we protect and keep our Earth in good shape for future generations to come.<br/><br/>In that Zen like drift, panicking does not help. Just be calm, take a deep breath and do what you have to do while enjoying the ride. What a spiritual ride that urges you to appreciate solitude and being alive.<br/><br/>Excellent visual effects where we are seamlessly drifting and floating together with them, even inside Dr Stone's spacesuit. The first 10 minutes were all seamed in one shot while we as the audience are also rolling, spinning and flipping gently in space. What an elating experience! How did they do that? This has to be watched in 3D.<br/><br/>The sound effects (music and breathing) were also breathtaking which match perfectly with the mood of the spacemen and the edging circumstances.<br/><br/>No more worry about whatever that is on your mind. This will definitely give you a new perspective of looking at life and at ourselves. Just go and enjoy the drift."

","It was a great film, Loved the way it was shot. I take my hat off to both George Clooney & Sandra Bullock. A+ performance.. The only thing that was an upset was the fact that George Clooney was not present for the entire film. I would guess thats why the movie trailer was so short and did not really show much.. because had they showed you the film was more based on Sandra Bullock it might not have pulled what it did in box office. But none the less still a great film and I would recommend it to viewers who have not yet watched it. (Y) Its also interesting due to the fact this film had such a small cast. Literally you could count the amount of cast members on 2 hands. Very interesting stuff."

Also, her falling into a lake the size of my bathtub is a little unrealistic out of all of the land around it. Although the thing could have some detection of water. Besides this, it almost made me cry and was a wonderful movie well worth seeing. The cinematography is great and the computer animated graphics were amazing. I felt I was there and i wish that I could have seen it in IMAX, but that is too expensive to pay for a group of people.

Before I was reluctant to watch 3D movies, but Gravity changed it all. Two people in the wilderness of space how possibly could both or anyone of them survive?

I recommend this movie if you are prepare to don't see guns, punches, sex, and all Michael Bay's ingredients. Go to the cinema or Imax.

"Nothinggrandproductions","10","3","5","15 October 2013"," One of the best movies in the era of digital movie-making
","Gravity is one of the most groundbreaking movies in digital movie-making. There I said it. Not only is it the first movie to really make me feel like I was in space, it used CGI in the best way possible to the point of that for the most part, I'm not sure what was real or wasn't. The movie follows Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) on her first space shuttle mission and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who is on his final trip to space. They are towards the end of the mission until debris from a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite causes mass destruction to be heading their way. This is where the movie truly begins. It has a slow buildup in the first 20 minutes but then explodes into a thrilling movie. Right from the opening shot, I could tell this movie was going to be special, it was a beautiful wide shot of space as we hear bits of mission control talking to the two characters and it was just great. <br/><br/>Bullock carries the film with an emotional performance and surprisingly, the characters don't actually get overly in depth but you still really care about who they are. They don't spend a whole lot of time with exposition with the characters but it almost isn't needed because of just small bits of characterization that help sum up the characters really well. The minimalist aspect of characterization works so perfectly for a film like this as danger just keeps provoking them. Although, the other big star here is the visual effects, cinematography, and space in general. The cinematography is absolutely mind blowing from long, slow, and beautiful shots of space to tense, unnerving close-ups on the actors The movie also uses POV shots frequently and they only add to the immersion and tenseness. The slow shots are hypnotic and spinning and give the perspective of space unlike anything else before it. <br/><br/>3D is utilized great from adding depth to the background or using it as actors reach out to grab something. The visual effects of space not only set the bar so high but really, truly make everything feel so real. In addition, the movie seems to call back to other pieces of science fiction such as 2001: A Space Odyssey with a certain shot as well as Bullock being a strong female lead like Sigourney Weaver in Alien which is always fantastic to see. Overall, Gravity sets the bar so high, changing the game for digital movie-making, has unbelievable effects and cinematography, and is without a doubt, the best movie of the year thus far, if not one of the best in years (and absolutely needs to be seen in theaters for the full experience)."

Not only does it have a compelling story line (and no, I didn't think it was slow), but from a technology point of view, the most amazing use of IMAX and 3-D technologies ever. And if Sandra Bullock doesn't get an Acadamy nod for her performance, I'll be even more surprised than when Barbara Streisand didn't get a nod for ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"".<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars is that there were a couple of technical goofs, but really, that is a mere quibble.

When people will discuss Gravity, it will not be for the acting or the storyline, it will first and foremost be about the cinematography, which is in one word unique.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the director or his other work, but I read somewhere that he wanted to be an astronaut.

","Gravity is a heart pumping, claustrophobic scif-fi thriller from maverick director Alfonso Curan. The film's leads, George Clooney and Sandra Bullock give Oscar worthy performance as astronauts on a routine mission that quickly goes haywire. The film is enchanting in its visual effects, giving the audience a first hand view of what space is really like. The sounds are soft and drowned in space, the land vast and open, it is a truly terrifying film, as it uses extremely long takes and masterful camera work to give the audience the most realistic space experience in 3D. The scenes usually are focused on Sandra Bullock's character, Ryan Stone, giving the audience a first hand experience of what it would really be like if someone was lost in space. Bullock's performance is nuanced as she demonstrates fear and panic in the most realistic light, everything from her heavy breathing to her moments of complete hopelessness is portrayed in the most expert of ways. It is truly a fantastic performance.<br/><br/>There are many words that can articulate the experience of Gravity, but in all actuality, it will not do this film experience justice. It is truly a fantastic film with layered characters and the best 3D work audiences have ever seen. Once it starts, you are hooked from minute one. Do yourselves a favor and pay the admission price because it is more than worth it."

You actually believe you are in space. The writing is phenomenal, the acting Oscar worthy. Sandra Bullock was amazing and the musical score was the perfect foil for the storyline. Even George Clooney was exceptional. This was a story of survival plain and simple but done with such mastery that it draws you in and you are there with Ryan Stone throughout the whole movie.

"ericbobg","10","3","5","10 October 2013"," Gravity: Will you hold on or let go?
","Since its release last weekend I've seen Gravity described as the masterpiece of Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuar√≥n. It is. It's a visually astonishing film that cohesively uses all its elements - cinematography, sound, acting, plot, visual effects, etc. - to tell a beautiful, and gripping story. While at face value it's a thrilling portrayal of a perilous struggle for survival, Gravity offers a deeper exploration into how each of us deals with adversity in life.<br/><br/>When I first saw the teaser trailer for Gravity I was instantly enthralled and excited. A couple of things stood out to me. First, I was in the theater when I saw it so I got the full audiovisual experience and the film looked beautiful and thrilling. I was instantly gripped, even though I really had no idea what it was about - no more than astronauts in trouble in space. The second thing I noticed were the names attached to it. Alfonso Cuar√≥n is an increasingly recognized director with only a few titles under his belt, but they are diverse and told with style and meaning (He directed the best Harry Potter film, Prisoner of Azkaban, among other things). Seeing something so different with his name on it is good reason to get excited. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are both great actors as well. Expectations were forming and I had a hunch this was going to be great. My ears were perked and I was paying close attention. I was dying to see it. That's what a good trailer does.<br/><br/>It met my expectations. Gravity's storytelling is efficient. Everything is tied to the ultimate purpose of the story and the characters. I just have to say thank you to Cuar√≥n for doing that so well. Most great movies do it, but few big budget flicks are among them. It opens with three astronauts during a spacewalk. The shuttle Explorer is attached to the Hubble satellite and Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is installing some hardware to assist in her research. It's her first time in space and Mission Control is getting readings indicating she's feeling a bit queasy. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), on the other hand, is a seasoned veteran astronaut and zooms around with confidence. A third member of the team is enjoying himself as well. He's a nice guy with a family and you know instantly he is not making it out of this alive. The voice of Mission Control (Ed Harris... yes, the guy that was the head of Mission Control in Apollo 13... if you were paying attention) lets them know a Russian satellite was destroyed and has created some debris but no need to worry. Oh wait... yes there is need to worry. They get hit by a field of high velocity space shrapnel. Ryan is flung into space completely detached from the shuttle and her team. She starts to panic. Matt tries to settle her down on the radio but she can barely breathe.<br/><br/>This is all in the trailer. From there it's a series of obstacles that must be overcome one by one, each promising a great likelihood of failure and death. This is where we really get to know these characters and learn from their different approaches to dealing with extreme adversity. Because that's what Gravity is all about. It's a beautiful and extensive series of metaphors on life and how to deal with hardship. But that part of it's not pushed in your face and it's great as it is without the reflection. Dr. Stone has some difficult things from her past and has kind of shut out the rest of the world since then. This makes the silence of space appealing to her. Matt is more fun-loving but with a sure will to survive and an unbreakable calm. There's going to be some real anxiety as you watch and consider how you would react in the same situation. You tell yourself these people have been trained for this, but only a true acceptance of the reality of death and life can really allow you to make jokes and listen to twangy country music as you drift in space with your oxygen ticking below 5%.<br/><br/>The physical situation in which these astronauts find themselves starts to morph into a good metaphor for Dr. Stone's own situation down on earth as we learn more about her. Isolated. Silent. Hopeless. Peaceful. As you watch you may begin to wonder if it mirrors your own life. Not in a desperate depressing sort of way (perhaps) but in that this mortal life we all wander through, the chance for disaster is upon us at any moment and once it strikes - whatever flavor adversity comes in - it's hard to imagine that most people wouldn't panic too. Maybe it would be easiest to just drift off. To let go. It's a lot of work to stay afloat. Ryan must make a decision that most of us are never confronted with: to hold on to or let go of gravity. By the end of the film we learn that rather than the shared bond between two masses, gravity is also the shared bond between each of us and the rest of the human race (perhaps even a higher power?). The choice we are faced with is to hold on and accept gravity - despite all the weight that comes with that choice - or to let go and drift away.<br/><br/>See my expanded review here: http://ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2013/10/film-gravity.html"

With state-of-the-art filmmaking and accomplished direction by Alfonso Cuaron -who collaborated on the otherwise pedestrian screenplay with his son Jonas - putting his stars in great peril may be great storytelling in 'showing' then 'telling' (when in reality it would help if it was the opposite).

The depth of feel was pretty good in 3D, without making the ""oooh 3...D...."" clich√© of focusing too much on trying to impress using the 3D elements like many early 3D movies choreography.<br/><br/>My only peeve was the rushed ending sequence and the twist of good fortune that made Shenzou capsule re-entry appear almost incident free, in stark comparison to the rest of Tiangong. The end was too bland, which could have benefited from short educational sequence for younger viewers on what would have happened to the astronaut (Clooney) drifted in space without the EVA/life-support --- but that's merely from an educational perspective of course.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, well done, Alfonso and Jonas Cuar√≥n.

","When I first saw the trailers for Gravity start to pop up I thought that it could either be really good or really boring. When some early reviews started coming in with mostly positive things to say I started to get pretty excited to go and see it and my excitement was not wasted. Gravity was an intense interesting and overall really fun time at the movies.<br/><br/>I've read some criticism about the scene where Cloony and Bullocks characters talk about their lives back on Earth while floating in space. People have said that the scene was completely forced into the movie and just did not need to be there. I completely disagree with that. That scene was needed and worked so well because Cloonys character (Matt) brought life on Earth up in the first place to try and calm Sandra Bullocks Character down on what was her first space mission. Considering how bad her first mission went I think what happened in that scene was just plain realistic.<br/><br/>I would not normally recommend 3D but in this movies case I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>So overall Gravity was just a really cool movie I give Gravity a 9/10"
"six2561","9","3","5","5 October 2013"," Visually Stunning
","I give it a 9 for the visual beauty of this movie. You haven't seen anything like it. I don't just mean the anti-gravity in space-type stuff floating around. Although all that made us shake our head.... how'd they do that!! *spoilers* Rather, I mean the scene shot from the perspective of being inside the space suit helmet looking out. The scene when she finally gets into the space capsule and floats in the fetal position. Even the very last scene when she's clutching the sand and the shot of her standing from the feet up. All very different and powerful. I am not at all a fan of 3D. I usually get dizzy and motion sick with it. This 3D is very different, on par with Avatar only better. I forgot I had the glasses on until it was over. Not distracting and totally enhancing. There are a couple of parts, one in particular, where there's a flaw in the physics of space and how matter would react in it. But if it wasn't for my husband, I wouldn't of noticed it myself. Short movie at 90 minutes. But long enough. I know I'm possibly the only person in the country who doesn't really like watching Sandra Bullock movies, but she did well in this movie albeit still hanging on to her usual facial expressions and awkward out bursts of emotion. George Clooney is just goofy (as always), but effective"
"donaldgilbert","9","3","5","4 October 2013"," The presentation is unlike any I've ever seen (no spoilers here)
","I really don't like to refer to myself as a ""movie snob"" but I do find myself easily annoyed with films that neither challenge me nor respect my intelligence. I went to ""Gravity"" based on a few strong recommendations but inwardly nervous that I would be disappointed. From the first 10 minutes of the film, I knew that this was something special.<br/><br/>I don't need to get into plot points. I would only say that this film is not for anyone with a heart condition or a nervous disposition. I found this film as visually beautiful as it was jaw-grindingly intense. In the theater, people were so intensely invested in this film that every intended reaction was felt throughout. Make no mistake- this film was the filmmaker's great achievement- absolutely the perfect presentation, absolutely the work of an artist.<br/><br/>Again, I don't shed these words for many. This was nothing I'd ever seen before.<br/><br/>The closest comparison for me is ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" but not quite. It's not as deep and intelligent a movie; not as original a premise and not as groundbreaking. But these are two different movies, and this story couldn't have been presented better."
"Big_D_Box_Office_Score","9","3","5","3 October 2013"," Beautifully done!
","Going in, I had some serious doubts about this movie. It looked beautiful, but every time the trailer would play in theaters, the audience would break into laughter by the end of it. It looked...silly. Sandra Bullock back-flipping into the eternal emptiness of space? Is this a comedy? For some reason, the trailers never really connected with me. I found it hard to take seriously.<br/><br/>And then, I saw it. Forget those trailers. This will connect.<br/><br/>From the start, the movie sucks you in. You really get a feel for the scope of outer space - it's so grand and yet so empty. Clooney puts in his usual quality work, but it's Bullock who really stretches her acting legs - literally and figuratively - and shines. The story flows well, and the tense moments will have you shaking your leg in anticipation...that forever-backflip lands a much heavier blow when you see the entire scene executed.<br/><br/>There will be parts where you'll ask ""Are you serious? What else could happen?"", and director Alfonso Cuaron DON'T GIVE A DAMN about what you thought couldn't happen, because it's GONNA HAPPEN, especially if it's the worst possible thing that could happen. Yet, it never really gets to the point where it's so unbelievable that you're knocked out of the movie. There's a fine line being walked, and Cuaron nails it. (Although -very mild spoiler-, that ""Bullock-is-an-unborn-child"" shot? I get the symbolism, but come on...lol) Needless to say, this movie is GORGEOUS. 3D is a MUST. And 3D really compliments the multiple Bullock underwear shots. (I know, I know, I'm so classy...) Gravity scores a 4.25 out of 5 on the BDBOS.

"aharmas","10","3","5","4 October 2013"," Mind Blowing and Ground Breaking
","What can one say about Alfredo Cuaron's work quality? He's given us films that are among the best of their kinds. They're full of magic, talent, and wonder no matter what the subject matter might be. Harry Potter became a fully-dimensional character, the girls in ""A Little Princess"" brought to life marvelous representations of an era long gone, with humor and insight. ""The Children of Men"" showed a bleak future, a time where hope almost disappeared from the face of this planet. It wasn't an empty portrayal in a science fiction half-cooked universe.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" tops them all and easily positions itself as a movie that could fit very well with the best ever made. In fact, there might not be enough superlatives to describe what you will see there. We have two players, and for the first minutes of the film are only recognizable through their vocal performances, their faces hidden as they are introducing the vastness and beauty of an unforgiving universe. It's grand, magnificent and completely inhospitable. It's a place where humans are one step away from death.<br/><br/>Conditions become more and more dangerous as the film progresses, and our two main actors go through ordeals which keep getting more and more difficult to overcome. Before you know it, only one of them will be on the screen, and this where the movie steps up the action, tension, and allows its heart to beat with unrelenting force, never forgetting this work combines love, faith, and intelligence.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is full of wonder, from its jaw dropping vistas, its superb photography, its flawless editing and direction, and because of the amazing Mr. Cuaron's admirable dedication: one of the best acting turns of the last 25 years. What you will see Sandra Bullock do in this film requires complete commitment to the material. Her performance is both physical and spiritual. There are moments that are touching and full of qualities one only wished had been present moments of ""2001""... a film that it will evoke. It is nevertheless to classify this film as Science Fiction because technically it depicts a situation that is entirely possible in these times.<br/><br/>Much credit should go to Clooney's supportive performance, a turn that uses his talents with absolute perfection, most of all because it's a difficult role, one that requires a person with charisma to burn and forces him to reach deep inside his soul in the later scenes. Bullock is just perfect and surprises all of us with her range, giving us a character that is rich with much depth and capable of producing incredible amounts of empathy. She's marvelous.<br/><br/>There is only one word to attach to this great movie, and it is unbelievable. It has elements we have heard of before, maybe even seen them in IMAX screens, but what Cuaron has put in the screen is nothing short of breathtaking. You will keep on asking yourself: ""How did they do that?"" We might as well be witness to the Best Movie of the Year."

","So I'm sure I am not the first to make that comparison, but yea it was essentially the same.<br/><br/>A movie about some astronauts doing what appears to be routine maintenance when a missile strike causes a chain reaction of satellite destruction and causing a wave of debris to fly through space at breakneck speeds. The story then follows to 2 sole survivors and their attempt to safely get back to earth.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that uses the negative space of visuals and sound to an artistic point. The score is amazing, but I'm starting to notice and be bored with the whole Inception Hums. Not overdone though hear. Visual effects are fantastic. I saw it in 3D and it was just right amount of depth to not give you a headache. One scene in particular when the cloud of debris came around the 2nd or 3rd time, the simulation for satellite destruction with the 3d was amazing. If you are claustrophobic this movie will hit you even harder than most people.<br/><br/>What's really great is how the debris field (obviously), but space, and earth were all characters without a single line that did there job of creating unease, hope etc very well.<br/><br/>Character development felt real and and natural. There were some scenes that those not fluent with physics might wonder ""Why didn't they just...couldn't she?"" Another nip picking low point was George Clooney. He was...George Clooney. He tends to be typecast as suave attractive smooth talking older man and this movie is no different. Him playing himself was kinda glaring but other than that good movie.<br/><br/>It was good.

But even if the visuals weren't impressive this would still be a very memorable film.<br/><br/>I was mostly impressed with how space is presented; not as a beautiful, magical area with endless wonder, exploration and potential for adventure (like sailing the seven seas). But instead space is shown to be an environment where the slightest thing changing or going wrong results in death or the threat of death. Even with high degrees of safety and training we cannot control this environment. And the physics which applies to space I've had a concept of but never seen just how different it is to Earth is shown to be a danger itself. WOW.<br/><br/>Onto the characters. There is only two of them. And both do a great job with George Clooney easily portraying the calm, experienced astronaut; Sandra Bullock portraying the technical proficient and capable yet flawed and inexperienced astronaut. Well done to both of them for giving a very memorable performance.<br/><br/>Lastly I want to praise the running time of the film. Too often I see movies which run long because it is seen as best practice. The result is a drawn out story which can loose audience interest and therefore fail to entertain us. At 91 minutes long it absolutely captives you from start to finish. I would rather see a very concisely told story that is only 1.5 hours long than sit through a so-called 3 hour epic which is uninteresting, unnecessarily long and not entertaining in segments (e.g. The Hobbit).<br/><br/>Go see the film of 2013 today."

","This movie was amazing! Outstanding visual achievement. Watching Gravity made you feel like you were in space. The shots of earth and the sun in the distance were stunning to watch. But what made this film even more fantastic was Sandra Bullock. She gave a truly amazing performance. She proved she is a great actress in not just a comedic role, but in a dramatic one as well. I've never felt more connected to a character on screen than i did with ms. Bullocks Ryan Stone. Very emotional at times. She tapped into every human emotion. Truly amazing. She deserves an Oscar nomination for this. I also want to praise the director Alfonso Cuaron for his great visual style, the camera work that he did made you feel like you were in Sandra bullocks spot . At moments while watching Gravity i found myself holding my breath. I was at the edge of my seat. I can't recommend this film enough. Go watch it!"

","I don't know how this movie won any kind of award. I watched it with a friend of mine and his two kids. It was barely watchable for the adults and the kids found it totally boring. It's basically a movie that has Sandra Bullock talking to no one for half the movie. The other half she is talking to George Clooney. I'm a Sci-Fy person and found this movie very very slow. She uses up all her oxygen and has only 5% left but keeps hyperventilating. Somehow the air never runs out. She has to read the manual on how to operate the various equipment and somehow gets it all right. Even on the Chinese space station she somehow manages to push all the right buttons to get the escape pod to deploy. I am so glad I paid less than $10 at Wal_mart for this movie."

"tamarafcb","1","4","8","5 November 2014"," Endless shortcomings, universe isn't big enough for them all
","It's been quite a while since I've seen this film, but I can't shake off the feeling that it was one of the worst I had the non-pleasure of watching. Never have I seen such pompously announced film so 'pompously' failing to deliver on pretty much every level - not that I expected much having seen who had been cast as the lead(s). Really, Sandra Bullock is a one trick pony - even in her comedic films I've always seen her as playing the same character over and over again, a somewhat misunderstood, clumsy, devil-may-care woman. So I wasn't convinced she could pull this off in the first place. But let me tell you how wrong I was - there was nothing in this film to pull off. Not even Meryl Streep would be able to. As vast as the universe is, as vast is the shallowness and, might I add, the utter stupidity (I rarely use this word, but really - if you have seen it or are going to, you'll see there's no other word that could describe it) of this piece of (f)art (oh, yes I went there!).<br/><br/>Other major character played by Clooney is oh so one dimensional that he could form a new pop sensation - One Dimension. It was like watching him in Ocean's Eleven in space. Maybe that wouldn't have been a bad idea - bunch of thieves and crooks in space trying to steal money from a spacecraft casino owned by their arch enemy - even that sounds more convincing and reality-based. But I digress.<br/><br/>In this film the story is ridiculous and certain to make you NOT root for the character(s). During watching you'll probably be asking yourself how in the world would this particular person make it to NASA's space program and furthermore, to space itself having admitted she crashed nearly every time while on the flight simulator. Oh yeah, if not clear, I am talking about Dr. Ryan. No knowledge of anything about EVA, but she somehow - with a little help from her friend in her DREAM and again by singing eeny, meeny, miny, moe manages to escape certain death whilst everything around her blows up and gets destroyed. I ain't no physicist but even I could see the oh so many inconsistencies between the film and physics. Let me just start by saying there is no sound in space but we do hear it when Dr. Ryan unstraps something (I do remember hearing it, I can't remember the particular scene though). I can only imagine the other wrongdoings committed to physics.<br/><br/>And oh my god, don't get me started on clich√©s. Really. Don't. This is every space film's storyline with a fatal mistake - no characters you'd care about, no character development and a lot of clich√© dialogues/monologues written by someone with a mindset of a Cheesy Cheesyngson. One clich√© in particular comes to mind when it comes to the soundtrack - hearing regular beats cut off by a sudden (pretty much expected) loud explosion, not my idea of originality.<br/><br/>And what can be said about Dr Ryan going all Bullocks, pardon me - b.o.llo.ck.s - about religion in her time of getting to grips with the certainty of her dying in space which she should have suffered through already considering she has been through so many explosions , she has inhaled a poisonous gas and so forth. And why not put her in a fetal position to symbolize rebirth (she's becoming a new person through this experience), that's smart, right? Well, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, I think I must tell you ''No!''.<br/><br/>Well, I guess you get the idea. I don't like Gravity. One star from me - a symbol of my suffering through this so called film. Not even for special effects - Earth ain't no Heidi Montag, no need to completely change its appearance. Okay, I'm out. With hope of enjoyment of good films as this one certainly wasn't."
"xlaim","10","4","8","3 August 2014"," Simple, rapturous, and spiritual.
","(Disclaimer: I am not an expert in space physics; this film is about so much more than that.)<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is at first glance, just an exiting flick about protagonist Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), and supporting hunk Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) floating through space. However, scraping lightly on the surface, we see lots of beautiful philosophical themes confronting spirituality, religion, and human purpose. <br/><br/>What seems to be the main theme in the film, focuses around enlightenment in Buddhism. Ryan is reborn 4 times during the movie's runtime, each time she has completed extreme difficult tasks that tests her ability to cope, and to find meaning. Having overcome loss, complete solitude, and ignorance, Ryan is finding her way to enlightenment when she falls down to earth with uncertain outcome. <br/><br/>A small frog/toad symbolises her cleared path to enlightenment is fulfilled. Ryan has now transformed into a new human being, like the frog changes from tadpole to frog. The Sanskrit word, Mandukya means frog. The Hindu scripture, Mandukya Upanishad, says that the three letters that comprise the chief mantra AUM (usually written OM in languages using the Latin alphabet) each signify a state of consciousness: A = waking, U = dreaming, and M = dreamless sleep.<br/><br/>The film also asks questions about religion in general when connecting it to the uncertain path to death, but I am tired. I'm going to bed, g'night."
"fjarle-988-471659","1","4","8","16 June 2014"," What is this madness?
","When scifi goes overboard with effects and monsters I'm fine with it. Very often realism isn't really part of the equation. But, Gravity presents itself as a movie that might be realistic. I'd peg Apollo 13 as its closest visual twin. With both the space shuttle, and Hubble, having roles in the movie, it's not set to some distant future. This collides head on with the writing, which is off the charts bad.<br/><br/>1. For some unexplained reason a medical engineer is repairing circuit boards on Hubble. 2. She refuses to stop working when ordered, in a life threatening situation, even though stopping would have no serious consequences at all. If lives were in the balance either way I might buy this scenario. 3. One of the astronauts is just randomly bobbing about in an EVA-suit, doing absolutely nothing but blabbering on about ""a bad feeling about this mission"" - followed by random anecdotes. Astronauts joyriding billion dollar equipment? I'm no astronaut, or NASA finance guy, but this seems far fetched. 4. During the entire first half of the movie the main character is completely helpless when stuff goes wrong. Prepared for nothing, and hyperventilating pretty much all the time - with 5% air left in her suit. It seems like NASA should let me into space. I wold be equally incompetent. 5. Russia shoots down its own satellite, instead of the tried and safe method of dropping them out of orbit to burn up in the atmosphere? 6. Space junk with the average speed of an 86 year old man in a wheelchair. 7. For some reason the Russian space station is full of vodka. 8. For some reason the Chinese space station has ping pong paddles flying around. 9. Airlock hatches explode open, potentially killing whoever is trying to open them. 10. Astronauts hanging on to the airlock hatches by the fingernails while they explode open. 11. The same astronaut(s) too weak to get on their feet in proper gravity - even if they displayed superhuman strength just minutes ago. Also after only a few days in space. 12. The escape pod immediately sinks after landing in water, even though heaps of re-entries are made into the ocean. I cannot remember ever hearing of one of them sink.<br/><br/>I don't usually get worked up over logical flaws in movies. Most of them slip by me unnoticed. But this was 90 minutes of purebred annoyance. Not one single thing about it seemed realistic, or even slightly plausible.<br/><br/>The visuals are pretty, and technically it's well made. Clooney is his normal, charming self - but when the writing is this bad, it just doesn't help.<br/><br/>How this thing won several Oscars, and has an 8.1 IMDb rating, is incomprehensible to me."

","A couple of months after the Oscar, I still can't believe it how this film managed to get 7 statues!?! Also the fact that Sandra Bullock was nominated for her role is shocking. Good that nowadays not everyone is taking Oscars as a reference.<br/><br/>The plot is so poor and all this Sci-Fi part is based only on the fact that the action is in space.<br/><br/>The so called performance of Sandra Bullock is dreadful. Being a novice, her role is stuffed with lines aiming to be funny, along with similar situations when she's building her plan. The maximum is when she's hitting randomly the buttons of the space shuttle trying to start the engine. Overall she was unconvincing and considering how this part was created I was more than surprised when she was nominated.<br/><br/>I would say that Gravity was a big deception and is one of the most overrated films in recent time."
"hisimperialmatt","2","4","8","28 May 2014"," Another Overrated Movie
","There are only two characters you see in the movie. You will be struggling to know even two things about these characters (other than they are astronauts). I think this may be the worst movie I have ever seen Sandra Bullock in, and she can usually make a movie good just because of her genuine personality.<br/><br/>There are way too many unbelievable parts to this story, which may not deter some people but starts to bother me after awhile.<br/><br/>The whole movie is a repetition of spinning through space, safe, spinning through space, safe.<br/><br/>They try to throw in religion for a split second, then forget about it immediately. It just bugs me that they bothered to do it at all.<br/><br/>I like the fact that they incorporated real events from NASA in the movie, but honestly the 'When We Left Earth' NASA documentary was more intense and interesting.<br/><br/>I do not understand the purpose of this movie. I thought it was about human endurance and the will to survive. But Sandra Bullock NEVER says why she decides to live, when she is obviously depressed about her child dying. It's like they just forgot about making their story make sense. Is it because she comes to terms with her daughter being dead? I don't understand how that is the game changer. I actually became sad after this because I felt like the creators couldn't come up with a good reason for her to live. This is probably the point where a decent back story would have paid off.... <br/><br/>2/10 only because it is in space, and looks pretty."
"Dragonfyre137","4","4","8","17 May 2014"," Irrational behaviour, logical flaws and plot holes
","I've read a lot good and bad things about the movie recently, so I decided to go to my local blockbuster video and get a copy and watch it to finally understand what all the mess is about.<br/><br/>I've been interested in this kind of genre since I can remember and thus have seen most movies/series depicting realistic space-action (to name a few of my favourites: 2001 Odyssey in Space, Battlestar Galactica, Event Horizon ...). So my expectations were pretty high.<br/><br/>I was positively surprised by the realism of the general space-environment. In contrast to other similar movies there is - as expected - no sound in space except all the sound coming from/through the space suits of the two characters, giving it a nice feeling. Who ever played the Dead Space Series - especially DS 2, will surely know what feeling I'm talking about.<br/><br/>WARNING, HERE BE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>There is one major thing that bugs me: When Ryan get caught in the ropes of the ISS landing module and catches the security rope with Matt hanging on it, why is he still being pulled away? There is supposed to be no gravity and no pressure, so given she caught the rope and stopped his momentum, he should stop moving. But he doesn't, as if he were pulled away from her. Now I've watched the whole movie with my girlfriend and we've discussed this scene and at first we thought it was the earths gravity, but as some later scenes revealed, Matt wasn't pulled away vertically to earth, but rather tangentially. So this whole scene simply makes no sense.<br/><br/>An what's the deal with Matt so apathetically accepting his death? He didn't show any little bit of emotion throughout all of the movie. And why the heck did he keep talking to Ryan and encouraging her to talk to him while her oxygen was running low? Talking uses a lot more oxygen than simply keeping silent. If HE didn't know, shouldn't SHE know, as a medic? I know, I know, if both of them wouldn't talk for all that time, the movie would have been even worse, but that's not well thought-out. Some of you might say he did so to calm her down, but the fact of oxygen running low faster with bow talking could have at the very least mentioned by one of the two.<br/><br/>I also found it quite fascinating that Ryan, as for someone with virtually no experience with landing-modules, had practically no difficulty in operating a Russian and Chinese device. Except the one time where she choose which button to press by ""eeny, meeny, miny, moe"".<br/><br/>Sadly, Matt had virtually no character: He was emotionless and showed no character development throughout the movie. Actually, he barely showed any character, at all. As to Ryan: Yes, well, she lost her daughter in a totally unrelated event and at first had no problem simply dying, until a hallucination told her not to. Isn't the NASA running strict psychological test in order to make sure psychically unstable or weak people like Ryan wouldn't get enlisted into a mission like this because they could endanger the crew and the mission? Not to speak about her disobedience in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, most of the movie is not much more than Clooney and Bullock floating in space and trying to get hold of something, so the plot mostly consist of the latter on one hand and some chit-chat to calm Ryan down on the other. Though I have to admit, the (short) action scenes are pretty good.<br/><br/>When rating movies, I usually give every movie 5/10 from the start and then add or subtract points. I've decided to give the movie a 4/10 because: + the effects were pretty decent + realistic depiction of the space environment (with one exception) - Clooneys wooden and emotionless acting (I know, it's arguable) - irrational and non-credible behaviour - very little plot-relevant content"
"lordjord96","10","4","8","29 March 2014"," It's safe to say that Gravity is as Heartbreaking as it is Breathtaking...
","Few films have given me a neutral vibe from trailers. The trailer for The Dark Knight Rises made me want to watch but not expect much from it, same with Life of Pi and now Gravity. After seeing the reviews for this film rocket upwards (excuse the pun), I knew I had to go see it. The trailers certainly got my interest to a point, but I wanted to see why so much fuss was being made about somebody floating through space. I'm very, very glad that I did see it in the cinema.<br/><br/>To summarise the plot; Sandra Bullock and George Clooney have to install a new part on the Hubble Space telescope. During the mission, however, the Russians destroy a satellite causing a chain reaction of debris which sees Bullock and Clooney separated from their shuttle. That's really all you need to know, as most of the subtle plot advances come from cinematography and lines of dialogue which would lead to major spoilers.<br/><br/>So, how does Bullock fares a desperate to survive astronaut bound to only one other person, with an ever depleting O2 reserve? Rather brilliantly, actually. Her performance really is the centrepiece of this film (Clooney has a relatively minor role, as you will see for yourself). When her O2 starts to run out as she panics, her breathing become raspy and difficult, her words sound desperate and difficult. Every movement is fluid, and every leap convinces us that this is a determined woman. Clooney plays a minor role, almost just a way of making sure that Bullock doesn't die and also acts as a kind of Comic Relief. Regardless, the first act plays out brilliantly between the two of them, and I was awed by the contrast between their deep conversations and the incredible surroundings they were floating in.<br/><br/>The cinematography is possibly the strongest I've ever seen in a film. I remember being blown away by the opening, as a huge roar during the Title is cuts to silence and an view of the earth rotating. This piece, followed by a 17 MINUTE continuous shot alone make the film worth watching. Seeing Clooney use a jet-pack to whip around space in 360 degrees was disorienting in a wonderful way; I actually felt like I was hovering around space with them. The camera work is fluid, but often fixes itself on the motions of an actor, such that we feel one with them as they go about moving from place to place. In one great shot, we slowly zoom on Bullock's face whilst she spins uncontrollably, getting closer and closer on each in-breath. It's shots like the one where she curls up like a space foetus (2001, anybody?), against the capsule door she just entered through, which reminds us of how amazing the 'land' of space is. How could anybody survive such a harsh place? Seeing it in 3d made all the difference, as seeing debris rush past and towards us was honestly terrifying, and made me fear for her life even more. The styling is ambitious, and the camera work more so. It's a beautiful film to look at.<br/><br/>I have to give it to Cuaron for this masterpiece. Many will complain that his story is thin and wears out by the time we realise it's about her 'living because her daughter died', but I think people like that are missing some clues as to the true meaning he hides in small pieces of dialogue and directing. <br/><br/>*SPOiLERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>Think about this; When Clooney 'saves' her as she attempts suicide, does she actually wake up? Is the rest of the film her in the afterlife, attempting to gain retribution for not standing up to her fear and saving her daughter? When she crawls to the shoreline and stands upon the sands, we are given an image of Evolution; This character, a human with the will to survive, stands stronger than ever, almost perfect, as thought she had ascended to a new level of life. Heaven, perhaps?<br/><br/>*SPOiLERS END*<br/><br/>Regardless of plot depth, this is an amazing piece of cinema. With technical mastery achieved by Cuaron, and a great performance by Bullock, this is the kind of film you HAVE to see. I think this will go down in history as that film which blew people away, for some reasons we can't just put our finger on and yet are still there. A glorious piece, 9.6/10."

","Alfonso Cuar√≥n's ""Gravity"" comes across as a metaphor for our own world. The debris that strikes the astronauts isn't that much different from the problems that we see on Earth, whether physical (pollution) or personal (stress). But in the end, we - like the astronauts - must face the problems directly.<br/><br/>The movie deserved its Oscar wins for the technical categories and Cuar√≥n's direction*. It creates a chilling feeling of isolation, much like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" did. But the bulk of the praise goes to Sandra Bullock as the embattled medical engineer: the character is the perfect balance between terror-stricken and persevering in the face of a seemingly insurmountable challenge. It's a movie that you have to see to believe. I also recommend Cuar√≥n's movies ""Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n"" and ""Children of Men"".<br/><br/>*I haven't seen ""12 Years a Slave"", but it sounds as though that one has a much more important story.

","*Warning, contains some plot spoilers*<br/><br/>To the average-Joe, this film is just boring about a woman stuck in space. To those who love movies and the art of making them, this is simply a rare thing in cinematic history. A movie that actually pioneers the spirit of making movies and pushes the medium beyond what the average film is capable of. <br/><br/>If you listen to most reviews disappointed by the movie, you can tell these are people who barely scratch the surface of films. On the surface its a movie about a woman trying to survive a disaster in space. Under the surface if you are capable of reading visual narrative, it is about a mother who lost a child and with it all that motivates her in life. The movie is about her rediscovering her desire for life through the experiences she faces while desperately seeking a way to survive. <br/><br/>It's a film of outstanding metaphors on existence, the obstacles and hurdles one experiences in life are obviously represented by the recurring destructive debris she's faced with overcoming. The very planet Earth itself is the sole representation of all that is beautiful and attractive in life and that which is her goal to return to. There is even a rebirth scene where her real fight to return begins in the docking bay of the station that she finally manages to get to. A stunning example of visual metaphor at its finest with her in foetal position, zero gravity, straps like fallopian tubes and in foetal position. It's a striking image in a movie full of striking imagery and cleverly seeded props that aid the visual narrative. Nothing is wasted, every anecdote Clooney recounts, the photo of the dead astronauts family even the unknown voice on the radio with the baby. Everything seeded to give the characters their background as well as indicate an aspect of the life she has long lost the desire to reclaim.<br/><br/>Again, the excellence of this level of visual plotting is lost on those who simply can't begin to interpret its fine art. The use of sound is like no other film I've ever known, truly original use of sound editing through everything they touch and way beyond your average orchestral music composition. George Clooney's character is a perfect polarising attribute to Sandra Bullocks Ryan Stone, he is essentially everything she's lost in terms of enjoying life. He has stories beyond stories of experiences and in her darkest most rock bottom moment that spark is ignited in true style of his character in one of cinema's most well delivered subversive dream sequences. The ending itself is worth every penny watching her literally re-evolve from her experience from one element into another delivering the story of life and everything that grounds it to us like a punchline.<br/><br/>This movie is a rare perfection, a true cinematic experience and everything movie-making exists for. Emotional, thrilling, visually stunning and with a beautiful score. Truly worthy of every award it got and more, by far and away the best film of the year and one of the greatest movies ever made."

But that's where it stops being anything short of obnoxious. A Russian satellite explodes and for some odd reason the debris from the explosion begin to hurdle around the earth at insane speeds - tearing through protective plating designed to take asteroid impacts. Immediately the main character starts having a huge panic attack, and her complete inability to do anything useful leads to the death of her commanding officer. While ""low on oxygen"", you then get to enjoy listening to Sandra Bullock hyperventilate for a good 20 minutes. Then she has major emotional breakdowns throughout the rest of the movie, leading her to do stupid, mindless things. A woman with that many emotional problems would not be allowed to go into space.<br/><br/>Everything she does either goes wrong or has the classic clich√© of working right at the last second (I can't even count how many times she missed grabbing a dozen objects but then happens to catch onto the last one). The most frustrating is when she is holding on to her commander's tether, and for some reason he is being pulled away from her continually, despite them being in space. He can't climb up the zero- gravity rope, and she can't pull him back? It's aggravating.<br/><br/>So really that's the gist of the entire movie. No character development.

Anyhow, to be honest i think the movie deserve a 6 rating. It's boring, no story line, the acting is mediocre, it's boring and it's boring again. Only watch this if there is no other movie left on earth. I wish i knew this before hand. If you are after fictions, there are far better movies out there which are more exciting I would go with space odyssey 100 times instead of watching this once"

I saw the movie. I was in SHOCK. If you have half a brain about how space works you will hate this movie. If you have respect for astronauts, you will hate this movie. If you prefer movies with plots you will hate this movie. Has anyone seen a movie where someone runs down a middle of a road and gets run over by a car that is chasing them? And you feel like turning the channel? That is the feeling I had through 90% of the move. It was hell because I was in the theater with $40 lost already. DO NOT watch it I warned you.<br/><br/>Now that the spotlight has moved on, its time to read the REAL reviews. Someone got paid here. I-M-D-B LIES.

","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>OK honestly, I love films and space but this was the worse excuse for a film and the creators of it should really burn in hell for eternity. <br/><br/>My reasons for this? <br/><br/>Firstly, they go against all laws and physics. In space if your helmet cracks or breaks your inside shoot out of every hole in a matter of seconds which they seemed to have forgotten in the shuttle when it collided with the missile debris. <br/><br/>Secondly, Sandra bullock's oxygen runs out before she gets to the ISS and yet she breaths CO2 for about 20 minutes and lets not forget her oxygen runs out is when she start breathing heavier as they hit the ISS. <br/><br/>Also not to mentioned she destroyed every piece of technology she touched, I mean how is she still alive??? She gets into the ISS and in a matter of minuted explodes the damn thing, then she gets into the Soyuz which she managed to keep intact until she gets to the Chinese space station and has to destroy that after seconds of landing on it.<br/><br/>Sandra bullock and George clooney are both good actors but still couldn't make this film good.... So what does that tell you.<br/><br/>Hollywood please ban the directors, writer and producers of this film from ever making another film again."

","2013 was a weak year for movies overall, but it did have this, a breathtaking and mind blowing sci-fi masterpiece which boots most of 2013's other releases into a bin liner. The plot is simple: 2 astronauts try to survive a space disaster. However, this is Alfonso Cuaron directing so it's not that straightforward. I've only seen the film once at the Imax, and I don't know if it would hold up on a repeat viewing on a smaller screen. The story won't wow anybody either, so just sit back and let it draw you in. You'll be glad you did. As the 2 astronauts Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are excellent, while in terms of visual effects space has never looked better. The film is one of the few movies that used 3D properly and actually immerses you in the experience instead of just being a gimmick which makes more money and forces people to wear annoying glasses for the whole movie. If you want to be jaw dropped for 90 minutes this is the film for you, since every single frame oozes glorious CGI and amazing photography.<br/><br/>Some have criticized the script, but loads of development and sentimentality would have sent the film crashing down to earth, so stop complaining! As a visual experience, there really isn't anything else like it and the ending when Sandra Bullock returns to earth will make you want to punch the air. It does actually have an emotional core and it is a powerful survival story that actually pays attention to science and feels plausible. The star of the show is Cuaron, whose use of long takes, tracking shots and camera movement pull audiences right into the film and never let go. Most would argue The Conjuring is 2013's most scary film, but this is arguably even more suspenseful and palm sweating. This is the best thrill ride of 2013 and one of the most technically accomplished movies ever, managing to pack more visual dazzle, emotional power and humanity into 90 minutes than Avatar did in 162 minutes.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I rarely write reviews, but just because the 'critics' in Belgium (and worldwide) were unanimously (ridiculously) enthusiastic I just feel the moral obligation of putting people back on their feet. They made it feel like the movie of the century, it felt like the 'Jurassic Park' of space movies... And as a die-hard sci-fi lover I really wanted to love this film, but sadly enough it now feels as cheap marketing gibberish. The graphics and audio are very good. Obviously. But just like Transformers: amazing cgi can't make up for a b√†d movie. The story and whole movie actually failed me on every possible level. Without going into some pretty obvious mistakes, the story simply doesn't connect, it doesn't grow on me. It feels like just a chain of events with very simple/flat dialogs and no real build-up or climaxes. It's short, it's simple. Not only that, but it's actually a very sad overstatement to say 'this one of the most realistic space movies out there' as I'm constantly trying NOT to point out some big flaws to my wife so she would not completely be disappointed. That said, I kind of like Bullock in most of her movies. A nice unpretentious 'simple girl' can only score in my opinion, but my wife and I were constantly annoyed with her clumsiness, lack of 'hurry' (even while breathing co¬≤), lack of courage, lack of education as an astronaut and so forth... But I guess that's a bad character/script in stead of a bad actress. She felt to me like what Jaden Smith does to most of his recent movies (which Is why i decided never to waste my time on him again). Anything but award-winning if you ask me :-/ But who am I. Watch the movie because society forces you, I don't care, but this is the last time I rely on IMDb ratings and 'real' Movie critics. Now it has 8.8, but in a year it will be down to 7.5, mark my words."

Clooney and Bullock are the only 2 people in the film which makes it a tad boring. Sure Bullock's performance when she is alone is very heartfelt but just watching 1 person float around and around (with the camera moving too makes you a bit sick) it just doesn't do anything for me. <br/><br/>When it finally ended I thought what a waste of 91 mins.

","Indeed, the visual effects were very realistic and sometimes you felt like the movie was really shot in space. But that were definitely all positive aspects I can say about this film. The most important negative aspect for me were the characters. They were so unbelievably unrealistic.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock/Ryan Stone: She is extremely unprepared for space (which can be seen in various scenes), is overly emotional and panics very often (which is very annoying and makes her seem even less suitable for space) and despite all this she still survives unharmed in the end, mostly because of luck. <br/><br/>George Clooney/Matt Kowalski: In contrast to her he is so exaggeratedly calm. This was probably meant to show his professionality but it rather makes him seem cold-hearted and inhuman.<br/><br/>This contrast seemed very made up and illogical to me. In addition to that, I could not empathize with Dr. Stone at all because she made so many silly mistakes you had no chance but to get angry at her.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot advanced so slowly (if it even advanced at all?) that you hoped that in the next scene finally something interesting happened.

The movie has a painfully thin storyline and has gruesome ""acting"". Trying to get deeper into the point the maker is trying to make is blocked by the inferior level of it all.

"SteveMierzejewski","4","4","8","12 December 2013"," Weightless
","Well, so much for the credibility of the Golden Globe Awards. That was why I decided to watch this movie. It received a number of nominations so it must be good, right? Sadly, it was not. It was as believable as an episode of Sponge Bob, but Bob has more psychological depth than Sandra Bullock's character. Actually, my bathroom sponge has more psychological depth than Sandra Bullock's character. I mean, the idea seemed good, two people set adrift in space, dealing with the inevitability of death and all the angst that that would entail. But I knew something was wrong when, instead of confronting this sobering reality, George Clooney's character begins engaging in cocktail party banter. I was baffled. I thought that maybe I had been misinformed. Maybe this was some kind of black comedy. Yes, it was a kind of a comedy but, regretfully, it was only accidentally so. Mainly, this is a one actress tour de force. You've got to be real good, REAL GOOD, to pull off an acting role like this. Tom Hanks did it in Cast Away, but, as is now strikingly evident, Sandra Bullock is no Tom Hanks. In her defense, she didn't have much of a script to work with. It seemed to be written by a 15-year-old. And I think the producers realized something was wrong. It just didn't have the punch they wanted and I suspect they realized this. Inspirational sections were not, so, you have the inspiring music swelling up in the background. Give me a break with this musical prodding that has become so prevalent in recent B movies. No amount of dramatic music can replace a bad script with bad acting. I won't even go into the physics of being adrift in space. I suspect that, somewhere, NASA scientists are throwing back beers and having great laughs at the movie's expense. They were probably the ones who gave it a five star rating. Hey, you don't suppose they work part time as Golden Globe judges, do you?"

","Visually, this movie is remarkable, great effects, its a technical masterpiece. Too bad the same care that went in to how good it looks wasn't taken with the script, the story and the dialogue. I am not a rocket scientist, but that doesn't mean I am a complete dolt. Having recently watched an IMAX documentary on repairing the Hubble telescope I learned that they have to take incredible care not to puncture the gloves, as even contact with a circuit board could breach them. Did the writers not even do a bit of research on this film? If its going to be pure fiction, why not just give her a transporter then she can beam herself home, or better yet a time machine, she could go back and save her daughter.<br/><br/>At about 65% of this movie I could watch no more.

"OlieRendch","8","4","8","27 November 2013"," Yeah, I don't think I want to be an astronaut anytime soon...
","So Gravity stars Sandra Bullock as a scientist sent to fix some satellite in space, George Clooney is also there too but the movie centres on Bullock; after A while something bad happens and a load of debris hits their ship. Now to start off, this film had loads of hype before I went to see it, people said it was amazing, reviewers gave it 10 out of 10 and so I was very excited to see it. And when I did see it I can see that the visuals definitely was the source of their enjoyment. The whole look of this film is just amazing, the long camera pans, the intense shots, the claustrophobic angles are all brilliant; especially in 3D, yes I saw Gravity in 3D and it is one of the best 3D films I've ever seen; I imagine it is quite enjoyable in 2D but this was just heightened the experience; when that debris was flying towards the screen my eyes sure flinched a lot. I thing to some people it may make them feel sick because it is very realistic; anytime I now think of people in space this is what I think it would be like; just the views and things are amazing. The music also goes well with it, I love the score to this, especially those parts where it goes incredibly loud and then just cuts and its silence, like the silence of space. The story line itself although good felt a bit repetitive about half way through; the scenarios the main character gets in are so similar every time that it verges on unrealistic, in that way I think it was hyped just that bit too much but apart from that its an interesting experience to watch and I'd see it again."
"JaysonT","9","4","8","21 November 2013"," Visually Stunning & Beautifully Crafted
","Gravity in physics means the force that attracts a body toward the center of the earth, or toward any other physical body having mass. Alfonso Cuaron's film that centers around outer space and Sandra Bullock, defines this notion both technically and emotionally. <br/><br/>I won't get into minute details of the film; I am not a science geek nor do I aspire to be one. I will say this is outstanding to look at, and aesthetically it is a triumph of both atmosphere and boundaries. Bullock plays a doctor who, along with George Clooney- an engineer- are dealing with an abrupt crisis that causes death and despair, and then for Bullock, ultimate survival. <br/><br/>I am not too keen on watching one-man shows unless there is something intriguing with the actor's personality. Tom Hanks succeeded to do this with Cast Away on a remote island; James Franco wasn't as successful but still sufficient in 27 Hours immersed in a cave; and Will Smith wasn't as forthcoming in I Am Legend, though that could also be because the movie itself was a laughably bad approach to isolation. Sandra Bullock, however, is quite impressive with her limited yet engaging presence. We want her to survive, but we also connect with her personally. She briefly confesses to Clooney (while they're plummeting in space) that she had a four year-old daughter who died unexpectedly. Now, she has nothing to live for. After the dire circumstances involving the mission, she must choose between accepting death, or willing to stand strong. <br/><br/>I won't say how the film concludes, only that it is quite satisfying and beautifully executed. While Clooney does his usual dose of Clooney-isms, Bullock is great at portraying a woman that is reserved and cautious in her approach to life, but still sympathetic. <br/><br/>The film over-all is awesome to watch and the visual effects are ahead of their time; there isn't a cartoon or CGI feel to the movie. A great experience."
"jafar-iqbal","9","4","8","20 November 2013"," One of the best films of the year....
","Me and 3D have never really got along. There isn't a lot of love there. When choosing between watching a film in 2D and 3D, I've always chosen the former, and always will do. But, sometimes, films come along that force you to choose 3D. Avatar for one ‚Äì I fell asleep halfway through. Life Of Pi ‚Äì pretty but needless. In short, I've never been blown away by it. IMAX is the future, in my opinion, but bloody expensive. 3D? it's a fad that will go away, just give it a few years.<br/><br/>But, I implore you. Go and watch Gravity. And make sure you watch it in glorious 3D.<br/><br/>Gravity, for those that don't know, is the new film from Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. Truth be told, I wasn't too aware of the name, but he has made some fantastic films in the past (Y Tu Mama Tambien; Children Of Men; Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban, to name a few). All of his best films have the same thing in common ‚Äì visually, they're a treat to watch. One of the most powerful moments of Children Of Men, for example, is when blood splatters across the screen and just stays there on the lens. With this new film, though, Cuaron takes that talent to a whole new level.<br/><br/>The film is unlike any other I have ever seen. Visually and viscerally, from the very first scene, it's a stunning watch. Very many excellent films have been made in the past about space, but Gravity is the first time that a movie actually takes advantage of the sheer distance and nothingness that space provides. It's full of beautiful long-shots, moving over the Earth, the stars, the space stations and debris around the place, and the people themselves. It's jawdropping; but as beautiful as it is, it's amazing just how terrifying it also becomes. As Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) hurtles helplessly through space, spinning uncontrollably and screaming for help, I was frightened. That fright was heightened by the use of 3D; this wasn't just objects needlessly flying off the screen at me; the 3D tricks were in context and meant something.<br/><br/>Thankfully, what Cuaron manages to do very well is supplement the visuals with a very solid and emotional story. Bullock's character has gotten literally lost in space and is desperate to get home. But this is not just your usual sci-fi adventure flick ‚Äì this is an emotional tale about hope, faith and (beyond all) the idea of letting go. Whether it's letting go of a traumatic experience, or simply letting go of a wire, it's a theme that runs throughout the movie and eventually sets us up for the exciting final third.<br/><br/>At the heart of it is Sandra Bullock herself ‚Äì as Ryan Stone, the veteran actress provides yet another excellent performance. You quickly forget that it's Bullock, so immersed she becomes in the role. Once again, the 3D plays a big part here; as she floats through space, we become her eyes, therefore creating a bigger bond between actor and audience.<br/><br/>But while one actor enhances the film, the other one did a helluva job trying to bring it down. That's right ‚Äì George Clooney. Now, I love Clooney, I think he's a wonderful actor and you can't help loving that Hollywood charm. Gravity, however, was not the vehicle for this charm. I found the character irritating and completely out of place. I understood the need for the role of Matt Kowalski, but perhaps with a different personality.<br/><br/>The one-dimensional supporting character was made even more irritable because of the unintelligent script. A lot of the dialogue here was hokey and full of clich√©, which was a little bit annoying. It wouldn't have been so annoying, had the other facets of the film not been so brilliant. They were, though, and I wish the script had been too.<br/><br/>However, overall, Gravity is still a fantastic film. Clooney's performance really isn't that important in the grand scheme of things, and you're not going to watch this film for the great script. You should be watching Gravity for its ground-breaking use of special effects, it's changing of the way science fiction and 3D will be viewed in the future, and it's engaging story and strong central performance.<br/><br/>Gravity is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best sci-fi movies in the last five years. Watch it. In 3D."

","As a long-time follower of the human spaceflight programs I was looking forward to Gravity insanely much. My expectations were sky-high ;) and I was not disappointed. It is quite likely the most beautiful film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This is not a futuristic film. Unlike most space films it is based on real spacecraft and the chronology is just a little bit off with the mix of a Space Shuttle (retired), the Hubble Telescope (current), the International Space Station (current), and the Chinese space station Tiangong (projected). This is a portrayal of the work and risks that face actual astronauts right now. Sure, there are plenty of scientific inaccuracies to count, but all of them are rather minor and are there too provide creative freedom for the story to be a real tour-de-force. I'm willing to accept all of them except the one crucial plot point that is based on an annoying inaccuracy, but I will not spoil it for the reader, nor did it spoil my full appreciation of the film. After decades of seeing actors walk around in their spacecraft (with the small-scale exception of Apollo 13), here we have them floating around freely in a marvelous simulation of microgravity. Finally! Also, sound is not transferred through empty space. The only sounds heard in Gravity are the ones transmitted through matter or radio communication, so you get the strange new experience of silent explosions. The score does however break the illusion a bit, but it's a damn good score.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n shows that he is one of the few directors who knows how to use 3D technology to its full potential. I have repeatedly been disappointed to see that most Hollywood directors stick to their traditional formula of fast-paced cuts, not seeming to care how annoying this is to the viewers who constantly have to re-focus their eyes and lose the sensation of floating along with the action. Cuar√≥n however knows that long takes is the stuff that dreams are made of. He got plenty of practice in his 2D masterpiece Children of Men (on which Emmanuel Lubezki also was the cinematographer), and even though Gravity is more reliant on CGI we are still treated to a number of astonishing long takes that sends us on a crazy roller-coaster ride that might just get you space-sick. This is how 3D should be used!<br/><br/>The story has its flaws, but even they are minor. The plot is almost non-stop excitement and it manages to toy with my emotions on several occasions. The prospect of dying alone in the dark void sure comes through in all its scariness. George Clooney is steady as a rock and gives a great performance, but the big star is Sandra Bullock. As a rookie astronaut who struggles with all her strength, she uses her entire array of abilities and is just amazing. The backdrop of the Earth below is portrayed in its full breath-taking beauty, as is the starry sky above, and the detailed spacecraft in between. The motion of objects in microgravity and near-vacuum give us the rules of the game, and even people who aren't too well read on rocket science should be able to follow.<br/><br/>This film is a visual delight and a pure show of state-of-the-art film making. It takes the audience on a wild ride just over the life-giving Earth which looks so close but is so far away for the poor space travelers who desperately struggle to survive. I highly recommend seeing Gravity at the cinema in 3D. It just won't be the same on your home screen. I've seen it twice so far and I just want to come back for more.

","Working as an usher for my local theater, I have the unique opportunity to hear the wide variety of opinions that movie-goers have towards each movie.<br/><br/>The way I see it, there are two main types of people who see ""Gravity""; those who ""get"" it and love it sincerely, and those who don't and find it boring. Those who ""get it"" tend to have a deeper understanding of literary elements and can appreciate the movie's mastery of symbolism, suspense, and cinematography. Being aware of my personal bias, I would say that these people tend to come off as being more of the intellectual type, often expressing an interest in movies with more depth over action, such as ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Enough Said"". <br/><br/>Meanwhile, those who don't ""get it"" tend to fall into a very different demographic. Being typically younger, these people comment on ""Gravity"" as boring, too slow paced, and not very interesting. I often find these people on their way to see ""Bad Grandpa"" or ""Escape Plan"" next, showing a preference for entertainment value in a movie over something with more depth. <br/><br/>This isn't to say that there are no shades of gray. Occasionally I run into people with unexpected opinions about ""Gravity"". In one particular instance, I spoke with a woman who had worked for Boeing for most of her life until she retired. While serving her popcorn, we chatted about many things, and I came under the impression that she would be the type of person to have enjoyed the movie, but when I asked her about it, her response was quick and concise, ""It made me angry."" She told me about how she couldn't get passed the scientific inconsistencies that were littered about the movie, completely distracting her from what she admits could of been a very enjoyable movie. I have to admit, she had a point.<br/><br/>Personally, I have to say that ""Gravity"" is perhaps one of the best movies of year. Being someone who can usually predict the course of events in a movie, I was kept guessing at the edge of my seat throughout almost the entire length of the story. I was moved to tears as Ryan (Sandra Bullock) reached into the deepest trenches of human despair and, through a glimmer of hope, pulled herself out of it. I was dizzy with suspense as she reenters the atmosphere and nearly drowns during her baptismal rebirth. Almost every detail of ""Gravity"" serves a symbolic purpose. For example the Marvin the Martian toy floating out of the wreckage, juxtaposed next to gruesome dead bodies, highlights the disparity between the playful fantasy idea of space and the terrible hostile reality of it. Overall, I give ""Gravity"" a 9.8 out of 10. An almost perfect piece of art that is only somewhat inaccurate in its attempt to reflect the reality of human life in space."
"abdulx","10","4","8","3 November 2013"," Gravity is Pure Genius
","I just watched Gravity, and throughout the movie i just kept thinking to myself just how unbelievably genius Cauron is for creating this work of art. This is the best 3D i've seen since Life of Pi, sure there are few scientific errors (clooney sacrifice scene, debris cloud that chases people, etc) but it doesn't matter, the story, characters, performance, dialogue, Special effects, 3D, soundtrack, cinematography, camera work and the whole immersion triumphs any flaw this movie had. I don't throw around the word ""masterpiece"" easily but this really is one. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock truly surprised me with her performance, i guess she's just been doing the wrong movies but this one really brought out her true talents. The suffering she goes through in the movie is amazingly portrayed by her (and her eventual triumph) <br/><br/>I was surprisingly attached to clooney's character despite the limited screen time, this is another touch of genius by Cauron (who is now elevated to one of this generation's greatest directors). <br/><br/>Gravity is 2013's best movie hands down. I'm seriously considering a second viewing!"

","It is my prediction that this film will go down not as one of the best films of this year, but of any year. This film sets out and achieves the remarkable task of riding along with Dr. Ryan and looking out through her eyes as she works through external and internal challenges. Direct, spare, intelligent and triumphant. Movies have, in my humble opinion, been relegated to the exploitive and/or nakedly commercial. Stallone and De Niro star in predictable vehicles that look like excuses to pay off their vacation homes. Gravity, on the other hand, is a tight, tense, work of beauty and power. Tension and release - the elements of music, and humor and all great art. I cannot recall a film that created such a powerful experience for the viewer. There should have been seat belts in the theater."

","Less is more. Well okay, almost always less is more. This is true for the 2013 film, Gravity. An astronaut, a medical engineer, a handful of extras, a broke down space shuttle, and a couple of air crafts leave viewers on the edge of their seats as Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) must contrive and scheme in order to launch herself from space back to earth.<br/><br/>""I effing hate space,"" says Dr. Stone after a mess of debris forces Stone and astronaut, Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) to detach themselves from a space shuttle to escape death. Stone is pulled away from the space shuttle by gravity. Her radio, the only source of communication, cuts in and out throwing Stone into a panic attack which gobbles up her oxygen. Just when we think gravity might take over, Kowalski finds her afloat and brings her back to base.<br/><br/>There's no such thing as ""home base"" in space, especially when the space shuttle and the handful of extras are found dead. With limited oxygen, Kowalski and Stone make it to another air craft. A cord wraps around Stone's foot causing a major catastrophe. As the plot progresses in this Science Fiction thriller, the same rope that once saves Stone's life threatens it. Trying to escape a catastrophic fire, Stone cleverly rides a fire extinguisher like a heat-seeking-missile from one space craft to another. Just when you think she might be safe to return to earth, another crisis erupts. And, the climatic approach throughout Gravity lasts until the very end, when you as the viewer, realize that after watching Gravity, a vacation from life is in order.<br/><br/>Gravity is an epic force of nature. It's much like Danny Boyle's (2010) 127 Hours. James Franco's character, Aron Rolston, is biking through a canyon and falls victim to a boulder in the smallest possible crack in the earth. Rolston resorts to desperate measures in order to survive. Both, Gravity and 127 Hours have simplistic story lines, but are filled with action/adventure scenarios in which the audience is left with the Oh. My. God. expression. I watch with such intensity, only to be left with an exasperation of relief at the very end. When a plot is centered around a person as the protagonist and mother nature as the antagonist, 99 percent of the time mother nature wins. What happens to those who are clumped in the one percent tile?<br/><br/>I'll tell you...<br/><br/>It drives an original masterpiece into the stratosphere begging in $55.8 million opening weekend, and ranking Gravity as the number one film in the world."

Gravity deserves every Oscar that can be forged, it is just that good. <br/><br/>There are no gratuitous sex scenes, no sappy bullshit, no corporate logos or political innuendos in this film, just 90 minutes of gripping, spellbinding entertainment. This is one of the tightest movies I have ever seen, not one second wasted, no fluff, no quarter and no pause. From the moment you are in your seat, prepare to stay there and prepare to be absorbed by this tour de force of a film. The attention to detail is absolutely amazing, it's about the best I have ever seen. My popcorn and every edible half-popped kernel was consumed in the first 30 minutes and any thoughts of relieving an aching bladder during this film were discarded as the cinematic greatness manifested itself throughout the entire 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock was wonderful in this role, certainly an award-winning performance from beginning to end. I will try really hard to avoid Spoilers here, but this film is brutally real as there is no saving the day or head-turning suspension of disbelief. The scene in the Russian capsule where Dr. Ryan seemingly had accepted her inevitable fate...I won't say any more, just go see this film. <br/><br/>This movie received universal acclaim from the professional critics, but has been savaged by quite a few amateur movie critics who criticize the movie for two main reasons. First, the storyline is assailed as being mediocre or pedestrian, and others rail against the scientific accuracy of what is portrayed in the film. To this I say, codswallop. Many forget the purpose of movies, i.e. to entertain the audience, and this one does this in spades. <br/><br/>Just go see it, you will not be sorry. Five Stars out of Five."

","Fledgling astronaut Dr Ryan Stone (Bullock) ventures to the stars to upgrade the Hubble Telescope, she is accompanied by an experienced team of astronauts including veteran space-jockey Matt Kowalski (Clooney) . Suddenly a freak accident leads to Earth's entire orbit being littered with deadly debris . As events unfold an otherwise everyday mission becomes something quite out of the ordinary, a desperate journey of survival across the vacuum of space.<br/><br/>From the opening moment of Gravity, it becomes abundantly clear that it is an exceptional film. There will be an awful lot said about the technical brilliance of the sound, effects and cinematography of this film because all are quite unfathomable and enthralling. Camera movements are artfully seamless, graceful and sweeping, the viewer is effortlessly transported between the third person view where weightless objects career towards them, seconds later only to find themselves in the first person seeing though Ryan's panicking eyes her hyperventilating breath clouding her visor.<br/><br/>The technical wonder involved here is not what makes Gravity a truly great film however, it is simply a tool that allows the viewer to very quickly and effectively build empathy with the characters, and their plight. Ryan and Matt are likable characters, they are very human, genuine and flawed. They are believable to the extent that any technical mastery involved takes a back seat to the narrative and characterisation. For this is a film with a lot of heart and soul the themes are big, metaphysical and distinctly attached to the concept of what it means to be human.<br/><br/>Gravity is a film made for cinema and 3D, and this is the way it should be seen if you wish to see it at it's best, for no reason more complicated than because it is quite simply beautiful. Because of the themes involved here, Gravity will probably not be suitable for younger children.

","(I am writing this review after a space mission!) Gravity, a film about how a space mission goes awry post an unprecedented accident is undoubtedly one of the finest films to have released in recent times. <br/><br/>Most, if all, movies tell a story to which you are treated from a distant place. But this movie will take you along with it into outer space and that IS really, where the director and his crew succeed. Alfonso Cuaron (who apparently once dreamed of becoming an astronaut) has shattered all generic constraints and has delivered a cult, exciting and suave gem of a movie!<br/><br/>Earth shattering special effects provide solid foundation to the script. The stunning reality of the work will leave you and your thoughts floating long after you have left the cinema hall. The stupendous finesse rendered to the detailing of each and every of the few objects in space is something to be experienced in 3D in a cinema hall. From the Earth to the cords of the parachute to the logo on the space suit, everything is impeccable.<br/><br/>Ms. Bullock's performance is one to be applauded. For she taken this to a whole new level. With every tear drop that floats towards you, the actress adds new dimension to this movie, and sans her Gravity would be unthinkable. Clooney too impresses in his role as the ever so charming mission head. With virtually no other actor, this movie rides on the brilliance of these two.<br/><br/>With some spellbinding cinematography and soul-stirring music, gravity comes as a wholesome experience and will definitely satisfy any movie lover.<br/><br/>And finally we must thank Sir Issac Newton, for without his discovery the world wouldn't have been graced by this movie!<br/><br/>This space mission will, without doubt leave you pondering over the gargantuan and imminent nature of space and mankind's humble attempts to visit it. Take a bow Mr. Cuaron!"

","this could have been aired as a documentary on what do do when you are stuck in space. It is understandable why the movie was only 91 minutes long as the story line was a single event. not enough of a story to hold my interest. the view of earth was nondescript so what one is left with is the science of gravity and things floating in space. while those flying objects were fun to watch they merely ended up nowhere as all one could see in this film was SPACE. and did i mention that it was 91 minutes of SPACE. had i not viewed this film in 3D on the big screen I am certain it would have been a bore....though I would have watched it to the end just to see its conclusion. not disappointed that i saw the movie, just not sure what all the hype was about. I felt like a judge on ""the Voice"" waiting for someone to hit the ""high note"" that never came. I would never want to see this film in 2D, nor would I ever need to see this film again. While I am not saying the fierce dilemma that became the characters' motivation in this film was a ""who cares"" situation but really I didn't feel the character development allowed me to care all that much."

","To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour. William Blake These words came to mind after my experience with this movie event called Gravity. I've read the spoilers; I read the stories on the making of the film and how in its conception it was not technically possible to achieve; I counted the positive and negative reviews and always came back to my question ""How is it this film only recently came to my attention?"". I followed all the news as Jackson tried to keep the filming of his Lord of the Rings trilogy private with great attention. I knew the stories from numerous readings throughout my life and how blown away I was upon my first viewing of Jackson's interpretations (which unfortunately that excitement didn't spill over with the over-bloated Hobbit installments). Gravity offered just single word that ultimately captures both the scope and plot of the movie so perfectly, it would be hard to make it any simpler or complex.<br/><br/>The father and son teaming seems very successful in the sculpting of this story. I became aware of Alfonse during the Harry Potter days. Indeed, The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite piece of the franchise. Then he released the gritty ""Children of Men"" with his epic 7+ minute single shot exodus scene twords the end of the film. For me, sitting under water for 7 minutes would seem impossible, but I don't think I dared breath as the fighting raged on during that ending segment. I have also rarely (if ever) seen a movie where the cast of on-screen actors was limited to two for the duration of the film, with only voices being a part of the credit list.<br/><br/>As suggested before, this is not so much a plot driven movie as it is a personal account of a chain of events set in an ominously empty environment. You sit in a theater. The lights go out and suddenly you are projected into space. You sit like an astronaut in your seat but instead of a suit and helmet, you are holding your popcorn and observing the focus through a pair of special glasses (we were given the wrong ones). You are immersed in the dark. Action picks up fairly quickly, and as any good story that is based on the laws of Murphy you get bumped around from one catastrophe to another. I found myself actually flinching behind the 3D glasses as shrapnel gets thrown at you from the various wreckages and once again I found myself not breathing. Going into this knowing the length is only 90 minutes long, you are open to all sorts of parallel time lines. At the end, which leaves you back in something more familiar, you take a deep breath of satisfaction and know things are going to be ""All right"". My only comment that could be considered somewhat negative was once the right 3D glasses were obtained, my first impression was ""This is kinda like looking through a ViewMaster"".<br/><br/>With enough twist and turns, a solid beginning and a solid end and incredibly produced you wonder how other films that lay in the quagmire of mediocrity stand a chance to even make it to the big screen. Then again you realize that some directors have incredible talent and vision. I read somewhere that James Cameron was involved in the initial development and said it was impossible to do simply because the technology was unavailable. I am happy to say this did not deter Alfonse Cuar√≥n. His vision became an extraordinary reality.<br/><br/>I rarely go to an IMAX simply because I'm a cheapskate but I don't regret going to see this one bit. Confining this to a 60"" diagonal high definition screen could not possibly give you the scope and ""gravity"" of this movie. See it big. See it 3D if you can handle it. See it. -B"

","""Gravity"", the movie that's been talked about for quite a few months now, is something unlike any other. It has extremely beautiful shots, dazzling visuals, gripping narrative, and fantastic music. Alfonso Cuaron, director of the third ""Harry Potter"" film, has a guaranteed a spot as one of the masters of film-making with this film. <br/><br/>Set in space, a very intriguing setting, ""Gravity"" is a survival thriller about bio-medical engineer Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone and astronaut Matt Kowalski and their exciting tale in space as debris from a Russian anti-satellite test creates a chain of destruction that damage their space shuttle and leave them stranded in space. <br/><br/>The movie is pure thrill. There are so many unexpected situations and each of them is memorable. The suspense starts fairly quickly when their space shuttle is hit by high- speed debris. The music elevates the tension and therefore, each of the suspenseful scenes never fails to please the crowd. Dying and getting lost in space is quite a terrifying scenario and terrible way to end one's life, and therefore, you're going to be on the edge of your seats as the action ensues. <br/><br/>The visuals were magnificent. Space is intriguing and this movie provides plenty of space panoramas. We see different parts of the Earth from space and it's just splendid. I also loved that the shots were long, instead of short unsatisfying ones. The scope of the setting is massive, and this is meant to be seen in a large screen, possibly IMAX. The 3D is pure enhancements and it's definitely recommended. <br/><br/>""Gravity"" doesn't have too many characters to play around with. Instead, we focus on Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone, the female protagonist of the story. The other leading guy is Matt Kowalski, portrayed by George Clooney. By not having too many characters, we get to take a look inside these characters, really get to know them and this film does it, especially with the character of Dr. Ryan Stone. <br/><br/>The movie is headlined by two Academy Award winning actors and they are nothing short of excellent here. Bullock is so good in portraying the role of Dr. Ryan Stone here. She brought all the emotions here and was great. George Clooney was also impressive as the slightly cocky Matt Kowalski (although his role is less compared to Bullock's). They are experienced actors and this film shows just how professional they are. <br/><br/>Brilliant. That's the word for the film ""Gravity"". Never before have I seen something like this. It's gripping, it's beautiful, and perfect. This year has not been a very successful year for sci-fi but ""Gravity"" is different from the rest. It may contain more drama but it is nothing short of spectacular. Not all will find the brilliance but older audiences should discover just how magnificent this film is. ""Gravity"" is wow!<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""Gravity"" is an experience like no other and will engage audiences with its thrills, visuals, and plot as if it's gravity itself."

","Two astronauts floating in space - how could that possibly be a concept for one of the most riveting films I have ever seen, and be deserving of the adjectives mentioned in this review's title? And yet Gravity is without doubt one of the most absorbing, don't-look-away-can't-look-away films I've seen for a long time. There are some films (good, entertaining films) that you just watch. Then there are those rare films which have the power to draw you in and make you forget you are WATCHING. Instead, you are EXPERIENCING. That's Gravity. Apart from the astonishing, beautiful and epic scale of the film, with directorial and photographic moments reminiscent of David Lean and Stanley Kubrick, the original script will keep you guessing all the way to the final frame of film. Both actors give solid, convincing performances, but Sandra Bullock has finally been given a part capable of revealing her real talent. Her character has real depth, and (by some truly brilliant directorial techniques), you become completely empathic with her. Finally, one hopes, she may get that Best Actress Oscar that's missing from her award cabinet. ... and when a space film gets the seal of authenticity from ISS astronauts and NASA, it can't be THAT bad!"
"damir-odak","6","4","8","6 October 2013"," Nice, but...
","The movie is visually beautiful and tense, but it takes as much care about laws of physics as Harry Potter serial does. To avoid spoilers, I won't be too specific, but watching the movie reader will understand. Rule of thumb (avoiding technicalities) - to maintain stable orbit on certain altitude object needs to have specific (angular) speed relative to the center of the earth. For example ISS performs DAP (avoidance procedures) -moving significantly up or down by increasing or decreasing speed by 1m/s. Therefore, when increasing speed object will move in higher orbit, decreasing speed it will move to lower orbit. Aiming at space station from 100 miles distance and then accelerating significantly in its direction wouldn't bring you anywhere near it. If the orbits were perfectly aligned, one would end up few miles above of below it. Disregarding that, approaching station with speed difference of, let's guess 30m/s, isn't good idea. If aimed correctly, astronaut would end up as fly on windshield, with or without auxiliary source of thrust. Cloud of debris, due to earlier mentioned rule, can't return on the same ""place"" unless orbits were perfectly aligned in opposite direction. Besides, If speed of debris differs from target, they would move to different orbit. Just to mention that Hubble orbits almost 100 miles above ISS with different inclination. Moving between those two orbits is very complex task requiring quite lot of calculation¬Ö Still, after accepting Harry Potter as reality standard, I like the movie."
"DonB-5","7","4","8","5 October 2013"," Good movie but flawed physics
","The movie is a treat for the senses in every way. Visual, auditory, and fairly exciting. I enjoyed the movie (seen in 3D) and rank it fairly high in terms of good science fiction.<br/><br/>**SPOILER** **SPOILER** An issue I have is with one aspect of the movie that ignores the laws of physics, yet this aspect becomes a plot point from which all else follows. I'm guessing many (most?) won't know, notice, care about this - but those of us with a science background will catch it immediately.<br/><br/>When Bullock and Clooney overshoot the ISS and Bullock gets entangled in the Soyuz parachute cord, Clooney (still tethered to Bullock) zips by but then, as the tether reaches its max length, he is jerked to a halt. The reality is this would have triggered a shift in momentum back along the vector he was traveling - he would have ""bounced"" as it were and been pushed back towards Bullock. End of story, so the writers ignored this (see Newton's Laws). Even if the event portrayed was accurate, we clearly see that all of Clooney's momentum has been negated. So at that point, both Bullock and Clooney have zero momentum (relative to each other, relative to the ISS). At that point - Bullock could have grabbed the parachute line and pulled (momentum towards the ISS would be the result) or could have grabbed the tether and pulled Clooney towards her or Clooney might have been able to get out of the jetpack, give it a good push away from himself, and once again be pushed towards Bullock as he gained momentum in the opposite direction. In all cases - the 2 could have easily made it to the ISS. It would have been a better story in my opinion - killing off Clooney was just a plot device to give Sandra an ""all alone"" aspect.<br/><br/>There are several other flaws in how physics is ignored in the movie - but they are much more technical and it is a movie after all. Most would not notice."

The Gravity of the situation is the movie's story of a chain of events which happens after a explosion in space. The explosion projectiles destroy Stone's and Kowalski's space walk and the two must find a way home. A exciting story! The second theme what gravity actually does or lack of it does not do creates a problem as Stone and Kowalski drift through space. The lack a gravity causes great 3 D effects and creates dialogue for Stone(Bullock) and Kowalski(Clooney). The viewer experiences kowalski's character who is a leader is clam, problem solver, generous, moral, and optimistic. Stone is a reserved, shy and disillusioned person. The theme expressed for the characters is the gravity of life. Stone's daughter's death causes disillusion and doubt with life and her ability to get back home. Kowalski's is a hard charger who's optimistic charm pushes the situation forward. The gravity of situation is about going home and going onward in life. Gravity weighs in at an eight out of ten."
"Turfseer","9","4","8","5 October 2013"," A Space Odyssey meets Robinson Crusoe in this new American sci-fi thriller classic
","Very few American films today classified as 'entertainment', actually can rise to the level of Art. 'Gravity', the new sci-fi, 'Space Odyssey-like' thriller, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, I'm happy to report, has made it into that pantheon. You would never imagine that a film that only features two actors, can be so compelling and captivating; but coupled with a barrage of extraordinary digital effects, co-writer and director Alfonso Cuar√≥n, has pulled it off!<br/><br/>The story begins with Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a bio-medical engineer and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), on a spacewalk outside their space shuttle, conducting routine experiments, when they're alerted by Mission Control in Houston that a Russian satellite has exploded and the debris field is headed straight for the shuttle (inciting incident). In a spectacular sequence, the shuttle is destroyed and Stone is hurled around in space still tethered to the craft, bouncing on and off of it, like a ping pong ball. When she's finally separated from the craft, Kowalski, utilizing his thruster pack to maneuver, saves her from floating out into space and they make their way back to the space shuttle, which they discover has been destroyed and the rest of the crew members dead (one of the astronauts who had been outside the craft, has his face blown off).<br/><br/>As we break into Act II, Stone and Kowalski must make their way to the International Space Station (ISS), if they have any chance of survival. The 'ticking time clock', so inimical to thrillers, is used to great effect throughout the film. Kowalski sets his watch for 90 minutes, because that's when the debris field, will make its first orbit around the earth, and come back and possible hit them again. While floating toward the ISS, we learn of Stone's back story (her daughter was tragically killed in a schoolyard accident and she then decided to devote her life to her work). Using the thruster, Stone and Kowalski arrive at the ISS, only to find the stakes are raised again, as the ISS crew has abandoned ship and the Russian Soyuz space module has been damaged, useless for re-entry to earth. Even more thrilling and shattering is that Stone finds herself tangled in the already deployed parachute from the module and is holding on to Kowalski, whose weight is causing the parachute cords to break.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, 'Gravity' avoids Hollywood endings by realistically arguing that space exploration is a danger business‚Äîand may result in death. Stone finds herself alone after Kowalski 'cuts himself loose' and we approach the 'dark moment' of the second Act, as Stone must maneuver the damaged module to a Chinese space station, Tiangong. But when she discovers that the module has no more fuel, it appears there's no hope. Stone's hopelessness is highlighted when she reaches a farmer on a short wave frequency, who doesn't speak English. The dark moment of the second act, always results in the protagonist discovering a solution to the problem; that happens during her hallucination that Kowalski has returned to help her, advising that she can still use the re-entry rockets to move the craft.<br/><br/>Now the protagonist must implement the 'solution' as we head toward the climax in Act III. There's more spectacular, edge of your seat machinations, when Stone uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster, to get herself over and into the Tiangong. I won't go into the rest of it, except to say that Stone must not only get herself out of a real pickle during the fiery re-entry to earth, but must solve a new crisis, after splashing down into a body of water, in a remote section on earth.<br/><br/>While I've been hard on Sandra Bullock, especially for her recent lame performance in 'The Heat', here she proves (when given the right material) that she's as good as any of the top stars out there today. It's an extraordinarily nuanced, low key performance, coupled with some physically demanding stunts, which I suspect were not all dependent on digital effects. Do you hear 'Oscar' calling? Clooney too is masterful, as he also delivers just the right kind of restrained performance to make this whole thing believable.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n has admitted that not everything we see on screen is physically or scientifically possible. But so what! Much of the technical aspect is true to form and looks quite believable. 'Gravity' is much more than a spectacular visual feast‚Äîit's about a struggle against overwhelming odds. When Bullock (Stone) emerges from a watery tomb, after 'going it alone', a la 'Robinson Crusoe', there is the sense that we've just witnessed an awe-inspiring, story of survival and an uplifting paean, to the human spirit."
"ChristianUnchained","9","4","8","4 October 2013"," A Chilling, Heart-Pounding, and Unbelievable ride
","Score Disclaimer: I want to give this film a 10, but I will wait until I see it again for a second opinion. <br/><br/>Gravity is an incredible film. Absolutely incredible. Peerless in direction, Gravity features career defining performances from Bullock and Clooney, absolutely stunning, top-notch special effects and incredibly effective drama that brings this seemingly simplistic idea and narrative to life. But above all, Gravity is the most fantastic space movie ever made. <br/><br/>Gravity is filled with visual splendor, and packed with layers of metaphor and meaning (much of which I am still debating with colleagues on)! I haven't come out of a film for a long while equally blown away and perplexed, in a good way of course. I love films that are appreciable by both audiences: those looking for entertainment (Which they will receive in spades), and those looking for a film that transcends being a film in the sleekest of ways. Other elements of the film are peerless; the cinematography is beautiful, the minimalist score is effective, and the sound design is perfected. <br/><br/>It's hard to describe my feelings towards Gravity without abusing my ""positive adjective"" collection, but I'll just say the Gravity is pretty darned close to perfect. It's original, intense and very entertaining. It's also highly re-watchable with a purpose; it's packed with genius and beauty. <br/><br/>This is one perilous journey I personally want to experience over and over, deciphering it's layers and themes. It will forever stick in my memory. A one of a kind, incredibly exceptional experience. <br/><br/>Side note: 3D usage transcends Avatar and my personal favorite of the summer Pacific Rim. It's essential to the experience, and proves to be one of the finest in-theater experiences ever."
"dvd4040","10","12","34","3 December 2013"," If you see one movie for the rest of the year, make it 'Gravity'. It's the perfect film.
","If 'Gravity' was the last movie I saw before I died, I would die happy. This is hands down, the best film of the year so far, and quite possibly the best film of the last several years. Alfonso Cuaron has come back with a vengeance after a seven year hiatus. Cauron directed 'Children of Men' and the third 'Harry Potter' film to name a couple. I know all of you have seen the trailer for this film, and let me just say, you're in the for the most thrilling ride of your life.<br/><br/>Not since Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' has space been so beautifully photographed. 'Gravity' is not ‚Äì I repeat, NOT a science fiction film. It's a survival story of man (George Clooney) and a woman (Sandra Bullock) trying to get back to Earth by any means necessary after a catastrophic accident happens just above Earth as they are fixing a new satellite. There are no aliens, futuristic space crafts, or fancy weapons. Just the regular NASA gear. This short highly intense 90 minute film will leave you on the edge of your seat, your mouth open, your eyes watery, and your mind blown with questions like ""How did they do that?""<br/><br/>George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut named Matt Kowalksy who likes Hank Williams Jr. and telling wild stories to his past to Houston down below. He is the pilot of the rocket ship while scientist Ryan Stone (Bullock) is fixing a problem on the satellite. However, the Russians launched a missile at one of their own failing satellites, which has caused the debris to collide with other satellites and space stations that has caused a giant spread of debris traveling around Earth faster than a bullet, and it's headed right for Kowalsky and Stone.<br/><br/>Of course, the worst happens, and now the surviving two members of this mission are without a shuttle back to Earth and must get back to Earth somehow before their oxygen in their suits runs out. Through drifting through space without hooked on to anything, to colliding with other space stations, things are highly terrifying for the pair of astronauts.<br/><br/>The film centers mostly on Bullock as she has only had six months of astronaut training and has to figure out how to navigate ships, put out fires in space, and come to terms that she might not make it back home. There are a few very emotional moments with her, where we completely feel how scared she is. And Cuaron's camera never misses anything, let alone has more than 12 edits in the entire movie. Hell, the first 30 minutes of the film are all one continuous shot, and it will truly take your breath away.<br/><br/>Clooney is very charming in this role as he is in every role and does a flawless job, but Bullock really shines here as she shows every emotion we would all go through in a horrible situation like this one. I have no doubt that she will be nominated for an Oscar for this role, and if she wins, well she deserves it.<br/><br/>The effects are some of the best effects I've ever seen on screen. I honestly can't tell if they actually shot the film in space above Earth with real space crafts, or if there was any use of special effects. It's that good. Of course there are special effects, but you will never be able to tell. Every shot of the film, could be paused and framed, and put up in an art gallery. It's that beautiful.<br/><br/>And if you see this movie, which I highly suggest you do, see it in IMAX 3D. Yes, I said 3D. I am not a fan at all of 3D, but 'Gravity' has the best 3D effects and picture I have ever seen in a film thus far. If every film that said it was 3D, was this good, I would be a fan of 3D. Steven Price composed this monumental score for 'Gravity' that will truly terrify you and make your hairs stand on end. It's the perfect and unrelenting score for a film like this.<br/><br/>If you see one movie for the rest of the year, make it 'Gravity'. It's the perfect film."

","Stunning! Yes! Its beautiful and if you have to see it, definitely see it in a 3D IMAX or you really will have wasted your money.<br/><br/>Take away the special effects and it is really a bad movie. Sandra Bullocks' character is not likable at all, I couldn't have cared less what happened to her. The dialog and actions of the astronauts are cheesy and patronizing. You do get a sense of the isolation that astronauts must experience in space, but this is cheapened by the clearly ridiculous and impossible things they do in space.<br/><br/>All fur coat and no knickers as they say. If you're going to an IMAX theater my money is on Hubble 3D instead. The trailer for it before Gravity was the best thing about the whole movie experience!"
"tao902","1","6","14","15 November 2013"," Not even a B movie.
","We know that marketing can sell products that are less than good but how trailers, reviews and previews have managed to convince so many people that this is a great movie is beyond my comprehension. This movie is dire. The story is weak, unengaging and unbelievable. The characters evoke no pathos and empathy in the viewer resulting in an experience that is woefully dissatisfying. Sandra Bullock, supposedly a trained astronaut, begins by complaining about feeling nauseous in space and rapidly moves to ongoing pleas for help as she is thrown around in space. Whilst this would probably be a frightful experience George Clooney fortunately manages to stay calm and gradually secure some kind of rescue for the distressed damsel. He should have thought of himself! OK, so we have impressive 3D visuals but after 10 minutes of extreme depth of field anyone whose thoughts are drifting from the less than riveting storyline is likely to begin contemplating how 3D movies don't actually simulate how our vision works. We are selective in what we focus on and 3D films offer us visual information that is frequently irrelevant. Save the entrance fee and cost of the spectacles and go see a good story told well e.g. Blue Jasmine. Gravity isn't even a B movie."
"kaydenp","1","6","14","7 November 2013"," Wildly Unrealistic and Problematic
","This was literally the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not relate at all to the story line or the characters. Usually I jump a lot when I see suspenseful movies with a lot of tension. I was very bored despite seeing the 3D version of this film. <br/><br/>The movie did not represent something that was likely at all. NASA protocol would never allow for astronauts to stay outside if satellite debris was floating around, they would have them return to the shuttle immediately, regardless of it being in their orbit or not. A lot of the issues the characters faced would never have happened. Sandra Bullock would have been wearing WAY more clothing under her space suit, but the director felt it was necessary to have a mostly naked woman in space. (Not to mention she doesn't even have shoes at the end and she's in the middle of nowhere). <br/><br/>The unkind reference to transgender people was completely useless other than a political statement. (I am referring to the story of the short man at Mardi Gras... the detail that he was transgender had ZERO relevance to the story and could've been avoided).<br/><br/>Also, there would NOT be astronauts that could not communicate at all. I found this film to be racist towards Chinese people. They implied that the Chinese astronauts knew NO English and were howling in despair.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention that the female character just HAD to be saved by the male character even though he died? This movie paints women as incapable and relying on men (as usual). The actors should be ashamed of themselves for taking part in this movie. Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are famous enough that they did not have to do this movie the way they did. They are not hard up for money, starving artist types. They could have spoken with the director about the script problems or just not done it at all.<br/><br/>There are more problems, but I will stop here. I couldn't even enjoy the graphics this movie was so bad. Earth didn't even look geographically correct when they showed clips of it."
"dgade","1","5","11","27 July 2014"," Possibly the worst ever
","I'd heard a few generic comments about this move which lead me to think it would be good. Boy was I wrong. For someone with the vaguest notion of how things actually take place in space it became obvious within the first 30 seconds that this movie would be painful to endure. It was.<br/><br/>It is clear that the creators had no idea about the elements of orbital dynamics, rendezvous and docking, space to ground communications, EVA performance, mission specialist expertise and training, or the propagation of space debris. Each of these are central to major plot points and each of them are presently in a deeply flawed and wildly farcical manner.<br/><br/>For a viewer even moderately educated in technology, enduring this stupidity is a trial. More importantly for viewers who don't know how deeply flawed this story line is, they're likely to assume that the movie is a reasonable presentation of the environment. The producers have gutted basic physical laws to find excuses for drama and explosions. In the process they have made major progress in lowering our collective knowledge of the real world.<br/><br/>I suspect if these producers had done Titanic it would have been something like this: Titanic leaves from Miami. The Soviets determine there is a secret microdot on-board, so they have a nuclear sub tow an iceberg into it's path. The iceberg is hit and the ship starts to sink. The crew panics, so Jack takes over as captain and Rose takes over running the engines and boilers single-handed (because she learned how to do that in finishing school.) They decide to dock the ship, and so sail to the iceberg and tie up. Realizing the iceberg won't save everyone, they chip off some ice, put it in their drinks, and think of a new plan. They decide they can patch the hole with whale blubber, so they get the shrimp from the galley, stick it on the anchor, and lower it as a giant fish hook. They immediately catch a whale and use the blubber to patch the hole in the hull. Unfortunately, the whale they caught - Flubby - was the favorite of the pod. The rest of the pod start attacking the ship in anger. Jack realizes the only solution is for him to swim for help, so he jumps overboard and swims 300 miles to land. He finds help, but realizing the ship only has 15 minutes to live, he had to convince the Coast Guard to use their new, experimental 40' rescue boat - the only vessel that can cover 300 miles in 15 minutes. They arrive in the nick of time and load all 2200 people on-board the 40' boat.<br/><br/>Someone learning the history of the Titanic from that script would be in the same position as someone learning about space from this disaster.<br/><br/>The movie also attempts to pay homage to others; probably 2001 and Barbarella. It is an insult to both (and Barbarella was more realistic).<br/><br/>The CGI was probably good, but using decent CGI on this story is like Monet painting on a giant horse turd, The result may look pretty but it still stinks and draws flies.<br/><br/>It would have been so easy to create a credible movie, set in space, that celebrated human resilience. But that would have meant giving up explosions and treating the audience like they had a brain."

I kept waiting for it to develop into something that didn't suck such an unbelievable amount of Rhino--something worthy of acclaim (acclaim despite a terrible start).<br/><br/>If I were the force of gravity, I'd want to sue for slander.

","The only thing I have to say about this movie is if NASA really do employ astronauts as inept,winging and useless as the bunch depicted in this movie then its a miracle they ever got anyone into space at all never mind on the moon. This is the worst film I can remember in years and I can truthfully say I will never watch it again because it is too boring and pointless to even consider having to sit through it again. The special effects are good yes but so what the special effects are good in most films in the modern CGI era and we now accept that as a matter of course anyway so why on mother earth everyone is ranting about the oh so brilliant special effects when they are just the norm in most films nowadays is beyond me. The storyline was for the 5-10 age group at best and the dialog between the actors was written on the back of a fag packet in about 10 minutes. That is all you need to know about this film, don't buy it, don't rent it don't see it at the cinema, its a waste of your money and you will realize it about 15 minutes in. If you must see it out of sheer curiosity like I had to then get it for free by downloading on the torrent sites and it will be the best money you never had to spend and you will feel so money supermarket afterward."
"RCD1321","1","5","11","31 January 2014"," Proof that originality is dead
","First off... I didn't go into this film with very high expectations, and that's probably why I wasn't as disappointed when the credits started. It is a visually stunning film, don't get me wrong there, but mercy is it an easy to skip movie. The plot is simple, and so is everything else. Bullock and Clooney are a pair of astronauts repairing Hubble when Houston gives word that the Russians launched a missile to destroy an old satellite which creates a mess of debris circling the earth at 20,000MPH. Of course if you watched the trailer you know that the debris hits and strands the two hapless stars in orbit high above earth with no way home. And that's when the frustration set in. <br/><br/>I used to say that any great actor/actress could save a horrible script. This was simply not the case. Bullock is great, but she gets very annoying in this film- and her character is about as dumb as a brick. Clooney babbles incessantly about nonsense for a good portion of the film, and doesn't act like a professional astronaut. The dialog is often laughable and way too candid to be realistic at all. Now I have to go back and watch some of these two actors' better films just to wash the nasty taste out of my mouth.<br/><br/>Speaking of realism... Some of the things Bullock's character does in this film teeter on the verge of what you'd see in a bad video game. Without giving anything away I'll just say that the viewers are exposed to three ""stunts"" (it's all CGI anyway) repeated a few times. It's as if the writers liked how one dilemma looked, repeat, did another dilemma, and repeat. Not to mention the complete lack of scientific research as to what happens in the vacuum of space. <br/><br/>DO NOT READ THIS PART AS IT CONTAINS A SPOILER... You've been warned. In the end, I reflected that this movie was silly, unrealistic, I didn't sympathize with the character at all, and I thought that Sandra Bullock's character is the luckiest person in the history of humanity... 5 times over! Only luck could have brought her to the end, as she makes one miraculous life-saving maneuver after another that in the real world would have left her cold and dead in the empty vastness of space.<br/><br/>This movie flat out sucked. If you want a good space film, check out Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff."

","I would have voted zero if possible. Film would have been better if there were no actors. I don't usually jump on to leave a review, but after this awful piece of writing I felt compelled to give my two cents. First, if you believe for one minute that they would send a crew into space that were not familiar with one another you probably liked the movie. Second, the good DR admitted she could barely land the U.S. Shuttle in the simulator but has no problem reading and writing in Russian AND Chinese,power their vessels and manipulate the controls. By the way, how exactly do you slam into an object in outer space and not become space putty? Third, after being stranded in zero gravity, which you would not be able to tell by Sandra's hair, how is it her muscles remained as strong as they have to where she can just swim away from a capsule that for unknown reasons did not burn up into millions of pieces during re-entry. This movie has more flaws than the ACA. If you value your time and money stay farther away from this film than the MIR Space Station was from the Shuttle."

That is where the good points end.<br/><br/>The movie starts with 2 of the astronauts fooling about with the equipment while the other works. Are we supposed to believe that this is what would be happening? Then a satellite gets blown up and takes out several other satellite's almost immediately!! The probability of this happening is insane. Satellites are all on different orbits at varying altitudes ranging from 0km to 35,786km.

I thought I was getting used to wearing two pairs of glasses in a bid for the visual impact and everything 3D films pack, but they apparently were much too obsessed with packing this baby with copious amounts of debris ripping your retinas scenes. I loved them, and I walked out of cinema stuffed to the gills and feeling queasy. Huge portions for bulimic audience are made not to whet your appetite, they are ruining this otherwise alright movie because they wanted this baby so larger than life that it appeals to all palates, like on the spur of the moment they kinda decided a woman with some extra platinum vaginae are hotter than lesser chicks.<br/><br/>Of course their decision set off a chain reaction as implausible as the one caused by Russian satellites in the movie, they expect everything to work fine in the form of traditional sci-fi from last century, as if space walk is still conceptual and space stations are not floating in orbit. The jokes they cracked would have worked fine if it were at least set in the near future. Don't mess with what's already public knowledge courtesy of the media, such as that they do receive intensive training before going up there, and few of the complex maneuvers are carried out to the accompaniment of shopworn banter.<br/><br/>And they are basically two insipid word spewers who talked till everyone else died and talked some more: ""I miss my daughter who committed suicide at four cuz she couldn't take more of my constant nagging"" and Clooney went ""I have flirtatious eyes, we are running out of time and oxygen, but I'll ogle you some more"". When Clooney died, Stone freaking talked with herself and woofed to dogs down there via the radio, getting only lukewarm response from them, apparently they don't like a heavy breather who barked like an asthmatic Labrador. <br/><br/>However, for those who said no one see objects moving faster than bullets, you do see supersonic aircraft.

It is a movie with two characters, and the performances of both are routine and expected. There is some highfalutin' intent on the producer's part about the meaning of the whole episode, but that is well hidden by the dialog. The Clooney portion of the script is very breezy. In the opening sequence, he flits, mechanically, around the outside of the space craft in an effort to break a Russian's record for untethered floating around in space. It adds nothing to the dramatic tension (if ever there was any). Stone's portion of the script is an endless series of pants. She never seems to catch her breath, which becomes annoying.

My wife and I did that with Gravity.<br/><br/>Believe me, I would love to love this film, but in all honesty, I can't. After five minutes, you've seen all there is to see. Yes, the animation department has done its job, but that's about it. The script is terrible, the director has done a poor job, even the actors, once known as A-list folks, are the worst I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Obviously, we are expected to believe a bunch of baloney:<br/><br/><ul><li>Dr. Stone is a medical doctor, but gets an engineering job in space.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dr. Stone and her colleague Matt Kowalski still address each other by their formal titles, and Kowalski doesn't know if she has kids until in the middle of their space mission.

He hovers around in space with ease, and, where necessary, with the aid of a fire extinguisher. But when his secret love interest (yeah, isn't she adorable in her cute little space suit?) is connected to the space station with a rope, and he holds on to her, he decides out of nowhere that ""the rope is not strong enough to carry us both"", and he lets go, not even trying to get back with the tools he used to exploit before, but happily vanishing in space.</li></ul><br/><br/>I could go on and on. Not one moment did I care for those ridiculous characters. And as to the dialog, I always thought multiple writers would improve at least that part of the script. To wrap this up, I have two questions:<br/><br/>1. Should NASA sue the production company? <br/><br/>2. Has Hollywood become a bunch of babies fooling around with huge budgets? Or are they grown-ups who have discovered that feeding babies is a lucrative business?"

After 15min I was already quite disappointed to realize that the 3D depth is nothing special when you have the black flat background of the space as in this movie. I did not like at all the part of the movie where the camera was turning around forever, with the clear intention to make people sick. They manage it perfectly and I could only close my eyes for 5min. Unfortunately i could not close my ears and stop the never-ending loop of fake breathing sounds. The rest of the movie is obvious, the story (if there is one) is incredibly unrealistic while pretending to be realistic. The acting is amazingly boring and fake looking. If you fell asleep in the middle and you wake up 10min before the end you do not lose anything. At one point i just wanted the movie to finish.

","""Children of Men"" director Alfonso Cuar√≥n's lost-in-space saga ""Gravity"" with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney qualifies as an above average science fiction film. Basically, this authentic looking outer space epic deserves Oscars for its special effects and production designs. Arguably, ""Gravity"" belongs to the sub-genre of factual science fiction films like Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" (1995), John Sturges' ""Marooned"" (1969), and Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968). Unfortunately, ""Gravity"" suffers from a devastating case of narrative anti-climax. In other words, after the catastrophic opening scene, nothing comparable occurs during its remaining 80 minutes. Worse, the astronaut who survives this disaster turns out to be a dull, tight-lipped individual with no family back on Earth. Despite its white-knuckled gauntlet of predicaments, the thinly-plotted ""Gravity"" has little to offer other than some modest thrills when our hero and heroine are walking in space. This straightforward, no-nonsense, claustrophobic thriller boasts a false surprise and a string of unlikely but plausible incidents. Imagine a movie built around a house fire with an individual battling to escape the blaze narrowly before everything burn up, and then put the burning edifice into orbit, and you've got ""Gravity."" Aside from its female protagonist, little about this $100 million outing is fresh. The result is a scenic but second-rate chick flick that relies on pure action rather than plot.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" takes place about 375 miles above Earth. Astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney of ""Solaris"") and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock of ""The Heat"") are members of the NASA space shuttle Explorer. They have been dispatched to perform repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope. Terror occurs with little warning when Russian space debris from one of their own satellites that they destroyed strikes the space shuttle and kills everybody but Stone and Kowalski. A good ole boy from the top of his head to the tips of his toes, the extroverted but avuncular Kowalski is a veteran astronaut on his final mission before he retires. You can guess what happens to him in ""Gravity."" During her first walk in space, Mission Specialist Stone is conducting the repairs. She has trouble dealing with the zero gravity conditions. Occasionally, she forgets that tools and parts float rather than fall, and she almost loses a part of a board that she is fixing. Stone and Kowalski learn from Mission Control (voice of Ed Harris of ""Apollo 13"") that they must abort their mission. The debris of a Russian satellite blasted in space is the equivalent of flying shrapnel that wipes out everybody aboard the Explorer and leaves Stone and Kowalski adrift. Kowalski wears a thruster pack that enables him to save Stone, but they cannot evacuate in the Explorer because the shuttle has been damaged badly. Instead, maneuvering with his thrusters, Kowalski drags Stone with him to the International Space Station. At this point, things take a turn for the worst. Kowalski quotes ""Star Wars"" hero Han Solo's popular line: ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" One of the astronauts dies so the other can live and leaves the other to contend with a challenging ordeal. Get back home to tell a whopper of a story or die in space.<br/><br/>Anybody who has heard astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson's criticisms about ""Gravity"" should bear in mind that it is a Hollywood movie that takes liberties with fact. Tyson would probably have improved ""Gravity"" in some small measure had the filmmakers used him as a consultant rather than Dr. Kevin Grazier who has served as an adviser for the SyFy-channel. Intelligent adults who paid to watch ""Gravity"" shouldn't be too concerned about the lack of authentic realism that disturbed Tyson. Ironically, even Tyson has gone on record to say he enjoyed ""Gravity."" Meantime, for all its realism, ""Gravity"" amounted to something of a letdown for me because it just was more one-dimensional than entertaining. First, neither of the two characters is particularly charismatic. Second, the 3-D doesn't enhance space or the vehicles where our heroes seek refuge. Rarely does 3-D work as it was originally designed, and the glasses are a nuisance from fade-out to fade-in that they hinder you from enjoying a movie. 3-D was designed so you could dodge all the stuff that filmmakers hurled at you to generate a greater sense of excitement. Nothing of consequence flies at you in ""Gravity."" Third, despite some fleeting moments of nail-biting anxiety, you know that once Cuar√≥n and his son Jonas who co-wrote ""Gravity"" have whittled down the two person cast (everybody else is a voice) to one that they aren't going to kill the last individual in space. Watching this survivor fool with a fire extinguisher, punch buttons on a console, and cry because nobody briefed this person about how to pray isn't my idea of a good movie. I'd rather watch space hokum like either ""Space Camp"" or ""Apollo 18"" because one made a great 'what-if' fable and the other was a horror chiller about why we haven't returned to the Moon. Finally, the best thing about ""Gravity"" is that it clocks in at 90 minutes. It remains to be seen how NASA will respond if ""Gravity"" makes believers out of all of us that space is the last place we should spend our tax dollars. I'd rather watch ""Apollo 18"" again with its cannibal moon rocks than the prosaic ""Gravity."""
"thetransmutator","10","5","11","8 October 2013"," Can't stop thinking about this film
","I must tip my hat off to the director, Alfonso Cuar√≥n. I honesty don't think anyone in Hollywood could have ever pulled this off the way he did. I am a huge fan of movies, especially sci-fi, thrillers, and drama themed movies and this film seemed to merge all 3 genres in one. The sheer claustrophobia from the pov from the actors view made you feel at times that you couldn't breathe and where in that space suit with them. Yet the grand, realistic looking CGI visuals of space and mother Earth made you feel the camera was actually filming from that very location.<br/><br/>I was not a fan of Sandra Bullock for many years. When she first came out in the 1990's I remember thinking she was an over-hyped, standard boring, whiny actress that the industry for whatever reason wouldn't stop promoting until she became a household name. I didn't think she deserved or earned any of the major roles she received throughout her career.<br/><br/>My mind did start to change when I saw the movie The Blind Side. I do seem to prefer her more serious roles and less of her predictable romantic comedies. Now after seeing this epic masterpiece of a film , I think Sandra has clearly learned a thing or two about screen presence and actually acting smaller to get a point across. She was simply brilliant and on her A game. When I say acting small. It's kind of what George Clooney does in all of his movies. You never see him putting on a show, he just acts. He acts like an normal guy in the same situation would act. It's so simple but it has the most desirable effect. It's real, and it's done well. Not every actor is expected to give us a character, like poor Johnny Depp who is plagued with every role he now lands having to be even bigger and more larger than life of the previous role.<br/><br/>Sandra in this movie is likable, easy to watch and you can believe her story and feel the pain/fear of her situation as the movie progresses. I have never felt that way about any Sandra Bullock performance until now. Without question an Oscar contender for both Sandra Bullock and Alfonso Cuar√≥n."

","I really wanted this film to be provocative, beautiful, and entertaining. 1 out of 3 isn't bad. It really was gorgeous to look at (in IMAX 3D). My son, who is 15, said it reminded him of something they would watch at space camp or one of those IMAX tourist traps. I have to agree. I have seen some wonderful IMAX films at places like Disney and other theme parks. It's a shame that that is really all there is to this film.<br/><br/>At a buck fifty running time there is no depth to this film. (funny because it is set in unlimited space) But it is pretty straight forward. Good looking tang people are working in space... Houston they have a problem... now it becomes a survival flick.<br/><br/>The actors were pretty well cast. However there wasn't a lot to do in an hour plus film without even a Wilson in it to talk too. I know a vast majority of movie patrons will feel it was pretty straight forward and thus underwhelming (other than visually). But there will be those that try to find symbolism, and meaning within this film. While I am not one to shy away from an , Look what the director did there!?!"" moment; there has to be more than viewer speculation to make a great film.<br/><br/>I almost felt like he didn't want to fill an extra thirty minutes with non dialogue scenes, and relying on Sandra to keep the audience interested. There was a film with half the visual money shots called MOON that never worried about the audience losing interest.<br/><br/>To be fair this is a wonderful condensed version of what adrift in space would feel like.

We enjoy the breathtaking ride through the dangerous outer frontiers. We also get to look inwards to the essence of our own minuscule humanity in stark contrast to the vastness of the universe. We will feel agoraphobia and claustrophobia at the same time while Stone and Kowalski struggle to keep themselves alive.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is not much of a story to be told by mere words, but a story that needs to be experienced best via the medium of film, and all its modern abilities. This film employs the best of cinematographic technique (Emmanuel Lubezki), editing efficiency (Cuaron himself and Mark Sanger), top-of-the-line 3D visual and eerie sound effects to re-create the harshness of outer space. The musical score by Stephen Price can be both soaring and quiet when the scene called for it. I truly see ALL the technical Oscars going to this fantastic technical team.<br/><br/>There maybe some scientific principles amiss as some incredible coincidences arise to move the story forward. However, we so care so much for our two characters that these minor details done in the name of artistic license can be overlooked with no big deal. The film successfully makes us feel emotionally connected with them. We are out there with them and we want to escape this scary and hopeless situation with them.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock comes up with a precious performance of a lonely person desperately confronting the biggest fears of her life in the bleakest of situations ever. Her range of emotions ran the gamut from fearful despair to hopeful determination. She is front, center and everything this movie is about. She did not lose her sense of humor when we also needed it. This has got to be a Best Actress performance of the highest merit. <br/><br/>Supporting Bullock is George Clooney as that believable voice of calm and reassurance we all need. With him there, Ryan felt she can overcome any adversity she faced. His wit and charm carried Ryan through her ordeal, and this was palpable enough to carry the whole audience along the ride with her.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" might as well be declared the Best Picture of this award season already.

"yusufpiskin","9","2","3","17 November 2019"," So Great?
","Yes. Yet another five star rating for Gravity. Before I go on, the five stars are for the experience. I don't know how you rate films, but my rating is for a great deal based on the fact that I just walked out of the theatre having seen something I have never seen before. Gravity is Jurassic Park's dinosaurs. It is a technological marvel urged on by a director who is intent on discovering how far he can stretch the medium. Many have said it and I have to agree. This was made for IMAX and probably shouldn't be seen any other way.<br/><br/>What makes Gravity so great? It is the totality of the immersive experience, the relentless ruthlessness of the script towards its characters and the fact that the pacing is immaculate.<br/><br/>The way Cuaron shoots his film, with his familiar fluid camerawork, creates the tether to the main characters. It's up close and personal. After the absolutely stunning opening sequence is over, we never really leave Bullock and co. We hover with them, sometimes even allowing access to their suit and experience everything through their eyes. This narrow focus is utilized optimally to create the unbelievable tension. Cuaron's choreography of the action is amazing in these scenes. Never losing sight of what is going on and genuinely taking you by surprise at points. In what is essentially a disaster thriller, immersion like this is a prerequisite for a connection with the audience. And boy did it connect with me. There were scenes that had me gasping for air, scenes that made me feel claustrophobic and scenes that had me shifting in my seat, urging our heroine on. The coldness of space is apparently one of the scariest movie villains imaginable.<br/><br/>The fact that the very lean plot keeps bombarding the characters with problem after problem means that there are very few moments to come up for air. These days films apparently have to run for at least 2 hours, especially the bigger films. Gravity takes 90 minutes, the perfect length for a movie. It is stripped of practically everything, we get the smallest of backstories about the characters and the plot goes from A to B like it should, leaving behind only the intent of the film. To grab you by your throat and take you on a ride you'll never forget. All in the guise of an extremely realistic thriller set in space.<br/><br/>Cuaron does seem to want to give us some pinpricks of an underlying theme running through Bullock's character arc. Cuaron literally allows her to be reborn. There is, what is perhaps the most beautiful scene of the film, a shot where she floats like an embryo. The crying of a baby, Buddha smiling down on her and of course the final scene, all show a rebirth of Bullock's character. Some might feel this change to be a bit heavy handed, I absolutely loved it. It works, mainly because of a very understated performance by Bullock. I normally don't care much for her, but she was excellent here, especially in the quieter, more intimate moments.<br/><br/>Gravity manages to appeal to a primal fear. The fear of the absolute nothingness. The coldness of the grave, here in the shape of the final frontier. It is a constant threat, a constant presence. And the main reasons for it working the way it does are the dedication to realism and the sublime cinematography. The latter is where the main innovation seems to lie. The line between what is actually shot and what is digitally created is completely blurred here. Everything jumps off the screen with resounding beauty and clarity. It is awe inspiringly gorgeous. I am fully aware I am gushing out a ludicrous amount of praise now, but the beauty of what they have created here left me gaping at the screen and that just doesn't happen often.<br/><br/>Gravity is a small step for a film, but a giant leap for cinema."

","Mexican director Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity is a spectacular enterprise that AWES us from the very first frame with its sheer brilliance and could well be counted among the defining movie experiences of our lives. If movies are an endeavour in collective dreaming, this is one hell of a dream which would remain with us, the viewers, for a very long time. For the cost of a mere movie ticket, the director transforms the audience into astronauts and transports them to space such that the entire movie hall seems suspended in space for about two hours.<br/><br/>The movie's plot, as such, deals with a catastrophe set in space and its aftermath. First time astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and her experienced mission commander Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are on a space walk mission with their team to repair the Hubble telescope. Disaster strikes when a debris cloud from an exploded Russian satellite comes hurtling at them. The debris destroys their shuttle, the telescope and also kills the rest of their crew and space-walk team, leaving them adrift and spinning in a very vast and lonely space without any means of communication to their command center on earth at Houston. The rest of the movie is a race against time thriller wherein they need to find each other and escape to the safety of terra firma. Yet, at the very heart of the movie is an engaging and inspiring tale of hope, resilience, courage and grit that defies overwhelming odds (of astronomical magnitude, one may add).<br/><br/>The brilliance of Cuar√≥n as a director, is in his intelligent and seamless enmeshing of the scientific spectacle, visual wizardry and a very human tale of hope. He creates a very vivid image of the loneliness and utter helplessness that confronts a human being in what could be one of the most hostile environments to endure and survive. Cuar√≥n creates an immersive experience for the viewer by effortlessly switching the viewer from a third person watching the action from a safe distance to a first person when we look at the happenings through the visor of Bullock. As a result, the helpless free-floating spin of Bullock and her breathlessness when her oxygen levels plunge are very real and palpable experiences for the viewers themselves. Cuar√≥n masterfully combines the skills of his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the visual effects team to present striking visuals with a silken flow as they effortlessly pan out to showcase the breathtaking beauty as well as the unending vastness of the space and zoom in to capture the tense expressions of the leads. There is also a remarkable eye for the detail, be it the careful and measured movements of the astronauts at work or their frenetic efforts to grapple at a hold to stem their free-fall or the floating specks of flame or even the globular drops of tears or other pieces of flotsam, which presents a well detailed and realistic setting.<br/><br/>For a movie that spans about two hours, Gravity depends almost entirely on, its aptly cast, two Academy Award winner leads - viz. an excellent Sandra Bullock and the suave, smooth talking George Clooney. Sandra Bullock puts in a riveting performance as Dr. Ryan Stone, bringing in just the right amount of vulnerability, melancholy and grit to the part. The significance of her performance is accentuated by the fact that, for the better part of this movie, she is the only human element who anchors the emotional content of this movie and in the process, lifts it from being merely a spectacular sci-fi eye-candy. The silent vastness of space filled with enormous, yet, empty distances between far flung celestial bodies and presenting beauty that is both captivating and foreboding alternatively, is the other major dimension of the movie<br/><br/>Gravity belongs to a small and rare category of movies that succeed in questioning and extending the hitherto known and accepted horizons of film-making. It is also one of the few movies which capitalises on the scope and depth offered by the IMAX experience to the hilt and is sure to be the front-runner for a clutch of technical categories including cinematography and visual effects at all major award events for the year.<br/><br/>This is a movie experience that inspires the viewers at several levels and is sure to spark many a young hearts to nurture the dream of donning a space suit. One also hopes that it would also inspire many more film-makers to conceive and conjure many such pioneering movie projects which could navigate the collective dream experiences of the audience to hitherto unexplored newer directions."

","As a quick cap on, this film is a survival film about an astronaut, played by Sandra Bullock, who is stuck in space after a catastrophe happens that ends her mission in space and strands her without any help on the way. That is the basis. It is directed by Alfonso Cauron, and his direction is much needed in this eye-candy film.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron is a fantastic director. His work on the Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men, the latter in particular, is nothing short of phenomenal. The long take, the attention to detail in the fore and back ground, all are a joy to see in films that have more to see each time you watch them. This is no different. There are moments where we move in and out of an astronaut's visor to get in and out of their traumatic experience, all within the fluidity of his signature long take, amongst gorgeous visuals.<br/><br/>Visually too this film scores very well. The images of Earth from space, the explosions, of which there are many I will unashamedly spoil, are similarly exhilarating to see. I had the downside of viewing the film on a 2D home TV. I got the impression that 3D would have been better for a viewing of the film, but it was still easy to appreciate the effort that went into the visual aspects of Gravity. The atmosphere from the visuals were very effective consequently and a joy to look at. Added to this atmosphere was a very effective and electronic score by Steven Price, that helped to enhance the film.<br/><br/>However, the film had glaring flaws that made apparent all the effort of the film's production went into the visuals. Foremost was the story. It was threadbare, and with 40 minutes to go, I stopped watching the film as I felt I had experienced all it had to offer. The films only substantial plot twist had occurred before this point, and so the films climactic ending was very predictable. Worse, the plot revolved entirely around something going wrong, and Sandra Bullock seeking a solution. This happens several times and by half way through, it felt repetitive and eye-rolling.<br/><br/>The characters were similarly dull. There are 5 characters in the film, of which 3 have a very small appearance, and so really there is only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. This is all fine; there are many films that nail 2 people casts by granting them compelling and complex personalities that you care about. However, neither George nor Sandra had interesting characters. George played the intelligent heroic figure; Sandra the damsel in distress, who appeared to be woefully unprepared emotionally and technically for a specialist mission in space, and spent the majority of the film panicking.<br/><br/>The characters were frustratingly one dimensional, left very revealing by the lacking script. Clooney had practically no backstory, and had absolutely no depth to his character. Clooney and Bullock both did their best with the roles, but the difficulty of such simple characters made their job acting hard. This heavily detracted from the overall experience of the film, because the interest I got in the film from the visuals and directing style was heavily reduced by the plot, script and characters, to the extent that I didn't finish it.<br/><br/>Personally I am very surprised at the reception this film has got by critics and the voters on IMDb alike. I went into this film expecting a thriller that was also good. I finished the film without reaching its conclusion, with the impression that it was well produced, but not well made. Alfonso did very well, but he made a graphical presentation, not a film.<br/><br/>The 5 is for the superb visuals, atmosphere, score and direction. The pros to this film are in abundance, but the flaws in plot and character were too large to make the film ultimately enjoyable. The film may have looked good, but if I didn't feel the impetus to finish the film, it doesn't score above a 5 with me."

Firstly, you fell sick constantly if you go there because there are no gravity and you can't stick to the same place. In which case, you can't control your body and are not easy to predict the moving of your body, so you are always like in the boat on the sea.

Of course it extremely unrealistic and most of the actions can be easily debunked, but that is an another story.<br/><br/>However nobody can take away the absolutely outstanding achievement in cinematography, editing, visual effects, sound effects, etcetera, that is exactly why this film won 7 Oscars, none of them for good acting or storyline of course, but still the movie has left its mark in film history, for sure. The graphics were truly outstandingly impressive, unfortunately that was the essence of this film, this film could have easily been one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made if only it had a better/more interesting story and the dialogue wasn't so dull and pointless.<br/><br/>It is worth watching just to enjoy the awesome visual effects, but other than that its plain, good thing it was only 90 minutes long. Has got to be one of the weakest plots ever, sadly. 4/10 for the graphics."
"nawal_bo","2","2","3","8 November 2015"," I can't see why the ratings are that high
","This is my first time writing a review, but since lately I have seen quite a few movies with high ratings that turned to be, in my opinion, quite a fluke, here goes. <br/><br/>First of all, I found the plot weak, illogical, and quite boring. I was tempted to stop watching right from minute 22 into the movie... I kept wondering why on Earth would someone who worked in a hospital for 18 hours be ever recruited to go to space. That connection escapes me... If it were an 'algorithm' she developed, I don't see why any of the NASA engineers couldn't have gone to install that themselves... still remains an unsolved mystery to me. <br/><br/>How could she get a transmission from Earth (Chinese guy with his baby and dogs) but not from Houston? Weird... <br/><br/>Why would the Russians just decide to blow up their own satellite? They did not just endanger the Explorer mission, but technically others (the Chinese???!!) as well. Aren't there any protocols for procedures like that? I'm guessing there should be because no one would want that to happen to their billion-dollar missions... I wonder... <br/><br/>It kinda seemed to me that the movie started somewhere in the middle of the events. A big chunk seemed to have been thrown out somewhere. <br/><br/>Acting was a bit strange: Sandra Bullock just gasping the entire movie, and George Clooney making weird oh-so-relaxed comments. Not sure what the point was exactly. <br/><br/>It just seems to me like an attempt to use fancy visual effects to mask a weak plot. Very unfortunate, and certainly does not deserve such a high score."

","Gravity (2013): Dir: Alfonso Cuaron / Cast: Sandra Bullock, George Clooney, Paul Sharma / Voices: Ed Harris, Amy Warren: Gripping space thriller with a title that seems to symbolize survival not just in space but also in overcoming grief. George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut on his final mission and Sandra Bullock plays a bio-medical engineer on her first expedition. Everything is routine in the quiet of space until high speed debris hits destroying their shuttle, killing a third engineer, and sending Bullock tumble floating rapidly into space. This is where both characters differ. Bullock is hyperventilating and losing oxygen from shock while Clooney is calm and uses his veteran skill to direct her back. It is dire straights for a race against time to regain shelter in another shuttle before another debris hits. Director Alfonso Cuaron tenses things up giving viewers a feel as to what being trapped in space would be like. He previously directed one of the best Harry Potter films with Prisoner of Azkaban. Both leads hold strong but it is Bullock's sense of helplessness that viewers can relate. She is skilled at the job and meets the disaster with only a hope at survival. She is given a back story regarding her deceased daughter, which led to her grief. Unfortunately smaller roles consist of useless mission command voices or astronauts that end up dead with little background. This works against the film when factoring the focus on star power as oppose to developing these minor roles further. Explosive special effects highlight a powerful film about staring uncertainty in the face until hitting home. Score: 9 / 10"
"simaoguedes-1415926","8","2","3","11 September 2015"," Quite an interesting film
","This is an interesting film. Weighing pros and cons, I actually recommend it if you appreciate some realistic drama situations.<br/><br/>Shortly after the film begins, disaster strikes. One of the most interesting things about this plot is that the disaster involved is so realistic that it could actually happen! This is a survival story which could really, essentially, be repeated. If you like realistic films, this is a good thing.<br/><br/>It is quite interesting to hear the conversations of the astronauts in the beginning, particularly with the slight humour and interesting stories of one astronaut.<br/><br/>After disaster strikes, the drama and thrilling is virtually constant; however, it is not scary or frightening, which makes it all quite interesting. At this point, the survivor(s) of the initial disaster (I shall not spoil who or how many they were) attempt(s) to stay alive ‚Äî and the way that this all happens is quite remarkable in every aspect; as I said, it is thrilling, and it makes you wonder what will happen next.<br/><br/>The outcome is, very simply, surprising. These all are good things I enjoyed in the film.<br/><br/>There were only a few things I disliked. The film is, in some aspects, scientifically inaccurate. For details, I recommend reading, in the FAQ section, the question, 'Did the film follow the laws of physics?' (may contain some minor spoilers ‚Äî perhaps you should read after watching the film, for a better comprehension).<br/><br/>Another thing that you may dislike if, like me, you are an evangelical Christian is that, at one point, one character prays to a dead person.<br/><br/>And, of course, as in most films nowadays, there are a few swear words (one F-word and a number of S-words), which also reduce the quality of the film. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to show this film to children. Beware, also, that some perhaps disturbing images are briefly shown, and that the entire drama of the film may just be too intense for some sensitive people (see Parents Guide for details).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, all in all, I must say it was a good film."
"geoffwoo99","8","2","3","1 September 2015"," Not JUST an escape movie set in space.
","I've seen this 3 times. Each time I got something new out of it.<br/><br/>The first viewing I thought it was an OK movie which depended on the 3D special effects to get it some viewings. And the 3D stuff WAS amazing. In fact visually it was truly beautiful. <br/><br/>On further viewings I got to appreciate that both of the cast of two (!) were excellent at commanding engagement and attention for the full duration of the film.<br/><br/>Deeper reflection afterwards had me thinking of several layers that this movie reached for me. The fragility of the human animal, and yet the drive to survive bringing forth an inner strength that is hidden when not under stress. The isolation (and freedom) of space; the need for our species to work with others to achieve success in the human existence; co-operation at various levels between nations, by remote support teams, the questioning and futility of national differences on this tiny blue planet.<br/><br/>Who ya gonna call when it all goes pear shaped? <br/><br/>All deep stuff. <br/><br/>The role of The Hero and his leadership. It's the good guys who always die first. And in this case he sacrifices himself for the possible safety of Bullock without even a second thought. (Discuss! :) )<br/><br/>Then there is the welcoming safety of Mother Earth. When Bullock eventually lands the colour saturation of sea and land is intense, the life giving light from the sun now contrasting with the empty deadlines of space. Is the message here ""value our planet, there is nothing else""?<br/><br/>The setting of space gives a macro view of our puny human existence, and puts it into it's true fragile context, despite egos on earth which claim to the contrary. <br/><br/>A movie that makes you think. And that's rare enough these days."
"silkandink","8","2","3","3 August 2015"," Subtle fantasy
","Acknowledging the factual flaws, choosing to ignore them makes the movie very enjoyable. It doesn't need to be scientifically accurate to be a great film. Don't let the seemingly vague dialogue fool you. This was one relatable movie with it's subtle and very real dialogue instead of the recent ""deep"" Hollywood movies. The panic and broken spirit is well portrayed, in my eyes explaining how easy it is to forget any training, being inexperienced. Bullock does a great job throughout the film, as does her counterpart Clooney, portraying the relentless veteran, trying to keep up her spirits just as much as his own. Depicting a catastrophe the movie is packed with action, but at points the viewer feels the Murphy's law weigh heavy on the plot, a bit too heavy. However all the things that can go wrong do so in a stunning manner, and it's a delight as well it's very captivating to watch. Beautiful to behold, simple in means of delivering emotion, it's a gripping piece that leaves you terrified, in awe and full of fighting spirit."

","Gravity is well-known as an multiple Oscar winner, thanks to the big praise from film critics. When I plan on watching this movie, I have low expectations because some people find it kinda nauseating because of the non-stop spinning of the astronauts. But after watching Gravity, I have to speak for all of us when I say it's an absolute out-of-this-world masterpiece!<br/><br/>We have Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who play as astronauts who are stranded in space after their space shuttle got destroyed. I fell in love with the performance, especially Bullock's! Bullock's performance is one the main reasons why I love this film to bits. You know the other reasons? I'll tell you, it's the amazing 3D visuals! The Earth is visually astonishing as for the rest of it, they're great! The pace is really acceptable, running over 90 minutes is much of appreciation for a film! I would leave the direction, the script and the music as honorable mentions.<br/><br/>Gravity is solid phenomenon and I will never recommend it enough. I'm glad that this won multiple Oscars and proclaimed as one the best movies of this decade. To conclude, Gravity is the best movie I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Film Score: 10/10 - Masterpiece"

","This is a sci-fi movie that is outstandingly good in terms of story, limited characters, pacing, action sequences, and the gorgeous cinematography.<br/><br/>Regarding the special effects used, it is one of the best that I have ever seen, and looked amazing in both 2G and 3G. The camera shots are graceful, and moves effortlessly between close to the lead character's viewpoint to general views. I enjoyed the film's sound effects and score, it had a fresh sound with subtle classical tones, and just the right build up to climatic sequences.<br/><br/>The lead and supporting characters are great on screen, played by Sandra Bullock (Ryan Stone) and George Clooney (Matt Kowalski) respectively. Their chemistry and on screen banter was excellent. The film, albeit with less characters to show for on screen and therefore less dialogue, makes the conversations that would take place all the more important and interesting.<br/><br/>The story had me gripped, and kept my interest throughout, although I only really appreciated the lead character more so upon second viewing, perhaps from being slightly distracted by the photography and action effects.<br/><br/>The director and all the people involved had a clear vision of how to make this movie well ahead of it's time, it was made to look as if the actual film crew were in space filming the sequences, it is that good.<br/><br/>The ""extras"" on my Blu-ray certainly indicated this was a bold attempt at filmmaking, from direction to acting and every element in between, there was hard work, meticulous preparation, and a lot of thought into how to make the film sequences as real and engaging as possible.<br/><br/>I will watch this movie time and again."
"lucasversantvoort","9","2","3","6 May 2015"," Poor storytelling aside, a thrilling 3D ride
","I'll just sum up this entire review in one sentence: this film is a glorious, thrilling ride hampered only by its awkward drama. That's Gravity in a nutshell. Talk about a 5 second review¬Ö But I can't just leave it at that. I have to present arguments and fill a page or two. So let's do this.<br/><br/>In one of the smallest ensembles ever assembled, we have a group of astronauts consisting of Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and a third unknown, Shariff Dasari, who I'm very sure will have a long and healthy live ahead of him¬Ö There are also a few off-screen actors present like Ed Harris as Mission Control, who is obviously there as an in-joke for those who've seen Apollo 13. All three are (more or less) doing adjustments and repairs near a space shuttle, when suddenly they receive a warning that debris is headed their way. This causes Dasari to get killed (absolutely did not see that coming¬Ö) and Stone to tumble through space only to get picked up by Kowalski. What follows is their quest to get back to earth safe and sound. Honestly, to go any further with this synopsis would be futile, as trying to describe Gravity is like trying to explain a roller-coaster ride; you're much better off experiencing it firsthand¬Ö The roller-coaster ride metaphor (though overused) is apt as that is exactly what Gravity is, nothing more or less. Director Cuar√≥n, cinematographer Lubezki and the entire visual effects team behind them have taken a great step forward in visuals if nothing else. The use of 3D is unobtrusive and used for making you feel like you're in space, save for a few scenes where objects are hurled at the camera which is the easiest trick in the 3D book. So impressive is the rendering of space that when Ryan finally emerges from the water on earth, it also came as a bit of a shock for me as well. Like Ryan, I felt like a fish out of water, despite only sitting in a theater seat for a mere hour and a half. That's the magic of cinema right there.<br/><br/>But alas, the everlasting need for plot rears its ugly head. I was quite honestly surprised by the awkwardly executed drama. I get that drama is needed to generate audience sympathy so that we start actively rooting for Ryan, but I expected way more from the director of Children of Men on this front. Every time the film reverts into storytelling mode, like when Stone says ""I had a daughter"" I feared this would be the low point of the film and unfortunately I was right. I get that she has to overcome her doubts, her past and find this primeval urge to survive, but these were the parts that made me cringe. Ryan gets this big crying scene where the dialogue is as subtle as the average Japanese anime and the only good thing about it is when her tears float up and hit the camera, creating little blurry dots, a bit like the blood on the camera effect in Children of Men. One has to wonder whether or not it would have been better if the whole dramatic backstory was cut and replaced by crafting a character solely through subtle dialogue and subtle movements etc. than through an overly melodramatic backstory. Honestly, the only thing I found moderately well-executed were what I can only assume are symbols of (re)birth and evolution: the fetal position scene, the emerging from the primordial ooze at the end, etc.<br/><br/>Poor and uninteresting storytelling aside, the real stars are the visuals, the various action sequences and Lubezki's cinematography. As long as you're able to handle the handful of times the melodrama rears its head, what you'll get is an actual cinematic experience, a bit of a rare find these days."

","A prime example of where a film concentrates entirely on the graphical accuracy. Now, I'm sure most of you have seen other critiques praise the director for ""the best space film to exist"", but this is just far from that. They're just overrated claims. I recommend you watch this film for not its aesthetics, but to discover the same viewership opinion as myself. I honestly wanted to love this movie, but the script and dialogue is just overtly lacking. I must say, I do love the graphics. They're probably the best for an outerspace film. However, I watch films solely on the basis of the storyline and narrative acclaim. You'll find a vast majority of irrational and unexercised users suggest that this film is easily the best space related film, but to totally disregard 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13. If you want to experience a real space narrative, watch those films and hide from this overdramatised film. But if you do wish to consume this over-hyped blockbuster where an astronaut cyclically floats from one exaggerated disaster to the next whilst consistently shrieking, by all means go for it."

Indeed the visual effects are nice but the movie is so illogical. It is purposely filled with worst case situations that I must admit in the end that it annoyed me. The best parts are the beginning and the end of the movie, where we people, overall mankind, can think about some deeper values in our existence.<br/><br/>But... that is unfortunately not enough. So dear Mr. Clooney and Mrs. Bullock, who made much better movies in the past, I must give you and your team only 5 Points :).<br/><br/>For those who like science and logical plots, only watch it if you have too much time.

I knew it was going to be a good one with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in it. But I was greatly disappointed. 3 words? Boring. Aggravating. Disappointing. I rented it with my brother and we didn't even watch it halfway. We turned it off and watched something because, (with the exception of the visual effects), it was very boring. We couldn't get into it. The aggravating part was Sandra Bullocks' character. We watched her make the STUPIDEST decisions which ultimately ended with consequences. We just sat there yelling at the screen and very upset. I have to praise the actors and the special effects team though for their major success.

Don't get me wrong, this movie deserves its Oscars in Visual Effects and Cinematography, but Gravity is pretty dull otherwise. At first you might be intrigued by the long takes and the pretty effects, but after roughly 15 minutes you will see how hollow the plot really is. I don't want to take away any plot points, but everyone would be able to tell this story in about 7 minutes. Everything is so slow. Sandra Bullock does her best to work with this lackluster script, but even she isn't up to par. And the ending... Seriously? <br/><br/>All in all I recommend the movie for its visual effects, and if you don't care about a boring plot, it's the perfect movie for you.

","'Gravity' is not a movie that will do it for everyone. There is no human villain and not really any human conflict, or interaction for that matter, so some people will be so bored while viewing this movie. I however was not one of them.<br/><br/>The movie is more symbolic of letting go, moving on and learning to accept whatever life throws at you. 'Rebirth' is the theme that is not so subtly thrown at you. But even with this rather heavy and preachy theme the movie still finds ways to make you squirm in your seat with anticipation and worry. This movie is more nerve wracking than any modern horror movie out there. It is scarier than any open water film you will ever see, and this is because of the lack of human and ethereal elements. In a horror movie or a lost at sea film you're not quite as scared as you should be, and this is because even if the character dies, in the back of your mind there is the thought that at least they were on earth. It's so tiny a thought that you don't even know you think it. But while watching this film you worry that the characters will forever be floating in space, never to be laid to rest at home, or even on the planet.<br/><br/>It's a new way and reason to be scared. This is exemplified with Sandra Bullock at the helm, who expertly bounces between terrified and resound to never see her home again. You parallel her emotions and root for her to buck up and find a way out of the scariest situation ever. And in this respect the movie is original. <br/><br/>The special effects are also very cool. Whether you see it in 3D or not you feel as if you're floating in space. When you see her move through the station she looks weightless, like swimming underwater. It's all very awesome.<br/><br/>So this movie isn't for everyone. It isn't as wonderful as the critics and awards made it out to be, but it was still a good movie. I give this movie 6.5/10"
"wytsevenema","7","2","3","2 April 2014"," Great visuals, incredibly weak story.
","I liked this movie, it's visuals alone make it a treat to watch. All these Physics Phd. wannabes (Look Ma, I watched Apollo 13! I know everything about physics) giving this film 1/10 for being ""unrealistic"" should just stop going to the movies altogether. Are they just angry because, admittedly, Gravity got too high of a review? Probably. No movie is without it mistakes, and unless you focus on them too heavily in this film they don't detract from it for the most part. The Visuals alone are worth an 8, and the film does an amazing job in letting you feel the emptiness and the vastness of space , sadly, story and character development is basically non existent. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!! <br/><br/>The plot is basically this; Sandra Bullock goes through a lot of crap and goes home, with your inevitable self sacrificing George Clooney moment in there. Why they picked Clooney and not any other actor is beyond me. He serves no purpose in this film. I was surprised he didn't fly around while drinking a cup of Nespresso. I guess he's just a handsome old mother f*cker. She makes it to the Russian space station, the debris returns to do some major damage ( mainly to everything but plot convenient things), She has a really weird moment ( not because you can't start hallucinating from oxygen starvation, it just didn't fit in the film, at all) where she tries to kill herself by turning off the oxygen, when she gets new hope from a hallucination of George Clooney(What else). She eventually makes it to the Chinese space station, which is re-entering the atmosphere, and she boards it using a fire extinguisher she picked up on the Russian space station, which basically makes the fire extinguisher the best character in this film, or at least the most useful. She lands in a lake, surrounded by lush greens, a pretty amazing sight to behold after fearing for her life in outer space for the duration of the movie. <br/><br/>The totally crap stuff:<br/><br/>There were some incredibly forced ""Emotional"" scenes, in the form of extremely forced and pointless symbolism, where she takes a fetal position to symbolize rebirth apparently. What the hell film. About as emotional as taking a crap basically. There is also this one scene where she gets in contact with a random guy on the radio, and starts making dog sounds in response to his dogs barking in the background. I don't know why they put things like that in movies, but please don't. They add nothing. <br/><br/>Tl;d.r Summary Looks great, is liberal with its use of physics ( or there would be no movie), has no character development, Sandra Bullock does clumsy stuff and lives to see another day. The story really sucks, the characters are cardboard. I know I said the visuals deserved an 8, but it can't be all style over substance, so I'll detract 1 point. It's a good effort, and a really fun and action packed ride, with some extremely painful and questionable moments in there. 7/10"

","Astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are repairing a telescope in space when a Russian satellite explodes and sends the debris their way at very fast speeds. <br/><br/>The beginning of this movie feels like it's the end of a movie when disaster strikes and they overcome it and we all go home. But, that can't happen as this just started. Bummer. <br/><br/>Gravity would be better viewed in 3-D if you can manage it. The CGI visuals are truly outstanding even in 2-D. We see Kowalski and Ryan try to get back to the ISS (International Space Station) and one would think there would be tension and suspense during this attempt to get back, but this didn't happen for me. But, if you watch in 3-D you will be ducking debris every 10-seconds. Quite exciting though. For me, the tension and suspense came much later when Ryan was by herself in the abandoned Chinese space station. Hey, wouldn't you be tense in a space craft where all the buttons and controls are in Chinese and you don't know the language. Huh?<br/><br/>Gravity was nominated for Best Picture. Say what? Give me a break. Sandra Bullock was nominated for Best Actress. Huh? The Academy must have had their collective heads in a Black Hole when they made these nominations. Sandra Bollock is a good actress, but it didn't show up in here. George Clooney was good, but his character acted too much like the disaster was a walk-in-the-park (I guess he knew this was only a movie).<br/><br/>Still, this was somewhat entertaining, but highly over-rated. The dialogues between Kowalski and Ryan were lame for the most part. No good lines, nothing funny. The star of this movie is the CGI visuals and again, they are spectacular. But, that's it. View it in 3-D and enjoy it. Otherwise, it's a ""Help, I've fallen in Space and can't get up"" type movie.

Based on the reviews I've read, it seems everyone who hated this film went to the theater with the intention of hating it, wanting to be cool by being against the popular opinion, and must have focused more on playing with their cell phones or something than paying attention to the actual film.<br/><br/>Gravity is one of the best films of 2013. I do acknowledge its flaws: yes, there are scientific inaccuracies. Yes, the themes of rebirth and letting go aren't explored very deeply. Yes, the plot is predictable and implausible. Yes, the film won't have much value when watched from a TV screen. But the film is incredibly exciting and engrossing, visually fantastic, beautifully shot, and incredibly intense and efficient with its short running time. It is more than a film, it is an experience, which has to be seen on the big screen. It is a film which asks you to go with it, and when you do, it is one of the most powerful cinematic experiences seen for a long time. If you go in expecting another 2001: A Space Odyssey, you'll be disappointed. Gravity isn't even science fiction. It is an action-thriller that just happens to be set in space, so stop complaining about that it lacks substance. Gravity is nowhere near 2001 in terms of quality, but that is not the point.<br/><br/>The negative audience reaction speaks only about how these days when there's a film meant to be seen in theaters, most people don't seem to understand it and just dismiss it as style over substance. Gravity is an extremely intense piece of filmmaking that is a feast for the eyes and ears."

"gargi_prasad","10","2","3","4 January 2014"," Technically Remarkable
","The most remarkable movie of 2013, especially on the technical front. It was not a movie but an experience. People who have missed it on IMAX have truly missed to view how far have we come and what is possible today. Completely women centric role, kudos to Sandra for her superb performance. Undoubtedly, there have been many space related movies before, but this one stands out because for the first time you can actually feel the remotest proximity to a real life experience in space, the lack of gravity. The sights, the sounds, or the lack of it and how it all matters when things do go wrong. I could imagine that some think it is a bit far fetched for they have covered a domino of accidents and a real life astronaut may find it nightmarish. But it is for sure thrilling to watch."
"joshwhitnallfilmblog","9","2","3","24 November 2013"," It's out of this world!
","This film is truly and utterly amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The film is completely set in space, starring 'George Clooney' and 'Sandra Bullock'. It shows a group of astronauts on a space mission, till a satellite is blown up near by. Whilst trying to abort the mission, things turn for the worst, and one astronaut, ends up alone and has to try and make their way back to earth. When watching this film I was so tense that I couldn't move. The cinema was completely silent during and after the film. The story grips you from the beginning as we become connected to the characters, we start to like them. When things start to get to go wrong we instantly root for the astronaut to get back alive, however we as an audience haven't all experienced being trapped in space, so we have no answers. Not many people consider the fact that it is silent in space, which the film uses to its advantage, sound sets the mood and sense of the loneliness, which when watching this film, I felt the same emotions. We see the astronaut make progress and then almost like a rug pulled under the feet, its taken away. This is done throughout making me want to shout 'COME ON!'. The effects are just incredible, you believe that they are in space, and with the techniques of the person person view, I felt like I was there with them, which is an achievement as I'm usually sitting there thinking 'that would never happen'. This Sci-Fi drama proves that you don't need aliens in a movie for it to be good. Sorry not good, amazing! This film is one definitely to see in 3D, everything comes flying out at you, its the best 3D film I have ever seen and yet I have seen hundreds. It would be really good in 2D as well, just make sure your comfortable and don't leave your seat.<br/><br/>http://joshwhitnallfilmreviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"johnappleseed1994","9","2","3","23 November 2013"," Original, Incredibly Immersive, And Totally Unpredictable.
","I'll start with saying I think this film is underrated, I think most people read the good reviews and try not to enjoy it, the films designed to be immersive and if you somehow try to avoid it you're not going to enjoy it. Complaining about bad physics is really pathetic with cinematography. <br/><br/>I went to the film not knowing what to expect, I'd only heard the word ""amazing"", I didn't know the plot, I didn't even know it was set in space, don't let anyone spoil this film to you as you probably won't enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>The film is incredibly unique, many of the films I've seen lately consist of medieval sword fighting, it's the same thing each time. This film puts itself in a whole new category. The film changes camera angle about five times, the whole thing is pretty much done in one take. It is completely unexpected, It's hard to make a guess on what's going to happen next, it's not at all linear, and the whole time you think the lead part is toast.<br/><br/>The film has one big flaw, or the game has one shall I say? It felt like I was playing Battlefield whilst watching. Is Sandra Bullock even in this film? Oh she is, but only her voice it seems. It's still incredibly advanced SFX wise but it sometimes ruins the immersion and reminds you that what you're watching isn't reality, your jaw undrops on the close-ups.<br/><br/>There was also one quite cringy scene which I felt could've been done slightly differently which you'll spot when you watch this film.<br/><br/>It gets a 9 for being original, immersive, and unpredictable. But the amazing animation sometimes wasn't convincing enough."
"itamarscomix","10","2","3","21 November 2013"," A wonderful panic attack
","For the first time in a long, long time, a film made me feel like a kid again. From the very first (long and glorious) shot of Gravity I was completely lost in the world Cuar√≥n created for me, and for the next ninety minutes I was on the edge of my seat and struggling for breath. It was like a 1.5-hour panic attack - a wonderful, wonderful panic attack. Suspension of disbelief hadn't been so easy for me in years, and part of it was the masterful use of 3D - by far the best I've seen so far - but most of it was thanks to Cuar√≥n's directorial work. This was a perfectly paced thriller, pure cinema at its most condensed, the editing, the sound, the cinematography, the acting all coming perfectly together to keep my eyes glued to the screen (or to the 3D glasses). Leaving the theater, I was stumbling, still not feeling quite at home in normal gravity.<br/><br/>Then I went on the film's board to see people's impressions - and sure enough, it was filled to the brim with complaints about the various scientific inaccuracies and implausibilities in the film. I'm something of a geek myself and plot holes drive me mad. But I just don't get how so many people could hate a film like Gravity so much. Comparisons to Apollo 13 and The Right Stuff seem ridiculous to me; this wasn't about a real space mission, it wasn't about the space program or technology, it was a thriller/adventure focused on atmosphere, character study and a semi-spiritual journey that character goes through in the hostile territory of unfamiliar life. Sure, looking back at it, a lot of it wasn't very realistic, but when a film works on as many levels as Gravity did, I really feel sorry for people focusing on the little flaws - and I'm so happy that for once I didn't."
"johnsim","10","2","3","17 November 2013"," Film making at it's very best.
","It's been a long time since I've seen a film which raised the bar like this one. This isn't just a excellent film, it's a lesson to other film makers.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n, the director, has an amazing ability to draw the viewer in to the film whole. The long tracking shots hold you. I was impressed with one of his previous film, Children of Men, and Gravity raises this standard even further. I can not speak higher of how brilliantly the direction of this film was executed.<br/><br/>The best advice I can give to anybody interested in watching Gravity is don't look at any stills from the film. Don't watch or read any reviews. Try and see the film as fresh as you can. Let Alfonso guide you through; be seduced by his wonderful work. And you'll leave the cinema in awe of Gravity.<br/><br/>Gravity is without doubt one of the best, if not the best, films I've ever watched."
"BrockPace","10","2","3","15 November 2013"," Gravity will leave you breathless.
","After viewing the film Gravity for the first time in theaters, I was at a loss for words, unable to explain the sheer magnitude of work that must have been put into such a groundbreaking experience. From the title sequence, I knew that I was going to love this film when it began by blasting my ears with such loud music only to immediately cut to silence. This emptiness that accompanies the first shot really shows the audience exactly how vast and diverse space can be. One of the reasons this shot had such a great impact was because of the 3D sound that made you feel like one of the astronauts. As each person on the radio was transmitted, I was able to hear what he or she was saying in front of me and behind me. Usually in films, I never really pay that much attention to the sound quality or editing, as most of the films I watch at home are either binaural or monaural. When a film like this splits up each sound into a separate quadrant of the room, all of the work that went into the sound editing really shines through. The film only gets better when it starts to pan around the space station, beginning one of the infamous Cuaron long shots. The cinematography in this film was simply amazing, focusing on specific objects floating in space to provide the audience with comic relief or to provide some back- story for one of the main characters. If there is one thing I would have to criticize about the cinematography, however, is the choice to splash water onto the camera. In many films, some directors find it necessary to break the fourth wall by indicating that there is indeed a camera filming the entire movie, such as the opening shot of Inception. The problem with doing this in Gravity is that the film rests on the fact that it could be a very real experience, and by showing something hitting the camera, it really took me out of the film. Next, the music was able to make the film incredibly fun to watch with there being very little sound. Before watching the film, I was worried that there was going to be extended scenes without sound, making the action scenes incredibly awkward and difficult to watch. However, the film went completely in the other direction, using the loud music and incredible score to make the film seem like it had some sort of sound during the scenes of debris flying into the main characters.With all of this said, I have not even gotten into the incredible performance as Ryan by Sandra Bullock. Throughout this movie she is able to constantly give a tour de force performance by perfectly adapting to gasps of air, screaming, and depression. Despite nearly every scene being about her not knowing what to do and almost giving up, this movie shows a complete sense of courage, something rarely seen in any movie with a female lead. Besides Silence of the Lambs and the Alien Anthology, I do not think I have ever seen a stronger female lead. Finally, this brings us to the symbolic purpose of the film, which is to show a characters rebirth via isolation. Much of the imagery in the film was directly intended to evoke a sense of pregnancy. The first clear example of this was when Ryan was floating in the Russian space station in the fetal position with her extension protruding out like an umbilical cord. Later in the film, as she is drowning in the lake that her landing pod crashed into, we see a frog swim by, representing the metamorphosis of Ryan as a person, so that she can grow her own legs and stand on her own. Finally, as she attempts to stand up, the audience can see that she is learning to walk again, not just literally, but as a new member of society so that she can happily live knowing that she has a purpose.<br/><br/>First, the film was created entirely in animation with only the voices of Clooney and Bullock to get a feeling for how the finished product would look, before investing all of the time and money into a large special effects budget. Next, they created a large light box that suspended Bullock in mid-air so that they could provide the proper lighting for her face, matching all of the shadows from the debris with the light from Earth, while being able to completely rotate around her body 360¬∫. In many of the finished scenes this was necessary as most of the shots were completely CGI with the only live-action part, being Bullock's face. For the scenes where Bullock is floating in the space ship where we can see her entire body, that was done with puppetry by suspending her on several wires, so that puppeteers could control her according to where the zero gravity would lead her. By using this method, she would have complete control of where or how her body moved, while the puppeteers could control the gravity of the scene. Finally, the film was converted into a 3D format. While most films that succeed at 3D are filmed with a 3D camera and all done in pre-production, the 3D for this film works because of what it is representing. By showing how much space is between Bullock and Earth, the 3D can clearly show us how far away she is from help and civilization.<br/><br/>Overall, this is my favorite movie of the year, and one of my favorite sci-fi movies ever. This is definitely a film I look forward to watching again and owning on a home video format. <br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"freemantle_uk","9","2","3","15 November 2013"," The perils of space travel
","Gravity was one of the anticipated films of 2013 and for good reason, it was the return of Alfonso Cuaron in the director's chair after a seven year break.<br/><br/>Orbiting the Earth is the Explorer Space Shuttle is orbiting the world when space debris, destroying the shuttle and leaving only two survivors, Lt. Matt Kowalski, a veteran on his last mission and Dr. Ryan Stone, a mission specialist on her first mission. Stranded in the middle of space the pair try to make it to the International Space Station as their oxygen and fuel is running low as the debris speeds around the world every 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Gravity is a film that gets everything right, a tort script, fantastic visuals and great performances from Bullock and Clooney. Cuaron really does give us a visual extravaganza, showing the beauty of space and the world with the depths of space and the zero gravity enhanced by 3D effects, some of the best put to film. Curaron continues his use of long takes and tracking shoots which I am a sucker for, and due to the space setting there was no limitation and helped keep the flow of the acting.<br/><br/>Gravity tells a simple story, but it is beautifully told. Cuaron is able to make the film compelling, thrilling film as we follow the astronauts in their struggle and we get to find out about them during the film. Dr Stone grows from a woman who was already nervous about her mission to someone who has to grow as she fights for survival. Despite the simple story Cuaron was able to add style toughs with looks of religious icons, adding subtext to the film.<br/><br/>Cuaron gets the tone right throughout film, from when to be exciting with the full force of the special effects and when to be more tender or tragic and the very occasional moments of humour, all increased by Bullock's performance. It was very reminiscence to Duncan Jones' Moon. Steve Price also supplies a fantastic score for the film and it is one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Gravity is an excellent film, working on the story and characters, to visual spender and gripping action spectacle as it shares themes of the perils of space travel to Moon, Sunshine and Apollo 13."
"twiggy120","9","2","3","15 November 2013"," Almost Perfect
","The plot is very simple, don't expect much in the way of twists and character development. They are already astronauts, they have been through the training to get this far. Usually I dislike Clooney, his charm and the way he stares at people makes me distrustful, but as an astronaut this works very well. Before I was indifferent to Sandra Bullock, now I'm in love. A few people have criticised her character, she panics, she does weird stuff. Given her situation this is completely understandable, she had my sympathy and admiration all the way through. <br/><br/>This may be the best looking film I have ever seen, most of it is CGI and it works very well. When Ryan (Bullock) is tumbling around moving away from the camera you can really see the depth. This is the only film I can recommend 3D over 2D. Usually I can't stand 3D, fast moving and close-up objects look terrible and jittery and ruin ant immersion I had. There were a few shots like this in this film, especially with the debris (you've seen this in the trailers) coming towards the audience it felt a bit like a gimmick. <br/><br/>Some of the physics was a bit wrong, but to notice that I had to put a higher standard on this film than any other film I have seen. Overall it didn't make much difference while watching it. Afterwards discussing the physics jut added an extra level of fun to this film. Some of the physics made me quite excited, the sound of the tools vibrating through the suits was beautifully done. I was twanging my headphone cable on the bus ride home just to hear those vibrations again. And another moment with Ryan and a fire extinguisher me happier than it should. Newton's third law! <br/><br/>This film was something special to view on a large screen in 3D. I'm going to see it again."
"andy-barbieri","9","2","3","13 November 2013"," Believe the hype!
","In the month between the US release and the UK release, there was a ton of hype about 'Gravity'. Some calling it THE cinematic experience of the year, some calling it the most stunning looking film, some saying it is Sandra Bullock's virtuoso performance, a must see movie! After seeing it for myself, I kind of have to agree on all points.<br/><br/>We join veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and rookie Ryan Stone (Bullock) on a repair mission to the Hubble Telescope, until the debris from a destroyed satellite causes chaos and so begins the thrill ride that is 'Gravity'.<br/><br/>And it is definitely a thrill ride of emotions, as we follow the two astronauts, with the focus on the rookie and how she copes with the frankly terrifying ordeal and her emotional journey of self-belief and survival. Throughout the 90 minutes, we're with her as she experiences the anxiety, the disorientation, the despair, the vulnerability, the danger, the hopelessness, the desperation, then the belief, hope, and relief! I was exhausted by the end! And I can positively say that I've not been as gripped throughout a movie as I have this one.<br/><br/>The VFX work is simply stunning. Not overblown or in your face, but giving you that sense of realism as if you've been watching a NASA video. I thought that the musical score by Steven Price worked really well too and helped to expand the emotional feel of Stone's ordeal.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Gravity' is well worth the hype that has been thrown at it. Tense, emotional and a superb performance from the focal star, what more do you need!"
"firejosh2010","9","2","3","13 November 2013"," This is a must see.
","This is one of the best films i have seen all year by far. The effects were incredible and the 3D really enhanced them to a great degree. The story was pretty simple and it worked so very well. The theory behind the main storyline made sense in what they were trying to avoid. Both key roles were exceptional and the story really allowed both characters to develop so very well. Yes, there were a few exemptions to this theory of realism, but they were very few from which you might expect to find more in a Space movie. This is in my opinion the best space movie I have ever seen in my days of watching these kind off films. It has the best effects of every movie this year bar a few. The acting was built up so very well and what they did made sense, most of the time. All in all if you call yourself a movie fan that I would definitely take the time to check this out and see what you make of it."
"abbieb0809","9","2","3","13 November 2013"," I don't want to be an astronaut now !!!
","I absolutely loved this film. I am not going to sit here and pull it apart, discuss it's endless flaws or technical mistakes. It is what it is. It's a film, not a documentary, and a mighty fine film at that ! It starts out, as anyone who's seen the trailer, adverts or masses of television interviews publicising it, will know, with 3 American astronauts fixing the American Space Station which is orbiting Planet Earth. Due to unforeseen circumstances, namely ""Russian Debris"" hurtling in their direction, at a speed that no one anticipates, things start to go disastrously wrong. And then - the film really jets into action. <br/><br/>From this point it is just Sandra Bullock, in a spacesuit, alone, in space, needing to find a way to get to an alternative space station, detach the module, and fly back to Earth..... and obviously there are many many reasons why this wouldn't be possible. <br/><br/>BUT Jurassic Park, Star Wars and Independence Day weren't based on real life either,so why all the negativity? It is, without a doubt, the most intensely stressful film I have ever seen. Adrenaline was flowing, my heart was racing and I actually (no lie) felt like I was there with Ryan Stone, in space routing for her all the way.<br/><br/>The effects were absolutely unbelievable. The speed of the film just carried you along, the 3D (essential for viewing) was magnificent, and on every level this film delivered.<br/><br/>Please go with an open mind, and a strong heart! This film will not disappoint."
"millsy_the_legand","10","2","3","12 November 2013"," Perfection on screen
","By the time anybody might read this, I'm almost certain they'll know enough about it without me explaining any sort of plot/characters etc. The reason I'm writing this is in regards to the reception this film has garnered. For the vast majority, it's being recognised as a phenomenal achievement- it is.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying there is absolutely no two ways about it. Gravity is as close to visually perfect as visually perfect has ever been. Lighting, design, CG, animation, costume I can't even begin to stress just how flawless the filmmaking involved in the visual aspect to this film are. Believe me when I say, maybe once or twice a decade a film like this comes around. Do not miss it. Anything less than a cinema experience will not do this film the justice it truly deserves.<br/><br/>Now, many people will try and tell you that the characters are not fleshed out, that the script isn't spectacular, that the science might be a little off. To those people I say, it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>If this film was scientifically perfect, it would lessen the experience for the 90% who don't care. If this film had a longer, more fleshed out script, it might seem like padding to most, it might lead the film to outstay its welcome. This film is 90 minutes long, not a second was wasted. A film is made for entertainment, some do a better job than others. To the small minority who would have liked to have seen perhaps a more investigative study into the human condition, a more accurate scientific representation of space I say good for you. To the people who would try and find fault with this AS A PIECE OF ART AND CINEMA for the aforementioned reasons I say, your opinion is irrelevant.<br/><br/>From a filmmaking aspect this film is flawless, as for the subjective aspect of opinion, think what you want. I personally thought it did exactly what it intended to do to me as a viewer, and I can't ask for a single thing more."
"alan-chan-158-451491","10","2","3","9 November 2013"," The Film of the Year and the Future of Cinema
","The Film of the Year, Gravity is simply a wonderful, astonishing and sensational experience that will leave you perched on the edge of your seat throughout its lean and mean 90 minute running time. In Hollywood parlance, it is also a game changer in much the same way that films like 2001, Jaws, Star Wars, Die Hard, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings and Avatar et al changed the face of film making and storytelling forever. The Lumi√®re brothers will be turning in their grave in delight because Gravity is exactly what they envisaged cinema to be ‚Äì a big, bold, larger-than-life visceral experience. It is also what 3D was created for and for once, does the format full justice and more so when viewed on IMAX screens. Suffice to say, it will Hoover up all the technical prizes in awards season and put Sandra Bullock up for Best Actress in a head-to-head with Cate Blanchett for her role in Blue Jasmine ‚Äì perhaps a more accomplished work but Ms Bullock is America's sweetheart and there is no denying the power of her performance which is at once heartbreaking and profound. Alfonso Cuar√≥n was always a visionary as his early Hollywood work on Children of Men showed, but this film is surely his finest moment and has at once, catapulted him into the same technical sphere as George Lucas and James Cameron as geniuses and visionaries of their craft. Cameron called Gravity 'the best film ever made about space' and he is not wrong. <br/><br/>Like all the best films, the idea is simplicity itself. Sandra Bullock plays Ryan Stone, an accomplished scientist who has made her inaugural journey into space to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. She is aided by Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), the avuncular captain of the Space Shuttle, and another more experienced scientist, Shariff (Phaldut Sharma). Disaster strikes as debris from a Russian satellite destroyed by a missile strike hurtles and careers into the path of the American mission. What follows in the ensuing 70 minutes is a tense, gripping and heart pounding survival story that will leave you breaking into spontaneous applause at the end credits.<br/><br/>The tag line for the 1978 version of Superman was 'You'll believe a man can fly'. Well, you'll believe that you're in space, not the space of Star War or Star Trek, but the grounded reality of space as we know it. The experience of working in the vacuum that is space is stupendously realised as you spin, hurtle, fly, crash and bounce along with the characters. In fact the effects are so good that I'm surprised that it doesn't induce benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the audience.<br/><br/>Gravity is such an enormous technical achievement that in the quieter moments you feel yourself being humbled by the achievements of mankind (the exploration of space) and wishing that you were better at science in school. You'll also marvel at the breathtaking beauty of some of the shots and two stand long in the mind ‚Äì a wide panoramic shot of Bullock and Clooney stretched out into space, tenuously tethered by the straps of a giant Stars and Stripes flag caught on the International Space Station and the onset of the Aurora Borealis on the Earth's atmosphere as day turns into night. Yup, in those moments of quiet wonderment, you'll be ruminating on life, the universe and the existence of God and especially the latter when your eyeballs are blistered with images of such searing and startling beauty that you question whether a Big Bang really did create life, the universe and nature ‚Äì I did anyway. At the end of the film, you realise that you have witnessed an important pivotal moment in the history of film and that film making, cinema and entertainment will never be the same again. In short, you have seen the future and life as we know it will never be the same again."

","Okay, first I wanna say that the whole 3D gimmick used in recent movies is really not my cup of tea. Only used for commercial purpose, useless even. I remember at the end of Avatar people clapping in the movie theater, I was just bored. I mean, yes the movie is beautiful, but the story is so not original. It was like watching 1983 Mission on an other planet. That being said, I gotta say Gravity is worth seeing on a good 3D screen. It was so beautiful you kind of tend to forget the whole mess Sandra Bullock is into ! We heard about the first 17 minutes, and journalists did not exaggerate anything. The whole choreography is awesome all along the movie and even when nothing really happens, well, it's awesome. I can't choose if it's action or drama or horror ( psychological horror I mean ), but it's definitely worth the 12 euros !!! A must see in theaters.

The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space. Incredibly effective long takes throughout the film bring the realism and suspense that none other space film has ever done before. The acting is subtle and engaging.Two astronauts floating in space - how could that possibly be a concept for one of the most riveting films I have ever seen, and be deserving of the adjectives mentioned in this review's title? And yet Gravity is without doubt one of the most absorbing, don't-look-away-can't-look-away films I've seen for a long time. There are some films (good, entertaining films) that you just watch. Then there are those rare films which have the power to draw you in and make you forget you are WATCHING. Instead, you are EXPERIENCING."

SURE, but his character (or more accurately a dream sequence of his dead character) performed to roll of spirit guide who allowed Bullock's character to return to Earth. I hope Clooney finally wins an Academy Award (for acting) for this role.<br/><br/>From a technical aspect, it seems to me that some of the science was not quite right... but who cares!

The audience realizes that this film only has *two* on screen characters, and one of those departs early in the film. Sandra Bullock deserves at least an Oscar nomination for best lead actress simply because she is able to pull off an amazing performance with *no one else* to work against in the second half of the film. The audience plausibly feels her fear as she struggles to return to earth after a major disaster at her space station, which kills off everyone in her crew except for her and George Clooney. A film where a person talking to herself may sound off-putting, and the audience may assume the character nothing more than a madman; however, given Bullock's character's circumstances, the audience understands her every action and word throughout the proceedings.<br/><br/>The film is remarkable for its minimalist approach. The situation the characters face is not fanciful, but remarkably realistic for a science fiction movie. The setting is limited to the earth's orbit in the near future, rather than on Tattooine ""a long time ago"" or Pandora a hundred years from now. The ""antagonist"" (if the conflict in the film merits such as description) is not Darth Vader, Jabba the Hutt, or the ""Sky People,"" but merely an accident and simple carelessness on the part of man: space debris from a Russian missile test. The vastness of space and malfunctioning spaceships and spacesuits I suppose count as ""antagonists"" in the broad sense because they are obstacles preventing the protagonist from achieving her goal. ""Gravity"" is storytelling reduced of all of its trappings to its most basic form. The episodic nature of Bullock's perils are gripping to watch in and of themselves. Cuaron takes simple fears, like that of floating off into the abyss of space, or a spacesuit running low on oxygen, and uses them to make for a compelling film. His use of expensive special effects is well done here, and fits in well with paradoxically simple story. There are no flashy fights with legions of spacemen or monsters, nor lush settings (other than the Earth from space) to distract from the story. Pacing is also well-done, as we, the audience, feel like we, too, join in with Bullock's plight.<br/><br/>George Clooney does well as the roguish, playful partner in Bullock's mission. He seems to be channeling Clark Gable in his portrayal of a clownish yet debonair ""bad boy."" He plays his part well here--again, remarkable in a movie with only one other visible actor.<br/><br/>The film's violence is limited to the perils of surviving outer space with limited resources. There is a brief scene where an astronaut gets his face torn off by space debris. Other than these concerns, the film doesn't seem inappropriate for younger viewers. This film is amazing because it has become a blockbuster in 2013, and yet has a very limited amount of violence and no sex at all. A dearth of sex and/or violence in a major Hollywood film in 2013--both traits being de rigueur if a non-computer animated kid's film is to be marketable--is refreshing. This film seems like a hopeful sign that movies will adhere to the credo ""less is more,"" be forced to be creative in their storytelling, and will shed the crutches of excessive violence and gratuitous sex in order to capture an audience's attention. Hopefully, Cuaron will win Oscars for this film, and not simply those for special effects. I highly recommend this film, if only because it is so different and emotionally satisfying compared to the usual fare."

","We always carry certain fears within our subconscious every day; the possibility that may'be we left the stove on, coffee maker on, didn't lock the door, lost our homework, or any other worst case scenario you can think of. These are things that rarely and don't usual happen to most to all people. But there is always that looming dread that it still can and the dark truth is sometimes it actually does.<br/><br/>This is one of the best suspense films I've ever seen, because this is a worst case scenario that takes place in space. Which I think is really cool because most suspense thrillers are always earth based. It's an uncomplicated and simple plot which makes this all the better, personally I getting kinda bored of most thrillers trying to be too complicated for their own good, all thought but no thrills. And the plot feels plausible, whose to say this can't happen.<br/><br/>The effects are just fantastic, I really love how space looks in this film it really looks like real space. And it's all reinforced by some of the excellent cinematography, I really love how it weaved around in certain places gave everything almost a certain sense of geography. Even at times there was some first person perspective shots which really gave a great sense of being in the astronaut's point of view but most importantly helped really put you in the action. And they also created the illusion of gravity well, the physical chirography and visual effects were on the mark that you'd almost think the film really was shot up in space, because they really nailed the physics of space perfectly.<br/><br/>Even the score was excellent it was thrilling and epic. On further note I saw this film in 3D and the 3D in this film is just fantastic, it really gave you the illusion that you were up there and in on the action, at times when the debris came I couldn't help but duck in my seat it looked like they were coming at me.<br/><br/>But most importantly the suspense in the film was excellent. This film goes at a fast pace , things are just constantly happening that there's almost no time to take a breath. The acting is solid, George Clooney does well with what he has but to me it was really Sandra Bullock that drove this film let alone she is the main protagonist. I really liked both her emotional and physical performance how her character reacts in the film, it felt like how anyone else might react and feel if even in this type of uncontrollable situation; constantly trying to keep functioning and working despite losing most of your cool.<br/><br/>I'll admit I couldn't help but worry for her life as both time and physics were against her. As at times she has to get from point A to B safely without loosing control of her body. Or even simply trying to get hit or knocked away from the debris that zip as fast as bullets and can cut through things like razors. Just any other obstacle that makes things worse than they already are, as a saying goes out of the frying pan into the fire.<br/><br/>Gravity is a thrill ride worth hanging on to.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"austin-premkumar","7","2","3","17 October 2013"," Visual that you can not visualize ever. Must see 3D movie ever
","Visual that you can not visualize ever. But Director Alfonso Cuaron had visual in his mind first and he conceive Gravity with unimaginable manner. No words to say..wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow..Fantastic movie. don't miss to see this movie in 3D, if you miss then you may have to wait another decade to experience movies like this. Hats off to the director Alfonso Cuaron. <br/><br/>I am wondering how director made other technician to understand every frame of this script. Especially Cinematographer of this movie. <br/><br/>After director, all credits goes to Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. You can not realize that you are seeing space in camera, you would feel like you are one of them watching everything happen in space. Cinematography is soul of this movie. Thanks for giving us the fantastic experience."
"AgentDice","10","2","3","21 October 2013"," But one thing I know for sure: It's gonna be one helluva ride.
","Some movies boast an experience which gives you a solid reason why the art of cinema influence a huge section of people comparing to other arts. It is the experience which is so realistic to life and yet fictitious that can provide the awe-struck moments during the viewing. ""Gravity"" is one such cine experience that keeps cinema distinct from other art forms by its maximum application in both sound and 3D visuals. We have seen many movies related to space expedition after 2001 - A Space Odyssey but I am sure none will be able to provide such a captivating experience like ""Gravity"".<br/><br/>Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is on a space mission along with Lieutenant Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) encounters an obstacle in form of debris after the destruction of the Russian satellite. This movie is about the efforts to survive by the duo in the most challenging circumstances.<br/><br/>Even if the film carries the clich√©s moments of movies carrying survival themes where character start of lose hope, plans to give up, moment of inspiration etc etc, you will not say the movie was predictable at any point. Now thats the strength of an outstanding screenplay presented by the director, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, who brings you to the most exquisite cine experience after Avatar (better for me) in the world of space. I cannot point out a single second of dullness through the whole experience and without wasting anytime, the movie starts off in top gear with the splendid 10-20 minutes (which seems to be captured in a single take) and thus gets elevated from that point onward until its end. I don't know whether I can term this movie as science fiction thriller alone because there were some bloodcurdling moments ( like the second debris attack) which created an impact that many horror films failed. Even though the screenplay is strong enough, I was totally mesmerized by the visual extravaganza that made me feel as one of the character or simple step into the shoes of the lead character. Thus Alfonso was able to provide a space ride and which shakes you emotionally. Now if a director is able to achieve that, its the sign of magnificence.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock was simply terrific as Ryan. She did maintain her signature style of acting which was groomed within the requirements of the character. While George Clooney simply charmed the audience with his one-liners as the optimistic Matt Kowalski. Steven Price's score elevated the mood of the scenes which carried tension. The score towards the end provided an epic feel. Otherwise the movie carried silence at most of the parts.<br/><br/>Very few will leave without a doubt whether the film was shot in a studio. Because Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography along with superlative 3D visual effects makes us wonder how can they capture such shots with utmost realism without going to the react location.Alfonso Cuar√≥n & Mark Sanger maintained the mood and flow with the editing work. The works by the special effects team along with production designer has come up with a meritorious effort in creating the space world along with satellites.<br/><br/>In short...this isn't just a cinema...this is an experience...even if you are not a science fiction fan or simply hates space stories, Gravity still can enter the list of best cine experiences you had...at least for me, the Best 3D Cine Experience till date."

Sandra Bullock should be nominated for this performance, she carries the whole movie on her own and thats not easy to do even with out having to work with all the special effects she had to.

"slicedbread117","8","2","3","18 October 2013"," Gravity: Best picture of the year, or a little over-hyped?
","Ever since Gravity released in theaters, it has been the talk of the movie world. Numerous critics and viewers are praising the film on every aspect, stating it as the movie of the year. Gravity is without a doubt one of the better movies that has released this year, but is it as good as everyone is stating?<br/><br/>As a movie set in space, Gravity immediately immerses you with absolutely jaw-dropping visuals. In 3D or 2D, the film's visuals are so stunning, that at times I wondered if parts of the film were actually shot in space. Movies set in space need to capture the beauty and wonder of space to truly sell where the movie is taking place, and to reiterate, Gravity does this just as good if not better than any other space film before it. If I were to review this film just for its eye- popping CG effects, it would receive a 10/10 easily. The movie is captivating in the visual department and makes you never want to draw your attention elsewhere. However, there is more to a movie than just the special effects.<br/><br/>Where the visuals exceed beyond belief, the majority of the rest of the movie is good and in certain areas great, but overall fall short of accomplishing the same feats that the visual effects do. The story is very straight forward and almost really not important to the movie at all. Gravity is a movie that shows the beauty and horrors of space, and is about two astronauts struggle for survival after their mission goes wrong. My point being that while the film is really about the moment and not a huge story, a well put together story could have created a more heart-felt and dramatic atmosphere and it could've helped in making each scene even more intense. After all, Gravity is a movie that attempts to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire 90 minutes, so the more reason to care the better. In its own right, their are several tense moments throughout the film but the lack of a well put together plot overall knocks down the intensity and at some moments leave the movie a bit dull.<br/><br/>A movie about two astronauts floating in space has potential to be pretty boring when you think about it, so solid acting is needed to keep the movie exciting and evoke realism and director Alfonso Cuaron was able to work with a pair of A-list talents in Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. The main star of the movie is Bullock who plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Bullock does a wonderful job creating a very real reaction to someone in space for the first time when disaster strikes. At first we see Stone as a complete train wreck but she quickly evolves into a calm and adaptive character thinking on her toes and using smarts to survive. While the performance by Bullock to bring realism to the screen is great, again the script hurts the intensity this time in the form of weak character development. Once again, a movie such as this doesn't need the attention to detail, it's all about the moment. But again the overall feel of the film is less heart-racing when you don't have much to really care about. We learn a little bit about Stone in the early goings, but nothing significant enough to really make a character that you will want to remember. George Clooney's character, Matt Kowalsky, suffers from the same fate and even more so than Dr. Stone but still Clooney adds some occasional humor and is a nice compliment to Bullock. In a movie such as this with only two starring roles, character development is key, and the lack of that again takes away a chunk of that immersive magic Gravity sets out to create. <br/><br/>So what do we have? We have exceptional visuals and some great exciting and intense moments complimented by the aforementioned CG effects and realistic and splendid acting. For a movie about survival in space, that's all you need to make a Best Picture candidate right? Unfortunately, wrong. There's more to a movie than the previously stated things, and in my personal case, the script needs to be the strongest part of the movie in terms of story, character development, the whole 9 yards. Alfonso Cuaron as created a wonderful film that aims to immerse you with scene after scene of exhilarating set piece moments but the weak script rob the film of achieving movie gold.<br/><br/>If you were to watch Gravity just for the beautifully stunning visuals and for each moment of intensity, then I can see why it is being considered by many to be the best film of the year. But when you break it down piece by piece, as a whole the movie doesn't quite meet the hype surrounding it.<br/><br/>7.5/10 (rounded to 8 on website)"
"ketgup83","10","2","3","17 October 2013"," ""You have to admit one thing; you can't beat the view "". Gravity is SPECTACULAR !!!
","I always believe that a movie is worth-watching if its completely mesmerizes you with hold-your-attention direction and screenplay and stupendous performances. Gravity is the right ingredient for cinema lovers and it will be thoroughly enjoyed. Gravity tells the survival story of an astronaut when her spaceship is destroyed by oncoming debris from a nearby Russian satellite explosion. From the critical acclaimed Children of Men , director Alfonso Cuaron goes one step ahead and gives you a live-action solid drama which will completely immerse you in the film as if you are actually experiencing it. Screenplay is taut and grabs your attention from the very moment you are in the film. Next level CGI technology is like icing on the cake. Never before footage of galaxy has been so well-captured. Sandra Bullock steals the thunder with her immensely likable performance. Watch out for her in the climax scene. George Clooney lends in a fantastic support as wise-cracking astronaut who helps Bullock to gain confidence.<br/><br/>Gravity is spectacular. As the great dialogue by Clooney in the film goes "" You have to admit one thing; you can't beat the view "". Excellent 4.5/5"

Great visuals, story, acting, Imax 3D excellent as always.<br/><br/>Reminds me something Ron Howard would do casting Tom Hanks but with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. The voice of Mission control was Ed Harris but you never saw him. <br/><br/>I am sure it will be up for some kind of Academy award. Bullock is getting better roles nowadays. She was perfect for the film. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it and may just see it again soon. You have to realize everything in space moves at about 17,500 miles/hour unless you have something to slow you down."

I must admit it, that line was not written just like that. Your brain really can't beat those stunning visuals. Luckily, I watched in IMAX-3D. Oh that was one hell of an experience. I will remember this day for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>But I have a complaint about this movie. You just can't call a film as masterpiece just because of stunning visuals, brilliant sound and some great acting. What matters more is the script and this is where Gravity loses a point from my side. Could have been more gripping and emotionally powerful. All that I wanna say is that I entered the theater expecting goosebumps and I didn't feel any!!"

Achieved by seamlessly merging live action with the most advanced visual effects technology especially developed for this film, Gravity takes us to outer space in a way that no movie has before. For all its slick technical wizardry, Gravity is about hope and courage and the will to come out alive. To best enjoy it, go in with patience and an open mind.

The natural perils and dangers are even more terrifying. And you do get all of them from debris to suffocation to fire and water. You can almost feel the physical hardships that the astronauts feel. The dialog is alright not annoying. Sandra Bullock does a good job playing it inexperienced but not incompetent. George adds his usual charming support. But the acting is secondary in this movie anyway.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a bit overwhelming at times. I know they were trying to make things exciting but it could have been dialed down a bit.<br/><br/>I just saw the 2D version in a medium sized cinema screen - wish I had chosen a cinema wit a bigger screen to see it."
"achyutaghosh","10","2","3","16 October 2013"," As the poster says, Do'nt let go. Do'nt let go of the movie. Watch it!
","For long, superhero and other action movies have made space look like walk in the park. But drop that kid friendly filter, take a shot of realism, and then look- space is both at once, a beautiful, and a terrifying experience. Beautiful because of the views it offers, the peace it gives and terrifying because of the silence, and of our own insignificance in the void. <br/><br/>No other movie in the recent past portrays space as realistically as Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity. Essentially a tale about two astronauts caught in a debris storm in space, and trying to make it back, Gravity is a mesmerizing experience- a unique thriller about soundless explosions, sacrifice and wry humor, but above all, a triumph of the human spirit, and the will to live. Particularly effective is the scene when the grizzled veteran astronaut drifts away in space, but still does not forget that he has to guide the greenhorn, and continues to do so till his last breath. <br/><br/>There are just two actors in the entire movie- George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, there is an Asian character whose face we do not see. But these two seasoned actors are at the top of their game, am sure Bullock will pocket an Academy award nomination, and even Clooney has a shot. Cuaron is an artist of the highest class, his direction is impeccable, the script is a perfectly tuned cliffhanger, the editing is perfect, the sound track is masterful, the imagery is exhilarating and the special effects are eye popping, more so because most of the destruction happens in silence, when we least expect it.The 3D just amplifies the effects.<br/><br/>After a surfeit of big budget explosive summer extravaganzas, this is what the doctor asked for. Gravity personifies the reasons movies were made in the first place IE. to give viewers an experience out of their ordinary lives, to sit on the edge of a chair, throats dry, wishing for something out of your control to happen. Tense, sentimental and nightmarishly engaging- this one begins somewhere in the stars, and actually remains high up there. Unmissable in 3D- 10/10"
"keyos27","10","2","3","15 October 2013"," The most affordable space travel that is worth experiencing
","Several Visual effects companies nowadays vie to procure a number of jobs of bringing magnificent space scenes to audiences whose expectations are high. So it has become much more challenging to create a successful Sci-Fi film that isn't always profitable genre anymore as more people are accustomed to common and groovy visuals.<br/><br/>So what truly keeps audiences captivated? I think it comes down to producing a balanced combination of Visual effects and storytelling that comes along with great acting. The ""Gravity"" is about Dr.Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) going through a sudden predicament that strikes them in the process of improvising the contraption over earth. Since small number of characters, it gives you a feeling of first-person movie.<br/><br/>It is more of a different type of Sci-Fi. What I can guarantee is the immersive experience that can put you in awe. The way the movie presents by showing mechanical details that beautifully capture both inner and outer space shuttles is even more overwhelming than mystical feelings that you get from watching a series of space documentaries.<br/><br/>Watching troubled astronauts hovering around the orbit on the brink of disappearing in the middle of space where their presence can easily become neglected is quite nerve-wrecking. Also, the beautiful and threatening space in 3D definitely has potential to appall and deafen the every theater.<br/><br/>There are of scientific elements to be found as it stimulates the concept of what it takes to explore the space. Some may feel remorseful while others may feel motivated but if there is one thing that we all learn from this film is an awareness to appreciate great nature that exists on the earth.<br/><br/>To reaffirm, ""Gravity"" does not take you any further than the rim of earth. There are no aliens, UFOs, and meteors. So if you are looking forward to encountering dynamic battle scenes that involve eccentric creatures, it won't be a movie for you. But that does not mean it is not worth watching as there won't be movies that can appeal the greatness and mechanics of both gravity and space better than this one for a while."

"diac228","9","2","3","10 October 2013"," Side-Effects to Gravity includes shortness of breath, elevated heartrate, and pure visual stimulation
","And you think your job sucks...<br/><br/>Containing some of the most claustrophobic space action since Alien, Gravity is a very tense and visually stimulating movie that contains some of the best usage of special effects in film within the past several decades. In a fashion similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, dialogue takes a backseat and all focus is on the imagery involving a struggle within the cold harsh world of outer space.<br/><br/>Every once in a while comes a movie that upon first viewing you become sure that it is going to nab every technical Oscar of the year. Terminator 2, Titanic, The Matrix, Inception, and Avatar comes into mind. Gravity falls into the same grouping because of its flawless usage of sound, camera-work, and special effects. Similar to how Jurassic Park shaped the way we see and hear dinosaurs on film, Gravity will be sure to do the same to outer space. With this film, outer space isn't just a backdrop, it is a true living, breathing environment that deserves to be respected and feared.<br/><br/>Without revealing too much, Gravity follows two astronauts as they struggle to survive within the boondocks of planet Earth when impending danger starts approaching their workspace. While the addition of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock doesn't exactly enhance the movie, their performances were quite good. But the best performance is that of Alfonso Curason, whose mix of close-ups, intense shots, elongated scenes, and astounding visual details makes this easily one of the best directing efforts in the past few years. The half decade spent on this production pays off, and it clearly shows why it took so long.<br/><br/>However, this movie's Hollywood mannerisms definitely hindered this from becoming a bonafide instant classic to the tune of 2001 (although I am in the minority and feel like Kubrick's space opera is a rather overrated work). Not seeing this in 3-D, it is obvious that some of the details in the movie were done less to move the plot and exercise the technical details and more because it was going to be released in 3-D and wanted to hand moviegoers its money's worth. Then there's the rather overbloated, overproduced, and overdramatic musical score done by a Doing-My-Best-Hans-Zimmer-Impression Steven Price. Against Hollywood wishes, the movie could have excelled even more relying purely on sound effects (and lack of) similar to No Country For Old Men.<br/><br/>Despite the two small gripes that prevent it from being a new-age Star Wars, Alien, or other sci-fi outer space masterpieces, Gravity is nonetheless a spectacular work of suffocating intensity that leaves you breathless throughout the merciful runtime of 90 minutes. Like the best visual works in film history, this is best enjoyed in the theater in front of a massive screen surrounded by darkness. In a year lacking of Best Picture quality films (so far), Gravity stands tall as the first great movie of the fall season.<br/><br/>Just be prepared to take deep breaths. This movie will take them away."

","I had gone to watch the movie after that scene in the trailer where SB is falling in space with no strings attached. That one really pushed me to watch Gravity and I am very happy that I did. The movie is in all about 2 astronauts stuck in space after an incident. Being stuck in space can be really really scary and that is what is shown in the movie. The views are amazing, the direction is breathtaking, the background score plays as important a role as SB or GC. Given that there is no sound in space, the severity of most incidents is established by the music. This is not science fiction. The cinematography, the camera angles are all phenomenal. Also, you will not be able to find any anomaly in the facts shown. Like how the things should be in space without gravity. If someone would have told me that Spielberg had made this movie I would have easily believed. Must watch."
"astjean","8","2","3","10 October 2013"," Fantastic visuals
","This film has outstanding visual characteristics and watching it in 3D adds to the enjoyment. Unfortunately some of the events seem a little too artificial simply to add to the suspense. Traveling great distances in a space suit with a limited power source did not seem probable, some characteristics of a weightless environment were either ignored of forgotten. You will notice how Sandra Bullocks hair stays nicely in place while everything else floats around inside the space station. I am not sure about events outside in space where some events seemed to indicate gravity where there should be none. More on screen time for George Clooney would have been nice and a little less of Sandra Bullock breathing hard and making sounds like a scared little girl. Hopefully NASA trains their people a little better than she seemed to indicate (she had to read an instruction manual in the escape pod to figure out how it worked?)and hopefully they choose people with a little more maturity that don't ignore commands from a superior. Finally, the ending with her rising from the pond scantily dressed to a music score suitable for the second coming was a bit too much for me."
"eddie_baggins","9","2","3","7 October 2013"," Technically flawless and one of the greatest cinema experiences ever offered
","Disclaimer ‚Äì This review was based on an IMAX 3-D version of the film.<br/><br/>If you're reading this review and have yet to take off into orbit with Gravity you should stop reading now and find the biggest screen available (in 3-D) and partake in what is likely to be one of if not the most technically flawless films ever made ‚Äì for Gravity make no doubt about it is an experience literally out of this world and a cinema experience that will perhaps forever rank as one of the best I have been lucky enough to partake in.<br/><br/>Any regular to J and E would be more than familiar with my advance hype and keenness for Gravity to hit our cinema screens so without further ado I can say this ‚Äì I told you so! (I don't get to say that to often so allow me my indulgence there) and as a repeat ‚Äì go see Gravity now on the biggest screen available to you.<br/><br/>It would be possible to rant on for hours on end about just how marvelous Alfonso Cuaron's space thriller is as a film making achievement and CGI touchstone ‚Äì the computer generated imagery on display here is scarily realistic! Gravity open's with one of the most audacious and spectacular tracking shots ever committed to film and from there it continues to push the boundaries of what has been done on screen before. It's clear that many pain staking hours of thought and commitment went into every minute and every shot of this film, from the construction of space tears through to every star in the vast open universe. It really is a joy to behold and no doubt a benchmark for filmmakers to now take off from.<br/><br/>All this technical wizardry would have fallen somewhat by the way side if Cuaron could not get a team to hold the movie together but thankfully his duo of Bullock (in a role that will be featuring in awards season) and the ever charming silver fox George Clooney deliver. Clooney offers his usual roguish charm and ever calm demeanor but it really is Bullocks film when it comes to the acting stakes and she really does give it her all. Bullock's performance gets under your skin so that every bump, near miss or floating through a shuttle will slowly feel like it is you the viewer experiencing these things which in all honesty can be a pretty scary thing when you are hurtling towards a space station at the speed of a bullet! With 3 paragraphs of praise behind me it now must be said that while Gravity as a technical point of view could be graded at nothing short of a perfect 5 stars there is something amiss in the film that stops it from reaching absolute perfection despite it being just to tough to pinpoint as a definite what that is. It could be any range of things from some script conveniences through to some misguided character driven scenes but really these are slight missteps in a movie universe that is totally and enthrallingly enjoyable for every last minute of its running time.<br/><br/>Gravity upon conclusion is one of the year's best movies, a film that will undoubtedly live long in the history of film and filmmaking. You have to be willing to take the ride with the film but it's a ride that you'll want to go on again and again and with that, Gravity deserves every last award that will come at it like hurling space debris come this awards season.<br/><br/>4 and a half fire extinguishers out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"gordonm888","9","2","3","7 October 2013"," Why Gravity is so great - an analysis after a 2nd viewing
","I just saw Gravity for the 2nd time, both times in IMAX 3D. Relieved of the suspense of following the plot, I was able to be a lot more analytical about what was working well and why the experience of Gravity is so overwhelming.<br/><br/>1. Musical score - This is probably the best musical score on a film that I have ever heard. Bullock and Clooney could have been pealing potatoes and the musical score would still have elicited an emotional response from the audience. But given the action on screen, the meshing of the musical score was just perfect. I can't emphasize enough how much the music carries the movie at spots. And yet, the music is never intrusive. I now realize that the musical scoring is an artistic accomplishment that is unsurpassed by any other aspect of Gravity, such as cinematography. <br/><br/>2. Sound and sound effects. - Given the sterile scenes of space, the sound effects have unusually high leverage in Gravity. Indeed, sometimes the bumping and rattling sounds are doing the story-telling. The low frequency part of the bumps and rattles are set to great amplification (in the sound mixing) to create the in-theater experience of shaking and vibrating -complementing what astronauts Ryan and Kowalski are undergoing on the screen. I'm not a sound expert, so I can't judge whether Gravity's sound effects and mixing were simply ""ordinary excellence"" or ""ground-breaking excellence"" -but the sound engineering was very,very good and unusually important and effective. <br/><br/>3. The visual effects. The progression of scenes in Gravity forms a sequence of ""reveals"" of first-time visual effects, so as to keep us in a continuous state of amazement for the first half of the film.<br/><br/>(a) the first reveal is the magnificent Earthscape that serves as the backdrop for the first third of Gravity. By the way, there is an error in the 3-D version. <br/><br/>(b) the second reveal is the unprecedented realism and special effects associated with the zero-gravity movement of the astronauts in space. This keeps us entertained until:<br/><br/>(c) the third reveal, which is the point-of-view of a spinning astronaut. We've never seen anything like that, and it persisted for what felt like several minutes. It was a very dramatic storytelling technique.<br/><br/>(d) the fourth reveal of a new visual effect is the ""head-wound"" of the third astronaut. The head-wound is on screen for just a few seconds, but it certainly is a powerful visual and really shakes the audience. We have never seen anything like that, either.<br/><br/>(e) the fifth reveal of new visual effects is the complexity and ""reality"" of the external view of the International Space Station (ISS). Wow! If the viewer hasn't bought into the movie at this point, then they must be a different species than I am.<br/><br/>(f) the sixth reveal is the visual scenes of the destruction of the ISS by the satellite debris. This scene is probably the visual highlight of Gravity. The decoupling of sound from the carnage (in the vacuum of space)is completely correct but makes this a new experience. We hear Ryan's breathing and the bumping sounds as she moves around the structure, but these personal Point-Of-View sounds are unconnected to the visual scenes of large structural explosions and shredding. All of this is matched by a musical score which swells with the destruction and guides our emotions. <br/><br/>After the ISS destruction, Cuar√≥n has used much of his bag of tricks (for visual effects)and he turns to Sandra Bullock, alone and shed of her space suit, to carry the film with her acting and make the film more human.<br/><br/>4. Acting. After a second review, I realize that Sandra Bullock does considerably more than saying ""uh-uh-uh-uh."" She has a fair number of very fine acting moments. Her voice and face acting are excellent during her initial discussion about her dead daughter. Her entire lengthy scene within the Soyuz lander module is very well done. Other than tears that form spherical drops that float towards the audience (Cuar√≥n's seventh reveal of a new visual effect) this segment of Gravity depends almost totally on Bullock's acting for success. And successful it is! I closely studied Bullock's acting and she does a masterful job of carrying these scenes. Very nice job.<br/><br/>On second viewing, even Clooney has his acting moments, when there are closeups of his face as he delivers key lines. His best scenes are when he reports to Houston on the Space Shuttle destruction, and when he tells Bullock that he needs to de-tether from her. Well done! He won't win an acting Oscar for this, but he can certainly be proud of his personal acting performance. <br/><br/>5. Pacing/film editing. The pacing was superb - creating an extremely intense experience with well-timed ""quiet moments."" I am not an expert, but everything about the editing seemed to work well. ***********************<br/><br/>For a film where virtually every aspect was an A+, the ending of Gravity still seemed like a B on second viewing, a bit of a let-down. It wasn't terrible, though, and it did have the virtue of not lingering overly long. But it was a bit anti-climatic and arguably did not deliver the emotional impact that it should have. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought the emotional intensity and power of Gravity was staggering, almost rising to the level of cinematic poetry. This is a must-see film."
"ghost_dog86","9","2","3","5 October 2013"," Hope Floats
","Screw ""The Blind Side""! Where's Sandra Bullock's Oscar nomination for ""Gravity""?! Not a spoiler, but while this film does star Bullock and George Clooney, this is Bullock's movie, in the same way ""Cast Away"" was Tom Hanks' movie.<br/><br/>From the initial sequence (which happens to be one of the greatest long takes I have ever seen) ""Gravity"" contains a nonstop barrage of emotionally breathtaking visual sequences (with even the POV working exceptionally well) an emotionally draining string of events and a handful of shots, so powerful (on a technical and emotional level) that they will simply leave you speechless, as you gaze upon the screen for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>The two reasons people may be apprehensive to see ""Gravity"" are: <br/><br/>1.They think that it's going to be like ""Open Water"" and they thought ""Open Water"" was boring. The fact is, ""Gravity"" is more like ""127 Hours"", which is definitely not boring. But more importantly, the greatest difference between ""Open Water"" and ""Gravity"" (and I really enjoyed ""Open Water"") is that one contains Oscar worthy direction...and the other is ""Open Water"".<br/><br/>2.They think that because it is set around someone stranded in space, it is unrelatable. While the plot's relatablitly may come under well deserved scrutiny (I mean, how many of us are ever going to find ourselves stranded in space with George Clooney?) it doesn't take anything away from the movie's suspenseful nature and entertainment value. Plus (and this may be getting too artsy-fartsy) writer/director Alfonso Cuaron has constructed his film in such a way, that while it is about a situation a vast majority may not be able to fathom, the themes of isolation, regret and mortality make ""Gravity"" more relatable than most Hollywood dramas set on Earth.<br/><br/>Flaws: With visuals as masterful as these, a lackluster story could have the potential to be seen as a blemish on an otherwise beautiful face. And admittedly, the story here is ultra simplistic (Synopsis: Sandra Bullock is an astronaut. After an accident leaves her stranded in space, she must figure out a way to get back to earth before it's too late). Yet, as this movie progresses, the more and more I seemed to develop an appreciation for how well the story was put together. This doesn't mean that there weren't flaws within ""Gravity"" that didn't bother me a little. The biggest one being: Near the end, ""Gravity"" contains some sequences of forced Oscar bait, punctuated by a few lines of melodrama. But, even in this case, said flaws can be forgiven in an IMAX theater.<br/><br/>Final Thought: As I alluded to earlier, aside from the stunning (the Oscar for best director goes to¬Ö) visuals, the fact that ""Gravity"" works as a straight story as well as a metaphor, gives the hardly-there plot a tremendous amount of heft and complexity. ""Gravity"" is a true triumph in filmmaking, which leads me to my final line. A final line which I never thought I would be compelled to write in all my years of film criticism: I wish I had seen this movie in IMAX 3D!"
"Stephen_BU","7","8","21","11 October 2013"," My 2/10 Rating Is Made To Bring Gravity Back Down To Earth (Actual=8/10)
","I really did like Gravity and don't actually think it deserves a 2/10, but when I saw the 8.7 rating my expectations went through the roof. The trailer didn't really interest me and the hype was really the only thing that made me see the movie. It was pretty much exactly what I thought it was going to be. A survival movie that shows both the physical and metal aspects of being alone in space, as well as being disconnected from the world. It also has references to the origin of life, as well as a lot of religious undertones. I think part of the reason I didn't love this film as much as others is because I am not the biggest fan of survival movies. If you like survival movies and the preview had you hooked, you will love this film as much as the others on IMDb. If you wondered what all of the hype was about, you still might be wondering after the movie. I'd give it an 8/10."

","The hype machine has been working overtime on Alfonso Cuar√≥n's ""Gravity,"" with the phrases ""game changer"" and ""all time greatest"" being bandied about like candy on Halloween.

Once a film (or any pop culture landmark) hits, reality sets in.

"daniewhite-1","4","1","1","24 February 2020"," Relativity Disappointing
","What goes up must come down and this film certainly let me down rather uncomfortably after exciting considerable anticipation.<br/><br/>Plotwise an incredible piece of utter bunkum that would have graced a b-movie of yore jarred conspicuously with a parred down aesthetic and a lean narrative style.<br/><br/>Having two major Hollywood a-list stars leading proceedings prevented any sense of impersonality and ""this could sort of really be happening"" suspension of disbelief on my part.<br/><br/>Which again proved incompatible with the obviously earnest and resolute direction and tone.<br/><br/>Also such obviously incongruous co-orbitals as the NASA Space shuttle (already retired with great fanfare) a live Hubble repair mission (similarly publicly discontinued....its on its own now) with the I.S.S. and the Chinese multi module space station (not yet built as of February 2020) further dented my interest in this ""realistic"" film.<br/><br/>Realistic, or realism, as a crucial value of this film was fatally undermined for me by all of the above considerations.<br/><br/>Almost every conceit of the film was beyond any sustained credit, for example: a mission scientist realistically dealing with the return space craft was an odd point to insist that we accept.<br/><br/>The travel between and arrival at each space station was equally comic book-ish.<br/><br/>I found one plot conceit to be utterly bewildering however and that was the radio message conversation with a non-English speaker on Earth.... I can not accept that no ground based space agency, certainly not NASA, would have failed to attempt this method of communication with possibly living astronauts of theirs within the situation of events depicted in 'Gravity'.<br/><br/>Preposterous is the best categorisation for this very notion.<br/><br/>All taken together I was unimpressed by 'Gravity' ""in the round"" and as much as I can complement some individual facets, as a whole it is much less than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>Those positives include fair work from the two leading actors.<br/><br/>Good production design and impressive practical effects work.<br/><br/>A clear, albeit incoherent, inconsistent and self-contradictory, creative vision.<br/><br/>Therefore I rate at 4/10 where many features are highly commendable but the film as a whole delivers the highest of bunkum almost ripe from the fruitiest of early twentieth century science fiction literature let alone mid century b-movie madness and this creates a tonal mess of a movie which defies believability and frustrates enjoyment accordingly."

","Right out of the gate, let me say that there's really not much you can do with a story like this.<br/><br/>Script?

It's supposed to be one of the ""great"" film premises and it always works.<br/><br/>It works here. Bullock and Clooney do just what's needed, and Bullock's character takes center stage for most of the film. It was definitely worth watching, and yes a lot of it was definitely suspension of disbelief, but what is a film like this without those nick-of-the-moment scenes where disaster is averted.<br/><br/>Bullock's desperation to get home definitely drives these moments nicely. The whole struggle of moving around properly with zero gravity is displayed nicely too. Clooney's devil-may-care fighter pilot attitude works well here.<br/><br/>Twelve Years a Slave won best picture that year and this film is no competition for that masterpiece. The effects and cinematography were so superb that it really took the project to the top. It held my interest even if I had to wait through the slow parts.<br/><br/>This film is not as bad as some say, and not spectacular either as some others say. Worth seeing for sure."

The characters are thin, dialogue is cheeky and wooden, and the events that occur just have you asking questions. It's not the events that occur to move the plot forward but it's like the Cuaron brothers decided to shove dumb action scenes in this movie to build tension, when this could've been put towards the characters. Also the music is the most generic score I've heard in a big budget movie like this, it sounds like they bought it off a stock music website.

"josephinemallorys","8","1","1","14 February 2019"," Felt a little hollow
","Visually, Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie. The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive.<br/><br/>On every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals, the chinks start showing up. Overall the script is very weak. Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything in its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request, Kowalski (who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while, floating around, spouting inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to disengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts.<br/><br/>We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human. Apart from this minor bit, nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea.<br/><br/>Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense. Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she does it three times), the debris presents itself like on cue every single time. Then a fire in a space station, then running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It's fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense.<br/><br/>Also at times I couldn't shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual. Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them? Really? Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages, why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me. Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can't-understand-this-thing machinery.<br/><br/>The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about. Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy. I wont even mention the in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is.<br/><br/>But it's not. Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either."
"tabuno","8","1","1","16 January 2019"," A Visually Dazzling Emotional Survival Ride
","7 October 2013. Gravity begins in a way suggestive of cautionary film producers of movies that offer drastically new, unknown potential, hedging their bets on an unknown audience by incorporating brief written explanations of what actual outer space is like or perhaps that introduce some dazzle as a way to ensure captivating the audience at the start of a movie, like Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) that spent time offering fascinating tidbits of tantalizing visions of outer space and the Starship Enterprise or like even Event Horizon (1997) that offered up the almost by now obligatory space shots of weightless objects spinning in space for the audience's vicarious space experience. Additionally, George Clooney was provided with an almost by now clique dialog seemingly formulaic in the same manner as Space Cowboys (2000). And whether or not the Executive Decision (1996) plot element was added as a psychological twist ploy and was even technically accurately portrayed was necessary or not is debatable. Like with Avatar (2009), Wall*e (2008), Life of Pi (2012), or Titanic (1997), Gravity presents its audience with a sharply breaking visual cinematic experience which may in time soften its innovative impact with future generations. But it can't be argued that this huge spectacular survival story bombards its audience with new amazing visions of space travel and space debris that have not been seen on film that delight and awe.<br/><br/>Interestingly this movie resembles the action version of an earlier lonely space station movie Love (2007) and uses the thrilling action visuals somewhat like Apollo 18 (2011) used its fresh and well edited space dialog and space behavior that captured the audience's attention. Gravity retains the same sense of eerie foreign exhilaration of the classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) by adhering to the stark ambiance and the potentially frightening personal isolation and dynamically different physical environmental effects of outer space or the monsters of the frozen tundra of The Thing (1982) or duplicating the psychological trying experience of attempting survive one night in a simple haunted hotel room of 1408 (2007), or the technical mysteries and dangers in science of Splice (2010). Overall, Gravity like The Andromeda Strain (1971) presents on screen an amazing compelling dramatic science fiction scenario that is also closely related to the personal survival theme from Touching The Void (2004) that brings its audience into personally experiencing a prolonged harrowing life struggle event. It can't be argued that this movie brings into full explosive and thrilling life the wondrous terrors of outer space into the darkened auditorium of the theater. It is Sandra Bullock's performance a little ways into the movie that really shines here (ignoring the early dialog like Clooney's that doesn't seem logically suited to the reality of the situation) that allows one to ignore the unlikely events that occur written for dramatic sake and make this movie into one of powerful presentation of human frailty and courage from a deeply personal place."

","Gravity is a lot like Open Water, Castaway and other tragedy movies in which a person is stranded in a dire situation. I'd say the monumental difference is that in the other movies the people were at least on Earth. I can't even imagine being stranded in space: limited oxygen, no water, no food, infinite darkness--that's stuff of night terrors.<br/><br/>But that was the situation Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) was in and her reaction was not unlike most anyone's would be: abject fear. This movie was intense throughout and if you can put yourself into that situation it makes for very heart-racing event. <br/><br/>What I thought was most amazing about the movie was how they were able to create a frightening and desperate scenario with little-to-no noise. They set it up at the beginning by stating that sound doesn't travel in space, so when catastrophe struck it was visual only. It was quite awesome."

But what I absolutely fancy in this movie is the space and how it is shown. Total silence and the amazing, mesmerizing views. If you dive then you may know what I am talking about - but that's still perhaps 10% of what you experience up there (yes, I wish I could do space dive before I am gone :). <br/><br/>To sum up - watch the movie.

","I wonder what it would be like just floating around space without having to overcome dangerous obstacles, either being hit by those things coming at ya or bumping into obstacles that aren't moving very fast. One cannot truly control the direction of an objects trajectory in space or the manner in which a body will move toward objects in space without proper guidance and focus.<br/><br/>I thought the movie depicted a pretty good representation of what might occur if lost in space, but it still makes me go 'hmmmm' because of fascination. The visuals/graphics were seriously intense. How does one make a movie like this? George Clooney and especially Sandra Bullock were phenomenal astronauts. Zero gravity in space, and then full gravity on earth? That has to mess with a body's equilibrium some. Phew, I was nervous for them. It seemed so real and reasonable. I noticed Sandra Bullock doing a lot of talking to herself as well and that makes it believable.<br/><br/>Darn, I didn't see this movie in 3D/IMAX! That has to be way more intense! The cinematography, superb! I'm interested in the documentary, 'the making of this movie' to see everyone's involvement. WOW! One could ask a lot of questions about this movie in terms of different outcomes, for sure. Sandra Bullock mentions that one of the space stations is about 100 kilometers away, which we all know is about 60 miles...and then when George Clooney comes back into the scene, he states that it is about 100 miles, which is about 40 miles more than Sandra Bullock stated. So I got a bit confused. Either they messed up about the miles/kilometers ratio or Sandra Bullock wasn't heading toward the space station, but away from it. I got a bit lost in that translation. But I only saw it once so far and I could be in the wrong. Nonetheless, still a movie worth watching, in 3D/IMAX no less. I'm wanting the IMAX version here for myself!"
"classicsoncall","7","1","1","7 May 2017"," ""...we sure could use a rescue mission.""
","I'm not as upset watching the film today as I would have been three years ago during awards season with this picture coming in on seven Oscar wins. I'll grant the ones for cinematography and special effects, those were well deserved. However the nominations for Best Picture and Best Actress seem misplaced among some of the stronger contenders for those awards that year.<br/><br/>I guess the main problem I have with the story is that I didn't have a sense that this is something that could actually happen in outer space. So with that, the inherent dangers faced by mission commander Kowalski (George Clooney) and specialist Stone (Sandra Bullock) didn't arouse a sense of panic and danger that I would have expected from a sci-fi thriller. The idea that Stone could maneuver her way to distant orbiting Russian and Chinese space stations also seemed like a stretch to this viewer. I don't know anything about the mechanics of outer space travel or what astronauts are capable of doing, but even for a layman I thought the science here was really pushing it. I know one thing for sure, no frogs live in the ocean, so the one that swam by Stone on re-entry was completely out of place.<br/><br/>I guess the thing here is to enjoy the camera work and special effects without thinking too much about the science involved. I'll give the nod to Clooney's character when he said at one point before disappearing - ""You gotta admit one thing, you can't beat the view."""

","When she (Dr. Stone) finally landed in the water, swam her way to the top and grabbed on to that wet sand as if to propose that she just held the world - which a few minutes prior felt worlds away - in her palm, made me realize more graphically, that there was space, between me and the intended emotion. I didn't quite connect with the planned nostalgia... And though I feel Alfonso ultimately did a really good job, I feel he robbed me of his vision, because there was something missing.<br/><br/>Also, I love Sandra Bullock, but her performance, though too, very good... Perhaps needed a little more than just being, very good. George Clooney also gets a thumbs up, but I kept wondering if maybe, someone else could've played the role better. Reason being, I didn't expect his death, yet still, when it happened, I didn't feel the loss. Lt Matt was clearly meant to be lovable, so that his unfortunate departure could create that, hole. Sadly (and maybe it's because of the script), though the execution was right, something was missing.<br/><br/>However, Steven Price was on point, and the end credits answered a question that kept harassing me; ""How difficult was it, to shoot this film""? Gravity had 1 director, 1 cinematographer... And, an additional cinematographer. That just put a smile on my face, because it's clear when you're watching this movie that, it couldn't have been easy...

","Going into Gravity I had high hopes. Its got good reviews, a great metascore, several awards, etc. How could I not expect something great? <br/><br/>The movie wasn't amazing. It was completely overrated in my point of view. Sure, the CGI was great (even on DVD), the characters likable, the acting well-done and all that stuff, but I felt like all this could have been better. <br/><br/>The characters had so much potential, but were never fully explored. Sure, there was a bit of back story for Ryan Stone, but not nearly as much for Matt Kowalski. Still, Ryan's back story wasn't enough to warrant any real or deep character development. They felt somewhat forced at times, which really took away from it. You may say that this was a movie made for its visuals, but the fact that it still tried to put character development in made me feel like it certainly wasn't trying to make itself all about the visuals. <br/><br/>The acting was quite average, if you ask me. Lots of hyperventilating, but otherwise it didn't stand out to me as much as other acting has (ex. Brad Pitt from Twelve Monkeys). The characters were well- executed, but it wasn't an absolutely brilliant performance or anything.<br/><br/>Gravity is a movie of constant tension and suspense, and yet I never felt that Ryan was in any real danger. It was fairly obvious that she would survive, and towards the end I felt like she was doing certain things simply to create conflict, no matter how minor. A lot of tension material was recycled throughout the movie as well. I'm sure that this is realistic, but it felt very unoriginal eventually. <br/><br/>Overall, Gravity had so much potential. The characters seemed to be the driving force of the movie over the story (it wasn't a particularly interesting or deep story), and yet that potential never felt like it was truly tapped into. In the end, it was really just an average movie, but could have been far better. Its worth watching if your interested, but that's about it for this movie."

","Unique. I did not say perfect. Sandra Bullock gives a better performance than her role in ""Blind Side"" but lost to a first time foreign black actress, such is Hollywood. Bullock is tense almost from the beginning. Only a chatty George Cloney lightens her a little, before the space storm hits. She fears, she panics, she gives up temporarily then gets rejuvenated - I won't say how - then overcomes. What made this a unique experience is she is all alone in space, in the boundless void where few human have subjected too. The struggle to survive is not new, but the appreciation of the victory in just being able to walk on Tera firma is universally shared; in fact this is why we go to the movies. Thank God for gravity. Without it we will all be float away somewhere. While there is much to celebrate about the theme, the movie isn't perfect. Bullock's personal background of having lost her little girl is not well developed. And I still have a hard time placing Bullock in a college science lab. Her role as Dr Stone would have been more believable she appears more bookish. George Cloney is too suave. Those are minor flaws however if you just take in a unique movie experience.<br/><br/>By the way someone had mention Rachel Wiez be a better choice. Agree totally. But the bean counters at the studio wanted Bullock for the box office appeal."

Its a universal movie that reminds you life can be tough, and there are things that haunt you. But sometimes, you just have to let go. Let go and enjoy the ride that is life. Any person going and has been through tough times can relate.<br/><br/>Visually, words aren't enough to describe how breathtaking it is. This is the best use of CGI I've seen in a long time. It's only made better by the amazing cinematography, and Alfonso Cauron's signature super long takes with the camera free floating in space.<br/><br/>Only two actors in this movie, and both nail it. That's all I will say. In fact, its better if you watch Gravity knowing as little about it. Do yourself a favor and see this movie no matter what type of person you are. I recommend 3D-Imax.

"polismbit","1","5","12","10 January 2014"," these are the words of tcara111 the best reviewer of this movie . I complete agree with you my friend !
","Did those who've written glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie I did? Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. And I don't want to rag on it, but if you're going to make a dramatic science thriller, you had better get it right or expect to catch it from the smart people. Despite the cosmic setting, the only star I can give Gravity is for the computer generated graphics.That said, this is not a movie for intellectuals and those of a scientific bent will be sorely disappointed. What made Ron Howard's Apollo 13 so gripping was its dramatic realism and superb acting. Unfortunately, none of those adjectives applies to Gravity, with the possible exception of some drama. However, for thinkers, effective drama requires an intellectual investment in the credibility of the story, the characters and the interaction between them. Intelligent humans need to believe that what is being depicted could actually happen. Unfortunately, the events depicted in Gravity are likely to alienate anyone with an above average IQ. Once one has acknowledged the impressive graphics, any anticipation of emotional investment is quickly dashed to smithereens by the unbelievably vapid and inane dialog. It is painfully obvious that someone with a double-digit scientific IQ appears to have awoken one morning and haphazardly decided to write a ""space movie"". The physics are off, the events highly improbable. The entire story demands a suspension of belief in reality. Worst of all, the dialog and interaction between the characters is so juvenile that anyone with a brain gets the immediate impression that the project is the product of sophomoric show-biz types who think that the way to move the product is to recycle hackneyed clich√©s, shiny objects and big explosions. Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is so unprepared and emotionally disabled by adversity that it is impossible to believe that she would have been selected as a mission specialist. Yet, she manages to flit from one space wreck to another and yet another. She consults operation manuals in Russian and, later, Chinese, yet she is heard muttering ""eeny meeny miney mo"" while haphazardly pushing control buttons like some clueless chimpanzee. The space vehicle's communication equipment fails to pick up ""Houston Control"", yet, miraculously, is able to receive a bizarre Chinese comedy and howling dogs, which Bullock's character feels compelled to imitate. Clooney's character, Matt Kowalski, is such a clich√©d hero that he is depicted as nonchalantly jesting with the hysterical Dr. Stone while he himself is drifting into a desperately life-ending situation. We are expected to believe that, despite having trained intimately together for this mission, these characters address each other by their formal titles and make clich√©d announcements back to a non-responsive mission control. Kowalksi has waited until he's drifting to his death to ask where Dr. Stone is from and if she has any kids. Finally, director Cuaron makes a supremely lame attempt at cinematic iconography depicting Bullock floating in a fetal position, a la Kubrick's Space Odessey. And after having had such a bad day and having plunged to Earth in a flaming meteor-like reentry, Stone emerges, unscathed and barefoot mind you, from the ocean onto an idyllic, uninhabited beach like some primal human emerging from the sea. Now, I feel bad about feeling bad about this movie. And I respect Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney as actors. However, it is my humble opinion that actors must assume some responsibility for the roles they accept. This movie was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. Alas, other than the black hole into whose abyss was irretrievably sucked away any hope I once had for discovering intelligent life in this movie, ""Gravity"" lacked gravitas"

","In the first few moments of this movie I was struck by the sheer majesty of planet Earth viewed from orbit. As a photographer when you stand on a cliff edge and overlook a breathtaking valley below it takes your breath away and it is nearly impossible to focus on anything in particular. But that's the best it gets in Gravity! While the rest of the movie jumps from crisis to crisis and we are exposed to the harsh reality of existing in space, it is filled with ""unbelievable"" scenarios that you most assuredly need to suspend any rational thinking/opinions. It is a work of extreme fiction. I was disgusted/frustrated and annoyed that we are forced to accept that a Russian missile, presumably an ICBM (intercontinental Ballistic Missile) or something similar is launched to destroy a former Soviet Spy Satellite and the result of the satellites destruction is a hail of metal fragments that proceed to circumnavigate the planet destroying Shuttlecraft, other Satellites, the International Space Station and pretty much everything else....yeah right! Now lets take a step into reality, since man started putting satellites into orbit when they become of no use they simply let their orbit decay and they get eaten up in the atmosphere. On top of that, not all satellites, space stations and what not are all located at the same distance from the earth (ie they don't maintain the same geostationary orbit) so even if debris was blowing around the planet it wouldn't affect everything around the world. This movie was utter crap, shame on you Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. But the title of worst director/writer is owned by Alfonso Cuaron...shame on you for making scenically spectacular utter trash!"

","With one white-knuckle scene after another, 'Gravity' pulls you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until its' finale. It is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen, and not ponying up for the 3D, IMAX or XD does this movie a huge injustice. 'Gravity' is the reason these movie formats were made. The special effects are seamless and the sound effects are fantastic -- Even the brilliant use of silence. The story is gripping, touching, scary and thought- provoking, and the acting superb. I can't say enough about it, except you need to experience it. This isn't just a movie; it's a moment. <br/><br/>Hat's off to the director for brilliant pacing. The film never drags and is exactly how long it needs to be. When I left, I was exhausted from holding my breath so much and running it longer may have taken some of that away.<br/><br/>You've been bombarded with previews and read some reviews, but don't think anybody spoiled it for you. The story still has not been given away and if you think you know the movie because you have seen so many previews, you are very wrong. Not knowing how the movie turns out is a lot of the fun. It certainly is not predictable. Don't trust the bad reviews. Believe the hype. True -- There is no sinister bad guy nor creepy space monster. Outer space is the monster in this movie. It's part of what makes this movie seem so real. This is NOT a sci-fi movie. The space shuttle, satellites and the International Space Station are all real. There are no sci-fi, made up crafts. The props represent things really in outer space and that's part of it's scary draw. The story is not formulaic and laid out in front of you, but that is it's appeal. It is certainly there; it's just a story told in a very different way. It will certainly have you thinking and contemplating the important things in life.<br/><br/>In a nutshell -- It's like a visually fantastic summer blockbuster with Oscar appeal. It's something you will be thinking about and talking about days after you see it, and what more can you ask of a movie?"

","What more can be said about director Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece, Gravity, that hasn't already been written by almost every single other person that writes about movies on the planet? In the film, Sandra Bullock portrays Dr. Ryan Stone, a first time astronaut on a routine space mission that turns to disaster when she is disconnected from her space shuttle by space debris. It's one of those amazing films that has you thinking the whole time: How did they do that? The combination of the real with the computer generated is so seamless, that you can never tell what's physical and what isn't, because it all looks so real. To say that this film lives up the hype would be an understatement, so as I sit here writing, adding to the neverending parade of noise surrounding this film, I figured I'd take an atypical approach with this review. I'm going to sum up what I thought about Gravity in a game of word association, rather than going into depth on the story and how emotionally powerful it is on all of the base human emotions, from fear to a will to live, because otherwise I could keep writing all day long. So, without anymore preamble, here's what I really thought of Gravity:<br/><br/>Space -- Beautiful. Alfonso -- Genius. Sandra -- Phenomenal. Disaster -- Suspenseful. Humanity -- Triumphant. Oscar -- Guaranteed.<br/><br/>I give Gravity a 10 out of 10!"

She and what's 'is name are flying along tethered together and they reach the ISS and her foot is caught in the lines of the Soyuz parachute and he says ""you gotta let me go."" I have no idea why because they are securely attached to the ISS, but some mysterious force is pulling him away from her, so instead of her grabbing the parachute lines and pulling them both to the Soyuz space craft he, for some unknown reason, frees himself from the tether that has him safely attached to her and floats away toward Earth, even though there was no force to cause him to float off.

Yes, there will come a time when being out in space will perhaps be an accepted state, but one would remain in a relative state of awareness at the threat that surrounds their mortality; to be clowning around as Clooney and the space loons are, is just utterly implausible. Go and watch Moon or Interstellar or Martian. This film is utter rubbish. I just had to stop this movie so I wouldn't waste any more of my oxygen wishing that Sandra bullock would run out of hers."

I honestly don't know whats wrong with the critics. The movie was already doomed from the start. I was bored out of my mind only 15 minutes after the movie started. For those of you who have not seen the movie, it is basically a story of a woman trapped in space trying to find her way back to earth. The problem with this movie is not the story line, but how it was executed. It is extremely boring and awful because the story wasn't going anywhere, it was too long, the acting was poor, there was only one setting, Sandra bullock faced way too many problems, and there was no chemistry what so ever between the only two characters in the entire movie. I was surprised because Clooney and bullock were supposed to be great actors, but i don't know. Frankly i won't advice anyone to go see this movie if they don't want to regret wasting their time."

The hatch is obviously on the top, so please give characters foresight and intelligence otherwise I feel nothing for or toward them other than annoyance. That capsule crap was the last straw for me, it was just mistake after mistake, because she didn't think a single thing through. <br/><br/>Come on even I know that fire and oxygen rich environments like space stations don't mix, and I didn't train to go into space. So why float on by the little obvious flames? Isn't that stuff you learn at the kindergarten of astronaut training.

","When James Cameron introduced Pandora through Avatar, 3D became a sensation on Hollywood. As a result, VFX gained more importance than other aspects of a movie. As Chris Nolan mentioned, 3D effects somewhat drained the essence of the story. Visual gimmicks and slow-motion shots became a usual sight on the movies. Apart from these movies, Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity stands out differently. It is a movie which is shot in 3D, not a movie shot for 3D. Prior to it's release, moviegoers all over the world, were keen to categorize this movie as an upcoming fop. But, it turned out to be one of the major successes this year, both critically and financially. Currently, it holds a meta critic score of 96% and a suitable position on IMDb 250 list. Without a doubt, it is one of the best astronaut movie ever made in world cinema. It has the technical excellence like in 2001: A space odyssey, and realistic treatment as in Apollo 13. It shows how fragile the life in space and how important and nostalgic the gravity is. Performances from the lead, Sandra Bullock and George Cloony, are remarkable. Gravity is one hell of ride of courage, sentiments, and thrill. You better be rush to the theaters, because, so far this is the most perfect 3D experience I ever had."

","you may have heard about the wonderful visuals on display in Gravity and yes these might be worth the price of admission, but considering the amount of hype surrounding this film I expected it to have more depth and was surprised to see a basic and shallow blockbuster action movie <br/><br/>mainly Sandra Bullock's character came across to me as being very shallow going from extreme panic, to bark like a dog dejected woman, to ms motivated with no subtleties in between. It's as if she was abducted by aliens from a shopping mall and beamed into a space suit in orbit. i found her performance perfectly unbelievable <br/><br/>Clooney is... Clooney in a space suit and he reminded me of buzz lightyear <br/><br/>There were also some extremely cheesy moments, like the 3d tears, the bit where Bullock howls like a pooch, Clooney angel, and the very end of the film where we pan up Bullocks ms. universe body is quite cringe-worthy too<br/><br/>On a technical level I disliked the sound design in the movie. I'd heard from many audio people that the soundtrack was amazing, but it is very see it hear it throughout and the focus on hearing every breath Bullock takes becomes very grating after awhile. They could've established the claustrophobia and still taken some chances with the sound, instead it's turn this screw and hear a muted screw turn, and of course the customary post explosion tinnitus sound. All very predictable <br/><br/>(I'm no astrophysicist but I also found some of the science in the movie to be a little sketchy.. eg. the effects on the human body when exposed to a vacuum. I think Arnie was closer in Total Recall!)<br/><br/>All of the above obviously suited the film makers since they were clearly batting for a basic commercial blockbuster action movie with great 3d visuals to earn lots of dollars, which is what Gravity is"
"EUyeshima","10","4","9","7 October 2013"," Cuar√≥n's Dazzling Space Odyssey Turns into a Cathartic Journey of the Human Spirit
","The irony of the film's title is that there isn't any, gravity that is, but that's not to say it lacks gravitas. It does in ways both unexpected and transcendent. It's been seven long years since Alfonso Cuar√≥n's last film, 2006's emotionally propulsive thriller, ""Children of Men"", which was a masterful work of suspense in the midst of one seriously dystopian vision of the apocalypse. Somehow, the less-than-prolific filmmaker manages to surpass that impressive work with this terrifying yet genuinely profound 2013 science-fiction thriller that buzzes by in a fleet 91 minutes. Although Ang Lee effectively used 3-D CGI effects to enhance the magical realism of ""Life of Pi"", I have never seen a film use them as purposefully and powerfully as Cuar√≥n does here within the dramatic structure of the story. Co-written with his son Jon√°s, the screenplay, by contrast, is life-size in its intimacy and even with all the technical jargon, at times poetic. This combination gives the film an almost mythic reach and at the same time, brings insight into the way the human spirit works against the overwhelming emptiness of space. The story takes place about 372 miles above Earth, and the alternately ethereal and scarifying setting is captured in brilliant detail by ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and special effects master Tim Webber.<br/><br/>Pay particularly close attention to the uninterrupted seventeen-minute sequence that opens the film. It's a bravura piece of cinema by anyone's standards. In brief, bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone is on her first space mission studiously installing a device to fix the Hubble Space Telescope on the U.S Space Shuttle Explorer. Mission commander Matt Kowalski is a veteran astronaut who devilishly spacewalks around her in a jet pack. Mission Control reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites which transforms into a massive attack of hurling debris that arrives in a matter of seconds and will continue to make an orbital return causing massive destruction every ninety minutes. There is no time for the crew to return to the shuttle much less Earth, and the damage to the craft and nearby International Space Station is extensive. It's enough to say that Stone sets off on a journey not only of physical survival but spiritual awakening as her character has been in a listless state since a senseless personal tragedy occurred back home. If you don't count the voiceovers at the beginning, there are only two actors who make up the entire cast, and they are grade-A stars who bring their personal charisma to the fore.<br/><br/>George Clooney has the smaller of the two roles as Kowalski, and he uses his natural insouciance to great effect as his wisecracking gives way to a character who provides the knowledgably becalming tone that Stone needs at the story's most critical points. He makes one particularly risky scene work by the sheer magnitude of his character's life- affirming bravado. He also impressively wrote the scene. Even so, this is Sandra Bullock's film from start to finish, and it amazes me how she wasn't even among the top casting choices for the role (Angelina Jolie turned it down twice). Although Stone may come across as emotionally stunted, Bullock offers her natural likability as a necessary counterbalance. However, that observation short-changes her stellar work here, especially the pure physicality of her performance. Intriguingly, her character is not that far removed from the one she played nearly twenty years earlier in ""While You Were Sleeping"" in that both deal with personal losses with an emotional alertness that wins us over completely. Only this time she does it with a graceful maturity that deepens the catharsis of the incredible odyssey she experiences, this in spite of a few overtly sentimental moments thrown in for good measure. Regardless, this is Cuar√≥n's towering cinematic achievement, and the movie truly stands on its own."

","Gravity is a stunning portrayal of reality created through computer generated imagery blended with live action. Are there technical flaws in the crafting of this magnificent creation? Perhaps. If there were, I was unaware of them as I am not an expert on space travel. And, if there were, they can easily be forgiven as there are no flaws in the presentation of the story. As the events in this film unfold, there is a sense of intense urgency that grabs hold of the viewer and doesn't let go until the final scenes. The fragility of the film's main character is its cause. One can make a parallel between the character's utter vulnerability and that of our planet, which has an almost constant presence on the screen. While the film's heroine faces the challenge of being adrift in space with a finite supply of oxygen, the earth has a fragile and finite atmosphere that is vital to human existence. Just as she struggles to ensure her continued supply of oxygen, we struggle to maintain an atmosphere on earth capable of sustaining life. In her quest, the heroine encounters one setback after another. While we face the challenge of ever growing levels of toxicity in our atmosphere, with one setback after another to the effort of countering its growth. The film's auteur, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, may have merely been creating an action thriller, I would like to think his motive went much deeper. No matter his motives, Gravity is a masterpiece on many levels and should not be missed."
"ebadong","9","4","9","5 October 2013"," A Space Movie That Breaks New Ground
","Gravity. What's ironic is that it's exactly what lacks in almost the entirety of the movie: that powerful, unseen force which keeps everybody's feet literally on the ground. <br/><br/>Gravity triumphs on multiple levels. From cinematography to special effects to musical scoring to a story so close to home despite the setting so far from it, this film breaks new ground (or space) in movie-making. Anyone watching it would be left wondering how they managed to get those shots of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock not only from every imaginable angle, but also the continuity of certain scenes that would have required lengthy retakes if there had been errors during the shoot (which brought to my mind 'Snake Eyes'). <br/><br/>I'd recommend that you watch it in 3D if you really want to have a virtual feel of spacewalking that can give you both that feeling of unease and wonder of being in space (the latter being something that really made me even become more in awe of God's creations, seeing earth from space with its many visages). <br/><br/>What's also ironic, at least from my experience in watching it, is that the immense space can actually make you feel claustrophobic, at least from Bullock's point of view. The more she drifted away from anything that would keep her from hurtling into deep space, the more you'll feel both the vastness of the universe and life slipping away as earth becomes even more out of reach and out of sight. And as you feel that seemingly endless blackness engulfing you, it's when that sensation of being constricted starts to creep in. <br/><br/>I hadn't wanted to take anything away from the performances of the main (and only) actors so as not to dilute the film's overall integrity, but Clooney's predictable (some would even say annoying) smirks and Bullock's familiar panicking (her facial expressions are almost a carbon copy of her hysteria while driving a bus with a bomb on board in 'Speed') were uncomfortably close to ruining the experience of watching this brilliant movie. Still, I give them credit for acting that was mainly dependent on facial expressions since they were in their spacesuits with their helmets on perhaps 95% of the film. <br/><br/>The moviegoer can easily be taken for an emotional roller-coaster ride throughout it. Even heard a bit of applause during a scene towards the end of the film where Bullock's character seemed to have conquered impossible odds. I must admit I got goose bumps myself watching some of the powerful scenes. <br/><br/>This movie looked really original. I don't remember any film in recent times that captured such intensity and drama in space given only a few elements to work with. Admittedly, Apollo 13 can perhaps be the closest you can compare it to in terms of movies in space, but the filmmaking technology and special effects used in Gravity are, for me, quite pioneering. <br/><br/>It's been a quite a while since I last experienced watching a film as enthralling as Gravity. Go watch it. It's worth every bit of money you pay for it (even if you watch it in 3D)."

","I wanted to see this movie both for it's supposed realistic depiction of the physics of space and the interaction of lots of bodies in motion, but also because I have long enjoyed Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's movies. The special effects do not disappoint. The 3D augments without overwhelming, despite the enormous potential given the subject matter - kudos on that. The visual ride is exhilarating and pleasing. While the special effects are superb, the story is anything but. I found myself becoming deeply offended by the way Sandra Bullock played her role, showing excessive weakness for an accomplished woman in her position. It felt like a throw-back to some 1950s production. The effect was further heightened by Clooney's cloying Daddy-ness, also unbelievable for a professional astronaut, who might be expected to be confident and even macho, but to play such an over-the-top patriarchal figure exceeded my ability to suspend disbelief. And for Bullock's professional woman to simply fall into his protective dominion seemed far-fetched at best. Overall, I found the stale gender stereotypes a major turn-off that ruined the film for me. Even though the heroine finds her grit, it's not enough to erase all the weakness that comes before. As a lover of old Clint Eastwood etc, I am not unable to enjoy macho men or girly girls. But this one seemed such a throwback I emerged not just disappointed, but sincerely irritated."

","What a disaster movie (pun intended).

Instead, the story line is absolutely dumb, boring, unbelievable, and pointless. There really is NO story here, but rather a contrived and narrowly scoped situation that supports the producers desire to use high-end technologies to make pretty pictures.

","Preface: Watched first half on Netflix.<br/><br/>I chose not to see this movie in theatres for the same reasons that I did not like this film. I am on the fence as to whether or not it would have been a better experience in theaters or if the effects would have proved too confusing and disorientating.<br/><br/>Review : Myself and my partner tried to watch this over the weekend on Netflix. I have to say that I am *really* surprised this film reviewed so well. It is certainly one of the worst movies I have ever tried to watch, and the first from memory that I could not bring myself to finish.<br/><br/>These statements are made in part, because of science. I have a rudimentary understanding of orbital physics. Every single thing about this movie is wrong. Not only wrong, but completely absurd to the point of that it could likely never happen, even if we (the human race) spent great effort in both time and money to intentionally cause it to happen. The laws of Physics simply do not work that way.<br/><br/>I have since joked to friends that Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen is in fact a more Scientifically accurate film. Its funny. And mean. And also True. It's is more likely that an intelligent extra terrestrial race of robots exists somewhere in the universe and will come to Earth to subjugate the human race, than the vast majority of scenes in this movie are likely to happen in real life.<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS**<br/><br/>I was up in arms after the opening scene. Once George's character asked to be ""let go"" because he was ""dragging her down"" - I had had enough. At the 45 minute mark my girlfriend had also become so bored that she asked if we could watch something else. So we turned it off.<br/><br/>Very unimpressed. As mentioned before, I am not even sure if the visual effects could have save this if I had watched it in theatres."

","If 'Gravity' was the last movie I saw before I died, I would die happy. This is hands down, the best film of the year so far, and quite possibly the best film of the last several years. Alfonso Cuaron has come back with a vengeance after a seven year hiatus. Cauron directed 'Children of Men' and the third 'Harry Potter' film to name a couple. I know all of you have seen the trailer for this film, and let me just say, you're in the for the most thrilling ride of your life.<br/><br/>Not since Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' has space been so beautifully photographed. 'Gravity' is not - I repeat, NOT a science fiction film. It's a survival story of man (George Clooney) and a woman (Sandra Bullock) trying to get back to Earth by any means necessary after a catastrophic accident happens just above Earth as they are fixing a new satellite. There are no aliens, futuristic space crafts, or fancy weapons. Just the regular NASA gear. This short highly intense 90 minute film will leave you on the edge of your seat, your mouth open, your eyes watery, and your mind blown with questions like ""How did they do that?""<br/><br/>George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut named Matt Kowalksy who likes Hank Williams Jr. and telling wild stories to his past to Houston down below. He is the pilot of the rocket ship while scientist Ryan Stone (Bullock) is fixing a problem on the satellite. However, the Russians launched a missile at one of their own failing satellites, which has caused the debris to collide with other satellites and space stations that has caused a giant spread of debris traveling around Earth faster than a bullet, and it's headed right for Kowalsky and Stone.<br/><br/>Of course, the worst happens, and now the surviving two members of this mission are without a shuttle back to Earth and must get back to Earth somehow before their oxygen in their suits runs out. Through drifting through space without hooked on to anything, to colliding with other space stations, things are highly terrifying for the pair of astronauts.<br/><br/>The film centers mostly on Bullock as she has only had six months of astronaut training and has to figure out how to navigate ships, put out fires in space, and come to terms that she might not make it back home. There are a few very emotional moments with her, where we completely feel how scared she is. And Cuaron's camera never misses anything, let alone has more than 12 edits in the entire movie. Hell, the first 30 minutes of the film are all one continuous shot, and it will truly take your breath away.<br/><br/>Clooney is very charming in this role as he is in every role and does a flawless job, but Bullock really shines here as she shows every emotion we would all go through in a horrible situation like this one. I have no doubt that she will be nominated for an Oscar for this role, and if she wins, well she deserves it.<br/><br/>The effects are some of the best effects I've ever seen on screen. I honestly can't tell if they actually shot the film in space above Earth with real space crafts, or if there was any use of special effects. It's that good. Of course there are special effects, but you will never be able to tell. Every shot of the film, could be paused and framed, and put up in an art gallery. It's that beautiful.<br/><br/>And if you see this movie, which I highly suggest you do, see it in IMAX 3D. Yes, I said 3D. I am not a fan at all of 3D, but 'Gravity' has the best 3D effects and picture I have ever seen in a film thus far. If every film that said it was 3D, was this good, I would be a fan of 3D. Steven Price composed this monumental score for 'Gravity' that will truly terrify you and make your hairs stand on end. It's the perfect and unrelenting score for a film like this.<br/><br/>If you see one movie for the rest of the year, make it 'Gravity'. It's the perfect film."
"matthew_lohr","1","3","6","24 June 2015"," Can barely even call it a ""movie""
","If I had a list of the worst movies I've ever seen, I don't even know if Gravity would be on it, because I don't know if I can call it a movie. Ignoring the particulars though, this is easily the worst film I have ever seen and I highly encourage others to not see it. Basically this is what it seemed like happened in the process of creating this film: Alfonso Cuaron got a bunch of college age interns and said ""Hey animate me a bunch of stuff floating in space."" So they animated him 2 hours worth of stuff floating in a space and also a girl hitting the stuff, and submitted it. Cuaron said ""This is great, let's make it a movie."" This is probably the point where script and screenplay writers approached him and said ""Ok, we'll make the screenplay"" and he said ""No. No screenplay. Just release it as it is."" I have a hard time believing people didn't question him and ask whether or not he wanted a story in his movie. Because basically Gravity has no story. You could argue and say ""The story is she's trying to make it home!"" But I mean that's literally it! In any other good movie you'll have tons of conflicts between the more than 2 characters, sub plots, or at least a main plot that is slightly more in depth than ""She's trying to make it home."" There is nothing to this movie. It is 2 hours of stuff floating in space, and that's all. It also completely lacks any character development whatsoever, which you think wouldn't be so hard to do when you only have 2 characters. I never felt attached or sympathetic for either of the characters, I just simply didn't care about what was going on. This movie is incredibly boring. It's Sandra Bullock at a station. Then she goes to another one. Then another one. And another one. Then she crashes on Earth. Stands up, and credits roll. It almost seems to me like this movie was a joke, a mock to all other movies. And don't even get me started on George Clooney's death. I mean you've got 2 characters, if you're gonna make one of them die, can't you actually make it in a way that's physically possible? If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about, Clooney's death makes no sense. Why didn't Sandra Bullock just pull on the cord that was connecting them, give it a little tug, and he would drift back to her. it makes no physical sense why he continued drifting away from her after the cord became taut. You can't tell me there wasn't a single person on the entire set that said ""Wait, this is impossible..."" For goodness sakes it's not even that hard of a thing to change, just make some debris come hit him in the face, or make the cord get detached somehow and he drifts away all alone. It's like Cuaron tried to make it impossible, and it's just laughable. Everything in the movie is laughable. The story is non existent, the character development is non existent, the physics don't even make sense, and the whole experience is just a joke.<br/><br/>And it won 7 Oscars!!"
"Lachlan-smith","3","3","6","17 April 2015"," Worth 3 stars, not 8
","I'd like to start out by saying that I am usually pretty good at tuning out plot holes, inconsistencies or inaccuracies while watching a movie, in order to enjoy the plot. I don't watch a mystery thinking about whodunnit, or a horror anticipating the scares. I find this way i don't spoil it for myself. As for gravity, this is impossible if you have even a shred of common sense and a high school understanding of physics. <br/><br/>The 3 stars it got were for its visuals, which were stunning. Probably landmark, though zero gravity is an easy way to make something look cool to be honest. Thats it for the positives.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives: it starts out with this patronisingly basic explanation about how space works, even though it proceeds to get the very basics of that wrong for the rest of the movie. As I said before, inaccuracies are fine if its just something that will sit on the goof page, but otherwise go unnoticed, but when you've got George Clooney - an accomplished actor playing an experienced, confident and intelligent astronaut, in a scene that is beautiful with fairly good music - telling you how he's a lost cause and is completely doomed, but everyone who's not asleep or an idiot is screaming in their head ""Huh? NO YOU Aren't??? GEORGE BABY YOU DON'T NEED TO DIE!!!"" It spoils it all. Its as simple as that. Plot hole after plot hole, and the already weak and clich√© ridden storyline is shaped around complete inaccuracies and and impossibilities. Everything that isn't impossible is so unlikely it may as well be. It's simply amazing how many obvious details they got wrong.<br/><br/>So the plot is a joke, Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for her performance but to be honest it wasn't special at all (then again I've never liked a single performance from Bullock, so take it as you will), so thats a joke. Clooney portrayed a shallow and boring character as well as he could.<br/><br/>If I was making a movie, I'd hire the cinematographer, artistic director and CGI team. One star for each. I was considering adding a star for its mercifully short runtime, but then I decided it wasn't quite short enough it deserve it."

"masandaglinus123","2","3","6","29 March 2015"," Gravity relies more on its visuals than its plot
","I'm really glad that this film won 7 Oscars. I really do. I think Alfonso Cuaron really deserves his award for Best Director. As well as the visual effects team who make this film more impressive. The cinematography, the terrifying silence of the outer space, musical score and the editing were outstanding and it adds more beauty to this film. The outer space looks so realistic and impressive that I was completely amaze seeing what it's like to be in there. There's no doubt that sci-fi fans will love this flick. But for those people who just want to see and experience a sci-fi thriller roller coaster ride just like me, they'll be disappointed. Sure, the visuals were a top notch, but what about the plot? The movie itself relies more on its visuals than giving away some storyline. There are some few suspense and thrills, but that's it? The film's premise is not really that intriguing. Who would want to see a film that the main character spends the entire movie floating on the space and keep bumping into stuff, muttering, and desperately trying to gasp for air? It sounds boring.<br/><br/>The script was poorly written. Too much terrible dialogue and awkward situations that got me scratching my head. I don't care if this film was praised by critics. I don't care if this film got 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. I don't care if this film got a metascore of 96. I don't care. This movie is so boring that I spend every second glancing at the clock, waiting to end this film. I nearly died of boredom. The visual effects can't help for me to make this film better to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, Gravity is more appropriate movie to watch if you're into sci- fi genre. But let me tell you something, there's nothing wrong if you want to watch this film, but it could be boring at times. So be prepared. I give this sci-fi film a score of 2.5 for the visuals, cinematography, etc."
"RossRivero99","10","3","6","6 October 2014"," One of last year's greatest films
","While I was watching Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, it reminded me of another movie which was Ron Howard's Apollo 13 (1995) because both movies had to do with astronauts in space (in which Apollo 13 was based on true events.)The movie stars Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone a medical engineer who teams up with an astronaut named Matt Kowalski (played by George Clooney) to survive a catastrophic event which was their shuttle getting destroyed while drifting in space. It is very strange that Bullock and Clooney are the only two cast members in this movie as well as the voice of Ed Harris as the mission control director back in Houston, one thing that this movie tries to teach us is that being stranded in space is much worse than it seems. Clooney and Bullock are nothing short of brilliant and I really do think that Sandra Bullock should have taken home an Oscar for her career defining work as well as giving her best performance since her Oscar winning turn in The Blind Side (2009).Cuaron's directorship for this movie is just perfect, and the score by Steven Price is what makes this movie even more suspenseful, but while we are watching this movie we don't even know if Clooney's or Bullock's character dies within the course of the movie."

I kept waiting for the movie to begin, for something to happen, to be shown anything about these characters that actually made me care. I was still waiting as the credits started to roll.<br/><br/>The dialog was predictable, the imagery prosaic and clich√©, and the conclusion inevitable.

","I must say that this movie deserved all the Oscars it won, also for its awesome CG (consider that almost everything you see is CG, except parts of the suits and the soyuz/shenzou interiors, as i learned from the blu ray extras.).<br/><br/>I can't understand why most of the people I've met with says this is horrible/stupid. So I start consider their arguments and tell why they're invalid.<br/><br/>first thing i've seen written, since the trailer came out, was the fact that Bullock's deep breath is annoing and stupid. Sincerely, I want to see these people in the same situation; Bullock has a panic attack.<br/><br/>Next, I see people argumenting with phisics from 1st high school. Now, myself I go to a school where I haven't studied phisics yet being at 2nd high school, but I hardly believe they teach you zero-g phisics in first years of high school, whetever you're not going to a special areonautic-orientated type, but this is not important; More importantly I don't get what ""wrong phisics"" are these people talking about, and I think that goes too nerdily away from the point of this movie: Don't surrender ever.<br/><br/>Next problem they have, is the plot. What's the problem? Seriously! Try yourself to create a better plot having this much of technology in space (As we have in space an ISS, Chinese stations, Had space shuttles and tons of satellites) and tell me something that truly is stupid. Some people say the effects like the one at the beginning of the movie when the shuttle comes in picture may look fake. This people haven't seen any actual footage from NASA's several programmes, that's exactly how you see a starship orbiting. and they haven't understand that everything is cgi except the actor's faces, the helmets (without visor) and the upper part of the suits!!! Then They have thousands of problems with bullock. First, that she hasn't really good practice being an astronaut. These people haven't actually been paying attention at the movie: It is said that Ryan Stone is a hospital doctor sent in space to install a prototype system developed by medical scientists and that she's at her first ship. Second, that we see her only for most of the movie. And...? Even better, it took out the ridiculous series of deaths you get in many movies.<br/><br/>Soo... resuming: hate how people begin to use stupid arguments to hate a movie. I think this started when a few people started to spread the words that this movie sucks, and many people started to believe them or just follow the mass, just as the reason why they tell me that star wars looks fake without having seen it."

I thought Bullock's character was annoying and generic and George Clooney, while being likable, was playing George Clooney. I think it's a good film, but not 'film of the year' and far from the 'best space movie ever'. It's a feast for the eyes but nothing more. The physics were wrong in some parts of the movie, which annoyed me greatly, and Bullock is simply frustrating to watch and listen to. the movie quickly turns into her story and i fell asleep, her story was not that interesting and i did not care whether or not she died."

As stated, some of the special effects were amazing but others were downright insulting to the intelligence of those who aren't mesmerized by actor's over-rated reputations.

"mark-4522","2","3","6","26 August 2014"," Overrated and an embarrassment
","Let's start with why it's overrated. The plot is boring. Yes, boring. A space action movie that's boring with is an accomplishment, kind of. This is happening a lot with Hollywood where writers are paid a thousand bucks to write a script and a billion dollars on special effects. Compare and contrast to the tense and gripping scifi film ""Moon"". Or ""Dark Star"". But if those aren't mainstream enough, consider Planet of the Apes (original) made on a shoestring budget. You can make a great scifi film without a lot of money.<br/><br/>Next, the acting. Big stars in big, empty roles. Their pedigrees actually made me ask why the film is so boring. Like the astronauts, they gasped for air to be interesting in stereotypical roles and failed. Consider great scifi movies with nameless talent at the time: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and a villain you never even get to see his face and robots. <br/><br/>Next, the embarrassment part: The India mars mission cost less than the film, something they are proud of. The USA space program had a greater day and now Hollywood spends similar money to make sub-par films that used to put men on the moon. Shameful. Disgusting. <br/><br/>Finally, I suppose the biggest problem with the film is that the space station itself is boring much like a bus station in space. Aging Soviet rockets take astronauts and cosmonauts to 70's era style cans to monitor experiments and then back down to Earth. Nothing groundbreaking. When was the last time you watched space station footage with excitement? Since the real thing is boring, how to make an improbable real life scenario interesting? Lifeforce (space sex vampires on the space shuttle) was more fun (for the love of God, I'm glad Sandra Bullock wasn't cast in that leading role!) <br/><br/>Hmm, perhaps something more fun would be a MURDER in space. Perhaps someone dies on the station while everyone is asleep and they try to solve the mystery on the ground. That crazy diaper wearing astronaut could be the inspiration. Hmmm.... I should write that up and register it as a screenplay..."

","I will be the first to say that ""Gravity"" was one of the most wonderful films in regards to cinematography and audio. I say audio because it is not so much the musical score which is brilliant, but even more so the simplicity and silence which is rendered throughout the movie. The emotional disconnect which is stirred when watching a lonesome person glide through space in the absence of sound is breathtaking. However, the plot? What plot? Unfortunately there is virtually no storyline. I won't place any spoilers in my review, but there is nothing mentally stimulating in this film other than a unusual and (I will admit) horrifying experience."
"Ross-k-carver","3","3","6","7 May 2014"," Focus On A Message, Not Visuals.
","All of the hype about this movie was a problem for me because when I saw Gravity, I ended up being extremely disappointed. even its rating on IMDb was (and is still) high and I was truly expecting it to be good, but alas, it was not. Because of this fact you might want to prepare for some angry rants because of how much it annoyed me. With this out of the way, lets get to some facts about the movie.<br/><br/>The film I am reviewing is Gravity, directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n in 2013 for approximately $100,000,000 (holy crap). It was written by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Jon√°s Cuar√≥n, and George Cloony. It was nominated for 113 awards and won 74 of them (impressive), including the Oscars for Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Directing, and Best Achievement in Film Editing. For my viewing of this film, it was my first time and I watched it with my parents. I chose this film because It annoyed me and I've wanted to rant about it ever since I watched it, I figured this was a good way to do it. This films impact on me, where to start; oh yeah, it did nothing for me. All it really shows is how people don't go to the movies anymore for a good story and interesting, relatable characters, but just for a pretty moving picture (another PERFECT example is Avatar). In my opinion, this movie was not a good role for Sandra Bullock. Well, not from a viewers perspective, it was probably amazing for her, but her acting style is not dramatic enough for this film. She can't display the proper emotions for what she was required to do, even George Cloony would have been better for the role than her. To be fair, the only movie I've liked with Bullock is The Blind Side, but I have yet to see Crash, so I can't be sure if that fact will remain true. To continue with the fact that this film had no emotional impact on me, it bugs me how I felt like before I saw it a lot of people told me how realistic it was. Yes, it is a complete visual piece (Like Avatar), it looks absolutely amazing and if it weren't so bad, I would love to see it on an Imax screen. The only problem is that I thought people meant all of the physics in it would be realistic, but again, the hype has failed, miserably. As a prerequisite to my next statement, I am in physics, with that out of the way what the heck Alfonso? I have a direct quote from Alfonso Cuar√≥n saying: ""We were trying to honor reality and scientific accuracy as much as we could"". The only example I need to give is one of the biggest moments in the movie: When Bullock has to hang on the the space station while Cloony is dangling off, if that were realistic, as soon as the tether was fully taut he would immediately slingshot back at Bullock, boom, he saves her, movies over, roll credits. All the inaccuracy before annoyed me but that was the killer. Now to stop bashing and give this poor film some love. The technical aspects of this film, the processes, were absolutely stunning, that fact is undeniable. That is why it won pretty much all the technical awards out there, and with how much CGI and animation, it could've been in the animated category and won some more. The cinematics, the visuals, the effects, everything was spot on for what it was. I can't say anything bad at all about any of the technical aspects of this film. Overall, I did not like this film for anything other than what it was, a showpiece. The physics were inaccurate, the acting wasn't what it should have been and it was way over-hyped (I can't blame Alfonso for that one). It may have been stunning, but if I wanted stunning visuals of our Solar System, I would watch the show Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey. When I watch a movie, I watch it because people said was good, or because I've been looking forward to it. This film taught me a lesson though: Opinions can be (very) wrong. In all seriousness though this type of showpiece film is the reason Hollywood has gone down the toilet (for the most part)."

It was nice to hear Ed Harris reprising his role as Huston control. Time flew watching this, that should tell you something.

One of them being the orbit of the hubble telescoop, which, in real life, is 255Km or 158.4 miles higher then the ISS, yet in the movie then seem to have the same orbit. These and others are well documented on other sites so I won't go into that any further.<br/><br/>I love 3D but it didn't add much to this film and could have easily been watched without it. On the positive side the CGI was good.<br/><br/>In the end we were left with that familiar feeling, that this is time of our lives that we will never get back"
"Joe_Crisan","3","3","6","28 March 2014"," Science Project
","This film was more like a science project than a story on the screen; the characters were so flat that when things happen to them, despite the overly dramatic music, the viewer could really care less. And when when the ending finally arrives, I can't imagine why anyone would cheer. It was just so ""blah"".<br/><br/>First, the film opens with some superficial dialogue aimed at building character for both Clooney and Bullock. As the story progresses, the ""blah"" dialog continues, and really adds nothing to the story or the characters because it's so forced. Later in the movie, the director makes an attempt at bringing the initial dialog full circle to create a bond between the characters, but it again, feels so forced that it makes you want to simply hit that fast-forward button to get to the predictable ending."
"Sankari_Suomi","8","3","6","27 March 2014"," Unashamedly heterophobic
","I expected to join this movie more than I did. And to some extent that was actually true: I did enjoy it more than I did. But in other ways I felt it could have been so much more, and if it had been, I would have enjoyed it as much as I'd expected to.<br/><br/>The plot itself is very thin: we start with a disaster which segues into another disaster, which segues into another disaster... etc... until finally we run out of disasters and all of a sudden everything's OK. Which is a bit of a letdown to be honest.<br/><br/>Nevertheless this was an excellent science fiction film, with the most realistic depiction of gravity-free space in the history of cinema. The interior of the Soyuz capsule was painstakingly accurate, perfectly reproduced right down to the last switch and button.<br/><br/>But it's easy to get lost in the visuals and forget that they merely constitute a vehicle for the message.<br/><br/>Gravity is replete with potent symbolism. I was impressed by its complex exploration of social identity, consciousness, environmental issues, economics, and human sexuality.<br/><br/>The last of these was the most obvious; phallic imagery everywhere, except in the scenes with George Clooney (who stars in a role better suited to Ben Affleck). That was a massive clue, and once I picked it up I could see exactly what the director was saying.<br/><br/>There are constant references to 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is more than just a homage; it's a complete remake of Kubrick's epic film. The mystical 'star birth' sequence is replicated with elegant sensitivity.<br/><br/>As the men die off one by one (*cough*misandry*cough*) Bullock's character questions herself constantly. She has no idea what she's doing there, any more than we do. Her monologue is halting and reluctant, as if she's reciting lines she has rehearsed beforehand.<br/><br/>Is she really a mother? Does she know what being a mother is? She seems to believe she has a daughter, yet we never see the daughter. What does the daughter represent? The obvious answer is 'lesbianism' (remember, all the men are dead! big hint!) but perhaps that's too obvious? As in real life, the tension of this existential dilemma is never quite resolved.<br/><br/>Many critics have identified 'Gravity' as unashamedly heterophobic, and I can't deny that. As a heterosexual man I did find it very challenging. Yet I still felt it spoke to me as a film-goer, but more importantly as a human person. It was an enriching experience.<br/><br/>I rate 'Gravity' at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 8/10 on IMDb."
"spencman","5","3","6","17 March 2014"," Space-Drama without Realism
","5 stars because i have seen far worse movies than this one and it somehow entertained me. The best idea i have heard so far is that all that happens after the Spaceshuttle is hit by debris the first time is just the hallucination of Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). Well this is not what the author intended, but it makes the movie by far better. Gravity starts of very good with realistic Space scenes and wonderful pictures, but when the crew and Spacecraft are hit by debris every realism goes away. It gets so weird i had to say to myself: ""forget realism, enjoy the pictures!"", but it didn't work out all the time. There are simply too many scenes where a SciFi-Fan (Which i consider myself) simply has more than enough knowledge about space, vacuum and the laws of physics to make the head shake like a nodding-dog on a gravel road. Bullock does a decent job to sell you the story. I really wonder how some people compliment Gravity for ""Realism"". Still it is a good popcorn movie and for those people who don't care about realism a really fantastic one. You think Armageddon or Space Cowboys was as realistic as Apolle 13? Great! this is your movie! If not, be warned! Gravity wants to, but doesn't obey the laws of physics."

","An artistic experience. I sat thru mesmerized from the opening text to the final shot. There is a reason film festivals, 2013 top ten lists, and most nay-sayers of modern effects went wild. GRAVITY is a hypnotic, magnificently realized vision of what our furthest reaches contain, astounding beauty with a dark, dangerous edge. I'd been following this specific project since it was announced in COMING SOON in mid-2012. I remember thinking, ""So...Clooney and Sandra Bullock float through space for 90 mins: Need to see."" The most surprising element for me was the performance of Sandra Bullock. I've seen her work mostly in comedy, and was thoroughly impressed by her performance. I wished she had won Best Actress, but since she undeservedly won for The Blind Side back in '10, they wouldn't give it to her now. The cinematography is fan-bloody-tastic; the effects are some of the most hypnotic and shockingly convincing I've seen in any science-fiction work; and the direction is flawless, showing a mastery of mise-en-scene and composition not seen since the days of Kubrick and Hitchcock. The 3D wasn't as mind-blowing as say AVATAR or Hugo, but it helps envelop viewers in the seriousness of the isolation among the stars. I went to see the flick late in its run with a dear friend who exclaimed, before the movie began, ""All right, impress me Spanish man!"" Afterwards, he said simply, ""He won."" If you haven't seen it yet, which is unlikely considering the blockbuster it was, Go See It. You won't be disappointed by it, at all. 4.9/5"
"SpencerRianBacon","10","3","6","5 March 2014"," One of the coolest films i've seen in theaters
","Now first I wanna address my favorite films of all time, because Gravity has gotten a ton of hate, and i wanna show you my favorites to add a little credibility to the review (hopefully) <br/><br/>10. Terminator 2: Judgement Day 9. Gravity 8. Pan's Labyrinth 7. The Dark Knight 6. Inception 5. District 9 4. Die Hard 3. Children of Men 2. Cool Hand Luke 1. Memento<br/><br/>First I want to touch on the technical aspects, Gravity is an achievement in how movies are made, it deserved the five technical awards it received at the Oscars last Sunday. Also it deserved its award for soundtrack too, but i'll get to that in a second, Gravity's special effects are so good and so well done, that I believed it was filmed in space. And the music, the music adds to the weight of the film, and it puts you in the front seat for an incredible thrill ride. Also the direction, Alfonso Curon directs the movie with such skill, the first shot in the movie that is thirteen minutes long is incredible, and in my opinion was what got the Oscar for cinematography and direction in the bag. Now story, this is what people seem to disagree on, some say its filled with clich√©'s and some say its good, I personally feel its good, because it pushes the film forward for what it really is focusing on, the metaphors, letting go, moving on, the themes drive the movie, not the story itself. That usually doesn't work, here however it does, because they choose themes that are relate-able, everyone has to let go in one point in their lives, and learn to move forward, to be reborn out of their despair. Which this movie is very much so saying. And I am fine with that, with such a good part to it, and in my opinion a great character to drive that metaphor i am fine with some of the things that don't add up, like I understand that the space stations wouldn't be that close together. Do I care? No, it is an enjoyable movie that deserves the awards its gotten, and one I visited twice in theaters, and will be watching many times at home.<br/><br/>Now with this being said, do you have to like the movie? Not at all, art is subjective, there's a lot of movies I don't like that much that some people really do, (for example, Casino Royale, I like the movie but not as much as most do, also Iron Man 3) do I understand it? Not really, but its what others like, I can't judge them for that, if they have a good reason for not liking something, or the opposite, than good for them. I just feel like when people attack others for liking or disliking something its a little much, and that's coming from an avid movie lover. <br/><br/>Hope you enjoyed my review, its one of my first on IMDb so be nice :)"

"bemyzeke","8","3","6","11 February 2014"," One of the best sci-fi movies of modern times.
","(Spoiler alert. read at your own risk)<br/><br/>OK, I liked the movie but was not really going to write a review until I started reading the bad reviews here criticizing the movie for being unreal. This movie is good for its great visuals, non-stop action, and a battle for survival of one person. This is a thriller set in space. No sci-fi is ever accurate, but in this case, some self-proclaimed space experts are criticizing the movie without merit. I will try to address some of the criticism below. <br/><br/>1. NASA would never send an astronaut with so much emotional baggage.<br/><br/>In reality, having a child die at the age of four does not automatically disqualify an astronaut. Psychological evaluation goes way much deeper than that. So, if all else appears normal, it is quite possible that someone with a tragic family history may make it into program. The emotions displayed by Sandra Bullock's character in space were under extreme hardship and loss of hope. It may not happen to a real astronaut but prospect of a certain, slow death, can break a very strong person.<br/><br/>2. Sandra's character did not decompress when Ryan opened the hatch.<br/><br/>She was hallucinating dude, that is why!<br/><br/>3. The debris stayed in orbit instead of falling to earth and burning out. <br/><br/>Although the movie depicts debris of epic proportions, but whatever debris there is, is likely to stay in the orbit at least for some time (depending on the velocity and distance from earth). The movie implies that all satellites are on the same orbit and therefore on a collision path. This is incorrect, but it is possible that when satellites are hit that they get knocked into a different orbit putting them on collision course with other satellites.<br/><br/>4. Chinese entry vehicle caught fire upon entry and yet did not burn out. <br/><br/>Entry vehicles can heat to several thousand degree and are designed to withstand the temperature.<br/><br/>5. Sandra's character was able to swim after returning from space.<br/><br/>Actually, swimming will come more naturally to someone returning from zero gravity, because it is a low gravity environment. However walking on earth just a few minutes after landing was unreal (and inconsequential to the story). <br/><br/>6. Eenie meanie Minnie mo. What? Really! <br/><br/>Shenzhou capsule is supposed to be a replica of Soyuz. Since Sandra's character had some knowledge of Soyuz controls, she was using her imagination to press the same buttons. Also, at this point, the character was taking chances without much hope. <br/><br/>This is not to say that this movie did not take artistic license and did not exaggerate, but it was a drama not a documentary. I have yet to see a sci-fi which is believable. Don't compare it with Apollo 13. That was true story, not a sci-fi.<br/><br/>On the whole, this is a very well executed thriller. It is not a very good drama though. Writers tried to add some ""emotional"" spice to the characters (perhaps in hope of an Oscar), but it did not work that well, perhaps because there was no time to build characters."

","I just watched the film. It's superb. Definitely 10/10. The story is touching, enlightening and inspiring the way it is. People may want to add or remove pieces, but I find it perfect the way it is told.<br/><br/>It is hard to write about it without revealing pieces that shouldn't be revealed. Really.<br/><br/>What touched me the most is how this story speaks in a brilliant way about our lives, our choices, our greatest fears, our attitude to life. It touches you very deeply, trust me on that. And does so both strongly and gently. The tension builds up then is released, builds up and then is released.<br/><br/>What I love about Gravity is that it speaks very clearly and yet metaphorically. It's not like somebody explaining you this or that, not like the narrator speaks in the background telling you what to think. It is like (a made up example follows) they beat somebody before your eyes and you know this is brutal, the situation speaks for itself loudly and clearly; there are no if's and no maybe's.<br/><br/>I don't like Hollywood movies in general, because almost all of them are repetitive and boring. It is very seldom I can stand a whole movie. That however fully does not apply to Gravity. It is great and will definitely evoke a response, unless you are enlightened or hard asleep :) :)"

"CJBx7","9","3","6","1 January 2014"," A compelling tale of survival
","GRAVITY is the story of Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), an inexperienced astronaut who is carrying out repairs to an orbiting space station module when debris from a satellite destroys her ship and kills most of her crew. With the help of Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) she is able to survive the blast, but there are more complications in store for her. The story that follows showcases her desperate attempts at survival despite enormous odds.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: The story is fairly simple on its surface ‚Äì a woman attempts to survive in outer space despite her inexperience, and the odds are against her. However, the writing by Alfonso and Jon√°s Cuar√≥n becomes more than a routine science fiction/action thriller; it delves into the depths of the main character and testifies to the will to survive, and to embrace life, despite the tragedies of the past (in this case, the accidental death of her young daughter). The story moves at a fairly brisk pace for the most part, although the sequence with her talking to the Inuit fisherman who intercepts her transmissions went on a little too long for my taste. You really do feel for her and wish for her to survive. SCORE: 9/10 <br/><br/>ACTING: Sandra Bullock really stands out in this movie. She is never anything less than convincing, and she really displays much of her range as an actress. Bullock is required to carry most of the film by herself and does so quite admirably, displaying her character's horror, sadness, rage, and determination to live despite the odds. She holds your attention from beginning to end. George Clooney plays his part effectively, although it seems that he can play the cocksure veteran astronaut in his sleep; I found his portrayal a bit smarmy at times, but overall he does a nice job. Clooney and Bullock have a good rapport. Bullock and Clooney basically provide 95% of the acting in the movie; the others are basically voices that provide occasional transmissions. SCORE: 9/10<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY/PRODUCTION: The production of this movie is absolutely exceptional. I had never heard of Cuar√≥n before, but this movie makes me want to check out more of his work. The cinematography was flawless and involving, the camera constantly moving and enabling us to not only see, but also experience Dr Stone's plight on a visceral level. The special effects (provided by CGI) are quite impressive, showing us a detailed view of the space stations and escape modules, and providing beautiful views of the Earth from many different angles. Cuar√≥n also displays an effective command of sonic dynamics, especially in the opening scene where the sound gradually fades in as the characters, who are floating above the Earth, come into view. SCORE: 10/10 <br/><br/>SUMMARY:GRAVITY is a tremendously involving experience. Its story depicts the human will to survive very effectively, and is anchored by a commanding performance by Sandra Bullock. The movie is expertly directed and the cinematography is astounding. It is completely absorbing from start to finish. SCORE: 9/10."
"miketunney777","7","3","6","30 November 2013"," Purely compelling.
","It's not to often that a movie can artfully utilize silence and nothingness (another polarizing example is Paranormal Activity 1); such applies to Gravity, a gripping thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.<br/><br/>the story is short and simple yet quite powerful. I won't spoil the movie (for my lack of knowledge of the plot raised my expectations), but it was a wise decision making the movie under 100 minutes leaving no room for unnecessary filler or fat.<br/><br/>From a standpoint of my eyes, the movie is a feast to look out, using gorgeous scenery and eye-popping visuals that gives the impression they shot this movie in space. The handful of scientific accuracies doesn't hurt either.<br/><br/>The acting is well done and realistically portrayed. Using real reactions in tense situations and some clever dialogue that slightly reveals the main characters, you stoop to their level when they are in turmoil, almost like your'e suffering or prevailing with them.<br/><br/>You will be very pleased, and very surprised, at what you see after the leave the theater after watching this incredible film. An obvious Oscar nominee/winner in the future and perhaps a film that filmmakers will study for years to come."

"toll-8","10","3","6","27 November 2013"," One of the films of the year. This is the platform for future space films.
","Contains mild peril is the brief accompanying the release of Gravity, however the problem with this vague statement is that it doesn't tell you if that is aimed towards the characters of the film or the audience members. It also doesn't help that to me being cast adrift in space, with nothing to grab a hold of, doesn't sound like mild peril it sounds mega peril to me! For ninety one minutes Gravity does not hold up. Even the calmer moments are filled with peril because let's face it would any of you want to work on the side of a space craft in the depths of space? This film has it all; tension, action, stunning visuals, strong performances, catharsis, cheese, and tears. It is only ninety minutes but boy does it cover some ground. Or space ground. Or no ground.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is Doctor Ryan Stone (that's right apparently her parents were hoping for a boy, a sure fire sign she has parent issues), a first time space traveller brought onto the last mission of Matt Kowalski, a veteran astronaut who is determined to break the record of the most hours accumulated space walking. Stone is fragile, struggling to cope with her new environment whilst Kowalski sees it all as a zero gravity playing field, that is however until debris from a broken down satellite sparks a chain reaction in Earth's orbit and sends shrapnel heading straight for them. On destruction of their ship the two astronauts are left to float with one objective in mind; making it back home.<br/><br/>What instantly sets Gravity apart from the rest is the stunning visual element that Cuar√≥n has used in telling this story. Not only does it look breathtaking on the big screen it also does justice to the use of 3D. Most films use it as a gimmick or a cash grab but with Gravity it feels entirely necessary. Cuar√≥n wants you cast adrift as much as the characters are and by creating greater depth he has achieved just that. In 2D it is bound to still look stunning but in comparison it may look flat. The sound is also critical to the development of the film. The non-digetic sound is loud, building to a climax that leaves you in silence. It pounds along hinting towards the sense of danger and adds to the tension soon to come. The digetic sound on the other hand is quiet, dull, and non-existent. Other then hearing the characters through their radios the atmospheric sound is as if you were in space with them. Drills are muffled. The destruction of space stations is made with a whimper. What Cuar√≥n has done is given the audience the feel that they are right there alongside them and all by providing sound possibly recorded through a wooden door. Mild peril is as much for the audience as it is those characters.<br/><br/>The acting must also be applauded, especially from the inconsistent Bullock. At times her choice of movie has baffled many but here she proves why she is A-list. Having little to work with in terms of stage surroundings, she conveys the traits and internal conflicts of Stone as if she were real. What is incredible is that the character is fairly generic and has little in terms of back story but little is all Bullock needs to work with as she convinces that Stone has a past and is determined to reach the future for the sake of all she has been through. We are right there with her and if you don't will her to survive then Cuar√≥n has failed to immerse you, which I find highly doubtful. Clooney is also the arrogant contrast to Stone and is the cool, calm charmer that we expect from him. His character is less developed but he is there to shift the attention to Bullock, who is left to drive home the themes of human nature and how having little going for your life doesn't stop you fighting for survival.<br/><br/>Every elements of the film is of the highest standard. The weakest element is possibly the script, with the ham-fisted dialogue, but Cuar√≥n and son get away with this due to the awe inspiring visuals. That is not to say the visuals should make a story better but when an entire space station is ripped apart to the sound of echoing silence within the frame, with a solitary female astronaut floating in the middle of it all attempting to avoid certain death, then I think one or two corny one liners can certainly be forgiven.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this yet then don't wait for the DVD, get yourself out there and see it on the big screen to experience it in all its glory. All the elements make up for a fascinating original movie which the film world is seeing less and less of each year. You want to sit on the edge of your seat for ninety minutes being dragged through space than this is the film for you. It is the closest experience to a fairground ride I have had in the cinema. Do not miss it. It is one of the movies of the year.<br/><br/>Rating: 5 / 5<br/><br/>Directing: Cuar√≥n's camera decisions have you floating right there with the characters. <br/><br/>Acting: Bullock gives the performance of her life. Clooney oozes charm.<br/><br/>Script: The weakest element of the entire production but isn't deterring in the slightest.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Stunning, absolutely stunning. The use of light is a contrast to their situation.<br/><br/>Score: Loud but silent. You just won't understand till you hear it through big blaring speakers.<br/><br/>Editing: This was edited? Wasn't it all done in one shot? The first 13 minutes certainly were. <br/><br/>Overall: One of the films of the year. This is the platform for future space films."
"stephen-hare1","9","3","6","26 November 2013"," A marvel of cinema
","Now, I'm not one to be enticed by a big ""Hollywood"" film. Just because you throw a couple of big names around and add some expensive effects doesn't mean you make a great film. And too many film makers seem allured to this cheap, flashy trickery. Just take Oblivion as an example - Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, apocalyptic wasteland, got to be good, right? I'm afraid not, with a story so obvious I guessed the twist in 20 minutes. So Gravity must be the same, right? Clooney and Bullock as astronauts trapped in space after an accident, combined with huge special effects; I was expecting an okay film at best. Well I don't have any good metaphors but ""eating my words at a buffet of my own doubts"" might sum it up.<br/><br/>Gravity was incredible; I can't put it any better! The effects were mind boggling. It was a genuine pleasure to see a film push the boundaries of what 3D can do. Avatar really started the 3D revolution of the last few years, and since then it's often been used just so Disney can impress a couple of ten year olds. But this took everything I knew about 3D and chucked it out the window with the words ""every 3D film you watch will be compared to this!""<br/><br/>The cinematography was genius, on an Einstein kind-of level. Watching Gravity wasn't like watching a film, more like watching 90 minutes through a window of Bullocks nightmare (an exciting nightmare at that). And even though the POV switched from spaceship to Bullock and back again through the film you barely noticed the cuts; it really was that seamless. This just helped to immerse you and by the end I felt like I had been to space. <br/><br/>When it comes to acting I have no doubt the words Oscar will be thrown around with this film in the next few months. Just for the record I'm not referring to Clooney. He was good, don't get me wrong, but you could have just called him Danny Ocean and no one would have noticed. But Sandra Bullock was the real treasure here; pushing everything actors/actresses should aspire too. The truly talented actor makes you believe in their situation; believe their hope or fear is real and she did this more than any actress I have ever watched.<br/><br/>The skeptics of this film are going to trash the scientific inaccuracies and I am with them to an extent. The spaceship orbits were wrong and the spacesuits were changed, to name a couple. But these aren't noticeable in any way during the film (unless you're an astronaut). Even Alfonso Cuar√≥n, the director, said he did this so the plot held together. Anyway this is a Sci-Fi/thriller, not a documentary, so the man was just doing his job. <br/><br/>In all Gravity was a triumph in cinematography, special effects and acting. But let's not forget ultimately a film should thrill you to the core, which Gravity did perfectly."
"duaghnoelie","10","3","6","26 November 2013"," Gravity falling
","Lets start with the good points. Gravity is the greatest piece of visual cinema ever. I is made to be watched in 3D in the cinema. This is what 3D should be like every time. It really felt like I was in space. Sandra Bulloch was fantastic in this , considering that she probably was on her own for most of the movie she does a great job. George Clooney was Geaorge Clooney, his lines was funny but not realistic and his scene at the start was a bit farcical but I suppose it set the scene. The plot was more Star wars than National Geographic. That Sandra was able to go from station to station s dare I say relatively easy was silly but I suppose its hard to create a decent story in orbit so I Ll forgive them. This is great cinema, it reminds me of 2001 , even with the flaws its the greatest cinema experience ever."
"zactac","10","3","6","25 November 2013"," One of the Best Movies of the Year!
","In a society where the success of media is determined by how much money is gotten from the overuse of 3D, it can be very refreshing to find a movie that has 3D but does not let it take over. This is probably one of the greatest strengths of ""Gravity."" <br/><br/>""Gravity"" takes place in (you guessed it) space and it surrounds the experiences of two astronauts (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney). When disaster strikes they find themselves stranded in the middle of space and must find a way back to Earth.<br/><br/>Sounds like a simple idea, but that is the genius of it. There is nothing complicated about the story, doesn't try adding some deep message about politics, society, or anything like that. No, the message is skillfully present in the movie without feeling forced because the filmmakers let the story play out. I am sure there was a great temptation to make the moral of the story as obvious as the sun in the middle of the day but they didn't. That alone is worthy of praise.<br/><br/>Another thing worthy of praise must go straight to Alfonso Cuaron. He is without a doubt one of the best directors of our time. He masterfully created a film with spellbinding beauty mixed with awe-inspiring terror. All the while he didn't lose focus of what this story is really about, the will of the human spirit.<br/><br/>Yet much of the credit must go to the leading actors: George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. Both did fantastic jobs but it is Bullock who should get most of the praise. This was definitely her best performance to date. She portrayed the vulnerability, strength, and pure terror of a woman trapped in a situation where hope is gone. Such a role demands an actress in the highest of standards and Bullock proved she was deserving of the role. At this point she is a deadlock for the nomination for best leading actress and I will not be surprised if she wins. She was absolutely phenomenal.<br/><br/>Yet there is one aspect that this film is almost guaranteed to win at the Oscars: special effects. Watching this movie made me feel like I was truly in space and experiencing every feeling these characters were feeling. Rarely have I ever been absolutely star struck by just the visuals of a film. The last time I felt this immersed in a film was when ""Avatar"" came out but I didn't see that in 3D. I am one who views 3D as nothing but a gimmick. However, when I saw ""Gravity"" in 3D I knew there was still hope for it. This was one of those rare times where 3D added to the experience of seeing a movie and not detract from it. Absolutely gorgeous movie on every scale.<br/><br/>So in the end, ""Gravity"" takes a simple idea and shows how sometimes the simplest idea is the better way to go. This was all thanks to masterful direction, fantastic acting, beautiful visuals, and wonderful writing. A great testament to the will of the human spirit; I will not be surprised if it wins Best Picture."
"Lejink","4","3","6","24 November 2013"," Saving Scientist Ryan
","One of the biggest-grossing films of the year and one of RYM's highest-ranking movies (number 60 all-time, as I write) and it's only just come out. No shortage of expectation on my part then as I donned the 3D glasses and sat in for show-time.<br/><br/>Well, I was disappointed. I can see it's a technical wonder with its depiction of life in space, both inside and outside a space- station, but frankly the lack of drama, never mind action very much bored me in my seat. It's very hard to convey character garbed in a space-suit, whirling around the cosmos, you can barely see the actors faces for the first hour or so. I found nothing greatly original in the very thin story-line either and some of the quirky character traits either overly sentimental (Bullock's loss of her young daughter) or just plain irritating (Clooney's country and western music predilection).<br/><br/>I appreciate the difficulty of one solitary character carrying a film, but ""The Spirit Of St Louis"" and ""The Old Man And The Sea"" in their depictions of human-kind's battles against earlier frontiers managed it and while I liked that it was a woman rather than a man who carried the film, Sandra Bullock is no James Stewart or Spencer Tracy. I'm no expert in these things, but her ability to successfully navigate her weightless way around the spacecrafts of two foreign countries and just by picking up conveniently situated manuals, actually fly the things and engineer her escape to miraculously land on water, yards from shore, all beggared belief.<br/><br/>Watching this film was like sitting in a theme-park simulator, okay for 10 but certainly not for 90 whole minutes."

"tomb_92","10","3","6","13 November 2013"," One of the most beautiful experiences of any art form. Unlike anything I have ever seen
","I wasn't sure really what to expect from Gravity. I did have high expectations and it's clear from Alfonso Cuaron's last film Children of Men that he is an exciting director and makes interesting films. Gravity is way beyond that. It is unlike anything I have ever seen. At heart it is a film about an individual's endurance and shear will to survive, nothing we haven't seen before, but it's the almost perfect execution that makes this film a masterpiece. First of all, this is a visual film. Every visual element comes together like cogs so that the finished product looks (and feels) extraordinary. The way the camera moves (pace, directionality, the way the focus shifts), the way the film is lit, the set pieces, all add up to what is visually speaking the film equivalent of an opera. And I never thought I'd say this but the 3D makes up one of those cogs, sometimes not quite moving in quite close harmony with the others, but very rarely was that the case. 3D for me has rarely been immersive, and never would I have described an entire 3D film as being that, until now. Rarely does a shot look noticeably out of focus, such is the norm with 3D. The vast, vast majority only adds to the beauty and wonder of the overall visual experience. Cuaron gets 3D, the slow-moving shots allow for an adjustment of focus that is seamless. In fact I'd go as far as to say that to see the film in 2D would be to miss a large part of what makes the film so stunning. Secondly, while I'll admit that the plot itself and dialogue are perhaps clunky at best, I didn't care. The lack of any sort of plot isn't an issue, the film is following the character on a short journey and as explained above you really do feel like you're right there, in space, watching. There are plenty of films where there is a lack of narrative. That is not an issue. The dialogue in this film needs to serve only as a commentary on what is going on, to fill in any blanks, which I'll admit people may have a problem with, and it does get a little cheesy. I didn't care. I was rarely listening to what was being said. I was more interested on what I was watching, yes the stunning visuals, but also the plight of the character, which was enthralling. Also, Sandra Bullock does enough to make the character come alive right here in the present so that the dialogue is largely redundant anyway, and any backstory not necessary. I found I was emotionally invested in George Clooney's character as soon as any threat began because it felt so real, not just because of the visuals but because of the weight of the acting and the threat itself. Lastly, I'll say that I haven't been as emotionally exhausted by a film in a very long time, if ever. I certainly have never felt so emotionally up and down watching a film. I probably laughed, cried and felt anxious short of having a heart attack several times in several different orders in the space of just 10 minutes of the film. The threat feels real and while I'll admit that people might find the continued frustration the film makes you feel annoying, I do think that is the point, the film sets out to be frustrating, it is part of the constant emotional roller- coaster (clich√© I know but it's also an appropriate way to physically describe the film) you feel like you're sitting on while watching it, and only adds to the realism of the threat. Importantly, Gravity doesn't feel like a typical sci-fi film. It could be set anywhere where there is sustained mortal threat, and I'm sure there are numerous films one could cite to show that in terms of narrative and theme it does nothing new. It does not pretend to be profound, or even particularly clever, but it does exactly what it sets out to do- show the plight of an individual though sustained trauma, alone and terrified- and I can't fault the result for what it is (though maybe I'm missing something). I tend to be overly critical of almost every film I see and I could count of two hands the number of films I have ever considered to be 10/10 films. I genuinely think this is one of them. From the opening shot I was in awe of the visuals, I have never seen anything that comes close to the spectacle of Gravity. From the moment the threat began I was scared, frustrated, happy, depressed, overjoyed, not necessarily in that order and several times over. I consider it almost mandatory that a film provokes some sort of emotional response, whether laughter, crying, happiness or even depression. One of the worst things a film can make you feel is cold. Gravity provoked emotional response and involvement in abundance, and it makes me love it even more. I will say that I'm sure that it would be different on a small screen in my own home in 2D, than in a cinema in 3D, and that would impact the entire experience of the film, though I'm sure that this is true of almost every film these days, but probably never as true as with Gravity. I left genuinely feeling a sense of having had all of my emotional limits tested one by one unrelentingly in such a small space of time on top of having witnessed the most stunning visuals I had ever seen as well as every aspect of the film (with the possible exception of the dialogue) having come together to form something that most closely resembles opera. I hate to use the word ""experience"", it sounds too cheesy, but it best describes how I think of the way Gravity plays in a cinema in 3D. For that experience- 10/10"
"harriet-garner","10","3","6","13 November 2013"," Life-changing

Sandra Bullock's performance literally left me lost for words.<br/><br/>I can say without reservation or regret that this is the best film I have ever seen.

","I often wonder if 'they' cast Sandra Bullock to play Sandra Bullock roles or does she just always play the same part...anyway I do enjoy watching her on the screen (even though she always plays herself) I just don't think she is a very good actor. This film, as usual is over-hyped by people who I can only assume haven't seen Space Odyssey 2001, Alien, Blade Runner, Sunshine etc etc all of which are much better sci-fi movies than this. The effects are stunning but I don't think that constitutes a great film. The main faults being; 1.) Acting - pretty rubbish overall 2.) Characters are not believable (i) a career scientist who never prayed (even after loosing a child) discovers religion as she faces death?! (ii) A career NASA scientist who doesn't understand the basic physics in weightlessness? (iii) a Career NASA scientist who doesn't understand that if something is sinking the water pressure will not allow you to exit it? 3.) really just general incompetence and face palm after face palm moments... for the main female character.<br/><br/>This movie really is no where near as good as other movies I listed above...apart from the effects has very little to offer.

That means, all other 3D films are full of fast movement action packed scenes, that my eyes simply can not withstand.

'Gravity' is a superb film, total 100% enjoyment even if one finds the plot quite dull at times (which I have not) - just enjoy the camera movement, the scale of it all. Breathtaking - did I say it already? Yes.<br/><br/>I understand they wanted big names for these roles. I always liked Sandra Bullock but in this particular film she was just 'OK' for me. It's a shame, because there are tons of great actresses who could have done it better, indeed like the impressive Elizabeth Mitchell ('Lost', 'V', 'Evolution').<br/><br/>As for George Clooney - well, he is OK but again I feel a better actor could have made this film even more outstanding then it is.<br/><br/>To summarise - great film, magnificent cinematography, amazing cgi, captivating plot.

His only role is to help the main female protagonist survive a series of very similar obstacles put in her way.<br/><br/>I got the feeling that the goal of the filmmaker was to simply get the message across that ""women make as good astronauts as men"", while hoping that hype alone would bring in viewers and thereby negate the need for any discernible plot, dialogue or audience engagement.<br/><br/>The ""no no no no"" line Bullock repeats ad nausium (which is taken from Prometheus) as well as painfully obvious and patronising references to 'our frailty and dependence on earth' etc etc, only highlight Gravity's derivative nature.<br/><br/>This film is the end product of a huge hype exercise, it is just 3D special effects with a thin plot and an undercurrent of social and environmental messages, dare I say even propaganda.

It's not simply a revolutionary movie in terms of visual effects; it is a well-rounded, complex, complete film.. Nearly all of the elements that make a movie great are here. Very few movies do this. This is a film that has to be watched. There is no other way to say this. Watch this movie."

","If somebody would ask to describe this movie in a few words - then I would call this movie as ""Best non-alienated sci-fi movie of 2013"" or maybe even of all time. It is hard to make good sci-fi movie, and it is doubly hard to make good non-alienated sci-fi movie. This movie jumps that barrier for sure.<br/><br/>Somehow this movie reminds me another hit (at least for me) - Solaris (2002). Some common things, such as: <br/><br/>a) Action of both movies happens in the some planet's orbit. <br/><br/>b) George Clooney plays in both of them. <br/><br/>c) Both movies tries to dig into human psychology. Albeit Solaris dig a bit deeper ;-). <br/><br/>d) Basic line of events flows around man (George) and woman (Sandra - Gravity case Or Natascha - Solaris case). <br/><br/>e) Action in both movies concentrates around space station(s).<br/><br/>But here similarities ends. Solaris chose more human related problems to analyze deeply. And Gravity chose to analyze more space-tech related problems with sprinkle of human psychology.<br/><br/>Sandra and George duet is wonderful. In first part of movie George acts as primary character, then in second part Sandra takes control over George. This switch is not bad, but it makes to feel that character relations are a bit too asymmetric. (For example in Solaris movie George and Natascha was acting in more symmetrical way - they were like two planets orbiting each other). And in Gravity you have a feeling that somebody shoot George movie part, after that - Sandra movie part and then joined these two parts with digital movie editor ;-) Of course this flow of events is also interesting, but for me symmetrical relations are more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>I would also recommend to see this movie in 3D format. Let's say that Gravity is well optimized for 3D effects. Maybe it is because plot is very suitable for this. Dark space and debris floating around - nothing has better options for 3D ;-)<br/><br/>All in all - you have to see this movie, because as far as i can tell George picks only deep and interesting plots to act on. And this is the case. So go on and see it."

","When James Cameron first said after the screening of Gravity that it's the best space movie till date then I didn't believed him, I considered it a marketing gimmick. Well how will you react to a space movie with just 2 characters shown in the promo and no aliens and bombs or anything of that fashion?? We are so much used to a Pacific Rim or Transformers that Space movies simply means to us to be full of invading aliens and humans trying to be hero and at last winning. Gravity is a totally different take. It's nothing like anything seen till date. If ""Perfect"" is a word which means no flaws, well it's simply goes true for Gravity. From camera to music to acting everything seems flawless. Gravity is a story of simple humans with flaws who rise up and put up a fight no matter how adverse the situation is. It's the story of how heroes are not born but made in a matter of minutes because accepting defeat is simply not an option. Watch Gravity as it pole vaults the current cinematic standards by yards and sets up a whole new benchmark. Gravity is beautiful, has a deep meaning and might inspire you in many ways. Very very very very very highly recommended."

","Gravity manages to transcend the realm of film and leave you mesmerized with its fierce suspense and jaw dropping special effects. The film employs only two actors ‚ÄìGeorge Clooney and Sandra Bullock, but it manages to say so much with so little .Majority of the screen time belongs to Sandra Bullock's character Ryan ,who played out her role with perfection . She finally got a role which did her acting prowess justice, and I could not see anyone else doing a better job than her in that role. Clooney with his usual flair plays out the outspoken Kowalski character to utmost precision. The role seemed to be sculpted for him. Cuaron's direction is masterful. The opening sequence itself is a 10 minute shot, without any cuts, and there are numerous other long shots in the film. That must have been really difficult to produce. The sound mixing in this one is fascinating. The sound mixing in itself managed to take the film to a different level altogether. The minimalistic background music is mixed right into the film, which is absolutely brilliant. Sometimes the intermittent silences spoke more than the background music ,and it is also the best 3D film ever made, and it wins by a long margin.The 3D managed to physically affect the audience,and it is not used only as a gimmick,but adds on the overall experience. The only thing on my mind when I left the theater was when will I again get a chance to go back inside to view this spectacle. Hats off."

It is terrific in widescreen format, the best of the best of fusion cgi and actual sets. Bullock does a great job, the best space movie I have ever seen. Clooney if likable but he could have mailed in his performance. And no cgi aliens were needed although I have been so used to that genre of horror movies I watched for an alien to jump out. None did if you don't count a subconscious dream that helped to solve a problem. If you see it, I would recommend do the 3D or IMAX experience if you can, I see from other reviews that it takes the photography to another dimension. I will go back and see it in 3D just to make sure I don't miss something. I suspect that those who can't get that this is a great movie were expecting a mundane film that they can play computer game with. This movie has content, unlike the one dimensional movies we have gotten so used to. Like if the movie goer is challenged to think,they don't have that cognitive ability developed yet therefore they pan that which they can't comprehend.

I am admitting to being slightly biased as a mid-west film scene supporter but praise has to be given to intense work from such amazing MoTown Filmmakers. As for this one, I don't want to give away any twist endings that the trailer almost gives away, but the film is stellar! I also loved Cinematographer Carl Ballou's work on this movie, it's like ""The Thin Red Line,"" very Emmanuel Lubezki like, kind of reminded me of ""Tree of Life"" too. The movies soundtrack was very omniscient, and I have been watching the very cool works of composer James Stonehouse or a long time who created a track on this film that was a borderline of Hanz Zimmer and John Ottman, who scored the Usual Suspects.

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The cinematography was spectacular. Bullock and Clooney were magnetic as expected. I am not going to dig too deep into this film like science folk are about the laws of gravity and what not because this is a movie. Yes, movies can tell a story of truth and all that jazz but let's be honest, will any of this ever happen. . .EVER? Most likely and probably not so to think too far into a film would be pointless.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed about this film most is the realism it gave off in the visual department. I have never felt so close to space and loved every minute of it. The storyline itself was a bit bleak but the actors made it worth the time. This isn't much of a dialogue film as it is a film that tells the story through it's visuals. You are watching what happened to these astronauts and thinking to yourself, can this be real and if it were what would I do? How would I feel? Sandra conveyed those feelings that If I could feel, I would have. She showed the kind of fear that I would have and the kind of strength that any human would have in the face of fear and uncertainty.<br/><br/>No, this film is not perfect and I am sure it crosses some kind of scientific boundaries but I ask you. . . .can you do better?

","If you remotely liked Apollo 13 or appreciate cinematography or thrillers, you need to see this movie. To describe it as Open Water in space is like calling Da Vinci just a painter. It is probably the only film I've seen that is meant for 3D IMAX, as you can feel like you're floating at times. CGI or not, there are times when you look at Gravity's view of the Earth and think it could be the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. <br/><br/>Like any movie, some suspension of disbelief is necessary for a great story. There is also some movie-underdog sentimentality in the dialog at times, but it doesn't hurt the story or the action. The short runtime keeps things moving and generally doesn't let you catch your breath.<br/><br/>Cast Away is probably the most apt comparison I can think of, and that still fails. I am not a Sandra Bullock fan, but she carries most of the movie very well. When you recall other actors having trouble emoting in front of a green screen, it becomes apparent how good Bullock is. Add to that the technical magic (CGI, choreography, lighting, stunts, etc.) required to make the film's environment credible, and it is easy to see why some are calling it a masterpiece. Flaws exist in everything...this movie is good enough to make you not care."
"zdh952","1","3","6","7 October 2013"," This movie is lucky it's beautiful. VERY LUCKY.
","I saw this movie in 3d, and that was it's greatest strength. It is absolutely beautiful, and some of the best 3d i've ever seen. Visually, it is a masterpiece. Now that I've said my kind words, I'll point out why this movie really let me down. The Premise of this movie is not good for a feature movie. Someone trapped in space trying to get back to Earth would be good for a 30 minute TV episode, but in a 90 minute movie like this, I felt bored because I knew no matter how she gets inside the ship, she can't have any good luck for another 45 minutes because the movie has 50 minutes left. Now, onto my big problem. Sandra Bullock. I like her, I think she does a good straight woman in comedies, and she surprised me by doing well here. Her acting was very good. The problem was the character. A brief 20 second reveal that she had a kid is supposed to connect me to her, and that is ALL WE GET in her character. It just doesn't make me care if she survives. Also, having her alone makes it so that if you don't particularly like her character, tough luck, that it all you have. Also, they kill off George Clooney. I LOVE George Clooney, I think he is a fun, light, funny, confident presence in any movie lucky enough to have him. He's no different in this movie. And when they kill him, all we are left with is a sad sack, uninteresting, complaining character acted by someone who deserves better. The movie could have been (and should have been) Clooney's character fighting for survival. The personality he brought to the character would have made the slow parts better. And god were there slow parts.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel like i pay 14 dollars to see Sandra Bullock spin circles in the vacuum of space and complain for 90 minutes. Have you ever met someone and thought, ""Geez, you're luck your're beautiful, because when you open you mouth, I want to jump off a cliff."" I met that in movie form. They named it Gravity."

Upshot... you are in space for 90 minutes. As near to literal as you can get.<br/><br/>The story was more about the earth, & this human moment in time, more than just the astronauts' experience. More about our collective human condition - doomed in peril in space, doomed to die on earth, and coping with that in a way that compels us to survive. This doesn't spoil a thing, of course... but it's good to understand this is more than just the characters, and has much subtext on life, death, religion, and more.

"FilmMuscle","9","3","6","6 October 2013"," The Definition of Spectacular Filmmaking
","What really makes a film great? In my mind, a film has to have some form of complexity whether it's through its plot/story or through its thematic material. At first glance, Gravity might seem like a simple action movie set in space, but once you notice Alfonso Cuaron's name in the credits, you suddenly understand that there's definitely more there than meets the eye, and that's exactly how it turned out to be. To analyze Gravity to the fullest extent would take numerous pages, which means my review would eventually outstay its welcome. Anyways, moving on, all you need to know prior to entering the darkened theater is that the film stars two of America's sweethearts (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney) and that it'll take you on an unforgettable and exhilarating ride. I don't need to cover the premise in four or five paragraphs like some people; frankly, it annoys me. <br/><br/>But I just have to dedicate a fair share of time to address the level of immersion this film provides. Again, it's one of the most immersive experiences you'll ever encounter as you really feel like you're in outer space, and I'm not exaggerating; I highly recommend all of you to go see it in IMAX 3D immediately before it's too late because that's basically the perfect format for a film of this caliber. It was meant to be experienced in IMAX 3D, and I can't say that for a lot of films, but by god, just do it. The sound design is unbelievably impressive. The filmmakers were somehow able to replicate the right vibrations and volume (considering distance and enclosure), and once that camera enters the astronaut's suit, you undoubtedly and unexpectedly feel the character's pulse and their every movement, required to deal with that encumbering outfit. And when you hear a thundering boom or the commencement of the film's phenomenal soundtrack, you'll probably then realize just how surreal and larger-than-life of a picture you're truly witnessing. The music itself implements so much energy into the feature where at times, it absolutely causes goosebumps or sends chills down your spine, and given the booming and grand surround sound in the IMAX 3D room, you will be left in awe and forced to the edge of your seat. Overall, it's chilling and terrifying at times and then impactful and resounding elsewhere. <br/><br/>On another and arguably more important note, you have the spectacular cinematography and visuals, which honestly serve as the highest draws and strengths of Gravity. The amount of work and the power of the technology put into this production is simply astounding, and as the audience views this unprecedented exhibition of multiplex filmmaking, they can't help but wonder how in the world this unforeseen feat was pulled off. How were the filmmakers capable of convincingly casting us into space, (seemingly) accurately capturing its frightening and remote ambiance? One might ruin the magic by insultingly responding with a ""they used a green screen,"" but there's so much more to it than floating in front of a green screen. I can only imagine the effort put into the editing process, which had to perfectly sync every little detail and sound to the impeccable camera-work. Let me tell you: Alfonso Cuaron wowed the world back in 2006 with the work that was Children of Men in how it completely redefined the idea of lengthy shots. Relating back to Gravity, the first shot you see of the film (its opening in other words) lasts for about fifteen to twenty minutes- fifteen to twenty minutes! For that duration of time, the camera keeps on rolling, and in doing so, it moves from one focused object to another or character while countless events are occurring. How many takes did it take (oops, nothing I can do) to finally attain the perfect shot? Who knows but it's mind-boggling to even think about. The actors, the props, the cinematographer, the entire sound department- everyone! - were unquestionably under a lot of pressure while this technologically striking, visually beautiful, elaborated shot(s) continued. The picture only continued with this style as the rest still mostly consists of lengthy shots. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, even though the critics have loved raving about it on a constant basis over the last week, it's not a perfect film. I've read some reviews after my viewing, and I've noticed just how much exaggeration these critics have been incorporating into their opinions. Noticeably, I can tell why. There's been an abundance of hype and praise surrounding this picture, and no one wants to be the outlier; thus, they begin stretching the actual depth and thematic material of the film quite a bit. In reality, you can do this with almost any film in existence, but there comes a point when your reader can easily point out where you specifically start entering the field of bulls***. Truthfully, the film occasionally feels like it's moving at a slow pace. For some odd reason, most of the critics out there seem to be applauding its lightning pace, but that's certainly not the case. You could tell there were moments that calmed and slowed down, and as much as the film advertises you being on the edge of your seat the entire time, that's not how it really plays out. And, of course, the passionate fans will come out and pan someone for possessing attention span issues, but you can approach any film's haters with such an excuse/attack. Let's attack people for having attention span deficits when they complain about the Tree of Life's snail-like pace, but that's a discussion for another day.<br/><br/>To read further, check out http://www.movie-blogger.com/movie- review/definition-spectacular-filmmaking.

"jakecarter-763-586265","10","3","6","6 October 2013"," Newton meets Kierkegaard
","Never have I seen a movie where physics and philosophy were so intertwined. Physics is the star of this show and philosophy is the subtle undertone, yet the two are inseparably connected in this surprise success. First I will comment on the physics of this movie, then the philosophy. ****Spoilers ahead**** The first scene is flawless. There is a reverence that enters your mind at first sight. People were still shuffling into the theater and I found myself bothered at the noise while this was on screen. It seemed like it deserved reverence. I was intrigued when I noticed that there were no cut scenes. If I am not mistaken, there was not one cut until Ryan's daughter was mentioned, and that was well into the movie. As a mechanical engineering student my mind works in a logical way and because of this I am critical of the plausibility of films to a fault. Sometimes I cannot enjoy a film because I am frustrated by how impossible things are. The whole time I watched this film, Physics 101 and Newton's Laws of Motion were in the back of my head analyzing every move. I can honestly say that not once did I seriously question the physics I saw. Everything was very plausible. On the other hand, the probability of the story is highly unlikely. This does not detract from the movie at all though, because they are still within a reasonable margin of sanity. The story was OK, in fact there isn't much of a story at all. But this isn't a bad thing. This movie doesn't need a story (more on that later). Character development is at a minimum, but again, not necessary. Alright now to the philosophy. Faith may be a better word rather than philosophy as I feel it deals with themes centered on life, death, birth, universal humanity, and even ""heaven"". First, I see the metaphor of the process of one's life from beginning. Most people believe in a sort of life before this one. To me outer space is that pre-earth life for Ryan. After the accident, when she is running out of oxygen and makes it to the air chamber, there is a scene where she is unmistakably portrayed as being in a womb. It is a beautiful scene that has the ability to evoke deep emotion concerning the value of life. After a time Ryan is being ""born"" by re-entry. But there are complications during birth. She is stuck inside the ""womb"", and escapes amid a lot of water (present during child birth) and physical straining. She comes out of the water (embryonic fluid) and takes her first breath of air in her new life. She struggles to the shore and she cannot stand or walk. Much like a newborn. She struggles and must gain her strength and balance to walk again. The whole movie is a portrait of how fragile life is. Everything is trying to kill her. Intertwined in the allegory of new birth, is the progression from no belief to faith. Ryan admits that she has never prayed once in her life. Throughout the film you see artifacts of faith when she is in her most perilous times (Buddha, Christ). She begins to discuss that inner struggle with herself. And slowly a transformation takes place. Her faith grows with her determination to survive. It is consummated when she makes the resolution to fight for her life. She starts telling the metaphysical Matt Kowalski that he is going to meet her deceased daughter and wishes him to say hello to her. At this moment she realizes her faith. Another interesting scene is when she realizes that she is going to die. Earlier we learn that when Ryan heard of the death of her daughter she was driving, and ever since then she just likes to drive and listen to whatever is on the radio. This is her coping method for death. When Ryan comes to the realization that she is going to die in the escape pod, the radio is picking up some random AM radio waves. She concedes to give up her life, and finds comfort in just ""driving"" a space capsule and listening to the radio as she slowly runs out of oxygen and dies. I personally would have been OK if the movie would have ended right then and there. Especially when George Clooney showed up again. At that point I was quite upset. I felt that it ruined the movie. When he turned out to be just an apparition I felt much better about the film. Clooney for me was only OK. I've never been a huge fan. I think his acting skills are one dimensional. And I can never get the Batman & Robin disaster out of my head. Sandra Bullock was on point the entire time; absolutely stunning performance. You root for her survival, but at one point, you are at peace with her death. The Hollywood clich√©s are at a minimum. The suspense is absolutely gripping. I found myself in complete awe at times. There are a few films that I limit myself to watching too often, because seeing them too much will cheapen them. This film has that same effect, but for a different reason. I think the biggest reason for not seeing this film again is that if it is not on an IMAX screen, then it is really diminished. Seeing it at home will sell it short. It just won't be right on a 32"" flat screen or even 50"". I may pay to see it on IMAX again. You totally forget about the 3D eventually. It is very immersive. At one point I actually flinched as debris was coming right at me. This film has been an instant success. It wins with its special effects and adds to the triumph with a stark look at humanity, life, death, faith, and the will to live."
"littleglassbottle","10","3","6","6 October 2013"," Visually, Acoustically, and Cinematographically Superior
","Essentially the whole movie takes place in space. The visuals are so breathtaking, it would be a worthwhile investment even if that was all the movie had to offer. The realism of their null- gravity environment is astonishing, and periodically throughout the film, I wondered how on earth (haha, pun) they managed to film it without actually being in space. <br/><br/>Cuaron also takes advantage of the characteristic eerie quiet of the vacuum of space. You often hear things from the perspective of the character in question, e.g. an enormous explosion produces only deep, dull tones as it resonates through metal that the astronaut is grasping. It's incredibly effective, and contributes to the high-tension atmosphere (haha, another pun) of the film. <br/><br/>But one of my favorite aspects of the film was the cinematography. Alfonso Cuar√≥n is known for doing very long single takes where the scene follows the perspective of a single camera for the duration, rather than switching between multiple views, as is more typical in cinema. If you've seen Children of Men, one of Cuar√≥n's other directorial works, you may recall the 378- second single-take scene in which the camera follows the main characters through an intricately crafted war-zone. It's exquisite. In Gravity, the first 17 minutes of the film are done in a single take. The result is an incredibly immersive experience that holds you in the unrelenting, dizzying, terrifying void of space.<br/><br/>In short, see this movie. Try to be aware of the acoustic and cinematographic nuances that subtly enhance the viewing experience. And if at all possible, I HIGHLY recommend that you see it in IMAX 3D. There are very few films that are actually improved by viewing in 3D, but this is undoubtedly one of them.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I used to dream about floating in space, staring at the stars crossing aside and admiring the nebula. Nothing can be more halcyon and more enjoyable. Now having seen this movie, I'm glad that I executed the space trek in my dream and not in reality. The view is absolutely breathtaking thanks to the CGI; the long shot in the beginning is stunning. Adding depths and the feeling of room, 3D really takes this movie to a whole new level. The unexpected coming of debris did hold me back, at first. However, the ever appearing predicaments generate humdrum. There are also several scenes that do not make sense for me. How can NASA send an astronaut having not successfully driven a re-entry module into space? How can an astronaut forget to grab tools after using them in space, AFTER already losing a hold of a nail once? How can a frog stay alive in sea water??? Moreover, the growing pitch occurring every time a door or anything needed to be closed annoys me a little. After all, it is undoubtedly a good movie with a fresh story and brilliant pictures, but it can be better."
"quincytheodore","10","3","6","4 October 2013"," A visual achievement and an inspiring masterfully crafted tale
","When I entered the cinema, I didn't expect to see a triumph in cinematography. Gravity is hands down the best movie of this year; it is fascinating, majestic and thoroughly dreadful at the same time. The visual is years ahead from the flock as the screenplay are probably the smoothest use of continuous shots I've ever seen. Acting from the talented Sandra Bullock and George Clooney is incredibly beautiful, the simple concept of characters in dire predicament has been crafted so masterfully, it's nigh impossible not to be drawn into this highly inspiring tale.<br/><br/>The visual is undeniably breathtaking. It flows stunningly from scene to scene, the camera shows just the right angle while explosion of color in dark space erupts. The occasional switches to first person view looks very natural, emphasizing the intense solitude, almost in frightening yet utterly captivating way. Graphical effect is clearly one of the best, not only in movie but in all medium; it is gloriously magnificent to witness such stellar value. It takes its time to build up the suspense and it focuses comprehensibly on the extraordinary moments while giving the audience a chance to savor them entirely. I truly admire Alfonso Cuar√≥n from his work in Children of Men, he's a visionary and now he's perfected his craft with excellent editing and screenplay.<br/><br/>Screenplay does a marvelous job of trailing the characters in the gripping struggle for survival. Credits goes to the short list of cast; George Clooney who is charmingly dependable and especially Sandra Bullock who deliver a chilling intimate performance that can freeze the entire theater. She's nothing less than remarkable, she seems a bit withdrawn at first but as she fights through the ordeal, she gradually opens up and ultimately exhibits strengths beyond despair. This is one of rare occasions where a movie almost exclusively relies on an individual's acting, and Sandra Bullock delivers, many times over, taking the audience along in her personal journey. A truly inspiring performance.<br/><br/>The music is harrowingly gripping, almost to the extent of merging with the sound effect. It gives enchanting suspense and even more emotionally engaging at most points. When the visual, music and acting combine together, it reaches a pinnacle of how passionately powerful a movie could be. Its simple yet brilliant concept of living can be universally acceptable to everyone; it speaks to viewers across age, gender or race.<br/><br/>There may come movies that stand above the rest, movies that can restore wonder upon watching them as if you are experience watching big screen for the first time, they may not come often, but Gravity is clearly one such movie. With such elegant visual choreograph and splendid acting, it's a near magical experience."

","Gravity. I went into this film knowing what it was about and having read the reviews saying it was a great film. The reviews were rights. Gravity is visual feast for the eyes. With such a simplistic setting (Space) and plenty of material to work with Gravity surprises time and again. The story is fairly simplistic: A space engineer and an astronaut are doing some repairs to the Hubble Space telescope when space debris comes hurtling at them like a bullets separating them from the space shuttle. what follows is a hectic-calm. Yes, its hectic but the cinematography and special effects are amazing. The attention to the detail pays off as you can see water droplets clearly. I saw the 3-d version, which I recommend, but even if you don't see it on 3-d, it's a still one beautiful movie. The acting by Sandra Bullock is impressive, I wouldn't be surprised if she gets a Oscar nod out of this. Clooney is Clooney, he's capable. With such a slim cast and simplistic setting, Gravity will hold your attention and leave you in awe."

","So after work I decided to watch a movie on this Friday night. I was thinking of giving this one a try because I want to try and see if I like the sci-fi and drama as I am usually into the action/crime movie. I actually paid more for this one as I watched the 3D. Tbe movie starts in the outer space one of the astronauts is trying to do something in the outer planet while others are doing something else. One of the astronauts were getting out of oxygen but later on made it to the ""ISS"" to get back to earth. I find this very hard to catch up with and sort of boring as I almost fell asleep several times during the movie. The movie just ends when the astronauts crashed in to water and landed on the seaside."
"fabiolebeau-1","9","9","28","21 December 2013"," Yes, this movie is awesome.
","First of all, I wouldn't consider this is a Sci-Fi flick. This is a movie about the human condition. That said, the movie is indeed awesome - period. Many people disliked the movie because of a certain kinda hidden religious bias (in one or two scenes), which, in my opinion, doesn't ruin the movie at all. We all, as human beings, need some mystery here and there. Science is just another form of religion, after all. But that's not the point here - and I'm not a religious person either. Many people have talked about the special effects and whatnot. Right, they play their part in the movie. However, they are not, by far, what it really matters here. ""Gravity"" (and the title is extremely important) makes complete sense only in the final scene - and let me tell you why.<br/><br/>We have Ryan (Sandra Bullock's character) and Matt (George Clooney playing space-George-Clooney). Matt is only a side dish, and that's it. Ryan is what really matters. She shows us what it means to be human. In other words, what it means to live under all this ""gravity"". In space there's no gravity, no problems (in this sense), we run away, we float. Matt tells her that. In a nutshell: Space is easy (even after all the problems they had up there), Earth is hard. On Earth, gravity affects everything and everybody. Ryan lost her daughter - that's gravity. The final scene, in which she tries to stand up, fails, tries again and finally succeeds is what the movie is all about. The movie is, therefore, a metaphor. <br/><br/>We must live under the power of gravity: losses, deaths, problems, sorrow, sadness, longing, etc. etc. etc. This is what it means to be human. That's ""gravity"". In space, we will never find any gravity. Gravity is down here, and we must live with it."

","A movie with such a title that is about the scary and dark void called ""space,"" you'd expect to be thrilling. Well, I have to tell you this movie is beyond thrilling. This film is a perfect combination of ""Matrix"" and ""Inception"" and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level! ""Gravity"" is a life time experience that everyone must see! If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters, it just doesn't get better than that!<br/><br/>Since this movie has so many genres, it's hard to tell its main one. This movie has adventure, comedy, sorrow, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense scary scenes and so much more! The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense. You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie. (Sandra Bullock)<br/><br/>The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope. It seems like a casual spacewalk, but when she gets stranded away from her ship, ""Explorer,"" she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station. If you want to find out how and if she and her co-worker, Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) make it back to Earth alive, you have to watch the film.<br/><br/>The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics, it's hard not to like it! You feel like you are right there, experiencing whatever the main characters experience. The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it - what would you do, if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe, with nobody but yourself? What would your thoughts be? Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you? The camera work is the best I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuar√≥n, I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel. She thinks she's stranded. Before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to Earth, she starts to see Matt. Matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back. As soon as his statement is over, he's gone. She hallucinated him but the plan worked! It's a very interesting and important scene in the movie and that's why I like it. <br/><br/>The movie is rated PG-13 and I honestly think it is appropriate for age 12 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and it is showing in theaters everywhere right now. I may be wrong, but I predict Oscar nominations for the cast and director of ""Gravity.""

"Leofwine_draca","4","4","10","25 June 2016"," Artificial space disaster film saddled with an awful lead
","Another overrated Hollywood movie. From all the press and awards it received, you'd think GRAVITY was some kind of masterpiece, but in fact it turns out to be a lightly-plotted space adventure which loses steam about halfway through and becomes tiresome. Yes, the film features some exceptionally fluid camera-work which looks fantastic at times, and it has some of the most realistic space scenes in it yet. The CGI effects work is often flawless and only looks fake in the occasional explosion scene in which it threatens to overwhelm the camera. I didn't mind the storyline too much either, even though it was overly simplistic.<br/><br/>Where GRAVITY falls flat is in the choice of lead actress. Sandra Bullock is in no way, shape, or form, a dramatic actress, and yet the viewer is stuck with her character for 100% of the running time. She screams, swears, mouth breathes, and hyperventilates throughout, while her character is responsible for some of the dumbest things in the movie. Why must American films have such horrible lead characters, ones that it's impossible to like, let alone identify with? Bullock's terrible acting drags this film's enjoyment factor right down, despite all the stuff the film-makers get right elsewhere.<br/><br/>George Clooney is much better in support but gets little screen time. And after a while you start to spot the artificiality of the script, with Bullock narrowly avoiding destruction time and time again thanks to the machinations of the writers. It seems that she possesses some kind of protective force field, but when she escapes disaster for the umpteenth time the sense of realism is lost. I like Alfonso Cuaron as a director, but perhaps he should forget about trying to write his films as well and start casting better actors."

","As unreal as a cartoon, the only thing that looks good in this is Sandra Bullock's body. Her hair is cut short as a Bull Dyke, though, and last year a study was done that concluded 9 out of 10 girls with short hair do not like sex, so this was a turn off too. The things that happen are impossible, a guy in a spacesuit is moving as fast as walking, and he's supposed to pull them to the next space station, which is how far? 1000 miles away? IF you're strong, you can walk 25 miles in a day, although the early native Indians were said to walk 50 miles in a day in bare feet like it was nothing. I was ready to walk out of this, but Sandra Bullock pulls off her space suit, which is the only thing that held my interest. The high technology equipment was a little interesting, but not worth your time. The only reason I saw this was IMDb's high user rating on this, which on some occasion's are wrong, so I'm trying to steer you the right way. This high rating here is false, try another movie, something that's more laughable."

Junk food in space with extra cheese in the form of 'in the womb' metaphors as well as the usual Hollywood nonsense of our America saves the world again. How how everything would be so much easier if everything was in English and those pesky Chinese and Russians did not write their own language on all those colourful buttons. <br/><br/>This movie is a stinker, unrealistic and smells of nationalism.

"Ziya90","3","4","10","28 January 2014"," I couldn't see anything unconventional in this film except a few beautiful shots
","I saw the movie in IMAX 3D (despite the fact that I am not a fan of it) and the experience itself was effective, yes, but the film was not. The film was visually beautiful, but not that dazzling except two scenes (the beginning and the ""octopussy-like cords"" scene. Honestly, as said despite I found the movie visually beautiful, it was not a jaw dropping visual feast in contrast with the hype. For example, The Tree of Life was much better visually or Holy Motors. In terms of ""space experience"", I prefer Into The Darkness as a recent sci-fi film (it was not perfect, but near perfect as a sci-fi blockbuster) and 2001 from the past, the mother of all sci-fi movies. Children of Men is a masterpiece for me, and it was a brilliant film from a genius director, but I couldn't see or feel that in Gravity. The idea is brilliant, but the movie is not unconventional to carry this idea. This is not an offbeat film, there are just a few ""different"" angles and shots, the editing in some scenes is impressive, but all these are technical aspects of the film, so is this enough? What about the story, what about the decisions (some silly decisions) of the characters, what about their motivation or what about their weird reactions just to affect or manipulate the audience? I am a Clooney fan, also I really like Mrs. Bullock (when I was a kid, I fell in love with her when I watched The Demolition Man), so seeing these people in the movie was a joy for me, but after a while, the movie turned into a conventional space drama thriller like Apollo 13 or even Red Planet (by the way Apollo 13 is a great film), but wasn't this movie supposed to be an offbeat space film? or at least an original film? Just the idea is original here, not the execution or the story, especially the development and the conclusion part of the story are pretty typical. The atmosphere could have been more uncanny, the situations could have been more suspenseful, the story could have been darker and the story could have been more mysterious. The spiritual background of the film was not that deep, just a few obvious symbols and themes, that's all. The movie was rather far-fetched than being subtle in transferring emotions and ideas, also it was rather ""mechanic"" than a thrill-ride. This is not a psychological film, because there is no time for that, the film was too short maybe and I didn't find the film inspiring including the finale. Gravity is not the new ""A Space Odyssey""."

Pretty basic stuff. **spoiler alert** - she doesn't die at the end. George Clooney doesn't make it half way through, although we don't actually see him die. <br/><br/>I don't write a lot of reviews, but I do read them.

"jamesxfm","2","4","10","11 January 2014"," Graphically spectacular but wears off and descends into a farce.
","First of all i'll start with the positives. the film's graphics are spectacular and for the first few minutes you feel immersed in the experience. Also the sound in the collisions worked very well.<br/><br/>However it didn't take very long for the novelty of it all to wear off. Which gets to me on to my first major problem. The script. It feels as though an amateur put together a script in 5 minutes and repeated it at least 4 times to make the film last an hour or so. It was basically a trip to 4 different space stations that were all hit by debris and the journey between them.<br/><br/>Then to my 2nd problem. The film tried to be authentic and yet there were more holes in it than I could count. the biggest of course being (spoiler alert) George Clooney's death. It made no sense that when he had been stopped from drifting away by the awful Sandra Bullock it would have only taken tug to send him in the right direction and save his life. Instead She lets go and watches him drift away. And if the film was about space that is a big oversight considering there was no force being applied to Clooney to cause him to die.<br/><br/>Other less severe but still wrong for a film that tries to be so right issues include the length of time bullock survives with so little oxygen, her ability to drive a shuttle that she has never been able to before even though no 2 shuttles are the same or even the same language.<br/><br/>And finally my biggest problem with gravity. No prizes for guessing this one. Sandra bullock. Never before have I wished the main hero to die as much as I did with her. It felt like she screamed her way through the whole film, while constantly whining about being in space. It made the whole film feel cheap.<br/><br/>As a summary, I feel that the graphics that the movie contained did a very good job of masking an inadequate script. But even they couldn't stop the film from sliding after such a promising opening. The cast couldn't bring the script to life and Sandra Bullock was one of the worst lead characters I have ever seen. I wanted to like the film, but I lost all immersion every time the cast reappeared. I wish it was a documentary."

","Like so many before me, I was looking forward to watching and enjoying one of the films, if not THE film of the year. The critics raved about it. IMDb rates it an 8.4 average.<br/><br/>What a disappointment.<br/><br/>The first five minutes introduced us to three characters, two male buffoons acting like five year olds in a space playground and a female engineer, temperamentally unsuited to being on the mission. She cannot follow orders and ultimately causes both their deaths -- not that she seems to give that much thought -- and we are supposed to care about her and her plight? There is no one here to care about.<br/><br/>The visuals aren't enough. Watching Bullock pinball from one crisis to another gets old really quickly.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't understand the raves.

","The idea for this film was very good and the film itself should also have been. The effects were great and it must have had a huge budget. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, as with most things Hollywood, it was utterly ruined by a terribly cheesy and utterly unbelievable script. Some, in fact most, of the lines were just awful. Do people really buy into this stuff? It is extremely unrealistic. <br/><br/>It really was akin to a low budget soap opera or an episode of 'which ever country you are in has talent'. I suspect the focus was on the characters 'journey' , 'as people'. You get the idea. <br/><br/>On many occasions this completely detracted form the story to make it unrealistic. Bullock is running out of oxygen for, what seems like, an age and panicking for, what seems like, an age, and needs to get into the space station. When she gets there, starved of oxygen, they decide to have a cheesy 'heart to heart' conversation before she eventually attempts to enter. You, well I at least, sat there thinking, 'hold on, you are about to die...right?'. This includes discussing what colour eyes they think Clooney has. Its just bad !<br/><br/>More over, Sandra Bullock has got to be the most wooden, emotionless actress I have ever seen. Does she really get paid huge sums of money for her 'acting'? They could have used a real bullock, called it 'Cows in Space' and it would have been more believable. I knew she was in it before watching, which filled me with dread, but then the idea was my kind of film. <br/><br/>In the beginning the space station they are space walking on gets hit, at high velocity, with debris, resulting in catastrophic damage and many dead. Bullock is thrown through space, hitting the space station at a very high speed and swung around on a large arm. Her response was completely out of sync with the situation and far too mild. She sounded like someone jogging ! Am i the only one who sees this? She sounds, acts and looks the same whether on a speeding bus about to be blown up, in a television interview or being thrown around space at high speed. It's like she's on prozac! Who in their right mind would cast her? She's a prime example that being reasonably pretty means more in Hollywood than being talented. <br/><br/>In summary the idea and basic story is great, as are the effects. The makers unfortunately went with 2 big names that are handsome or pretty rather that actors could do it justice and added a cheesy 'Hollywood' script, thus ruining it. Avoid !"

","I'd heard people raving about how good this movie was but last night, just before I went to watch it, a friend told me that it had been largely panned by the critics. However, in a backflip, someone (perhaps a critic or someone else with a lot of clout in the movie industry), gave it glowing accolades and essentially turned the reviews around from terrible to a must-see.<br/><br/>It seems that the possible turkey of a movie is now a ""must see"" based on the number of glowing reviews.<br/><br/>Anyway, onto the review... co-written; co-produced and directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, this is visually, a lovely movie. The cinematography of the space scenes (ie. outside of the craft) were a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>However, the storyline itself, left a lot to be desired. Bullock plays a ""brilliant medical engineer"" who is on her first space outing.<br/><br/>The first thing I found amazing /implausible was when she is ordered to return to the spacecraft due to incoming space debris, she refused to move until she had calibrated some equipment. A person who is in space for the first time would adhere to the orders of a senior crew member who has been in space many times before.<br/><br/>Next, the efforts to retrieve a dead colleague who was killed during the space storm meant that Bullock was almost out of oxygen by the time she reached the spaceship. Would you risk two other people dying (Clooney & Bullock), in order to rescue a dead body ??? I think not.<br/><br/>Next, during a close-up of Bullock in her space suit, she's got layers of mascara on her eyelashes. It could have been eased back a bit to make it more ""plausible"" - OK, maybe I'm nitpicking here, but it's my review.<br/><br/>During the fire inside the spaceship, Bullock doesn't raise a bead of sweat, despite being in an oxygen rich environment. She's just too cool all throughout her continuing ordeals.<br/><br/>When she lands on Earth, Bullock is stuck in a spacepod that is fast filling with water. She can't easily get out of the pod before it sinks... Wait a second... I thought pods were meant to float, so that the astronauts could get out when the boat /helicopter arrives. It made no sense that it sank.<br/><br/>While underwater, Bullock finds she is not able to swim because of her space suit being worn. Amazingly, she is able to just pull it off like a Velcro suit and swim to the surface and then onto the sea shore.<br/><br/>At that point, Bullock finds that she can't easily move because of ""Gravity"".<br/><br/>Roll credits.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a really low rating in order to balance out the implausibly high ratings.<br/><br/>Wait for it to be released on DVD - you won't be missing a lot in the meantime."
"poolboyg88","Null","4","10","25 October 2013"," 'Gravity' is Sexist
","Spoiler Alert: This post will ruin the closest thing to a 'twist' that Gravity has. It's not a huge deal, but if you haven't seen the movie and don't want any plot spoilers, best to move along.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's character is the most panicky, inept person ever sent into space. It's never explained why a medical doctor with only six months of training is somehow adding equipment to the Hubble, probably because there's no world in which this would happen. Science fiction movies have certainly had more panicky people in space (Bill Paxton in Aliens?) but Gravity isn't a science fiction movie. It takes place in present times with present technology, in space. It's realistic fiction, comparisons should be more to Apollo 13 than any sci- fi. For the first half of the movie, Sandra Bullock basically has no agency and takes no useful action to save herself. George Clooney unflappably holds her hand through every action and swoops in with his magic jetpack whenever she inevitably does something wrong. She spends a good deal of time literally tethered to him as he does all the work. By all appearances, George Clooney's character would have survived the entire ordeal easily had he not been forced to frequently expend limited resources and take gigantic risks to save Sandra Bullock's ""damsel in distress."" The only back-story for her character is how emotionally damaged she is because she is a mother who lost her child. There's no screen time given to how awesome at her job she must be to have landed this incredibly rare and prestigious opportunity, nor is any given to showing her being more competent than anyone else at any task she performs in the movie. There is a point in the movie where she has given up all hope and just decided to die. Rather than taking this moment for her to find the strength within herself to carry on, she instead hallucinates George Clooney back into the picture to be Space Daddy and tell her exactly what she needs to do. Whatever else you may think of Gravity, don't think that it is doing a good job of portraying a strong female role. It's the opposite. This is just one more story reinforcing ""in catastrophic situations, men are cool as cucumbers and women freak out and get emotional"" stereotypes.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n may have fought to have a female lead in Gravity, but having a female lead and having an admirable female character are two totally different things.<br/><br/>And now for some pre-facto rebuttals:<br/><br/>The circumstances were unprecedented, any man or woman could have panicked in that way. That's true, but not just anybody did. The reference points we are given in the movie are the cool, collected man and the panicky, inept woman. But ultimately she saves herself! Yes, but there's both the problem of hallucinating a man to tell her what to do and that we are never shown a single thing that she does that seems like it is better or different from what our male character would have done, and he's only dead because of her. Her inexperience was central to the tension of the plot, it had to be this way. I disagree. This isn't Apollo 13 where we're recounting some historical actual space disaster. This is a movie about everything in space blowing up. There would have been tension and doubt as to her survival even if she were exactly as cool and collected as George Clooney. So how should it have been, then? How about this: just swap the roles. Sandra Bullock (or someone maybe a bit older) plays the cool, collected experienced astronaut who is paired with a rookie astronaut on his first mission. This probably can't be George Clooney because I can't really imagine him playing a rookie or panicky anything. How about Bill Paxton? Who cares, it's just a movie. A movie that is garnering universal critical acclaim, huge box office success, likely award nods, and is also talked up for having a female lead. We're showering praise and success and reinforcing the idea that damsels in distress are a great way to tell stories. I believe that media and entertainment hold immense sway over the attitudes and behaviours of our culture, and I find it frustrating how few opportunities are seized to portray fantastic, strong female characters, especially in engineering or scientific roles. The world needs more Ellen Ripleys, not more Ryan Stones (that's the character's name, if you've forgotten. I had)."
"verna-a","5","4","10","13 October 2013"," Oh dear, a bit of a disappointment
","I was looking forward to this movie but I have to say that I went away somewhat disappointed. Sure the special effects are great and the elements of suspense are certainly there in the situation, but I began to feel disaffected quite early in the movie. To identify why, I had to compare it with another, really enjoyable, space movie, Apollo 13. To me, the characters in Gravity are really not plausible as people who would be likely to come through the astronaut training program. Right from the start you see them indulging in irresponsible behaviour outside the spacecraft, and disobeying orders.Their training seems patchy to say the least. Then one of them (Bullock's character) turns out to have a major personal issue they have not dealt with. That's my gripes with the characters. Then in terms of the story development, there is absolutely no let up in disasters. Explosion effects are piled on explosion effects, and one thing fails after another. Sure a number of things went wrong in Apollo 13, but it's all a lot more low-key. I started to feel somewhat burnt out by the whole situation in Gravity and when at one stage Bullock's character decides to close her eyes and just die, I had to say I thought it was the most appropriate action! A final beef is that I doubted the authenticity of the way the laws of physics are depicted with the interaction of bodies in space - I'm pleased to see that others have taken issue with this too. So in brief I found the whole thing implausible and irritating. Bullock was fine in her part : the photography of her face is in no way flattering throughout, although the gym-toned body she reveals when she shucks her spacesuit, is quite impressive. The film had well and truly lost me before then however. I should give it a 6 out of 10 for watchability but because my disappointment has left me bitter and twisted I'll rate it only 5."

","Having read rave reviews from both critics and general public I was surprised how mediocre this movie was. The plot is very thin. The action sequences are repeated throughout the length of the movie. They seem to be impressive the first time but after a few repetitions they bore rather then thrill. Scientific details make you doubt that screenplay writers learned basic physics. For example, the ""speeding bullet"" fast moving debris hitting the ISS. Or miraculous survival of Dr. Ryan Stone inside the burning capsule. The acting is quite good but there is not much to act for Sandra Bullock. You can't relate to this story on any level and this is why it leaves you cold. CGI's are terrific but they can't save the movie. Overall, it was a disappointment after great expectations.

","I am always a little leery about seeing movies in 3-D because I have issues with motion sickness. But I sucked it up and saw in IMAX 3-D. Let me tell you from the start, this is the only way Gravity should be seen. From the opening scene, you will almost feel a sense of weightlessness in your theater seat. It is so much greater with the depth you feel in 3-D. The director does such a great job of switching between the awesomeness and openness of space and Earth to the claustrophobia that Bullock senses inside her own space suit. I will admit there are scenes during the movie that could have been moved along a little more swiftly. Believe me, those short respites from action in the film are welcomed. Most of the movie is a white-knuckle, edge of your seat thrill ride. Like others have said, Cloonie plays little more than a supporting role to Bullock. However, his ""character"" is well-scripted and supports Bullock superbly. I have never viewed Bullock in a more gripping and introspective role. Not only does she have to deal with her physical surroundings, but she has to face down her own mental and emotional demons as well. For parents, there are a few swear words throughout the film, including a very quick F word. Also, Bullock is shown in a few scenes with little more than underwear and a t shirt on. This is a great movie and maybe the best movie in this decade."

","I went to see ""Gravity"" this evening in the cinema and came out with mixed feelings. I don't want to give anything away so let's say ""Gravity"" is pretty much ""Open Water"" in space.<br/><br/>While the CGI is very impressive, the set itself is kind of minimalistic. The build-up of tension is also very well made and the film has you on the edge of your seat more than once. That's probably where everybody just seeking a thrill can drop out - the movie definitely delivers.<br/><br/>What really bothers me is the melodramatic undertone of the whole thing. It starts with the sound effects during collisions in space. Why bother mentioning that there is no sound in space at the beginning of the film when you don't let the pictures of destruction run in absolute and horrifying silence afterward but use all the methods of dramatization like synthi-horns etc. instead? For me, it takes away a large portion of atmosphere against the background of this very special setting.<br/><br/>Music is generally a big problem of this movie. There is music that is a vital part of the scenery in a film (e.g. The Sining) and there is music that is nothing but a suggestive instrument to arouse emotion (e.g. any given patriotic action movie). Unfortunately ""Gravity"" uses the latter and thereby loads the otherwise cold and deadly solitude of space up with a ""feel this, feel that..""-music that doesn't fit at all. The score makes this film really laughable at times and I have to say that ""Open Water"" made many things a lot better, simply by sticking to the horror such a situation bears itself.<br/><br/>Concentrating on the deadly silence of space would have made this film great but it really falls victim to the overly dramatic use of music. Judge for yourself."
"mfc90125","8","5","14","20 December 2013"," Gravity is amazing, but can you watch a film like this more than once?
","Gravity is an absolute thrillride. But can you watch it more than once? WARNING: major spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The beauty and thrill of discovery involved in space travel is matched only by its inherent potential for dramatic loss of life, as evidenced by the tragedies of Challenger and Columbia. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity takes us through just such a disaster, creating both a thrilling and cautionary tale that will either inspire or make you nervous each time you fly.<br/><br/>Astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are busy space-walking around the Space Shuttle Explorer when the ship is struck and destroyed by a dead Russian spy satellite. Their only hope is to make it to the International Space Station, which Stone finds has been abandoned, with its only functioning escape craft damaged. As secrets are revealed about the duo, one must make the ultimate sacrifice so that the other may live, paving the way for a gripping end to what was supposed to be a nice walk around Planet Earth.<br/><br/>This is a two-person show, with Clooney and Bullock as the only actors, minus the voice of Mission Control, played by The Right Stuff's Ed Harris. They survive each debris storm, which seems to grow in intensity and size, while constantly running out of oxygen or dealing with fires in space. It would have been less effective had Gravity been told from Clooney's perspective, or had the hero been a man. That's not to say women are less likely to survive a space disaster of this scale, but the perceived frailty of women and instinctual survival are played up here, resulting in either modest failure or total success. It's merely by luck that Bullock emerges as the lone survivor, but what of her life afterwards? Clooney has more incentive to return home - to the life of a bar-hopping astronaut - than Bullock, whose loss of her daughter years before has left her with nothing but quiet car drives after work. That's not something to look forward to, especially since Cuar√≥n makes such a big deal of this perceived dysfunction once the action ramps up. Gravity is less about the future than surviving the present, with our heroine reacting to circumstances and less about how those change her. Once she's home, it's back to that quiet car ride. Lame. <br/><br/>Clooney is the master of the understated performance, with his dry veneer and aging good looks guaranteed to keep women focused until his untimely departure. By then, we've already focused onto Bullock, whose realistic portrayal lends incredible reality to the role. A lot has been made about their public relationship, and whether Clooney influenced the selection process; regardless, she turns in an amazing performance that could see her nab an Oscar nomination. But this is Cuar√≥n's baby, and he delivers it with amazing vision and excellent camera-work by Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. Both seem to understand the backdrop of space as both amazingly dangerous and yet filled with incredible beauty and untapped power. Man is merely a grain of sand in that great vacuum, and Cuar√≥n - who co-wrote this with his brother Jon√°s - adds the right mix of human drama and space-scale epic to the screen. The result may convince you to either become an astronaut, or swear never to fly again. <br/><br/>Some people classify 'good film' as something you can watch more than once, because you always find a new angle or background action you missed the first time. Gravity is hard to place into this neat box, because its novelty wears off once the credits start rolling. That doesn't mean you shouldn't see it. but you might be dissuaded from purchasing it on Blu-ray once it becomes available. Nevertheless, Gravity proves that space is both the final and most dangerous frontier man will ever face. Bullock re-assumes her position as a top-tier veteran, while Clooney continues to prove that his appearance in a film - whether short or long - makes everything he touches that much better. If you have issues with vertigo, I'd discourage you from seeing it in IMAX, based on our feelings of vertigo at a 3D standard theater. Either way, it's a film you'll only want to watch once - make the most of it. Gravity is rated PG-13 for language, creepy country music in space, and has a runtime of 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Discuss this review with fellow SJF fans on Facebook.

","I hate this movie. I really really hate this movie. If everyone else didn't love this movie soooo much, I might not have this much disdain for it, but after watching it, I went on Youtube and was hoping to find like minded intelligent people to commiserate with and I was stunned that so many people thought it was so touching.<br/><br/>Do you know how hard it is to get chosen to go on a space mission? People spend their entire lives working to get the chance to go to space, and they STILL most likely won't get to. And then you have Sandra Bullock, the reluctant astronaut, who just mopes around and cries about her dead kid. Our astronauts train so diligently to remain calm and collected in an emergency. This makes a mockery out of them. Stop sobbing, pull yourself together, and deal with the situation.<br/><br/>Scientifically, it's a mess. We all know about how George Clooney never needed to die, but when his ghost comes back to save her (because like most women, she's too busy crying about her baby to do complicated science, and needs the ghost of a man to come save her (heavy sarcasm)), she just starts randomly flicking buttons in that capsule. People say that this movie makes women look so strong and whatnot, but I think that it portrays exactly how we're viewed. Emotional and frantic and instead of stopping for a second and getting herself together to try to read and figure out the instruments, the writers found it more realistic for her to have to visualize a man to do it for her. <br/><br/>And yes, when she's floating in space and taking off her space suit (so she doesn't lose her femininity with that bulky costume), she's curled up *just like a fetus*. Dude. I get it. The imagery is just hammered over your head and I found myself screaming at the TV for her to STOP CRYING"

And what is the probability that among the 70% sea water (deep oceans) and 29% of land that it just gets in the marsh, which has saved her life because it is partially soft input, and is deep enough to not falling through from the bottom, and it is enough shallow that when it comes to the bottom so as not to drown because there is enough air to quickly reach the shallows. (if she fell in the sea, protective suit, as is made of metal, dragged to the bottom of the oceans and being killed or from pressure differences, or from drowning. Another option is to fall on the land, due to excessive speed just make it explode). Very unrealistic film (although they desperately tried to make film to be as realistic as possible)."
"braddugg","10","3","7","7 September 2014"," The most immersing cinematic experience since AVATAR.
","The most immersing cinematic experience since AVATAR.<br/><br/>Before I begin the review I have a qualm to express. I am appalled by the way Prasads IMAX does it's business. IMAX was built with a specific purpose and now with release of Telugu films which do not deserve an IMAX screen, Prasads expressed that its purpose is to serve Telugu films and the films essentially meant for an IMAX release, like GRAVITY have to take a backseat. I wish there was one show of this film in IMAX.<br/><br/>How many do know that there is an IMAX in NASA Space Center in Florida. I was lucky to be at NASA in 2010 and more so as I did see a wonderful film called HUBBLE there. Now, GRAVITY is a film that is based on what may have happened to HUBBLE. That is all it has in common and from then on, its a bumpy ride its a kind of cast away it space. Where one person is caught in jeopardy and has to get out of it. <br/><br/>George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky and Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone are two NASA people on board the Hubble on an operation. Now, in space fixing a screw too is like an operation coz its daunting task there, considering many things. In GRAVITY, their characters are wonderfully written by Alfonso Cuaron and both have done their jobs wonderfully and indeed Sandra Bullock has won my heart with her performance. <br/><br/>Why is Gravity so immersing is because this is not a film where merely some story is said. It throws you into the action, makes you empathize with the character and makes you relieved when the character attains the impossible. That's how cinema is supposed to be and GRAVITY succeeds in involving the eyes and the physical body language too of the viewer too. I felt dizzy at times and I am still feeling the jolt hours later. Impact is such heavy and also it's all worthwhile.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron, who took the pain of directing it must be a relieved man now since he has done the job wonderfully in directing this marvel now can sit back and enjoy the results of the hard work. The pain he took in detailing can be felt in every nuance that is there is on the screen, even the teardrops, the nuts and bolts, wow for all those in space. All my salutations to Alfonso, the writer director who had a vision and he has executed it a way that we seldom see in cinema.<br/><br/>I loved the editing and the soundtrack. But above all else, I loved the cinematography and the visual effects. Placing the camera in the right position and to encapsulate the whole feeling in the lens is remarkably done. The post production work I am sure will sweep all the visual effects awards of this year.<br/><br/>Above all, it's a story of inspiration and of human spirit winning in hard times. When there is hope and some common sense, ""fortune favors the brave"" and that's what exactly happened in GRAVITY.<br/><br/>A 5/5 for one of the most compelling experiences at cinema. I wish this film was not given a break by our theater people and I also wish that this will be soon released in IMAX as I am eager to catch it up in IMAX many many times. JUST LOVED THE EXPERIENCE."

I bet SCUBA divers just roll their eyes thinking' WTF when they watch Bullock and Clooney make their way to the Intl Space Station (don't talk..concentrate on not panicking & breathe deliberately to conserve oxygen).

","Alert: This review may contain spoilers: I had heard a lot about this movie's special effects and acting, so I eagerly looked forward to seeing it. I also like George Clooney as an actor. To me the characters in this movie were very one dimensional and hollow. I can't help but wonder if the actors actually read the script before signing on the dotted line. Clooney's astronaut was too cheery, whimsical and far fetched - making small talk by repeating pointless jokes and stories and playing country music while space walking on a serious mission - drowning out communication with NASA in many instances. His character did not seem professional in his conduct at all but rather a nuisance many times. I also found the film very depressing and full of despair, especially Bullock's character who had lost her 4 year old daughter in a tragic death on earth sometime before the mission. I could not help but wonder why her character with such an emotionally disturbing event would be chosen to be on this mission. She seemed to panic a lot and to be totally unprepared for emergencies. I expected much more drama and tension in the story arch, it seemed way out of balance with too much emphasis on negativity, loss and not enough hope to keep the viewer sustained. The script needed much better development and dialogue before shooting the film. It is a shame Gravity was made in a half baked manner without being carefully thought out and planned. It could have been MUCH, MUCH BETTER!"
"jimgigs","1","3","7","18 July 2014"," One of worst movies I've ever seen
","Gravity is so bad on so many levels that I have lost all respect for the Oscars as a critical film institution for nominating it for best picture. First of all the acting is almost comical, George clooney basically plays George clooney floating around in space for the first 15 minutes or so until he floats off into space, sacrificing himself so Sandra bullock can live. Where's the barf bucket??? That's what I was thinking. Then Sandra bullock basically grunts and groans as she whirls around thru space, surviving impossible situations. One scenario more absurd than the next. At least if some kind of connection was made thru a back story of some sort, you may care about whether she lived or died. I heard this film compared to castaway, but it was not close. Castaway actually had a storyline and a plot that allowed you as a viewer to have some sort of connection with tom hanks character. Gravity is basically a class in special effects. No story, no dialogue, no nothing, just a realistic looking view from outer space. Go to Epcot and ride the mission space ride, the storyline to that 3 minute ride is more advanced than the plot of this dreck, plus you can actually feel like your in outer space instead of just getting a view of it from your couch."

","it's nonsensical to speak of spoilers with a movie like that... but i want to try and ""spoil"" the potential follow up of this, too.<br/><br/>anyway, i think after she makes it safe and sound to earth(or water) and the movie ends with her rejoicing about being onshore she should be happy about more than her miraculous survival: her mission (as i perceived it) to destroy as much space technology as possible and produce lots and lots of space debris is crowned with success. on top of that she presumably lands in the middle of nowhere which gives her an advantage making her escape. maybe gravity 2 could be about dealing with the aftermath of her endeavors while simultaneously making it a cool story about a woman on the run from the officials? her character would have to be completely different though, let's say: altered by several near death experiences, which is why she stopped being whiny and stupid. of course this is not the most convincing development, but hey, better than many were in part 1! also the viewer would benevolently accept it seeing that it is necessary to get the story going - the story about a tough strong woman laughing her persecutors in the face, kinda road-movie-ish. feel free to use my ideas, gravity people! you're welcome.<br/><br/>as for my critique: i'd agree with the reviews that illustrate the uncanny stupidity of the script, be it scientifically or character-wise. honestly, it's easier to feel irritated by them than empathy towards them. the lowest moment i'd say was when she enee-menee-mood the Chinese control panels... ... i would have been outraged, had it not been for my emotional detachedness from the story. oh yeah, obviously the script fails ""politically"" as well but i don't feel like elaborating on that now. the review is too long as it is. the unbearable banality of the soundtrack and two in my opinion mediocre actors wrap it all up neatly. -the visuals are nice though.<br/><br/>but there Is something to compliment the movie on: despite its lack of brains it still manages to be self-referential. the plot about producing space debris beautifully hommages this movie's making!"

","The film Gravity is awful because:<br/><br/>The dialogue between the characters is unrealistic. The characters themselves are unrealistic. You find yourself wondering why the lead character was allowed on the mission in the first place.<br/><br/>Then the real problems start. The physics is all wrong! ALL OF IT! The film is so heavily based around bastardised physics that it becomes unwatchable. The reason for this is that most of the events which occur in the film would never occur in real life. This film is supposed to be a thriller/drama/realistic horror? Yet it can be neither of these things. There is no realism in terms of the characters, their interaction between one another, the ""geography"" of space, or the science upon which the whole film is based. The lack of realism in a film that depends on it for its narrative and genre means that it loses all credibility and thus fails altogether.<br/><br/>Also, why call a film ""Gravity"" when as far as the astronauts are concerned, there is effectively none of it. Indeed, my repulsion to this film is far stronger than the micro-gravity that wouldn't be experienced by the astronauts because it would be too small to notice. One can only presume that they subconsciously called it gravity, on account of how weak it is. It is afterall, the weakest of the forces. Which is why Starwars is so much better."
"user-543-975655","10","3","7","8 March 2014"," 7 Oscars? That's It?
","Sure, 7 Oscars is a lot, but still, only 7? I was on the edge of my seat for the last 2/3 of the movie. I agree with many people in the fact that this the future of cinema. So many films could be inspired off of this one, because it creates so many ideas to build off of, even though I hope that doesn't happen. If you don't like this movie, you need to watch it again. I'm sure you'll like it more if you do so. Think what it would be like, people, if you were floating in space, without any knowledge of whether or not you are going to make it back to Earth. Cuaron (Alfonso) brings that experience to life as realistically as possible while you are just sitting in a seat. This movie had all of the qualities that I (and a lot of other people) look for in a movie in space. Steady camera angles, mind-blowing special effects, breath-taking zero-G environments, brilliantly realistic space shuttles, exhilarating action sequences, and thrilling backgrounds and such. That just covers the special effects. The acting in this movie is unparalleled, and will likely not ever be duplicated. Yeah, it's that good. Bullock and Clooney are so emotionally involved that you feel you are actually with them when you are watching. You might, anyway. They are a dynamic duo in this movie. If there had been anyone else in either role, the movie wouldn't have been nearly as good. There are so many things flying around in this movie that you have to watch it several times to just notice half of it. For that, I can understand why it won best special effects of the year. The movie is not only intense in the sense of action, but it is also very emotionally intense at times, and it can almost bring tears to your eyes if you are sensitive enough. The script is really very clever, because even though for a portion of the film there is only one character, the writers somehow kept a lot of words thrown in there. Sandra Bullock talks to herself a lot, and by doing that, keeps the viewer informed on what is happening. She explains everything she is doing to herself, out loud, and without this, the viewer would have no idea what was happening. The score of this movie does not seem like it would fit with the actual movie, because it is so subtle and not very intense. However, it is one of the most awe-inspiring and inspirational themes I have ever heard. I can understand why it won best original score. It is also spine tingling if you are involved enough, because there are some deeply fantastic vocalizations included. There was a goof I found. At the beginning, it says there is nothing to carry sound. But the whole movie has small sounds thrown here and there outside of the shuttles and in space. Unless the sound waves are bouncing off of the shuttle, and that is what we are hearing. I don't know. It all still sounded really, very cool. The director and writers of this movie are cinema geniuses. That is because they extended a very short story up to 91 minutes (minus the credits, so about 85), and they still didn't make it at all dull. That is a pure stroke of genius in the cinema world. Even the opening scene with the facts about how extreme space is is masterfully crafted. I don't know how, but it is. There is also some humor thrown in on the side of things, which makes the movie even more enjoyable, if that is possible. In conclusion, this is a white-knuckle roller coaster that will have you on the edge of your seat until the end. Thanks for reading this review, especially because I went 1.5 months without writing one. See ya!"
"drmnc1","1","3","7","4 March 2014"," Gravity. It gets you down. This film certainly does.
","This film is not even worthy of a review, but in protest to yet another railroaded Oscars, I have been compelled enough to write this, to warn people about the dreariness of Gravity, and voice my incredulity how this undeserving film ever got a rating of 8.2. NONPLUSSED is probably the best way to describe how I feel about Gravity, and not I a good way.<br/><br/>Taking on the ""stellar"" reviews this film has had, I decided to go and see what all the hype was for myself. It now has the unremarkable accolade of being one of the very few films I have ever walked out on in my life. <br/><br/>People complain about this film being scientifically inaccurate, but that is besides the point. This film is boring. BORING. Nothing remotely interesting, surprising or thrilling happened at all. Chomping your way through a loaf of plain brown bread is less tedious than this. It is just George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as two astronauts floating in space while being battered by debris storms that they can precisely predict when they are going to happen. Not only is this film tedious, they want to sap away any sense of suspense too. George got bored halfway in and decided to leave, and I took his example, and ejected myself from the theatre too soon after. Sandra reading an instruction manual from a foreign abandoned space station with no effort was the last straw for me.<br/><br/>This film left me fuming. Not only was I angry that I had wasted an hour of my life before I saw this film for what is was (garbage), But also I knew that this film would shoot to fame and ubiquity. Gravity does not even deserve 1 star. It probably doesn't even deserve 0. How this excuse for entertainment, how this Gravity has shot to critical acclaim and won a handful of Oscars is completely beyond me. Then again, if a film only has 1 or 2 actors in it throughout the majority of the film, it is automatically and mindlessly showered with praise and awards - see The Life of Pi, 127 Hours and other similar trash. Everything about it is terrible. It doesn't deserve a single minute of your time. At least they were actually bearable enough for me to make it to the end.<br/><br/>The list of dubious winners of Oscars from previous years is endless, but even they are better, and that really is saying something. Unfortunately, this year, the Awards have been disgraced by this detritus. I cannot say how indescribably cheated and annoyed I feel about this film. And nonplussed. I just hope you have the sense to give up on it long before I did."

If you have a chance at watching the other Oscars winner movies. Watch the other ones. This one is not worth the money. Or your time, too pointless and boring. Only thing that was good in this movie was Sandra Bullock. Not because she did an Oscar worthy performance, but because she stood out. She at least tried. And why did it win two Oscars for sound mixing and editing. The people who decides these things must be high. Or this movie has something that clearly, only a few people like.

","If this movie was fantasy, or set in another universe, or science and realism were just brushed to the side, I could enjoy it. But it's not. It's a movie that depends on its realism, focuses on it, and utterly fails at it.<br/><br/>First, high school physics. From the basic premise, to the minute to minute action, to the conclusion, this movie depends on physics. And one thing this movie fails at completely, is physics. Both the initiating event and the final heroic sacrifice are completely unsupportable and end up being annoying and distracting rather than emotional because of it. <br/><br/>The movie also fails at the geography of space, putting objects thousands of miles away within spitting distance; in fact the initial premise of the movie depends on this failed geography, two objects thousands of miles away from each other being in exactly the same orbit.<br/><br/>And then they set up the main character as a nearly untrained, emotionally disturbed woman without any special skills. There is never a convincing reason given for her being there. The qualifications for being a fully mission integrated astronaut are exacting, and the only way I can see anyone getting around them would be as a PR stunt, or if someone was a top level expert who would be valuable to the mission in some special way. So far as we can tell, she's not a PR stunt, and she's not a mission critical expert. She's just there. And after sticking her there for no apparent reason, the movie depends on her inexperience and lack of training to add tension and advance the story.<br/><br/>It's ridiculous. I find it completely impossible to take the movie seriously, when it seems every plot point turns on something unbelievably unrealistic.<br/><br/>The high budget, a-list actors, and high quality special effects make it watchable... but nothing could make it enjoyable."

After 45 years, 2001 still looks much better, and I mean just visually, let alone all the rest.<br/><br/>Sorry, it's not enough for me, I also need a good script, good character development, an actual story, a damn reason why you would want to watch a movie or even produce it.<br/><br/>Half of this movie is just close-ups of Sandra Bullock's oversized chin while she moans, 15 minutes of her praying, I find all that unacceptable."

","From seeing the trailers of Gravity I knew that this was one of the movies that I'd had to see. And boy was I pleased with that decision. I decided to see the 2D-version due to my use of glasses. Maybe I'll take my changes with the 3D-version later.<br/><br/>From the first second you know that Gravity is not your ordinary space movie. The long non-stop scenes where the camera is fluently floating between the actors and the space station are breathtaking. U actually feel like your out there with Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney. The unexpected space trash warning (result of some Russian satellite been destroyed) starts a chain of events that glue you to your seat for the rest of the movie. I had to cover my face with my hand more than one occasion.<br/><br/>Gravity is a survival movie that just happens to take place 225 miles above sea level :) The acting is spotless. Bullock delivers a great performance as an engineer that faces tough decisions regarding her life. Clooney's character as an experienced astronaut comes evident. The lite jokes while facing certain death are some what humorous and sad at the same time. <br/><br/>If I started to think about the realism of the actual events happening that would just ruin the experience(for me anyway). I try to enjoy movies as a neutral party and most of the time that works just fine."
"intspin","4","3","7","7 February 2014"," Little verisimilitude, too much suspension of disbelief required, boring, not intellectually stimulating
","I had very high hopes for this film - due to reviews from both industry critics and lay-people. I'm sorely disappointed. Caveat - I saw this film on an airplane.<br/><br/>The one of the main problems lies in that there is insufficient verisimilitude to compensate for the required suspension of disbelief (e.g. believable characters compensating for poor storyline or vice versa). It's not particularly thrilling nor gripping either. There are also weakly saccharine aspects to this film, which, I suppose, was meant to be subtle human interest. I can't account for the visuals since I saw this film on an airplane. <br/><br/>I thought the characterisation was very poor - I did not feel engaged, neither positively nor negatively, with either of the two main protagonists. Perhaps you need to be from the United States to do so. Given the back story of the characters, there could be so much more. The way that the protagonists back stories impinge upon their characters is very crude, there's little subtlety and nuance. I did not believe that the characters could be real, nor are they interesting, and I felt minimal empathy with them.<br/><br/>The poor characterisation could be compensated by the storyline - I did not find it interesting nor trilling nor gripping nor believable. Again, so much more could have been made of this aspect. <br/><br/>I did not find the film intellectually stimulating. Often, I go away from a film thinking about particular aspects that are posed or suggested. There's little in this film that did this for me (apart from being irritated that I could have been sleeping instead). <br/><br/>The film is so bland that it's akin to being spoon-fed weak saccharine solution. Perhaps other reviewers were distracted by the visuals, which I did not have the benefit of enjoying to the full. As for the reviews from within the industry, I can only surmised that there must be some self-congratulatory aspect clouding judgment. The two main actors are not usually known for this type of film - for the actors to perform in a mediocre way against type must have seemed like a great achievement. It might well be - but that goes to show that the wrong actors were chosen for the roles."

","Gravity is about as perfect of a film as I've seen in quite some time. It delivered on all levels - Script, acting, cinematography, and symbolism.<br/><br/>The script was nearly flawless...It was nicely-paced, had structure with obvious turning points, and gave us just enough comic relief from its truly incredible level of suspense. My only beef, and this is minor, I think the audience could've have used some additional exposition between Harris, Clooney and Bullock to help us better understand the origination of the threat.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock deserves every ounce of accolade she's received thus far. She wonderfully gave us Ryan Stone - who began as a brilliant, but morose astronaut, and finished as an inspiration. However, Bullock couldn't of given us Stone without George Clooney as Matt Kowalski. The two had amazing chemistry.<br/><br/>The cinematography was groundbreaking. If you ever want to know what it feels like to be in space, watch this film.<br/><br/>Although it was not as allegorical as ""2001"", it contained enough symbolism to give the film depth and meaning.

"nooneishome747","8","3","7","19 January 2014"," The modern 2001: A Space Odyssey
","Despite the phrase ""In space, no one can hear you scream"" being taken by Alien, a movie that would better suit this phrase is Gravity. The tension of being alone in an uninhabitable environment is perfectly captured here. Heck, there is even a moment which can only be described with that phrase (more on that later).<br/><br/>Before I go any further, I want to say that Alfonso Cuaron has concocted a modern Sci-Fi masterpiece that utilizes tension and emotion at every conceivable turn. When I first glanced at the run-time, I almost balked (because I'm used to 2 hour-plus movies). However, Cuaron manages to make the most out of every single second on screen. Not since Alien have I seen a Sci-Fi film this pulse-pounding. A huge credit to Cuaron (on a further note, I still need to see Children of Men) can be given to the seemingly immaculate camera-work at display here. Almost every shot is one of pure wonder.<br/><br/>In fact, Cuaron's direction results in an outstanding performance from Sandra Bullock (who I admittedly had not really cared for). It is a performance that evokes the independence of Ripley from Alien at some points, an intense sense of fear/nervousness at other junctions, and an undeniable lust for life at even more routes. It is truly a masterfully executed role that should receive an Oscar.<br/><br/>For most movies, the visual effects are used to cover up weakness in the writing, acting, or direction. However, this is not the case with Gravity as the special effects enhance an already-strong movie. Giant effects extravaganzas such as the chaotic mass of debris striking the satellites may provide eye candy, but they also serve to exasperate the dire situation that Dr. Stone is in. Yet, the film also impresses with the little details. For example, Dr. Stone must escape the ISS due to a fire, but one scene earlier, you can clearly see sparks (or loose flames) off in the shot, creating foreshadowing.<br/><br/>Stephen Prices's Original Score captures all the right notes. For much of the movie, the score captures a distinctly minimalist feel, but it is a feel that accentuates the already tense film. In fact, much can be said of a soundtrack that manages to create tension from a moment where all sound is abruptly cut off (such as when Dr. Stone hallucinates Matt entering the shuttle). However, an equally glorious contrast late in the film create a fitting sense of finality whenever 's is re- entering the atmosphere. If decided the Oscars, this would get Best Original Score.<br/><br/>Throughout the entirety of the movie's duration, I could not help but be reminded of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The isolation, vastness, and emptiness of space are appropriately documented in both films and both films contain (for their respective eras) fantastic special effects. However, Gravity feels like a tighter, more polished experience that can be appreciated as a film-goer's film. 2001, however is a movie that is all about atmosphere, which renders it harder for the modern viewer to appreciate (I do enjoy 2001, just so you know). Whichever film is better is all a matter of personal opinion, but now we have two great movies about isolation in deep space."

After the first entry on the cons list this movie unravels faster than a cheap sweater. It doesn't just defy the laws of physics, it hits them over the head and buries them in a shallow grave. I would have totally overlooked the physics problems and even the overly sentimental 'therapy chair in space' theme if they hadn't built the whole film on the premise that Russians are morons. That nugget of racism bugged me from the moment it was introduced and made me feel like I was being hit over the head with a blunt instrument of propaganda.<br/><br/>I went into the cinema expecting something good, perhaps even great (considering the buzz) and in the end I left (before the movie finished, which was a first for me) with buyer's remorse and a lingering feeling of extreme aggravation."

"peterp-450-298716","4","3","7","4 January 2014"," Space Hype !
","In visual terms ""Gravity"" is overwhelming with those images of the Earth. The infinity and immensity of the universe is beautifully put into the picture . The insignificance of man in this intolerable environment gives you a constant tightness . However, I think that you only get that overwhelming feeling when you watch this movie in the cinema. On a normal LCD TV in the living room there's not much left of this space spectacle. And that's quite a damper on the expected experience because the story on its own isn't really that much of a deal. I think it's a great achievement to create such an entertaining film with this simple story and only two characters constantly on the screen.<br/><br/>I sat almost the entire movie on the edge of the sofa cause of the tension. The movie has a surprisingly fast pace. It's one situation after the other . But if you omit the stunning CGI and forget about the probably impressive 3D images , there remains nothing else than a boring tedious blockbuster. And they made such a big fuss about it. A big hype over nothing, my guess. Reading roughly through the remarks at IMDb I'm not the only one with that idea. I also found it disturbing that someone can be so unlucky in just one day . Chronologically all this happens: the shuttle gets hit by debris resulting in some casualties and one person (Bullock) floating in space, she's picked up again by Clooney , but is almost without oxygen , with his thruster pack they go on their way to the ISS , they smash into it and Clooney releases himself heroically to rescue Bullock, almost choking she enters the ISS , a fire breaks out and she has to disconnect the Soyuz , the Soyuz gets tangled to a parachute, the ISS is destroyed by debris , the Soyuz has no fuel , Bullock uses the burners for landing, she reaches the Chinese space station using a fire extinguisher , goes into the atmosphere , and even though she doesn't understand Chinese she lands safely by randomly pressing the right buttons. That's not enough though. She almost drowns also after the landing . It wouldn't be a surprise she'll never ever join a space trip again in her life.<br/><br/>Although the two main actors are not the least , they can't make the film look better. Sandra Bullock didn't convince me as being a scientist with high intellect . She looked more like a Miss America who won a space trip . Clooney was so extremely charming and gallant in space. I expected every moment that he would serve a delicious Nespresso. And then realizing that the making of this empty movie needed $ 100 million. They could have made a few better movies with that kind of money. And I won't mention the technical and scientific impossibilities as they are described by a NASA expert on Wikipedia. But OK, otherwise it would be a even more boring and dead serious flick .And it should be entertaining, not ? Unlike many other spectators, I didn't think the moment where Ryan starts barking and howling like a dog was ridiculous or silly.For me it was rather a touching moment.<br/><br/>Conclusion : a gem in imaging, but as space itself , it is an airless story. It feels more like a black hole."
"Robin_clarke41","4","3","7","3 January 2014"," Not deserving of the glowing reviews
","When I first saw the trailer for Gravity I thought it looked OK, not amazing, just OK. Then I started to hear the hype. Critics were throwing around praise like 'One of the sci-fi greats' and 'simply stunning'.. Then I looked on IMDb and saw that it had a score of 8.4! To put it into perspective that's almost as high as James Cameron's Aliens. Surely this movie was something very special? Now that I have seen it I can safely say that it is not special. Not special and quite frankly not very good. Sandra Bullock is exceptionally annoying in her role as the marooned space damsel in distress. Her constant whining and panicking is not at all in line with the excellent and comprehensive training provided by NASA. There should also be an award for the biggest waste of a Hollywood A lister in a movie for George Clooney. He kind of floats around a bit with some very irritating and badly written dialogue and then floats away like some kind of space moron if you will. His character just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>The movie had a very plodding and clumsy feel to it. The pacing was all wrong, it was only 90 minutes long but the dullness and tedium of it all made it feel like double that. I was checking my watch 20 mins in which I rarely do for such big movies. OK I'll give the filmmakers some credit as realistically portraying someone being stuck in space is not easy to do. My problem with it is that they just didn't do it very well. No build up of tension, no fear, no concern for the plight of our heroine.<br/><br/>I also feel I should address the ridiculously bloated IMDb score. I know it's each to their own about how movies should be rated but 8.4 for this? Seriously? All I can think of is either that the producers paid people to post fake reviews or Sandra/George have some very loyal fans. Bitterly disappointing."

Great story, though a bit formulaic at times, and relies quite a bit on luck, still it stays on track once things get going, and keeps you tied to Bullock's lead completely. I recommend this one all the way. There is no real violence, though there is a very gory scene early on that could really upset some folks it's not bloody.

","OK, first, I know I am late to the party. This movie is in it's 11th week now. But I usually don't go the to movies anymore. For no apparent reason I stopped after ""Avatar"" (before all the hype). Then tried it again with the latest Die Hard which was a big mistake. But after Mark Kermode (BBC's loudest voice against 3D) said one has to see that at the theaters and further more in 3D I decided to give it a chance. Usually I see my movies on Blu Ray where I can control my environment. Luckily this showing of ""Gravity"" was quite pleasant despite one woman laughing at really inappropriate times, OK that's enough story let's get to the movie. Of course by this point it has been hyped beyond the moon with many pointing out it's opening scene. So of course I was sitting on hot stones waiting for the movie to start. And let's just say the opening scene went far beyond anything I could even imagine. This scene made Avatar look like a youtube video filmed on an iPhone. After that the story develops pretty fast. Their ship is hit by a lot of debris and rendered useless. So they try to make their way to the ISS. Luckily in this one instance the trailer didn't tell us much of anything because it made it look like Bullock would be lost in space with Clooney looking for her which was not the case at all. Clooney is actually out of the picture pretty soon and from there on we get to witness Bullock alone on her journey back to earth. I loved that they didn't include any unnecessary side stories or anything like that. The movie focuses on the problem at hand and how to handle it. I was really at the edge of my seat the whole time which about 80% of my brain devoted to the movie and the other 20% thinking: How the hell did they make this movie? It seems so real. Should this be this years best picture? Yes it should.

The 3D is absolutely brilliant, my personal favorites were the zero-g effects, the light effects, and *spoiler* the ISS destruction *end*. The story is good, and I honestly didn't feel bored at any point during the movie. Bullock gave an excellent performance, as did Clooney, but I wanted to see more of him than Bullock. But I have to say that the most impressive aspects of the film are it's effects, direction, and cinematography. It's hard to find a flaw in it's technical side.

Much like the Mona Lisa with a crayon beard, it's a glaring juxtaposition that makes for one obnoxiously aggravating viewing experience. A film I might watch again in the theater, but next time I'm bringing a set of earplugs.<br/><br/>*spoilers ahead* <br/><br/>So here's how it goes down: Opening scene, spacewalk. Bullock is performing some interesting looking work on the Hubble, which they never bother to explain. Clooney is floating around wasting his thruster pack fuel for no reason and a third astronaut is bouncing around also detracting from the mission. Then all of a sudden Russia destroys one of its own satellites with a missile, NASA tells Bullock & Clooney everything is fine, nothing to worry about. Then, literally three minutes later they recontact saying the destroyed satellite has caused a ""chain reaction"" of destruction and the debris is now minutes away and heading right towards the shuttle! Abort Mission! What?!?? That's ridiculous.<br/><br/>Gravity? A reference both to the characteristics of motion in an orbital environment and the weighty nature of the situation these two find themselves in. Pretty deep, but I think a more apt title would be ""George Clooney and Sandra Bullock's Wacky Outer Space Adventure - starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as themselves."" Both are unconvincing as professional astronauts, plot revelations are thrown into the film with no attempt at subtlety or reality. For example, need to establish where Sandra Bullock is from? Why not have George Clooney just ask her, like an hour into the film, where she ""pitches her tent""? How about her personal life? Have him ask if there's a Mr. so-and-so! I'll tell you why not: two astronauts, who would have no doubt spent a very long time training together on Earth and then be crammed together in the space shuttle with literally no privacy would have broached these water cooler icebreaker topics in their first hour together. The interpersonal dialogue throughout has all the depth of two people that just met on a bus. Ugh.<br/><br/>From that point on this film couldn't have been more formulaic if it had been produced for a Disneyland motion ride with a C3PO narrator. Set your watch folks, in seven minutes there will be another improbable action sequence followed by more of Sandra Bullock's lame emotional odyssey followed by another explosion.<br/><br/>Some have been commenting on the recurring theme of spiritual rebirth peppering the film. Again, just thrown together without any attempt at subtlety. Sandra Bullock curls up into an ultrasound perfect fetal position complete with an oxygen tether umbilical cord floating cast against a suspiciously uterine-looking airlock through which she was just birthed into a second chance at life? Give me a break. Or how about the scene where she was resigning herself to death in the Soyuz and the last transmission she receives is from a foreign ham radio operator with a crying baby in the background? And what's worse they couldn't even leave it at that, she has to say (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""Oh! A baby, neat-o! I'm dying and someone else is being born, life goes on ob-la-di ob-la-da!"" Alright, she didn't say that, but she was thinking it.<br/><br/>The only scene that caught me by surprise was Clooney's reappearance at the capsule window near the end. The obvious was to make it an oxygen deprived delusion, but given the preceding 75 minutes I gave it a 50/50 chance that the writer would actually have him just miraculously re-appear with no explanation. Well, credit where credit is due and I doff my hat to the writer for having not done that at least.<br/><br/>And now for the insensitive and inappropriately aggressive commentary befitting an online amateur review: You know how after watching Apollo 13 you walked away thinking ""man, if I'm ever in trouble in space I sure hope Tom Hanks is around."" We'd all prefer Jim Lovell of course, but Tom Hanks the actor would do in a pinch. Well, after seeing this film, if I ever find myself in trouble in space with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock my first instinct will be to smother both of them to save oxygen."

","Now it is going to be hard to review ""Gravity"" without letting slip any spoilers. Yet i believe i have done an excellent job of it.<br/><br/>Gravity unlike any other Alfonso Cuar√≥n film has broken all the box office records except for ""Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban"", which also mind you screams ""ALFONSO"" in every frame. To be honest it deserves all the success.<br/><br/>To even begin to imagine how Alfonso went about conceptualizing the idea and the ""screenplay"" for this film boggled me to no end. Reason being some scenes being so engrossing and that he actually knows on what part of the frame the audience are going to focus. That he goes for a bokeh in scenes which you would least expect it, yet they are so bang on that you would not realize it a second too soon.<br/><br/>So Alfonso deserves a double thumbs up.<br/><br/>Coming to dissecting the actors performances Sandra Bullock is the ""man of the hour"". Very few actors have been given an opportunity to shine like Bullock has been and she does 147% justice to it. She has succeeded in invoking pathos for her character which is of a very common insecure woman who has seen her fair share of problems in life. It grips you when the actor is so accomplished in her trade to point of passive dexterity. Enough said.<br/><br/>The genius of Gravity lies in spinning a most terrific tale of Space travel which is so fragile and beautiful that it connects on a subconscious level. Lucky is the director to have been able to envisage and be able to exploit the concept of helplessness of man in space so amazingly before anybody else was able to do it.<br/><br/>Gravity in the years to come will achieve a kind of cult status nevertheless yet it will never be as popular as space sagas like Star Wars series or Superhero movies like Dark Knight trilogy. Because it lacks in star power and pre-release hype which the other movies got. The way this movie will grow on you will surprise you to no end. Yet if the director or anybody do decide to make a sequel to this film whether it turns out or be good or bad, i think it will be a sacrilege to the film and they deserve no forgiveness. That is the respect which i have for films like this, which are in a class of their own, <br/><br/>Myself being an avid amateur astronomer the movie spoke to me at a very deep level. Hope everyone enjoys this film like i have. Watch it when you have a weekday to kill with a fellow movie buff or watch it on a weekend with all the fanfare and a large group of friends, It doesn't matter because you will love it anyhow."

","Remember how you felt a bit sick after Blair Witch? Two of the 4 of us in my party were sick after the first 15 minutes. So much spinning and twisting,spinning and twisting. This was a disappointing Bullock flick.Her dialogue was inane and trite. Clooney was OK, also trite, but a bit funny too. The CGI was well done, borrowed from the Hubble documentary. It was very frustrating to see Bullock appear so unqualified, how did she get on this mission? Other questions came to mind: what does NASA do to prepare mission participants for the problems that may occur?Does it send them there when they admittedly fail the practice tests? Do crew members have no idea who their ship mates are and have no knowledge of their personal lives? When I wasn't sick from the constant spinning I was waiting and waiting for Bullock to make it to another station ...in slow motion.Thank goodness Clooney told Bullock she had something to live for, so she could finally show some spine and stop whining. We waited for the plot to begin, and then it was over..we looked at each other and said ""That was it???"" We thought Melissa McCarthy should show up ,that might have helped."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","3","7","17 October 2013"," Visually great, story-wise fine as well
","Gravity is Alfonso Cuar√≥n's first feature movie in seven years. He got help here with the screenplay from his son Jon√°s and also from the film's co-star George Clooney, one of only two actors we see in the film. The other is Sandra Bullock as the undisputed lead and there's occasionally some voice acting, by Ed Harris and others. Harris' inclusion may or may not have to do with his fine work in ""Apollo 13"". The story is summarized very quickly: Bullock and Clooney end up in an accident in space and are confronted with the difficult task of making it back to Earth alive.<br/><br/>My favorite section of the film was definitely the first 30 minutes. It's basically that part of the film where Clooney and Bullock share the screen and Clooney elevates those scenes considerably. His critics say he always gets typecast and only shows the same shtick over and over again. (Strangely, for other actors, that is considered smart role selection.) I strongly disagree. He almost always gives multilayered performances and is rarely overshadowed by somebody else in the cast acting-wise although he's been in films with almost all the big names. And let's not forget how he's been writing, directing and producing quality films for a long time. No surprise he's the Academy's darling right now and deservedly so. He's also the best thing about this movie, together with the visual aspects of course. This film could very well dominate these categories at the Oscars and it looks like Emmanuel Lubezki could finally end up with his first Oscar. Anyway, I wrote before that the first half of the movie is my favorite and that's true, mainly because of Clooney who totally nails his lighter scenes (taking away the tension) as well as his dramatic work after the accident. Another reason is that in there we basically see people out in space all the time and it's just mesmerizingly beautiful. If it had gone on like that, this would certainly be my new favorite film of 2013. Unfortunately it didn't, but it's still in my top5.<br/><br/>When it turns into a one-woman show by Bullock, after Clooney drifts into space (the only scene that had my eyes kinda wet), it gets a bit worse, but still not really bad. Bullock is basically making her way through ships, shuttles and space stations and at some point it just got less interesting when she fell again and some mechanism failed again and the alarm went off again etc. and at some point I just stopped being interested in what was wrong now. It also certainly didn't help that she's not my favorite actress really and this film could not make me see the light on her. There were scenes like the howling, which could have been so great if performed differently, it just didn't engage me at all. Same goes for the scene in whhhich she discovers that there's no more fuel and keeps going ""You gotta be kidding me."" There I almost cringed. Clooney's short reappearance later on wasn't on par with his early scenes either, although it was still better than most from the second half of the film as those scenes that included references to Bullock's life, or lack thereof, were still emotionally superior to her pure fight for survival. The writing was another strength of the film. When it was good, it was really good and the message behind the film could certainly motivate someone to get out of a hole they've been in for way too long.<br/><br/>Finally, about the ending, let me say that I may have preferred a different, unhappy outcome. Sure it may have been a bummer to some, but the final scene on the beach did not hit me as hard emotionally or made me as ecstatic as I'd have hoped for and it could still convey the aforementioned message strongly if she had only almost made it. Actually it would have been an interesting symbolism if she had managed to survive in space, but not survive on Earth when the water entered her cabin for example. Or maybe go for a bit of an open ending with credits rolling in right before the crucial moment when we see if she will live or die. Anyway, even with these criticisms, it's a well-written, visually enthralling film with a good story line. I'm really surprised so many actresses passed before Bullock got the part. I personally believe I might have enjoyed it more with somebody else in the lead, but it was still a good effort by her. Gravity comes close to a must-watch. Very much recommended."

","The movie was not only scientifically inaccurate, but also extremely boring. I forced myself to sit through the entire movie, hoping to get some entertainment value and justification for having spent my time and money on this worthless piece of s***. Somewhere in the middle, I actually lost track of the storyline from one scene to the next, especially when Bullock enters the Russian spaceship to her 'riveting' journey back to the Earth. Maybe, Gravity would've felt about average (rating of 5) in another time and place, but having just watched 'Rush' before watching this movie, didn't help at all. Don't quite get the overall rating > 5 for this movie. Sandra Bullock was annoying to the point of being obnoxious. My hopes and expectations had initially rested on George Clooney, who turned out to have only a 'special appearance' in the film. My recommendation would be to not waste your time, money or both to watch this movie in the theaters. Wait for a DVD or something, if you're desperate."

The movie other than being a visual marvel of massive proportions delivers an amazing journey with the only two characters played by the amazing Sandra Bullock and the astounding George Clooney, I wouldn't say it was the performance of their careers but definitely one of their best performances ever.<br/><br/>The film score by Steven Price hits just the right notes at the right times and complements the visual experience by a climactic auditory ... orgasm!

"CinemaClown","Null","3","7","14 October 2013"," 3D or Not... Either Way Gravity Is Going To Be One Hell of An Experience.
","Surpassing all hype & expectations with finesse, exhibiting excellence in nearly all aspects of filmmaking & making exceptional use of its third dimension, Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity is a cinematic spacewalk of jaw-dropping beauty, wonder & amazement that not only succeeds as one of the best films of its year but is a marvel of technical filmmaking that pushes the cinematic art form to new realms while also marking a huge leap for VFX in cinema.<br/><br/>Set in space, Gravity tells the story of mission specialist Ryan Stone aboard a NASA space shuttle on her very first assignment which is being supervised by a veteran astronaut out on his final mission. Disaster strikes when the high-speed debris of a defunct satellite destroys their spaceship, thus leaving the two stranded in space with nothing but each other. Rest of the story focuses on Stone's journey as she finds hope & will to survive in the face of imminent death.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Gravity presents the notable filmmaker at the very peak of his so-far-illustrious career for he's taken a simple setting of a catastrophe, applied it in space, refined it with precision detailing & accurate science, intertwined each aspect with liberal arts and finally encapsulated the whole picture with the third dimension to provide a breathtaking experience of sheer awe & astonishment while the core content also deals with the themes of loss, isolation, resilience, mortality & rebirth in a concise manner.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, Gravity is a triumph in every department. Starting with Cinematography, Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work introduces some new inventions in 3D photography and employs the long, continuous & unbroken single takes with sublime effectiveness to immerse the viewers into its world. And with the help of its fluid movements & contrasting shots, which seamlessly blends the warm imagery of Earth with bleakness of the rest of space, also does a fab job in narrating the plot visually.<br/><br/>Editing trims the whole narrative down to 90 minutes which is expertly paced although there are a few moments in the middle when it feels like hitting a snag but that's only for a short duration & doesn't really hurt the whole experience. The silence of outer space does serve as accurate science to a considerable extent but it never stopped Steven Price to come up with a spectacular score that ultimately turned this already effective thriller into an absolute nightmare of escalating terror with its loud, intense & unsparing tracks.<br/><br/>Apart from its two actors, almost everything in this film is computer-generated and yet the crisp images retain such high degree of realism with its authentic depiction of zero gravity, spacewalks, explosions along with geographic view of Earth, solar reflections & many other elements that it further signifies the careful attention with which the whole production was carried out and on an overall scale marks a huge step for VFX in cinema. Add to that, even the Sound aspect is nicely taken care of & exists only where it needs to.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, there are only two characters we interact with in this narrative, actually one for the majority of its runtime. Now I'm not a fan of Sandra Bullock yet here I was quite enamoured by her vulnerable character who goes through plethora of emotions ranging from fear, frustration & hopelessness to rediscovered resilience, willingness to live & eventual spiritual reincarnation. Supporting her briefly is George Clooney in a tailor-made role that also provided little comic relief in what is an unforgiving & harrowing depiction of life in vacuum.<br/><br/>Throughout its runtime, Gravity also pays tribute to a number of space classics, including Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Ridley Scott's Alien, Ron Howard's Apollo 13 & surprisingly Pixar's WALL¬ïE as well. Although it is heavily influenced from many disaster films of the past, the very experience it provides, especially in 3D, is unlike anything put on screen before. The third dimension really adds a great amount of depth to its premise while amplifying the rest of the elements, thus turning it into something that feels all the more special & personal.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Gravity is a fascinating blend of cinematic art & big-screen spectacle that qualifies as the finest film of its year, is the closest we've come to experiencing outer space on silver screen, and is an incredibly riveting thriller that's totally worth your time & money. Outstandingly directed, finely written, brilliantly performed, cleverly edited, briskly paced, gorgeously photographed, magnificently scored & skilfully balancing all its elements from start to finish, Gravity is as rewarding an experience emotionally as it is viscerally, is deserving of all the praise it has garnered to date & is a must-watch on the biggest screen possible."

But the movie that absolutely leaves an impression is Gravity, and it is absolutely safe to say that it WILL be remembered during awards season.<br/><br/>We go along for one crazy roller coaster ride with Sandra Bullock who gives the performance of her career, even better then Blind Side (Oscar #2 anyone?). With her is the always reliable George Clooney who could also be noticed by the Academy (even though he also has Monuments Men).<br/><br/>Stepping away from the acting, the technology used to create the film does wonders plus one.

He assembled a crew that truly gave their all, and the finished project is beyond perfection.<br/><br/>The only thing i would warn people of is that the movie is quite stressful (my heart was in my throat throughout) and it has one shock scene that will catch a lot of people by surprise. And last but not least, if you get motion sickness, i suggest some Dramamine, because the movie is a lot of twisting-turning camera angles at warp speed.<br/><br/>But all in all, I was floored, stressed, but floored.<br/><br/>Bravo 10/10"
"jadepietro","10","3","7","9 October 2013"," One Helluva Ride Indeed
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>My review: Tag lines are a funny thing. Created by clever ad men, they lure the unexpected masses to their product with a few carefully chosen words that are usually misleading. Only on rare occasions are they ever accurate, especially in the hyperbole of the science fiction film genre. However some slogans do ring true. Stanley Kubrick's masterwork, 2001: A Space Odyssey, used ""The Ultimate Trip"" as its come-on. Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi thriller, Alien, had this tag line: ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" In Alfonso Cuar√≥n's exhilarating new film, Gravity, the catchphrase is just a three word message: ""Don't Let Go"". This film doesn't and for 90 gripping and tension-filled minutes, it takes us on a metaphysical journey in space where no one can hear you, except Mission Control in Houston. And this ultimate and dangerous trip is all the more frightening because of the dire lifelike isolation of a person set adrift and totally alone.<br/><br/>Gravity is grounded in realism. There are no extraterrestrial creatures or mystical interventions to contend with. The simplistic story is essentially a battle of survival concerning the sudden dangers of exploration and its daring space travelers caught in its stratosphere. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a first-time traveler and medical engineer and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is a wise-cracking veteran astronaut. Both are on a mission to repair parts of the satellite. While on a spacewalk, high speed debris destroys their spacecraft leaving them lost in space. (This event happens almost immediately once the film begins with an amazing opening tracking sequence of visual mastery that is absolutely breathtaking to behold. See it in 3-D IMAX for full effect.)<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n has been a strong director in his past efforts (Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men), but this film may be his masterpiece. His unique vision of outer space is haunting and poignant, rivaling Kubrick's earlier film. (Of course, technical advances have improved since the late 60's.) Cuar√≥n stresses a sense of dread and foreboding doom throughout the film which weighs heavily on the characters and the movie-going audience. His highly effective camera-work and compositions create powerful imagery that are unlike anything seen before it. His point of view and use of perspective, sometimes seen from inside the space helmet or in the claustrophobic space chambers, ratchets up the suspense. Cuar√≥n also co-edited and co-wrote the film's script with Mark Sanger and his son, Jon√°s Cuar√≥n, respectively. It's a concise and straightforward tale about tragic miscalculations and man's instinct for survival, although there are some plot contrivances at the journey's end.<br/><br/>The film swings from scenes of infinite beauty, using darkness and light and silence and sound which maximizes the tension. Images of remarkable grandeur continually fill the screen. The use of stylized movement and floating objects create an eerie and poetic impression from sudden tears suspended in mid air to a space traveler afloat striking an embryonic pose. (Kudos to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki for his stunning camera-work and to Steven Price's lively musical score, both of which contributed to the film's overall impact.) <br/><br/>While the technical aspects of the film are all top-notch, the film is essentially a standard and rather conventional two character drama. Creating that necessary emotional connection with the audience are Bullock and Clooney who are more than up to the task. Bullock projects the inner fear and strength needed for such a physically demanding role. Clooney uses his macho bravado and leading man charisma to great effect, masking the more sensitive and protective aspects beneath his character's surface. <br/><br/>Gravity deals directly with the issue of survival, of solitary confinement within our vast macro-cosmic universe. It is an epic film with stunning visual effects, masterful direction, and superb acting. This riveting film is a thoroughly intriguing and memorable movie-going experience and one of the best films of the year. <br/><br/>At one point in the film, an astronaut says about this space adventure, ""It's one helluva ride!"" Gravity surely is that and more. GRADE: A-<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"comicman117","10","3","7","8 October 2013"," An visual marvel and an intense thriller
","Alfonso Cuar√≥n's gravity is a gripping thriller that manages to pull you in (the tagline of the movie is Don't Let go). Gravity is a film that also takes advantage of its 3D. A film that for its short running time (90 minutes without credits) manages to scare me more than most recent horror movies I've seen. The film is real, and it's not afraid to show that.<br/><br/>The plot follows Dr. Ryan Stone a bio-medical engineer who is on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (who is on his last mission before his retirement). While on a spacewalk out, disaster strikes after a space debris from Russia causes a chain reaction of destruction, and they have to abort the mission. Things get worse when they lose contact with mission control. Left alone with just each other Stone and Kowalsky have to make it back to earth before they get sucked into the endless void of space.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes or so of gravity, is quiet, its just Bullock and Clooney talking to each other. The action kicks once their attacked by the space debris from Russia, and things get interesting. The plot of Gravity is very intense. I haven't seen a movie in a while that's gripped me as much as Gravity did. This is a serious story Although it's not the best female performance I've seen all year, Bullock is quite good. She manages to convince me that she really is lost in space, and I also felt for her character. I imagine if I was drifting in space alone, I'd probably go berserk, but Bullock as Ryan Stone manages to keep her cool, and her character progresses throughout. She starts out in the film panicking and screaming, but by the end she manages to keep her cool and I honestly believe she's stuck in space and trying to find her way home. George Clooney is basically playing himself, and he doesn't have a whole lot of screen time (this is essentially a one woman show, might have spoiled it for anyone who hasn't seen the film), but he's still fairly witty and manages to give some pretty decent one-liners.<br/><br/>The visuals are in Gravity are amazing. The opening shot of Earth is beautiful (or as the film likes to put it ""breathtaking""). The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is spectacular. We really get to see space, and the planet. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that showed space and earth quite as good as gravity did.<br/><br/>The 3D in Gravity is excellent as well. While Gravity is post-converted 3D, it's not the usual post-converted 3D crap we're used to seeing. This is a film that uses 3D to its fullest. For example when the ISS (International Space Station) explodes several parts of it come flying. I ducked my head more than ten times, despite the fact that I was aware that it wasn't real. But that's how real the 3D in Gravity is. I highly recommended you see it in that format.<br/><br/>Gravity is an intense thriller. It's not a blockbuster, but it doesn't need to be. It's a film that doesn't have much of a soundtrack (and the soundtrack, however short it may be by Steven Price is beautiful), but it doesn't need one. Its runtime is short (90 minutes including credits), and it moves at a brisk pace. This is a movie I highly recommended you see."

It truly gives you a sense of desperation in a very realistic way, I found myself gasping for air in some scenes and that really about says it all, you're right there with them, you feel it and at just 90 minutes long you feel like the movie is much longer but in a good way in that it transports you to space and makes you feel at least part of the helplessness and desperation that they are feeling, will not give any details about the movie because you all pretty much know from the trailer what the plot is pretty straight forward plot, I do agree with another reviewer's opinion that Sandra Bullock should get another Oscar for this and maybe its the source material but no one so far this year has taken their acting to this level, the people behind me were crying in several scenes, I almost did, Sandra has truly come along way since Demolition Man"

","I went into Gravity not really knowing what to expect. I had seen the trailer and wondered if there was more to it than just a couple of people trapped in space. Gravity is beautifully filmed, well paced, believable and immersive but it is a very simple premise. I was never bored or frustrated by Gravity but I was waiting to be surprised by it and that never happened. I have seen many cases of this movie being compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey. While both movies present a believable space experience, 2001: A Space Odyssey had far more imagination, vision and depth. 2001: A Space Odyssey presented imaginative ideas and concepts that inspired the viewers own imaginations and thoughts. I don't think 2001: A Space Odyssey is a perfect movie but in those ways it is superior to Gravity. Gravity creates a more immersive space experience, it feels real, it looks real and in that way it is better but if you are looking for something more than that I don't think you will find it here. There is some interesting symbolism and undertones about life and death that add an extra layer to the movie but it isn't amazing.<br/><br/>Gravity does what it does incredibly well. It doesn't really do anything wrong, the visuals are gorgeous, the soundtrack is atmospheric, the effects are realistic, and the performances are genuine. This is an example of a movie that fires on all cylinders but its just a bit too simple to be phenomenal. Other films could learn a lot from Gravity but I don't think Gravity has enough imagination to be counted among the greatest movies of all time. Gravity should be experienced in theatres, it is a great space experience and I think it can be enjoyed by almost anyone."

Cuar√≥n anticipates exactly what the viewer expects, and what the viewer fears, to an astounding degree. Every tense moment is made doubly tense for the audience, who knows, just knows, that something else will happen, even more jaw-dropping than the last event.

","Most of the reviews I've read focus on the visuals and sound, and rightly so -- the unmatched technical achievement in this film results in the rare feeling of being part of the story. Read all the superlatives in the reviews and see this film -- see it on a big screen with big sound. The screen will fade away while the sound and the silence move you.<br/><br/>What I don't see in the reviews is the other side. All the stunning images and sounds would be empty without meaning. The solitude and awe provide the space for something more. <br/><br/>The spacecraft and space suits are small worlds to support life just as the earth is in the vastness of space. We leave the protection of earth to the protection of an orbiting shuttle only to go outside in the protection of a space suit - like a womb protecting us from the dangers outside. We leave the space suit into an airlock. We see Ryan floating silently in a fetal position and sense safety and hope. And when it fails -- and it will all fail -- our birth, our rebirth is what matters. In a moment of quiet resignation to death - a death borne of pain and calamity - she finds a way to pray, something she was never taught, simply by putting her hands together. <br/><br/>In her death comes the answer, the voice of God through an angelic dream -- redemption and rebirth. She returns in a baptism of water to new life and learns to walk again under the sunlight of hope, free of the tangling cords of her old life."
"TeaLeafOnTheWind","10","3","7","5 October 2013"," This film wins.
","This movie wins. I cried at least five times during the film, just from the breathtaking, jaw- dropping, groundbreaking cinema I was watching. The action is intense. The acting is perfect. (The dialogue was a little weak, but there was barely any of it anyways). The special effects were... seamless. Cuar√≥n and his crew create a piece of film that is so brilliant, I am not sure I ever want to watch another movie, as there is zero sum possibility that it could stack up against this work of art. Every time I think that the film could take a wrong turn, it defies expectations and creates a beautiful flower. The literal paintings of the visuals canvas of this movie could be watched for days on end. The sense of place and, of course, the sense of space - three dimensional space - is laser focused and melts my brain - as Cuar√≥n achieves through story, visuals and sound, in this 131 minute film, what every filmmaker wishes they could achieve. He is a master of the medium - there is nothing that we see that is not perfectly intentional. An auteur. The music is chilling. The pace moves quickly and makes your heart race - and yet, he allows for those most essential contrasts of stillness and silence. Bullock and Clooney's instant charm and chemistry don't exactly hurt the flick either. From the first frame, until the last powerful moment of gravity, this movie makes me believe in a higher power - Alfonso Cuar√≥n - Master of Cinema."
"mgfuchs99","10","3","7","4 October 2013"," Gravity is Powerful Visually and Psychologically
","Having now seen the movie, I can say my assumptions were correct: the marketing of the movie was very poor. In fact, I got much better insight to what to expect from Jon Stewart's gushing interview with Sandra Bullock on the Daily Show. (He wasn't exaggerating.)<br/><br/>Gravity is visually stunning and exciting. Think ""2001"" but at the pace of, say, ""Die Hard"" or ""Aliens"". But this is not a sci-fi movie. This is a character study and a psychological mind trip. Two hours with only two characters on screen. You get to know them, intimately. The masterwork aspect of the movie is that you don't get bored.<br/><br/>Gravity is also not an art-for-art's sake movie. While it is built from the ground up to fully exploit 3-D, the strength of the movie is the characters, and the fact that you are sucked in and deeply invested in them - particularly Bullock. I know I tend to overuse analogies, so I apologize. But the idea that came to my mind to set my fellow movie go-er's expectations was: imagine Vince Gilligan directing Castaway, in space, with the pacing of ""Need for Speed"". The intensity and tension of a Breaking Bad episode applied to a different genre.<br/><br/>Go see it. In 3-D. See if you don't agree. <br/><br/>(Leave the little ones home, though. There is a little too much scary, intense bad stuff happening.)"

","Watched 'Gravity' in IMAX screen, Wadala (India). Wow, I just watched the Best Film of 2013. Even calling it a film is absolute injustice. Coz it isn't a film, it's actually an experience, more of a space ride. Yes, after the movie was over, I couldn't walk comfortably because my mind was spinning just like the astronauts in the film. The whole film is set in space, two astronauts are left stranded outside their spacecraft and then its all about how they struggle to reach Earth. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock give their career's best performance especially Bullock. The movie engages you, hooked up to the screen with its amazing visuals of space that even blinking your eye is forbidden. For every 2-3 minutes you'll say 'wow'. This movie will surely fetch all the major technical awards at the Oscars especially Visual Effects, Cinematography, Sound Effects, Background score and Editing. If Sandra Bullock doesn't get an Oscar nomination for her performance then I will lose all my faith in the Oscars. I seriously recommend everyone to watch it in IMAX, even if its thrice the normal ticket price or if its far for you to travel. You'll be amazed and will cherish the film even after hours walking out of the screen. Truly the Best Film of the year. Rating: 11 out of 10! Yes, you read it right!"

","tl;dr: gravity is a good film with some incredible visual scenes; Sandra Bullock can't act worth spit.<br/><br/>Long: Gravity is better than I thought it was going to be. Some great space scenes, shots of the earth etc. Would look incredible on IMAX.<br/><br/>Basically, some astronauts get into serious trouble and have to struggle to survive and make it back to earth.<br/><br/>Has some seriously great SFX scenes, and few slower moments, but it never feels like it drags. Luckily the script is packed with disasters, so it manages to move along at a brisk pace without ruining the feel of space as a vast, endless... well, space.<br/><br/>It's essentially a one-actor film (Sandra Bullock) (with a supporting role (George Clooney). Unfortunately, Bullock's acting is so uneven that it almost ruins the film. For example, during the initial disaster moment, she's terrified, and understandably so. Her character is not an experienced astronaut, and it's a disaster of unimaginable proportions. However, this terror vanishes soon after, even when faced with other serious disasters. Whilst you don't want a character that's a useless terrified blob the whole film, the complete unevenness of her acting is bizarre. The end result is that the majority of the film lacks a lot of tension, and that sucks. Things go wrong, and she just takes it all in her stride. There's just no emotion there, except for the obligatory ""finding the will to survive"" scene.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film. Well directed, gorgeous cinematography (well, SFX, but well-composed), some great tense scenes. Definitely a big screen film.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

Had this movie run when better movies were playing at the same time Gravity would be considered a dud. It feels like the movie deleted key parts of the script, like the beginning. We really learn very little about the main character and George Clooney's character basically is a wisecracking astronaut with bad stories who flies around a lot in his space suit. Sandra Bullock plays this part very well but at 50 years old perhaps a younger actress would have made more sense. The movie is very visual and it has some great shots. However, quite a bit is not plausible and simply would not happen so don't look for accuracy. Don't expect much and you'll like it...but it really doesn't deserve the hype."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","11","18 October 2013"," Buy the Hype, Buy a Ticket and Witness Something Truly Remarkable
","Gravity (2013) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Visual masterpiece about an astronaut (George Clooney) and a medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) who must try to find a way to survive in space after an accident leaves them cut-off from everything. GRAVITY does a lot of great things and it also puts to rest the whole notion of not watching movies in a theater. Those saying ""I'll wait for the Blu-ray"" are going to be missing quite the experience because this is a film that was born to be seen on the big screen and in 3D.<br/><br/>There's really no way that any words can pay justice to the special effects in this film but I guess I'd say that watching this movie is the closest most people will ever get to experiencing outer space. I was really amazed at how wonderful the special effects are as they certainly live up to the hype. It seems every month movie goers get more ""hype"" about something grand but I think it's safe to say that the effects here are perhaps the greatest that you're ever going to see and not too many movies have used effects to such an advantage. I think this entire movie would fall apart if even for a split second you didn't feel as if you were with these characters, all alone and in space. The idea is terrifying on its own but the way the film turns this into an adventure is something quite amazing to watch.<br/><br/>It's also rather amazing at how simple but powerful the story is. As the short running time moves along we're told bits and pieces about the Bullock character and when everything plays out it's certainly an incredibly touching and emotional ride. Given the right material Bullock can be truly great and this here is without question the greatest work of her career. She's certainly limited in the movements that the character can do so she must act with her eyes and she does a masterful job. Clooney is also very effective bringing his calm and cool nature to the role, which so perfectly plays well against the other character who is in a panic. I'm certainly not going to ruin how things play out but the entire film just leaves you in a state of drama from the opening scene to the closing. There's no question that GRAVITY will be remembered for decades to come. So, if you think waiting around for this is a smart idea, buy the hype, buy the ticket and witness something truly remarkable."

","Gravity, in my opinion, is everything that is wrong with cinema today. The notion that a spectacle will more than make up for a void where a story should be is a ridiculous one, yet one that is employed time and again when making these 'blockbuster' films. I watched Gravity on a 15inch MacBook and it was so depressing that once it had ended I drank a bottle of cheap red wine mid afternoon and watched a weeks worth of Come Dine With Me so I didn't feel my whole Sunday was wasted. Would it have made the experience more enjoyable had the bits of satellite shrapnel floated around my front room and Sandra Bullock's heads up display really had been heads up? Probably. Would I have still got drunk and tried to forget about the whole thing afterwards? Definitely, only I wouldn't have had to wait until the morning to get a headache, cheers 3D. This film is painfully dull and yet it is set in space, the coolest location for a film in the world (joke). Just because you can CGI up a convincing globe doesn't mean that it's all I want to look at for two hours. Though arguably after the 110th thing goes wrong for whatever Sandra Bullock's character is called, and the film just becomes one long moan, you couldn't care less what you're looking at anyway.<br/><br/>The point however is not that Gravity is poor, the point is that cinema has become a waste of time. I learned nothing from Gravity other than the Russians are stupid, the Russians drink Vodka in space, the Russians don't put fuel in their space craft, and the Russian space suits aren't as white as the American ones. What was happening on screen didn't matter as I couldn't have cared less about the two astronauts. I didn't believe that that many things could go wrong for one woman, I didn't believe the escape module would sink, I didn't believe they'd let an emotionally unstable woman in to space, and I certainly didn't believe that when Sandra Bullock stood up at the end it merited the drama of when Dr Grant first saw the Diplodocus in Jurassic Park. I didn't believe any of these things because not once was I invited to care, because this is a shallow film from a poor storyteller that suffices only to prove what a shallow and poor audience bankrolls modern cinema.<br/><br/>One star, or infinite stars.

"winopaul","8","2","4","23 January 2016"," Very good, but not great
","This is a very good movie. It deserved every one of the technical awards. Sandra Bullock deserved her Oscar nomination. What I find as fascinating as the movie is the number of 1-star reviews here, and how a certain group of people, us techie types, seem to hate this flick.<br/><br/>The movie does have two huge flaws, one dramatic, and one technical. The dramatic flaw is the scene where Sandra is coiled up like a fetus. If I was in the theater I would have stood up, pointed at the screen, swiveled my head back and said, ""Look everybody, its Symbolism!"" It was heavy-handed and inappropriate. It reminded me of that review of Snow Falling on Cedars, where the guy said he wanted to stand up and shout, ""OK, we get it!"" Worse yet, Sandra had just promised George Clooney she was coming back for him, and she is doing this little curl-up diorama. The audience is screaming-- ""Hey darling, George is out there drifting away and dying of oxygen starvation!"" People that almost die don't pause for a peaceful respite. They claw around and tremble from the adrenaline rush. The only thing worse would be if she found some scrap of a mirror and started touching up her makeup. I fault the studio here. They could have snipped this self-indulgent bit out. But like often happens, that which was expensive or hard to do gets kept, simply since it was expensive and hard to shoot.<br/><br/>The technical error is George Clooney drifting away after unhitching his lanyard. Sorry, there is some elasticity in the parachute cords, but it sure looked like they were both stopped. George would not have gone anywhere.<br/><br/>Those minor niggles aside, there is a reason this big-budget movie made back it financing double in the USA alone, and seven times return world-wide. Its a very good movie. I think the reason so many of us techie types hated it is that they thought there were going to see a science fiction movie, and this is not science fiction. Its an art film. It odd how the people that want to see make-believe BS with transporters and photon torpedoes also try to criticize the plausibility of this movie to explain their hatred.<br/><br/>Mostly they are wrong. The guy that says the Hubble is in geosynchronous orbit away from the ISS. No, its in low-Earth orbit. The guy (its always guys) that says she would have died breathing ""pure CO2."" No, she had an alert for high CO2. Over a few percent and CO2 turns into carbolic acid in your lungs and starts to kill you. The guy that said capsules land in the water and would not have sunk. No, Russian capsules land on earth, and even the USA lost a Mercury capsule when it sank.<br/><br/>Then there were guys that criticized Bullock, saying she was emotionally damaged and could not have gotten in the program. Nothing she did indicated she was totality screwed up from her kid dying, that came out in dialog as back-story. They despise her for playing enie meanee mo, but the movie makes clear the Chinese capsule is the exact same layout as the Russian one, and she is only trying to remember what she did 10 minutes prior. I loved the guy (its always a guy) that says the Chinese ship would have a setting you could change to make the buttons English. Dude, they are clear plastic with silk-screened characters, not 100 tiny LCD screens. Others say she was a bimbo for crashing the simulator. Dudes, there are military flight people and a science crew on the Shuttle. They don't expect the science types to be flight experts, that is part of the suspense. Speaking of suspense, how about the guy that says there is no suspense because we _know_ that there will be another debris storm in 90 minutes. Dude, that is what creates the suspense, are you completely broken as a human being? And all his fellow experts that say the debris incident would be impossible. They did not watch the special features that explains the Kessler syndrome, did they? The only way Cuar√≥n could get us techie types on board is to switch the roles so that Bullock floats off and dies. We don't hate women, but they confuse us and that just adds to the lack of empathy we ""on the spectrum"" feel for other humans. Better yet, indulge our OCD and replace Bullock with Patrick Stewart. No girls and a Star Trek prequel, that's the ticket.<br/><br/>The criticisms of this movie profoundly increased my respect for Gene Roddenberry. He did not invent Star Trek, he discovered it. The perfect food for the Asperger mind. All the tech types who demand anything in space be science fiction also demand Roddenberry's universe. Girls as minor characters, or fluff-babe sex objects for Kirk. Exploration, not reaction to events--- like playing Dungeons and Dragons. Lots of fighting and war, like a first-person shooter. Make-believe BS, like transporters and glowing wormhole intestines that poop you out in a different galaxy. It has to be an extension of comic book story-telling. Indulge our ADHD with a different episode every week, but pander to our OCD by keeping characters and situations the same.<br/><br/>So my apologies Se√±or Cuar√≥n, for all us tech types who excoriated your movie. My favorite comment was the guy that said ""The director was not emotionality involved."" Watch the special features DVD, you blithering buffoon. If you don't want the haters Se√±or, you will have to make movies that combine Dungeons and Dragons with a first-person shooter. I see many action movies that are already just FPS episodes. Now those have no plot, unlike your films. Perhaps you can make a film that projects to the future where us Asperger types are the Morlocks and you neurotypicals are the Eloi. I would pay to see that vision, for sure."

Cuar√≥n is incredible in photography, (just watch Children of men in the plane sequence car scene) You don't know how to really appreciate a movie, you forget about everything else besides the history and acting. And now, how would you create the sound of the space?? Only Cuar√≥n could do that, and he proofs it very well in this movie. I know that history is bad and simple, but the real worth of this movie is in the elements I've just mentioned.

","Those who have seen this movie and complain about its vapidity and lack of intellectual scope..Well, is it me or are people today uneducated ? Or just dim?<br/><br/>Gravity is a modern mythological journey, it's about loss, depression, spiritual redemption and ultimate rebirth, rich with symbolism for those who can actually see and discern. It's Phoenix rising from the ashes, Ulysses..the technology is simply the vehicle to convey the story Here are a few signposts: The image of space itself, without direction, an airless void suited to Dr. Stone- no coincidence to her unfortunate name. Someone in a spiritual wasteland since the death of her only child, who, when she is at work 'just drives', no particular direction or motivation. in a spiritual wasteland..<br/><br/>Clooney's character would be Mercury, the winged messenger, facilitator of transcendence, sometimes described as Trickster which he literally is in this situation. When Dr. Stone is about to give in and give up the ghost so to speak, he comes to her in a dream, and offers the option of returning home. Her final journey from Tiangong, translates as 'temple' in Mandarin, is marked by fire and water. She has to save herself from drowning and shed her 'space' skin like the mythical snake before rising to the surface, preceded by a little frog swimming before her - another nice little touch of mythology- the frog symbolizing transformation and rebirth, being born in water and living on land. The last words of dialogue in the movie from Dr. Stone are 'thank you' She repeats this directly to the earth as she is holding on to fistfuls of sand. The last image we see of her is one of her rising like a colossus standing on two feet for the first and only time in the movie, then taking a few tentative steps like the newborn which she now is"

","As pure entertainment, this movie kept me on the edge of my chair. The science was all wrong, but I didn't watch it to learn about space. In typical fashion, the heroine was always in the path of danger from the satellite debris and the exploding space stations (including a fictional Chinese station), but never a scratch on her. Others have commented that she should have died when Matt opened the escape pod, but she was just hallucinating. Amazing that she managed to land in a small lake when considering most of the earth is water. When she opened the door to the escape pod and water started rushing in I was reminded of Gus Grissom and his Liberty Bell 7 capsule. And equally amazing that once out of the water she could not only stand, but walk. After a week in zero gravity she should have had difficulty in standing. The movie did become predictable, but still I enjoyed the suspense. You will be disappointed if you watch and expect to see science. Forget about the science and just enjoy."

","It's no spoiler to state at the outset that ""Gravity"" won no best-script awards. Why? The writing is third-rate. Maybe even intentionally so. Editing apparently left plot connections, and with them story-telling logic, on the cutting-room floor, and you can count the clich√©d lines recycled from Westerns and lost-at-sea flicks.<br/><br/>But so what. This movie features stunning visuals, great special effects, credible action, a welcome touch of international politics, and a pair of actors the camera plainly loves, even in space suits. And so did I. Clooney plays a sensitive macho with style, and -- notwithstanding the catty comments you'll read elsewhere on this review webpage -- Sandra Bullock deserved to win the Academy Award. She's beautiful, sure, but she can also act with a decent range of emotion. <br/><br/>So don't see ""Gravity"" expecting to see Shakespeare, or the Lunts, or Helen Hayes, or even the latest English biopic set in a countryside manor. Go for a good time."
"g-bodyl","8","2","4","17 December 2014"," An Exhilarating Experience!
","I saw Gravity when it came out in theaters and I will never forget the spectacular feeling of awe I saw watching this film. The visuals are astounding and so lifelike. I recall Alfonso Cuaron saying he had to invent the technology and my gosh, Earth never looked so beautiful on the big screen. The sound design is also amazing and when we sync the sound with the visuals, we are in for a treat. The story, however, is merely average. It's not bad or anything, but it's nothing new. It does add a sense of realism and danger. This is a realistic space movie, so we cannot believe that three-legged aliens will come out of nowhere. Instead it is just about a mission that has gone wrong.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron's film is about two astronauts named Dr. Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski who are stranded in space after their shuttle was destroyed in a collision with broken satellites. Now they must find a way back to Earth even if that means traveling across the globe.....in space.<br/><br/>For the most part, this movie is a one-woman show. I think Sandra Bullock did a fine job in this role, much better than people give her credit for. George Clooney's screen time was not long, but he effectively countered Sandra Bullock. This is one of those survival movies that don't rely on a huge cast and it works better that way.<br/><br/>Overall, Gravity is a very good movie, especially in regards to the technical design. That was beyond impressive and it made for quite an exhilarating ride at the theaters. I remember how me and the audience was blown away by Earth and space and the lack of sound in space. The story is a little thin or perhaps simplistic will be the better word to describe the story. But I did like some of the dialogue and the in-house jokes referencing a certain space movie from the mid-1990's. All things said, this is a solid directorial effort by Alfonso Cuaron. I rate this film 8/10."

","(91%) Whether this really is film of the year is entirely down to the individual, but it certainly is one of the most remarkable, awe-inspiring cinema experiences I have ever witnessed. No other film gets even close to the feeling of actually being in space and terrifying events taking place as much as this, it certainly is as close as I'll ever get. The effects are nothing other than true big budget magic at its best, it really does feel like it was shot out there and not one second feels anything other than the case. The direction is sublime and the performances from the very small cast are perfect. So as a cinematic thrill ride it's highly recommend, but once it leaves the big screen, and like so many great films, particularly these days, I suspect it will lose some of its strength on the transition to your TV. So in other words watch it now in the cinema or miss out, its worth every penny in my opinion."

","I was anxiously waiting to see this movie after it had been advertised. Finally caught it on HBO! I have really enjoyed watching Sandra Bullock in all the movies she has ever done and she did do an amazing acting job in this movie. However, I was disappointed with how fake and seemingly unrealistic the scenes were in the movie. There were several times that Bullock's character would have died due to extreme changes in pressure. I also thought Bullock's character could have been developed much more into a good story line. To me, the movie was just a series of events that did not create any realistic suspense. Unfortunately, sadly disappointed."

","Air. Breath. Oxygen. How much of it do we take for granted? Cold. Dark. Alone. How many of us have really experienced it? Space. Void. Black. Fear. How many of us can really comprehend it? To be in space is at once beautiful, thrilling and terrifying. Like a sailor adrift in an ocean on a dark night, Earth shines like a beacon - near and yet so far. Always just out of reach. Out there, everything is put into perspective and you realize your insignificance in front of it all. Alfonso Cuaron gives you an experience that few can match. It gives you an astronaut's view and shows you the enormity of nothingness. Sounds antithetical, doesn't it? But, that's exactly how it is. From here, from the security of land, of Earth, we gaze up at the stars and wonder about aliens and exotic planets. And sometimes, the black nothingness that lies in between encroaches our vision and thoughts.<br/><br/>This film does not preach, and like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Tarkovsky's Solaris, this film shows, in a very unique way, the meaning of life and of survival. Out there, there is everything and there is nothing. There is just you. Facing it is the ultimate test. <br/><br/>Watching this film made me realize how much of our planet we take for granted. We seldom think that gravity is the anchor that keeps us home. The subtle meaning and choice of words are integral themes in the film - that of a mother who has lost her daughter, who has lost her hope, her anchoring, or to put it bluntly, her gravity. She is drifting, literally and mentally. But she finds that courage to cling on and return.<br/><br/>In this film, you come face to face with the sheer horror of space, of the impenetrable, intangible, all-encompassing, never-ending darkness. How you intend to face it alone is up to you."

","I agree with a lot of the user reviews. I was totally surprised when I watched it listening to a very poor written script. What really got me was when she was attempting to contact the Chinese space station and they didn't know what the term ""mayday"" is. I thought that was a universal call for help. Not only that but none of the Chinese aboard that station understood even the slightest amount of English so they started barking like dogs and she actually barked back.I would have screamed at these jerks asking if anyone knows a little English to get her point across The entire movie was like that. Very low on intelligence. The graphics were great and that's about all which is why I stayed with it all the way through."
"rmax304823","6","2","4","13 July 2014"," What Do I Do Now, Ma?
","A team of four astronauts is out in space repairing some floating piece of American technology. The team is led by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. Oops -- force majeur. An accident elsewhere in the sky sends an invidious junk yard of space debris hurtling in their direction. They can't escape it, and two of the team are killed as their entry vehicle is destroyed.<br/><br/>This leaves Bullock and Clooney spinning around without any way of returning to earth without getting burned up by the atmosphere. Clooney's solution: He tethers Bullock's space suit to the mobile chair he occupies and they head towards a nearby, abandoned Soyuz that has a workable re-entry system, as well as oxygen.<br/><br/>Bullock makes it. Clooney sacrifices himself, making cheerful wisecracks as he glides off in the general direction of Betelgeuse. Bullock is some kind of engineer and lacks confidence but she becomes resourceful. In the empty but pressurized Soyuz she has the good sense to strip off that hampering space suit so we can see her floating around in a tank top and a pair of tight black shorts.<br/><br/>Alas, the space debris comes whipping around in its orbit and bangs into the Soyuz and it tumbles around and Bullock dons a drab Russian space suit and launches a pod towards an old, decaying Chinese space station, and everything is whipped around as Newton's laws prevail, things are spun and bumped around like pin balls, there are loud thumps and WHOOMS, and I don't know what all.<br/><br/>We've seen danger in modern space stories before. ""Marooned"" and the like. They're all kind of interesting if they're at all well done. They raise provocative questions like ""What the hell are we DOING out here where there is no IHOP?"" This movie gets underneath all that tension but it does so too extravagantly. The viewer is overwhelmed by the (very good) computer-generated images. And, if nothing else, the musical score will pound you into insensibility. It's full of weird sounds, eerie noises barely heard, ominous electronic chords, drums beating faster than a sprinter's heart. And it's loud.<br/><br/>Stripped to its armature, what we have is one of those journey movies in which the lost person or persons must find their way from one watering hole to the next, hoping to hit the town or the railroad, as they plod through the desert and get bitten by rattlesnakes and stuck by vicious cholla. John Ford's ""Three Godfathers"" is a good example.<br/><br/>It's entertaining enough and sometimes thrilling. Clooney is such a likable guy, no matter his film character. And Sandra Bullock looks choice in a short haircut and short shorts. Can she really be fifty this year? She doesn't bring that much to the role. How could she? There is one touching moment when she is preparing to die and listens to an Eskimo singing a faint lullaby on the radio, but calls mostly for gasps and brief, breathless monologues. However, she speaks German flawlessly and I give her a bonus point for that. I give the movie a bonus point, too, for not being nearly as dumbed-down as most recent Hollywood productions, although this will challenge no one's sensibilities."
"motorfocus82","9","2","4","19 May 2014"," A great film about overcoming terrible odds
","Wow, there are a lot of bad reviews on this movie around here, most of them disappointed for the lack of absolute realism. My, what strange expectations you kids seem to have. I've never seen a scientifically perfect sci-fi film, and if you can't let some of it slide in favor of a little Movie Physics, then the problem is yours. It's not a documentary, it's a story.<br/><br/>What I knew of this movie was that it got great reviews by a lot of people after its release, and it was set in space with excellent graphics. Accurate on both counts. It kicks off without any background stuff, characterization and lead-in minimal. The entire thing, start to finish, is focused on the trials of Sandra Bullock, which for once she's not so annoying, mostly because she has to spend most of the film reacting to her environment, which is quickly falling apart. <br/><br/>The entire thing is about overcoming in a harsh place, which might have just hit the spot for me when I watched it. The dialogue was not elegant but worked anyway; the characters could have been essentially mute and I still would have enjoyed it. There's no good guys versus bad guys, no subplots, really minimal garbage to clutter up what's going on. The lapse into religion and odd symbolism are there, all of it representative of scarred people struggling for safety; the fetal position thing was, I think, somewhat misinterpreted as rebirth, which would have been a strange metaphor given where this was in the plot. None of this is terribly intrusive, although it is certainly nothing special. But it's easy enough to let it pass.<br/><br/>But then there are the graphics. My TV is not an advanced piece of machinery, but it didn't matter, because the real treat of these graphics is how they pull you into the situation. Cuaron knows how to use the perspective of the camera lens, and you feel every body impact as Bullock gets thrown onto every man-made piece of hardware in orbit. Sandra hits all the right emotional notes without extensive exposition; you can feel how she feels and you know that, in her position, you would probably be ready to quit, like she often seems to be. It's fine acting and, if you aren't nitpicking the science or probabilities of what you see, harrowing stuff. Great film if you want to root for someone against the odds, and everyone likes doing that. Watch it, and let that which does not matter slide."

","I watched this movie Saturday night while I was home alone. I watched it on my 70 inch HDTV with a Sony sound system and on Blu-ray. It was excellent. The CGI is wonderful, and the suspense and storytelling is very well done. I was willing to look past some of the unreal unscience for the sake of the story. I doubt that many astronauts wear only their sexy underwear inside their spacesuits. Why would Sandra take off her space suit inside the space station, not knowing the amount of damage she would encounter once inside? Could someone accidentally start a catastrophic fire in the ISS just by accidentally brushing by something? No matter, the story was all good. I saw a brief cut from Mission to Mars from 2000 and darn if there isn't the exact same scene of the man telling the woman to let him go to save herself. Still it's all good stuff. We can forgive some of the hokey stuff and unlikely or even unpossible stuff in exchange for good entertainment. It is a movie, after all. If you want reality, go outside."

It's a giant pet peeve of mine and when I realized this film wasn't going to betray that science, I had hope.<br/><br/>Then the first explosion and Sandra Bullock got flung into space happened, and I couldn't look away.<br/><br/>Not only is this film a visual marvel, it's a film that made me wonder why Sandra Bullock didn't get the Oscar for best actress. I may not have seen Cate Blanchett's movie but I didn't have to spend an hour and a half with her and her alone. Sandra is the only actor for the bulk of the movie. Clooney has about 2 scenes in total, maybe 3 if you're pushing it. Sandra carries the entire weight of the film on her own. It's a miraculous performance that deserves endless praise.<br/><br/>Technologically, I'm in awe of what they accomplished. I have seen a few space based films before and very often it's hard to believe that they're really in space. This movie, you completely buy that they just shot a movie in space. I swear when I watched it, I didn't even realize that the outdoor shots are all animated even though that's literally the only way you could do this kind of film.<br/><br/>The story is compelling and terrifying, I know nothing about science but I could completely buy everything this film was saying. I could buy that an astronaut could get lost in space like that. I believed everything they were doing was real, they never once pushed beyond the limits of what you would believe.<br/><br/>It's no wonder why this film was considered one of the best of the year. It's a great 90 minute thrill ride that you can enjoy as popcorn fluff, as gorgeous art, as a feat of technology or as a metaphor for life. It's one of those rare movies where everything works, and you wonder how anyone could say anything bad about it because it's a absolutely flawless movie"

After all these are supposed to be handpicked professionals and yet they react a little too human to those life-threatening situations. In reality they wouldn't have the slightest chance to make it.

From the first frame, you're immediately plunged into outer space, and the magnitude of those shots enveloping your field of vision must have been breathtaking (I missed this in theaters, but the movie still makes its point on home video). I kept looking for the CGI trickery involved in sending the actors into orbit, but the camera movements, the brilliant looming Earth and omnipresent blackness of space make you feel like you're really up there. <br/><br/>I love this movie; that they got Ed Harris for Mission Control Voice; the white-knuckle suspense . . . But more than just that, I loved George Clooney's character. His role in the movie is obvious, but he ties right into that human spirit angle something fierce. And even though I knew the big spoilers before seeing this (indeed, the worst kept secret around), ""Gravity"" was worth every second. <br/><br/>Normally I write these things to either just be honest about how I liked/disliked a movie, or to remember something about it. In the case of ""Gravity"", I'm fairly certain I'll never forget one particular scene: where Sandra Bullock is telling Clooney to give a message to her daughter. It's Bullock's indefatigable human spirit that really lands the punch to the gut (her daughter's dead, and she's decided not to go see her today) and really gives this movie its lasting impact.<br/><br/>9/10"

"CelluloidDog","7","2","4","26 March 2014"," Visually Stunning, Laughable at Times
","Gravity is a beautiful film! It shows how far we've come in special effects. It portrays itself as a realistic film, that is, with realistic images of floating in space, flying through the atmosphere, etc. I can't decide whether this film is a 7 or 8¬Ö.I think 7.5 just for the images in space, the curve of Earth, the space stations, the reflection off the glass, Sandra's breathing condensing on the glass, Sandra's effortless floating glide through the Russian and Chinese stations. Quite visually beautiful.<br/><br/>But really, it is more fantasy than science fiction. I think I would have rate this higher (8.-8.5) if I knew to expect a fantasy film. But I feel a bit disappointed as many others. Almost none of the physics are real and it defies what really happens in space and defies NASA protocols. For accuracy, here's an astronaut's comments:<br/><br/>http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/astronaut-fact-checks-gravity.html<br/><br/>The script from minute one was just bad at times. George Clooney trash talking and zipping around without a tether. He'd be released from NASA, never be allowed in space again. Acting by Clooney was actually better than acting by Sandra Bullock who more or less played herself. She is a bit kooky and she has a bit of her Miss Congeniality in her. George also played himself but somewhat had more charm than Sandra. Too much testosterone. However, the best moment was when Ryan Stone (Sandra) drifts off into unconsciousness and she imagines¬Öor is it communication from the dead? It is a well-crafted touching scene with Clooney and Bullock talking. And then she talks about her daughter. The girl with one shoe, I believe she said. A statement on our mortality. Perhaps the best drama scene in the film.<br/><br/>Definitely this film deserves the Oscar and BAFTA for visual effects and cinematography¬Öand maybe a couple more. But Best Director? or nomination for Best Actress? It's an empowering film for a female lead. It empowers Sandra Bullock. And inspires many young girls to be an astronaut perhaps. Liberating and uplifting. But really, if you check the URL above, almost nothing would have happened. As pointed out, Sandra's character, Ryan Stone, would have never been trained in a simulator. Worst, Sandra doesn't quite portray a woman of confidence or science. Rather she relies on the manly Clooney coming to the rescue. Dr. Stone is more like Dr. Claustrophobic and Ms. Panic. She's not the composed, strong woman that a real astronaut probably would be in space. Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney would have never let go and leave her alone. There is no gravity acting on Matt in the scene where she is caught in the lines and he is holding on. It therefore kind of resembles joyride of ""Armageddon"". Yet Gravity is a better film.<br/><br/>Gravity is a dramatic movie with little realism, but still plenty of fun. It actually reminded me of another extract-yourself-from-the-debris action movie, Daylight, with Sylvester Stallone. But Daylight has a remote likelihood but Gravity lacks most realism. That is why I laughed at Ryan Stone's eight or ninth time she should have died. Perhaps she is a Terminator? Never dying. A superhero. She needs a cape. <br/><br/>Gravity ranks among the best films based in space but it clearly isn't 2001 or Contact. The latter film with Jodie Foster is much superior in script, acting, direction and even comes close with nice special effects. Gravity is a 7-7.5 and Contact might be 8.0-8.5. Gravity has nine lives. It's your day, Dr Stone.<br/><br/>I wonder if Cate Blanchett or Julianne Moore might have been a more credible, calmer Ryan. I would have like a stronger woman in charge, more convincing as an astronaut. Just that the opening scenes and Ryan's goofy inexperience in space make her reminiscent of Miss Congeniality. <br/><br/>Gravity might have been the best science fiction/fantasy film of the year. If only the plot was more realistic and script were better. Then it might deserve a spot as one of the best space films. But even with flaws, the visual effects rank it high among the very best if that's your piece of cake. For space films, it deserves a top 10-12 rank. For fantasy/scifi, top 25. But that many Oscars? Yes, we will be all asking that question ten years from now as there were many better movies in a strong 2013."

Nor did I care, other than pure curiosity if the usual clich√©s will be broken, about the fate of Kowalski and Stone.<br/><br/>It's perfectly all right to drop some realism for drama, so it doesn't bother me that e.g. the astronauts don't wear diapers under the space suit. Yet other stuff irritates me, e.g. various (expensive) space stations have been evacuated and are under threat of destruction, and the only guy she is able to communicate with is some drunken amateur radio operator in the tundra?!<br/><br/>I didn't know much about the story when I went to watch Gravity. I expected it to be more about drifting helpless in space rather than racing from one doomed space station to the next one.<br/><br/>The movie would have gained a lot by a slower pace: Build up story and characters, so the viewer cares about the people involved. And some more suspense instead of action.<br/><br/>One further remark: It is definitely not a science fiction movie, but a disaster/action drama. For a good recent SciFi movie stick to Sunshine, which is way too underrated."

","Everyone seems to love the movie, ""Gravity,"" or maybe ""they"" the ""movie critics"" are just afraid to criticize it. I simply do not get it. The special effects were fantastic! Yes, I agree, but...the plot was so simple I was bored. Nothing really happened. I can get more ""plot"" out of an old ""B"" movie like ""It Came from Outer Space."" I kept waiting, and waiting for a subplot...throw me a George Clooney bone, anything. Sandra Bullock was OK in it, but I was so tired of her depending on George Clooney's character to save her...and the whining, the whining just went on and on throughout most of the movie. I guess I just wanted her to be more ""professional,"" or tough like the Sigourney Weaver's character in ""Aliens."" I was so disappointed to see George Clooney, the only interesting actor in the movie, drift off into oblivion. I kept hoping the camera would follow him. Oh, well...maybe in the sequel they will go looking for him and call it ""Gravity 2, In Search of George."" I gave it a rating of 6 for the great special effects¬Öbut, ""special effects"" does not make a movie!"
"ppilf","10","2","4","24 February 2014"," Gravity is a masterpiece!
","First I must start out by saying that Sandra Bullock's performance in the lead role of Gravity was absolutely superb! I don't think anyone could have performed it as well as her. As far as I'm concerned she's the best actress of 2013. George Clooney was also superb as veteran astronaut commander Matt Kowalski. I just can't see any two people doing as good a job as these two stars.<br/><br/>But that's just the starting line-up. The special effects and visual effects engineered by the ultra-professional organization 'Framestore' were no less than spectacular! The orbiting spacecraft simulations, weightlessness, zero-gravity kinetics, impacts, and motion were so real that they seemed like miracles of cinematography. I simply can't say enough about the people who created these amazing special effect sequences. Their work is the main reason I agree with James Cameron and Anthony Scott when they said that Gravity has rewritten the rules of cinema as we know them, making Gravity the best space film ever made.<br/><br/>I'm an aerospace engineer, and there were a few scientific inaccuracies and some slightly far-fetched premises in the movie. But given the premises, Gravity's accuracy and realism is second to none in the movie industry. It is difficult to call this film science fiction because, although the story is fictitious, the science is very realistic.<br/><br/>Finally, Alfonso Cuaron is the main person responsible for this great film. He directed, co-produced with David Heyman, and co-wrote Gravity with his son Jonas. He has been nominated for best director, he and Heyman for best picture by the Academy Awards, and he has won or been nominated for numerous Golden Globe and British Film Academy awards for Gravity. I think he deserves to win them all! Gravity is a masterpiece!"

","When i first heard about this movie i was wondering what the hype is all about and how its 3D was necessary (for a change) so i went to see it. I was awe-struck from the very first shot till the very end of the movie it is the most visually stunning film that has been made to date. From the direction to the acting to the music to the editing to the cinematography to the sound editing and mixing and the scenery this movie is a miracle of film technology and has raised the standards to what movie tech might really do when it hits right. I will admit, the story is generic (the main argument of its haters) but it doesn't bother me here (unlike in avatar where it DID bother me), and that is because the purpose of this movie is to describe a situation rather than tell a multi-dimensional story about it: Astronauts fixing a telescope, debris destroys their ship and they have to go back to earth before the air runs out, very simple. But still, everything in the movie form music to effects contribute to the emotion you experience making it a really entertaining movie and you just want the characters to succeed even if you don't know them too much and that is due to Sandra Bullock astounding performance and does a very good job for a character who mostly just needs to breathe heavily and you end up rooting for her with all your heart. The sound in this movie is realistic beyond belief. You literally feel you are in outer space where there is nothing to carry sound. Other than the realism it also increases the thrills to a level where you are overwhelmingly excited and get soaked into the movie completely. So Gravity is the most visually stunning film made to date and should be soon by everyone. Big screen or small screen this movie is still unique and stunning and tense beyond belief and anything anyone has ever experienced to date. Do yourself a favor and see it NOW!!!!"

","I just want to start by saying that Gravity is definitely one of my all-time top favorite movies. It's just plain fantastic. It's extremely focused in the story it sets out to tell. That means that from the second the film opens until the end, you're in space, and you're experiencing everything that Dr. Ryan Stone is experiencing. It's thrilling, it's emotional, and it really is one hell of a ride. <br/><br/>Having such a strong focus proves that you don't need a huge cast, and you can rely on amazing actors and directors to create a highly artful and enjoyable experience. In this film, that lack of other actors on-screen really helped perpetuate that feeling of isolation and helplessness way out in space. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock and George Clooney did an amazing job here. The realness that was expressed just made me feel like I was there in her shoes. I rooted for her every step of the way, even when everything seemed to be going wrong and things looked hopeless. I had never heard of director Alfonso Cuar√≥n before, but wow, his vision for this movie was absolutely realized. <br/><br/>Overall I hope people don't get bogged down by the haters and give it a chance themselves. I don't really understand why people would say this movie is ""boring"". I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie, and my heart was pounding several times! I say, ignore the haters, and give it a watch."

That said, this SFX soundtrack fits perfectly the antigravitational cinematic experience, so that's perfect! However, don't try to listen it at home on a CD, unless you want to get depressed from the meaningless feelings it conveys, amplifying the emptiness of space and its horrific, shocking depravity of life.

Matt (Clooney) is the real pro, and he's been doing this his whole career. The world looks beautiful. Yes, the world. The way they've designed it makes you believe that you're there with them.

They always complain and complain about how this and that movie is Hollywood garbage but liking movies like this is the reason. A woman on the verge of death with a sad past who manages to escape every near death situation within seconds of it happening and no way to talk to somebody isn't that new. Sure it was in Alien but that was over thirty years ago. Maybe I'm saying these things because I walked in with high expectations but it wouldn't exactly help if I didn't. I'm not someone who really wants to listen to Sandra Bullock breathe heavily whimpering ""HE HA HI HA HE HA HI HA"" for ninety minutes. I could go on and on about faults and nitpicking and things like how she's wearing a tank top and booty shorts in cold dark space. Not to mention the stupidest scene involving Sandra mimicking a dog.

","""Gravity"" is a visual spectacle of technical brilliance, thanks to the far-out vision of Director Alfonso Cuaron. The film stars Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone, an engineer who is on a space mission to work on a satellite for her research. Along for the el espacio ride is George Clooney as astronaut Matt Kowalksi. When debris from a Russian satellite crashes into their own satellite, they decide to call Direct TV for technical assistance. Wait, come back! I am un tremendo sa-te-li-te so you have to excuse me. Anyways, in reality what happens is that Dr. Stone and Astronaut Kowalski get caught up in a spacely catastrophic situation, and a plight to survive. Cuaron's direction is the gravitational force that magnetizes the viewer into his visually- brilliant ""Gravity"". Cuaron is earthbound to receive lots of love during the movie award season. Bullock's mission of portraying an authentic character of a woman's fight to survive in space was superbly controlled by Madame Sandra. Clooney was pretty much playing the charismatic Clooney in space, but it did have enough pull to give his supporting performance worthy accolades. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is a sight-to-see and is a shoe-in for a Best Cinematography Oscar. ""Gravity"" deserves many stars in its review.

","It's ""big miss"" is the already admitted impossible ""let go"" of George Clooney's character Kowalski by Sandra Bullock's Character Dr. Stone. (When Dr. Stone let's go of Kowalski's hand Kowalski would not have floated off into the wild black yonder, he would have stayed exactly where he was. And, in fact, there was no reason to let go of Kowalski's hand -- all she needed to do was pull him back to the tether line ... because he's weightless. It seems that it's no big deal to the people who like this film a lot. Well, I liked the movie too but there are a lot of other ways that Kowalski could have ""died"" in the movie and any one of them would not have been as dumb as the one they used. (What if in ""Gone with the Wind"" Scarlett floated down the staircase instead of walking down the staircase.) But ... since this is a space movie such a dumb impossibility is forgiven."

On the other hand, the trade off is that there is much dangers in space, let alone the challenges of the unfamiliarity and the weightlessness environment.<br/><br/>In ""Gravity"" we see the two astronauts in grave danger, and they have to fight against literally all odds just to survive. The magnificent desolation, as an astronaut had described, becomes deadly hopelessness.

WHAT A RUSH. Never in 30 years or so of being a movie buff have I ever experienced a trill like that. I was mesmerised by the crisp, clean and ever so realistic show of this film. I felt almost as if I was there amongst the chaos and desolate empty space that I have had a fascination with for so many years. Dodging debris, holding my breath, gripping the armrests, floating in zero gravity with grace and tranquility. The whole concept of virtual reality is something that I am very excited about in the coming years in regard to movies. And if this movie is just the tip of the iceberg of what we can expect I reckon I'm going to be watching many more 3d movies. I can't wait. Although I have no comparison to bear on, never having seen a 3d, even I could say with certainty that this is quite a special movie experience. <br/><br/>The movie itself was quite a ride. Essentially a survival tale, beating the odds, overcoming your own personal demons to increase your chances for survival. I'm sure there is some hidden deeper meaning to this film, but in all honesty it slipped by me. I was just too engrossed in the film to notice. I must give huge kudos to Sandra Bullock ‚Äì I was mightily impressed with the way she handled this 'mission'. Always thinking that she was 'OK' for an actress. Not great but just 'OK'. This was definitely her shining moment. I could feel her panic, because I was panicking as well. When she cried, I cried, when she triumphed I was there cheering for her. This was absolutely the 'Sandra Show'. George Clooney had a good supporting role as the voice of sanity and calm and even a small amount of humor. <br/><br/>Being a huge sci/fi buff a lot of the technical jargon was not lost on me. I know how things move in space. Fast, destructive and threatening. I am very aware of the challenges that are faced when leaving the earth's atmosphere, which made it all the more trilling for me because I 'got it'. <br/><br/>I'm going to give this movie a 5/5 rating. For me it was something original, scary, exciting, touching and so much more. And a new experience in movie watching for me.It's a shame that I will never get to see it in 3d again, (unless I buy a 70inc 3d t.v, which ain't gonna happen anytime soon), but I am equally excited to watch it again in 2d. it will be interesting to see what the difference will be especially on the small screen. I will recommend this movie to anyone, in particular sci/fi fans like me. I know that it will get many repeat viewings over the years. <br/><br/>It is as close to going to outer space as I will ever get."

","In ""Alien"" by Ridley Scott, horror and helplessness of a man in space and the prospect of a violent death were amplified from the clutches of a monster. Cuaron, who wrote the script ""Gravity"", get away without the fiction but made the ""Gravity"" -one of the most terrific horror movies about the space. Black abyss of interstellar space itself is an ideal medium for a thriller- a place where no sound exists, no top and bottom, where it is almost impossible to control your movements, and the probability of encountering something alive is zero. Not to mention that there are no tools to survive. All Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron had to do in this indifferent landscape is to place an experienced astronaut who about to retire and a woman who is a newbie to the space. It would seem that with such an input data, all that remains to the heroes is to beat their heads in panic or humbly wait for death suffocation. Despite the utter hopelessness of the situation, Kowalsky stays calm and tries to joke, while Stone-overcoming despair seeks to outline the homeland on the body of the planet. But yes-it is a story of survival in place, categorically not suitable for life.<br/><br/>This is probably the only film today, in which the presence of 3D technology not only justified, but simply necessary. 3D here performs its direct function ‚Äì it draws the viewer into the image, allows to feel the horror of a man tumbling in space and who has no way to stop the rotation. <br/><br/>This awesome in all aspects movie is only spoiled by the set of disgusting Hollywoods formula with a mandatory American standard ending. Where instead of profanity and hysteria (Houston won't hear anyways)- encouraging imperatives and popular country music broadcast. Heroes are utterly typical: Stone is a direct descendant of Sgt. Ripley and Kowalsky is an alien from a native childhood dreams of the most heroic profession."

","I've been absent. Not only from writing about films, but from watching them with the frequency of past days as well. Part of it was life-driven, as i don't have the time i used to have. Part of it is because from time to time i feel the need to step a little back from whatever i'm doing more intensely and reevaluate things. Passions are better enhanced through fasting. I've had 6 or 7 very intense years where my life mixed a great deal with the lives of the films i've watched. That's the beauty of films, when you approach the films that change you by allowing then to become a part of your life, by blending them into you - as if you had a choice... Cuar√≥n had changed me before, he's so intense because his narrative is always in the eye. His films are bits intimacies that arise from the magic of the relation between character, space, and camera. That's the basis of his dramatic construction, that's where the story lies. That's what allows him to spin and make beautiful free yet coordinated movements, like a planet circling the sun. Children of men changed me because of that. When i heard that Cuar√≥n decided to go to space and enhance even more that special relation between space and camera, i knew he was going for something even bigger. He changes me now, once again<br/><br/>Nothing is more powerful, and as such more difficult to bend as space. It's infinite in its possibilities (like desert), it is totally spatial and it is the opposite of architecture, which is also all about space. Children of men mastered the built space, as this one masters the infinite. Intimacy of a space capsule as opposed to the possibilities of gravity zero. The camera as the ultimate non-animated disembodied character, as chaotic as space itself, yet as emotional as any of the 2 characters in the film. Cuar√≥n ranks at the highest point, together with Kalatozov, in that so dear (to me) theme of space manipulation and film.<br/><br/>Both actors do what was expected. Clooney plays Clooney's character, and becomes a useful wheel in the mechanism, allowing with his persona to make the audiences enter easily this otherwise strange unexplored film frame. Sandra tries hard, as she always does, perhaps harder than she should, and also as always, she seats uneasily in the role, but again that works in favor of the narrative, as her character also does not belong to the world where she moves. Than comes the magic. And world, from the moment it starts to shake, is always a sequence of total stillness followed by spatial chaos. Meteo rain vs the silence inside a capsule, breaking cranes (again the cranes are flying...) vs the sight of Earth framed by a window. We get the most powerful womb representation that i can think of in my whole life in films, and the metaphor of poles, of touching extremes is complete, as the intimacy of the uterus kisses the intimacy of the infinite, where Clooney is allowed to sing while he sees the sunset, or rise.<br/><br/>This is the second film in 2 years that: -really changed me; -was compared by a great deal of people to 2001; -which i find has nothing to do with it. Is it the fact that he films planets and black space? That the actors are dressed as astronauts? That we have scenes in zero gravity? The other film was Malick's Tree of Life.<br/><br/>This is the best 3D i've seen. Nowhere else have i seen such a meaningful use of the possibilities.<br/><br/>My opinion: 5/5"

If you like a movie or not depends sometimes on personal taste or expectations, but seriously: this is not a good movie, not ONE BIT. It's but a theme park ride.<br/><br/>I have to admit it, seeing ""Gravity"" on the big screen is an experience like no other. The 3d isn't even that good, but the (so-called) camera work really makes you feel like floating in space. The visual effects are stunning, the whole look suits great. The sound effects are arranged like a first- person experience, it's awesome. Summarized, these features give the viewer an effect of the physical experience which the protagonist is going through.<br/><br/>But that's it. The movie is more of a demonstration of what modern cgi is capable to achieve. The whole rest of what makes a movie great like: an original story, good acting, well-written characters or even authenticity: ""Gravity"" screws it up. All of it. The background story of Sandra Bullocks character is the most clich√©d and cheesy thing i've seen in a while, her acting is so unsubtle that it almost hurts. The ""dog-scene"" is the most embarrassing thing, it's not even funny.The dialogue is insulting everyones intelligence who has a little bit of sense of criticism left. Many of these issues are to blame on the script, of course. The ending is decent, at least. (George Clooneys character isn't even worth mentioning). <br/><br/>I don't want to imagine what a great movie it could have been if they used a good script and a suitable actress. Like this, ""Gravity"" is evidence of the incapacity of ""professional"" critics and it shows how much the overall voting culture on IMDb lost its proportionality. I am worried about the influence this movie will have on future works.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 because it's a cool experience once, but it will be buried in oblivion right after sighting it.

","Sadly this film was all about the nice visual effects and little else. It starts with the main characters already in space and goes from there. There is very little character building throughout the film and the details that are exposed are straight out of the clich√© handbook of story lines, this makes it very difficult to engage with the leads with any conviction. As the film progresses the realism starts to fall away very quickly in aide of attempting to drive the story along and maintain interest in the characters and their plight. As a result this means Sandra Bullocks character looks like an incompetent fool for most of the film as she stumbles from one clumsy moment to the next. Her continual incompetence made the film more and more implausible as time went on and quite unbearable as it reached its conclusion - cringe!<br/><br/>There are also some very long drawn out moments that are very close to disconnecting with the audience altogether. About half way through I was bored. I was quite relieved when the film finished and I suspect most of the audience were too judging by the murmurings when we exited the theatre. <br/><br/>Honestly I am shocked this film is getting such high reviews. Did other reviewers see a different film? Sadly this film did not deliver, which is a shame as I suspect a lot of the budget went on the stunning visual effects when more time and devotion should have been spent on a plausible and engaging script."

","I'm not sure that I saw the same version of Gravity as everyone else who seem to be raving about it. A plot that is minimal, a mawkish sub-plot that adds sod all, a couple of performances that were phoned in by Bullock and Clooney, a bombastic score, and some pretty 3D skyscapes. <br/><br/>The plot devices intended to create drama become tiresome, the characters are thinner than the atmosphere, and whilst some of the visuals are good, they're certainly not the greatest I've ever seen. We both walked out at the end and agreed that we'd both found it disappointing. Shame really as I expected so much more."
"mvedprakasha","7","2","4","17 November 2013"," The Conceptual Review
","Gravity is a movie all about ourselves raising beyond the gravity to a state of achievement. The environment puts us into various challenges which pulls us to the ground level however we need to raise to the heights of excellence to fulfill the dreams. Meanwhile the process of excellence demands sacrifices in that journey which needs to be adorned. The well effort-ed satellites (dreams) of life sometimes explode and go un-repaired. That's the time we need more and more oxygen to breath in, take in all the confidence and fearlessness and get our mind in the state of balance for moving forward. We may need the help of experience of friends, relatives, guides and mentors but its we who have to continue the journey and reach the destination. The movie takes us into such various stages where everyone is stuck at some point in life, where a question arises as whether all the human effort is made before accepting the defeat. Its God who help those who help themselves.<br/><br/>Its the capacity and the caliber of the director Alfonso to direct such a movie to take ahead with only couple of artists who keeps running the show for the entire 90 min in great 3D effects. Its just the Sandra and George who keeps us entertaining. On the darker side of the movie, the audience shall be more or less interested in the achievements rather than the effort put forth in the process, which the director does not give the clear view. Though its all about 'standing' high, amidst challenges, the greatness of a person shall be in presenting himself as effortlessly flawless, in spite of being surrounded by drowning challenges. Another point of notice is that its better to give people the examples of situations which seems more familiar to them rather than choosing the space domain which most of the audience may be unaware of. Any way the director and his team's effort is fantabulous and is indeed successful in conveying the message that any success story needs seamless effort and sacrifice."
"sunshinebeachcinema","8","2","4","17 November 2013"," Sandra Bullock spins off into the abyss in Alfonso Cuar√≥n's intense space thriller
","After a month's absence from the silver screen, I returned to catch Sandra Bullock spinning off into the abyss in Alfonso Cuar√≥n's intense space thriller Gravity, which chronicles the struggle of two astronauts to return home when their shuttle is damaged beyond repair by an unprecedented cascade of destructive space debris.<br/><br/>Though undeniably engaging and frequently action-packed, there is an understated atmosphere that comes from the focus on a small cast and their isolation. It's not pure science-fiction, though fiction allows it to circumnavigate the criticism it has received for scientific inaccuracies. In the absence of any vast treatise on the destiny of humanity, Gravity becomes a contemporary space adventure that is both modern thriller and character drama.<br/><br/>Cuar√≥n is the director of the celebrated Children of Men (2006) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), cementing his ability to work within different genres. He also displays preference for UK based productions: the ostensibly American affair (helmed by a pair of Hollywood veterans), was in fact shot in Britain.<br/><br/>The term 'shot' is used loosely here, because the real stars are the stunning visual effects, also created in London. What the production team have created is a live action film that is almost entirely and inconspicuously computer generated. Our heroes are inserted into the immersing void above a stunning blue pearl, as they navigate speeding debris, collapsing spacecraft and vast leagues of emptiness.<br/><br/>Cuar√≥n strays into tried and tested Hollywood characterisation with his two leads, the newbie and the veteran. Similarly, the action settles itself in the typical action movie camp, demanding suspension of disbelief from the audience. It's easy to lose count of the times someone miraculously grabs the very last railing before hurtling off to their doom, but for every time this happens, cinematic karma provides another situation when luck runs out, and their fate appears sealed.<br/><br/>George Clooney appears as Lt. Matt Kowalski, an old space dog enjoying his last spacewalk as he pipes country music through his suit. Clooney's got the experience: this isn't his first voyage to the stars, or the first time his ship's gone down. However, the story really belongs to Bullock, who inhabits her character Dr. Ryan Stone (""my dad wanted a boy"") with emotional intensity.<br/><br/>Stone has none of Kowalski's confidence, and is terrified when things go awry. We learn she has lost a young daughter, and since then retreated into her research. Cuar√≥n revisits themes of futility explored in Children of Men as Stone must decide whether to resign herself to fate and be reunited with her daughter, or fight desperately for life. With little desire for self preservation, she teeters on the verge of accepting the former more than once.<br/><br/>The tool of her absolution is a symbolic rebirth, explicitly visualised when she removes her bulky spacesuit for the first time and drifts in a foetal position, the cable that tethered her to the ill-fated shuttle floating past as a suggestive umbilical cord. Dressed simply, her vulnerability at this point is reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Alien (1979).<br/><br/>Gravity is the latest exploration of how far visual technology has come since the pioneering Avatar (2009). While that film basked in the visual candy of alien flora and fauna, Gravity's portrayal of the vacuum of space, and the perceived lack of a certain fundamental interaction, invites comparisons with other masterpieces of space on film.<br/><br/>Themes of rebirth and the use of long, uninterrupted shots owe a debt to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which is ultimately wider in scope. Though elegance remains in Kubrick's classically scored wide shots of docking spacecraft, Gravity ups the ante by dynamically moving the camera through these long sequences, swooping around characters and spacecraft to fully exploit the versatile digital environment. Composer Steven Price's score meanwhile is haunting silence highlighted by thunderous crescendo. Long shots are interspersed with the view from Bullock's perspective, emphasising disorientation as she spins out of control.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe 2001 was released 45 years ago when its effects, created sans computer, still appear so realistic. Kubrick achieved weightlessness with strings, while cameras filming from unconventional directions turned the pendulum-like swing into weightless drifting in another axis. The iconic floating pen was achieved by fixing it to a transparent sheet of rotating plastic. It's a mark of how far effects have come that multiple pens, along with a plethora of other equipment, frequently spin past Bullock as she clambers through space station interiors.<br/><br/>Apollo 13 (1995) eschewed special effects for the real thing, filming aboard NASA's astronaut training aircraft, the famous ""Vomit Comet"" which completed hundreds of descents to give the film makers enough time to shoot (with around 25 seconds of weightlessness a trip). Incidentally, another link between the films sees (or hears) Apollo 13's mission controller Ed Harris reprises his role as the voice of Houston at the start of Gravity.<br/><br/>Notably absent in Gravity are the Earth-based back stories and cutaways to Houston's desperate attempts at rescue ‚Äì exactly the kind of narrative that padded out Apollo 13. Cuar√≥n reportedly worked hard to exclude this against the wishes of studio executives, preserving the sense of disconnection and simplicity. When communications go down early in the film, they are completely on their own.<br/><br/>One exception, which highlights rather than disrupts this, is Bullock's connection with Earth as she scans the airwaves, hearing a non-English- speaking amateur radio enthusiast (revealed in accompanying media as a Greenlandic fisherman). He does not seem to understand the gravity of the situation (no pun intended), yet Bullock draws comfort from the sounds of life on Earth: laughter, a barking dog and most poignantly, the crying of a baby during what may be her last moments on this mortal coil. But I'm not going to spoil the ending."

And the 3D effects were simply marvellous.<br/><br/>At first I thought that the film might run out of steam simply because of the lack of other characters, but the fight for survival was so palpable, so engaging, that I simply didn't even realise that the film was a one-woman show until after I had walked out of the cinema.<br/><br/>If you see no other film this year, this is the one to see.

","The plot of GRAVITY is straightforward enough: Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and her astronaut companion Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are left to fend for themselves in space after their craft is destroyed. But this scenario belies the film's greatest virtue - its quite amazing photography and visual effects. All credit must be due to director Alphonso Cuaron and director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki for creating a film which, watched with 3D spectacles, is both scary yet compelling. We feel we are lost in space with the protagonists; the debris that threatens their future threatens us as well. The color palette used in the film is just gorgeous; I have seldom seen such views of so-called ""Mother Earth"" in all its finery, especially at sunrise. Through this experience, which is both sensual, aural as well as visual, we learn something about ourselves and are capacity to survive, even when the odds seem stacked against us. Perhaps it's just a matter of returning to a womb-like state (it's significant that Bullock appears in this position several times throughout the film) and understanding where we came from, as well as who we are. GRAVITY is the best SF film I have seen in years - definitely worth seeing more than once, if only to savor a life-changing experience."

"Sandcooler","7","2","4","7 November 2013"," Fantastic visuals, stilted writing
","""Gravity"" is worth your money just for the opening scene. In a world where movies are plagued by directors/producers who think any shot longer than .5 seconds is dreadfully boring (yes you, Michael Bay), keeping the camera perfectly steady for at least two minutes is an amazingly daring approach that turned out to be a brilliant fetch. It immediately captures your attention by doing everything Hollywood hates (that's ironic, but not very), it's a magnificent opening. There are more breath-taking scenes spread throughout the movie, visually it's an amazing experience and it actually shows us that movies like these can be made for other reasons than just to show of new technologies. The technical side is amazing, but it's also functional, and that's something a lot of movies seem to forget. In the second half however, this movie's flaws really come into play. The screenplay is just really mediocre, when you take away how fantastic the movie looks it's really just a basic tearjerker with an absolutely terrible ending. The character development doesn't flow at all, it's just thrown into there as forcibly as possible as they kinda hope nobody notices. What's the significance of Bullock's character losing her child anyway? Isn't being lost in space with no oxygen enough drama to keep the plot going? I stared in awe at the first half, but the second half just doesn't add up. Movie of the year? Visually yes, but I don't know if that's enough."

Clooney largely played himself, not that there is anything wrong with that. Sandra Bullock was fantastic, particularly considering that most of what was around her, and that she was reacting to, were not there at filming, but added in post-production. While there were certainly some plot holes, and the physics were not one hundred percent accurate, the filmmakers went out of their way to demonstrate on of the big problems about working in microgravity, that is, the Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum. Poor Dr. Stone got just beaten all to hell trying to stop, and perhaps they should have put some bruise make-up on Bullock for that. But, then again, the film only spans maybe two hours of time. Anyway, the film is very intense."
"Jcs92","9","2","4","2 November 2013"," Cinema at its best!
","Gravity - Alfonso Cuar√≥n's latest film that he directed and co-wrote with his son Jonas, pits medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) together alone in space after Russian satellite debris destroys their shuttle. Alone in space, cut off from Earth, they find themselves fighting for survival with oxygen running low. The film begins with the simple statement that ""Life in space is impossible"", a phrase which is forever on the mind of the audience and astronauts Stone and Kowalski. Much like Cuar√≥n's previous work (Children of Men, Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n), Gravity has a bleak aspect, interspersed with moments of unbridled hope; this creates the framework upon which a true masterpiece has been built. Visually, Gravity is looks absolutely stunning; every frame could be frozen and framed above the mantelpiece. The velvety blackness of space smothers all, it is absolute, a vast void that has rarely looked so beautiful. Space is just one of the aspects that the 3D element amplifies; as in Avatar and Hugo, the addition of 3D certainly adds to the experience. The tension steadily rising as each minute passes by, the claustrophobia of the space suit and the spinning disorientation as the astronauts and other objects weightlessly float across and towards the screen ‚Äì all enhanced by the worthy use of the much-maligned 3D format. The performances and chemistry of Bullock and Clooney are the perfect complement to Cuar√≥n's ambitious vision, understated yet powerful, the transformation of Bullock's character is one of the many seamless layers that create this extraordinary feat in filmmaking. Gravity does tackle important issues; this is no shallow, visually focused blockbuster, it explores rich themes that are relatable on an existential level to humanity as a whole. Communication, or the lack thereof, religious subtexts, the (in)significance of man and life itself are all profound questions raised using techniques such as masterful camera-work and the poignant composition of shots ‚Äì the white speck of an astronaut floating through the darkness being one of countless spectacular images which deserve analysis over pages not sentences. Cuar√≥n asks the characters to let go, asks you to let go and embrace the unexpected, this is not an easy journey for either party. Earth is always in frame throughout, reflected in a visor, reflecting sunlight through a porthole, always taunting; Stone and Kowalski can almost reach out and touch it yet they are many miles away. Gravity, a force in nature binding us to Earth, a force in cinema binding us to the seat, open mouthed in wonder as Cuar√≥n delivers one of the most remarkable films of the 21st century. Space has never looked so good, Earth has never looked so beguiling, and cinema has rarely been so magnificent. It reminds me of why I love films and this is undoubtedly the film of the year, no, the century."

"andy-933-696608","9","2","4","1 November 2013"," Life is short, and the present moment is all we have.
","The sight of the earth encompassed in a wide shot brings tears to one's eyes, as it can revive memories of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Although different from the craft of Stanley Kubrick, the work of Alfonso Cuaron as a filmmaker is bold and original in its attempt to create his own genuine odyssey. As an evolved species, we are constantly embarking on an odyssey of knowledge. Every day we encounter some fragment of life which further defines who we are, what we'll be. This journey is filled with wonder and excitement, but also with peril and fear, knowing that in the end there is death, waiting to part with us each of us. Gravity although classified more a thriller, in the element of survival, there comes the self-reflection of our futility in our struggle to survive. It is the fear of death that truly brings out the most vulnerable aspects of our character. In those crucial moments we are tested, thus acknowledging the value of life in an agnostic universe where there is still so little that we know.<br/><br/>The opening scene of Gravity is something to marvel at, with the sight of the earth in scope. The only thing missing is the poetic composition of Johann Strauss. Oddly though, we get the honkytonk country antics of Hank Williams Jr. as an even mellower LT. Kowalski (Clooney) rides through space in his final mission, with first time astronaut Dr. Strong (Bullock). After a few quirky stories and some perverted humor regarding tequila and a weekend at mardi gras, disaster strikes aboard their ship. The impact of high-speed debris devours the ship, quicker than rapid waves to a boat, with no sound making the use of Steven Price's music although more thrilling. Two survivors remain, with Stone being hurled into the black abyss that is space, and Kowalski couching her through her panic.<br/><br/>In the time that they remain separate, the scene cuts are rather long, playing out within each scene, and giving the feeling of zero gravity more authenticity as Stone struggles to survive, let along comprehend her situation. Clooney's Kowalski, a veteran astronaut is endowed with the more calm and reflexive qualities that bring back an earlier image of Michael Caine's Jasper from Children of Men. Both mellow, and serving more of a guide for Bullock's character, Clooney embodies the wise mentor in the moment of peril, having learned from life that although there is beauty, there is also danger within the self-awareness of the present moment.<br/><br/>Gravity, although made within the aspects of a disaster thriller, draws even greater strength from its existentialist themes. These questions regarding death, spirituality, and God are never answered, nor are they posed directly to our own understanding of their mystery. They are simply there through the situation, as Stone floats and panics with erratic fear, in an abyss of perpetual darkness. Her courage to move forward, despite her fear is moving as it symbolizes the true strength of the human spirit's devotion to survival. Initially that is what separates from other animals, our ability to be self-aware, granting us the distinct capability of knowing that we share the same fate as all other animals, death. So much can happen in those moments, that we pray, we cry, and we plead for mercy. At times, despite our doubts, the essence of the divine becomes relevant, be it through the beautiful aspects of Buddhism and Christianity, we derive some source of strength as a means of combatting our fears, into further rising from a pool of despair.<br/><br/>Within a mere ninety minutes, Gravity manages to capitalize a brilliant portrayal of the human struggle for survival. It marks a story of determination through conflict, as Sandra bullock's protagonist with the sorted flaws and gifts that make her conception all the more worth watching. It is through her own innocent and kind presence that Bullock is able to capture the fragility, as well as the courageous strength of her character. George Clooney as well captures a uniqueness to his character Kowalski, representing the wisdom of a person whos experienced life to the degree that he can fully comprehend that it is short, and not worth the indulgence of fear. He serves the role of the wise mentor, guiding Dr. Stone to Safety, despite her own doubts and fears towards death, as well as the denial of happiness she acknowledges. Gravity is brilliant in its execution of the disaster element, as well as equally compelling within its examination of the human condition. As much as we look at life and contemplate our situation of death, it all boils down to the present moment. The here and now is all we have. Regardless of what we hope for in the future, the only thing we can only be reliant on is the present moment. It is basically a leap of faith regardless of the unknown and the only thing we can do is make the best of it."

","I just watched the movie this afternoon after all the reviews and the box office performance. It's a good movie, excellent, even amazing visuals when seen in 3-D, and the rebirth or the journey for birth allegory was nicely done, but I still feel unsatisfied.<br/><br/>The movie has amazing visuals, granted. But what if the story had taken place in a jungle: a woman lost and surviving, or being re-born in a jungle? Or underwater? or in a snowstorm? or in the middle of Alaska? etc. My guess is it wouldn't garner all the praises it has so far received.<br/><br/>In the end it's great visuals and good allegory. I'm disappointed because I expected more. If I rated this movie right after I watched it I'd have given it a 6/10, but I ended up giving it an 8. It deserves it: two main characters, great visuals, allegory, and it exposes science to the masses. But there are much better movies.<br/><br/>I'll tell you what though: 90 minutes, best in 3-D, in-shape lady dressed as sigourney weaver, Clooney to attract the non-science fiction geeks, and voila: more money for Hollywood. It's like popcorn at the movies for $6.25: it's completely absurd, but one of the greatest ideas ever."
"umer_uf","7","2","4","30 October 2013"," Great visual experience with minor momentum moments.
","Gravity is an instance visual experience with great performances from Oscar winning actors and occasional silliness that can kill the momentum. Sandra Bullock brings her A game both in acting and in the physique department sending a clear message to young Hollywood lionesses that she is still the head huntress.<br/><br/>Clooney is as usual killing it for all us single guys with his suave persona and wine-like looks that seem to get better with age. His calm yet imposing demeanor makes him a good mentor figure, guiding Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) through an almost hopeless situation. The back and forth between the two was a pleasant distraction from impending disaster. Like in any disastrous situation, the experienced will calm and guide the rookies throughout the ordeal. The conversation between the two reveals a sad story of Ryan Stone's life which made it easier to sympathize with her and root for her even more.<br/><br/>Gravity looks absolutely breathtaking and for the first time I sat through a 3D movie without headaches, or constant struggle between 3D and my actual glasses for space on the bridge of my nose. The movie does 3D right, creating an immersive environment in which dodging space debris almost feels instinctive. The ever presence of Earth in the backdrop is both scary and humbling, creating an odd sense of wonder and insignificance.<br/><br/>Gravity could have been a near perfect movie if it didn't have some momentum killing moments. There were times where I had to tell myself that ""it's just a movie, so go with it"", and that's where the movie lost me. Any time I have to tell myself ""it's just a movie"" is when I start to dislike movies, and sadly Gravity is one of those movies. There is a limit to how much a movie should push a single situation or scenario and in my humble opinion Gravity breaks that limit a few times. It's hard to get back into a movie once you start to question the reality presented to you.<br/><br/>Overall, Gravity is a fun movie that will definitely get your heart going, have you dodging space debris and clinching your seat. Absolutely worth the watch even if it's just for the amazing visuals. If you don't like to do too much thinking and are looking for a fun immersive movie Gravity will not disappoint."
"eshwarmail","8","2","4","28 October 2013"," Amazing while you watch, fizzles out a bit when you think back
","To be able to generate the amount of hype for a two character movie is one thing, to live up to it is quite another thing altogether. Alfonso Cuaron's thrilling space saga achieves just that. Though I wouldn't rate this big as a compelling drama, it more than compensates with its spectacular set pieces and jaw dropping visuals achieved through precise use of 3D technology. Even the drama quotient had its moments leveraging on more than capable Sandra Bullock's intense portrayal of a lonely stranded astronaut who has lost her way and hope but not ready to give up. <br/><br/>Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer who is on her first trip to space along with the smooth talking veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). When a Russian satellite is hit by a missile, the fast flying debris hits their explorer shuttle and drifts the two further into space. It now becomes a race against time to reach a nearby space station, get into an escape pod and reach Earth. <br/><br/>While the movie gives a very satisfying visual experience with the leads charismatic and intense portrayal complementing each other quite well, the story as a whole leaves a lot to be desired and believable. Hopping into different space stations, reading through manuals and controlling the systems all made to look quite easy. Letting go of Matt's character that easily did not make any sense for the following obvious reasons - 1) He is full of life and wouldn't part with his life that easily for someone he just met. 2) They have no clear way of knowing the tensile strength of the string they are hung on. 3) They don't even attempt to save him before deciding. By not showing any other character on Earth with just some distorted voice signals, the director manages to create that eery atmosphere of loneliness which Sandra Bullock took it to another level. The use of latest and smartest use of 3D technology made me feel like I was in space for a moment especially when Ryan was rolling away in space, it was through Ryan POV and it made for a horrifying yet thrilling view. Like the director's superior 'Children of Men', the relentless and continuous action sequences and a restless screenplay doesn't let you ponder about its logic until it is done.<br/><br/>Amazing while you watch, fizzles out a bit when you think back"
"Ed-Shullivan","5","2","4","27 October 2013"," Gravity was a bit of a downer, (no pun intended)
","As most people have not yet invested in a 3D high definition television, I anticipate that the producers are going to lose a bundle on their eventual DVD release even if Gravity does well at the box office and at the Academy Awards. The best thing I liked about Gravity were the 3D visuals. The plot was not very believable. Let's try and understand what happens in Gravity. Sandra Bullock plays a scientific engineer who has received 6 months extensive training by NASA for her role as a high priced repair woman. There are a number of satellites circling the atmosphere but I had no idea they were sitting so close to one another. Hmmmmmm? Their shuttle receives an urgent message from NASA to evacuate their mission immediately and miraculously after being hit by a meteorite shower of space debris Sandra Bullock becomes the sole survivor. <br/><br/>The audience does not have much sympathy for all the human casualties caused by the accident in space. Why you ask? Because there are only two characters in the entire 91 minute movie, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. George spends the first five minutes of the movie flying freely in space uninhibited whilst sitting in his space rocket chair.<br/><br/>And so the plot thickens....but I thought it just froze and went nowhere. Of course when the meteorite shower of space debris nears their space capsule they dodge and dart every piece of debris but their comrades manning their space ship are not so fortunate.<br/><br/>As Sandra loses her tether and is flipping 360 degrees through space George catches up to her in his space chair rocket and attaches her by a rope so that they can make it back to their space ship. Although George is the one who won't stop talking to Sandra as they travel through space in an attempt to make it back to their space ship, it is Sandra who runs out of oxygen first and needs desperately to make it back IN to their damaged space capsule. What happens to calm, cool and collected George? Well he just gets Sandra back to their space capsule in the nick of time before his rocket chair (that is right, it is not a rocking chair, it is a rocket chair) runs out of gas and his space suit runs out of oxygen so gravity just takes him away. Say goodbye George and say hello to the movie title, GRAVITY!<br/><br/>So far Sandra has survived a meteorite space debris shellacking, a free fall through the universe, an empty tank of oxygen and her adventure is just beginning. She then has to survive her space capsule catching on fire, a second and third rotation of the space debris hurtling at her, until lo and behold she finds a Chinese satellite that she quickly learned to operate, although it appeared to also be out of gas.<br/><br/>Sandra eventually finds a way to propel the Chinese satellite back towards earth and before it evaporates from the intense heat when re- entering the Earth's atmosphere, Sandra lands it in the ocean, and whilst opening the space shuttle door the water pressure submerges her and the craft to the bottom of the ocean and she then calmly swims to the surface.<br/><br/>Two subtle changes I would have made to Gravity is I would have asked Hilary Swank to replace Sandra Bullock in the lead role and when Sandra (or Hilary) popped their head to the surface from the ocean floor I think the ending would have been great if a Sea-Doo went flying by them and smacked them in the head. Gravity was a bit of a downer."

","Saw this last night, and was pleasantly surprised. Here the Thomapl review: ""This nail-biting quasi-sci-fi 3-D drama with a cast of two is not so much about an outer space tragedy/accident as it is about a kind, strong, good-hearted man helping a scientist overcome her fears, grief, and insecurities in the gentlest, most patient manner. It's about a good man who helps a good woman become better. It could easily have been the other way 'round. Think Sally Ride rather than Sandra Bullock. I won't give away any of the plot turns or denouement but watch it through my lens and I ga-run-tee you'll enjoy it. I give it an A."""

","Grave is when you can't say thanks.<br/><br/>""I'm the sort of character who's got to have an anchor. I want to be around immovable objects."" That was part of the answers of the Irish singer Paul David Hewson, known worldwide as Bono, in the very extensive interview by Jann S. Wenner, one of the founders of Rolling Stone, which is published in the issue 986 November 3, 2005. (Also in the official site of this award-winning journalist www.jannswenner.com) I suspect that like this lead singer, many of us like to know where we are stand, knowing the ground beneath our feet. As much as we seek change, at the end of the day we all want to return to that space we know well. And we know it's always there. It is the site that doesn't move. At the end of the story, we like to come back to our refuge, our corner ... our anchor.<br/><br/>I made this long detour to say that I'm fascinated and want to tell you to go to cinema to see the last Sandra Bullock movie: Gravity. Of course, this is my opinion, and the film might be a waste, as one friend of mine think. To him it seemed bad at acting, in narrative (awful monologue, according to him), in plot and everything. A trash. I would argue the opposite. Maybe it's a matter of taste. Or maybe not. For there say that everyone sees things with different lenses.<br/><br/>In my view, I'm not an expert in films, the film is a staging of modern man (I'm also including the women, just in case). It's as if the director (an artist) would say: look, no matter how far you've come with your power, your money, your knowledge, your science and your inventions, you have no control of everything. You're not as powerful as you think. So, be grateful with what you have and try to make peace with life, with others, don't be bitter or afraid... in the end, you always need your neighbor, although he doesn't think like you, or speak different language.<br/><br/>Gravity is a journey into space, but I think it is also a journey into us. After that chaotic, bumpy and harrowing journey of Dr. Ryan to space, back to earth she's no longer the same. I must say that I also loved the George Clooney character, the veteran commander Kowalski. It's a realized man, at peace with himself and his life. A happy man able to give his own life for others (she, in this case). A man capable of service and sacrifice (something unthinkable for our politicians, regardless of their color). I don't want to talk about the stress experienced during the hour and a half of the film. I don't want to talk about the plot. I just want to end by saying that the end of this film is beautiful. Nothing like coming home, nothing like returning to what is firm and steady as a rock, where nothing is relative, but safe and will hold ... And nothing like being thankful.<br/><br/>Just one question to finish¬Ö To Whom do you think Dr. Ryan Stone says thanks? Go to the theatre to watch Gravity. ""Thanks."""
"Jackkrsk","10","2","4","23 October 2013"," ""Gravity is one of the best films of the year!""
","The recently released space thriller film, ""Gravity"" (which I watched in the movie theaters about three weeks ago) focuses on the innovative tale spin story about hope and survival in space (In other words, original, intense and thrilling plot). <br/><br/>For astronaut films, watching ""Gravity"" is like watching a hi-tech version and exact opposite of ""The Right Stuff"" (1983). It's also the exact opposite of other survival films such as ""Alive,"" ""Cast Away,"" and ""127 hours."" Watching the suspense thrills in ""Gravity"" will have your heart pounding (which I felt when I first saw it).<br/><br/>The two surviving astronauts were brilliantly portrayed by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Their performances are all the more brilliant because they have never been in this type of survival picture or have played these types of characters. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie and Robert Downey were originally cast as the two main characters, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. After Jolie dropped out, other actresses such as Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts, Natalie Portman, Marion Cotillard, Abbie Cornish, Carey Mulligan, Sienna Miller, Scarlett Johansson, Blake Lively, Rebecca Hall and Olivia Wilde were all subsequently tested or approached for the lead role, but it was Bullock who landed the lead. <br/><br/>The film also costars Ed Harris as the voice of mission control.<br/><br/>The thrilling plot is about a medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) who is a mission specialist on her first space shuttle mission along with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) commanding his final flight before retiring. <br/><br/>Disaster ensues during a spacewalk when asteroid pieces and the remains of a space satellite hit the shuttle where the two astronauts are working. The two are separated and left adrift in space leaving you to witness their fight for survival. <br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron, who also directed the film, wrote a great original screenplay for this film. Before ""Gravity"" there had not been a disaster film involving astronauts - that's part of what helps make the screenplay so great. Although ""Gravity"" does not involve terrifying extraterrestrials killing humans as in Ridley Scott's ""Alien,"" when it comes to survival and suspense thrills, this film does not disappoint. <br/><br/>Every motion cinematic shots of this film was wonderfully taken by the amazing Emmanuel Lubezki, who also worked on Cuaron's ""Children of Men."" The cinematography shots of outer space are one of the great things of this film. It's not just this, it's so far one of the best cinematographies of this decade along with ""Black Swan"", ""127 Hours"", ""The Tree of Life""etc. The cinematography is truly unbelievable in this film.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is one of the best movies so far of this year. The tremendous special effects, space survival story, cinematography and acting makes this film so enjoyable. I also loved the 91 minutes of the green screen effects. The talent director picked the perfect two A-list movie stars. <br/><br/>If this film is nominated for an Oscar for Best Special Effects, I would put my money on it. I also think this film should be one of the nominees for Best Picture of the year. I would choose this film because it includes that 20% drama (most Oscar nominated films are dramatic). There were two astronaut films which have been both nominated for Best Picture: ""The Right Stuff"" and ""Apollo 13."" Given its genre, it would be a significant milestone if ""Gravity"" took home the Oscar for Best Picture.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is still out in theaters and it's worth buying a ticket to see the movie. For people who haven't seen a good astronaut flick in a long time, go see this one. I also recommend this film for astronomers and NASA scientists. You all should see it before it comes out on Blu-ray.<br/><br/>I give the film a powerful four out of four stars.<br/><br/>This film is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Existential terror and the salty language.<br/><br/>Cast & crew info:<br/><br/>Directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n; written by Alfonso Cuar√≥n and Jon√°s Cuar√≥n; director of photography, Emmanuel Lubezki; edited by Alfonso Cuar√≥n and Mark Sanger; music by Steven Price; production design by Andy Nicholson; costumes by Jany Temime; visual effects by Tim Webber; produced by Alfonso Cuar√≥n and David Heyman.<br/><br/>Released by Warner Brothers Pictures. <br/><br/>Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes.<br/><br/>Starting: Sandra Bullock (Ryan Stone), George Clooney (Matt Kowalski) and Ed Harris (Voice of mission control)."
"hannah-barry-824-673630","5","2","4","22 October 2013"," Cringe-worthy and overdone typical Hollywood Film
","Suggested to me by a friend that this was a film of the year by critics and the likes I tried to be open-minded to it, however as soon as I heard the main roles were played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney I thought why bother. But eventually was asked to go along to the cinemas and thought hey maybe Ill be surprised...I wasn't.<br/><br/>It was hard to take either of the main characters seriously and see them as who they are in this film when you know the roles they have played previously. The film would have done much better with lesser known Hollywood actors so you could actually become attached to them as a person not just another actor. The film tried too hard to make you feel attached to the characters too quickly with traumatic/real experiences told of their past, however with unbelievable acting I was no more attached to them even when they were on the verge of death or getting lost in space.<br/><br/>Typical one liners made the film tacky eg. 'Its not Rocket Science', 'Half of north America just lost their Facebook and 'I need Space'; I don't see why Hollywood films feel the need to put in lame jokes like this, maybe to distract us that the movie is actually quite mundane and has no plot? Either way I felt this ruined some of the film when it actually could have taken a serious turn.<br/><br/>Cutting to a few scenes after George Clooney finally disappears into the universe, Bullock is left all on her lonesome and with her own stupidity. Yes its Space and you are all alone but there seemed to be too many cases where Bullock was found incompetent of doing the basic of tasks regardless of her first mission in space.<br/><br/>Overdone symbolism such as Bullock spinning in front of the spacecraft window in fetal position and when she crawls out of the riverbed like a fish from evolution was cringe worthy; too much emphasis was on the meaning of life and hope, again overdone. The movie could have done with less music which distracted from what was actually going on; space is described as lonesome and isolated this could have been more obvious without the distraction of music and rather the silence of space.<br/><br/>As usual the typical Hollywood film ends on a high Bullock survives and realizes how lucky she is to be back on earth and feel the beauty of simple things like grains of sand through her fingertips, and what a wonderful feeling/atmosphere that mother earth is after being is such a 'vast place like space'.<br/><br/>After all this I can definitely appreciate the special effects of the film and it only being 90minutes long. Wish I could say more about this film but I left feeling as I expected; unaffected."
"pablo2896","10","2","4","20 October 2013"," Sandra Bullock floating around is a surprisingly stunning experience
","Space... the final frontier... of near death and thrilling situations. That sums the movie up. If we left out the jaw dropping ambiance, scenery and cinematography. When the first cut in this movie happened I clapped. Wanna know why? Because it doesn't happen till 3 minutes into the movie when the satellite debry starts cutting through dudes faces. That is masterpiece editing done by the proud Mexican (I'm Mexican) Alfonso Cuar√≥n. The flowing of every scene is smooth but tense at the same time. You gasp for air and control when you are put in Bullock's point of view while she spins into the nothingness of space. And those scenes last... and are absolutely beautifully choreographed. The tense atmosphere that Cuar√≥n achieves doesn't let go of you until the last second of the movie for you to realize how sweaty you are. The script and dialogue aren't something to be amazed about, but the acting makes up for it. The charm and charisma of Clooney are entertaining and you really believe some of the scenes done by Sandra Bullock who plays this really unlucky (but at the same time lucky?) astronaut. Cuar√≥n achieves greatness with eye popping visuals and a surprisingly low (for the things you experience in the movie) budget and that is something you don't see that often. I can really see some Oscar statues in Cuaron's pocket in 2014."
"lasttimeisaw","9","2","4","20 October 2013"," Gravity - Wow!
","Travel in India, but I will never miss any chance to experience a cinema-going activity in any exotic locale, not to mention it is Alfonso Cuar√≥n's GRAVITY, the sensationally topical follow-up to CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10), a firmly prospective Oscar-bait and is on its way to procure an unanimous triumph from both audiences and critics, domestically and internationally, a rare feat which is hailed as the most innovative film in executing the ubiquitous 3D technology after AVATAR (2009, 9/10). <br/><br/>I was at a relatively large 3D screen hall, but if you can find a screen with IMAX plus 3D, which is the quintessential option. The film runs a succinct 96-minutes, at first I found myself a bit distracted by the murkiness of the screen with the clumsy 3D glasses double-glazing my myopic spectacles, one primary reason why I don't enjoy 3D films on the whole, so as to I didn't quite adjust myself to appreciate the opening scene, thankfully a belated captivation comes when the debris attacks, this survival tale begins to gnaw at its audience in a very good and exciting way. <br/><br/>Floating in the infinite emptiness, the extremity of terror and helplessness is oppressive and overwhelming, Sandra Bullock confidently and believably pilots us into a journey of wonders, we don't know what's the odds here for her to pull it off the miraculous landing on earth, it is her relentless mettle and stamina shock us, inspire us and strike a chord with us. Bullock's hallmark of underplaying her character's choppy emotion does a clean sweep to deliver a top-notch impact in spite of a comparatively thin script, it is a tour-de-force performance in her career and a hard-earned honor for an actress who can overcome the glass ceiling to lead a commercially prosperous Sci-Fi fare in her age (what's more important, she is also a top-billing comedian presently). Clooney serves slickly as the experienced but not-too-lucky astronaut, most of the time he is hidden inside the space helmet and uniform, but generates a wake-up call on the nose when he displays his usual Clooney-esque mien, Cuar√≥n does know what audiences want. <br/><br/>GRAVITY is a ground-breaker, a high-tech adventurer and seeker, and fingers crossed it will eventually give DP Emmanuel Lubezki his overdue golden statue after 5 nominations (divinely shot scenes include the trademark ever-rotating long takes, the resurrection emblem of a fetus inside the uterus, the final victory when she rises out of the sea as a giantess, etc.), maybe for Cuar√≥n and his sterling production team as well (sound department, art production and visual stunt). It is a film beyond everyone's imagination and it edifies you so much with so little to tell, like an essay, it is concise but cogent, and with a collateral effect to blow your mind. <br/><br/>PS: I am planning a rematch when the picture will arrive at the end of November in China, hopefully in an IMAX screen finally."

The story was okay, and the characters were 2-dimensional, and the story arc was terribly predictable.<br/><br/>I knew the entire plot from the moment that the astronauts' radios announced that there was debris coming their way -- I knew the rest of the film's plot all the way until the final shot of the film, which took a long time to get to.<br/><br/>I liked the film a lot, though.

"ricardopthomaz","10","2","4","18 October 2013"," Sheer brilliance! A breathtaking experience!
","God, I don't even know where to begin... this is simply one of the best space dramas I've ever seen in my life! The script, amazing, the photography, breathtaking, the concepts, mesmerizing!!<br/><br/>It's an experience best taken if you sit down and pay all the attention you can. Don't go to this movie eating popcorn, it's distracting! I did eat something just before I enter the theater and I'm glad I did! Believe me, this movie is enough food for thought alone, and it's just amazing! Suspenseful, tense and at times reflexive, thoughtful.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is an astronaut that has her team injured during a mission on the Hubble satellite. With 10% of oxygen in her space suit she's saved by Clooney's character and gets to the space station safely and there she has to face some difficulties. Through her personal journey we come to know her past and her struggle to overcome the difficult path to personal growth, acceptance of her own mortality and building of a new perspective, not like the person she was when she signed for the mission, but as a different person.<br/><br/>And when we finally get in contact with her past and her inner ghosts until the moment of the final climax, the catharsis in the end of the movie goes deeper and I just can't avoid not to give a standing ovation to the final outcome! The final scene (SPOILERS AHEAD) of her, stepping into land again, the shots making her seem like a giant, those were poetic visuals, beautiful, breathtaking and I couldn't applaud enough! It evokes a sense of inner looking of the human soul, a lot of philosophy and it completely blows your mind with the journey. One of the most remarkable scene was the fetus scene. If you saw the movie, you'll get it. It's amazing!!<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie enough!! Go see it!! Feel it, experience it!<br/><br/>I went to see it twice and I'm still awed by it! It's a real memorable experience!<br/><br/>Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n excels himself and crafts his crowning achievement with this one! Well done!! I went over the final credits with a heavy chin, wondering how to talk, how to debate. If you like Science-Fiction and Space Movies, then this movie is for you! Don't miss it!!"
"bobbystryker","10","2","4","17 October 2013"," Gravity, a force to be reckoned with!!! Possibly the best film you'll see this year! Read on to find out why!
","When was the last time you saw a movie that was receiving rave reviews all around and then you saw it and it somehow exceeded all your expectations? I don't know about you, but I can't remember the last time that happened to me. I know some of you will talk about the Dark Knight movies but they never really did it for me. Gravity, on the other hand, wow! Simply, wow!<br/><br/>I was like a lot of people, I saw the trailer, I saw Sandra Bullock spinning round and round in space and I couldn't help but wonder how they could possibly make a whole movie about that. I actually thought it looked kinda lame. To compound things further, I've never been a fan of Sandra Bullock. She was amusing in Demolition Man, did what she had to do in Speed, but then fell into meaningless movie obscurity all they way until her Oscar for The Blind Side in 2009. I am now happy to say, after watching Gravity; I am a full Sandra Bullock convert! 100%! She completely owned this movie!<br/><br/>Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (Clooney) are doing their last spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope when they receive news that high-speed debris is coming their way. What ensues, as can be seen in the trailer, is more like a military missile attack throwing our leads out into space. Thankfully, the plot isn't about Sandra Bullock spinning around in space for 2 hours while helplessly calling for help, not at all. It's about the human spirit, the value of life, and our resilience in the face of adversity. <br/><br/>What ensues is probably the most tense and gripping hour and a half of cinema that I've every experienced. It's literally nail biting, sweat and palpitation inducing stuff. <br/><br/>Revealing anything more would really risk spoiling the experience for you. All I can say is that Sandra Bullock absolutely blew me away with her performance. If her performance had been weak then this movie simply would not have worked, but thankfully Bullock hit the nail on the head. Clooney is likewise; pretty much pitch perfect in his role as the veteran astronaut. <br/><br/>Even though she was frequently the only person on screen, I actually forgot I was watching Bullock because I was really so engrossed in what was going on. This is an acting masterclass. Dr. Stone exhibits uniquely human qualities we can all empathize with, her combination of strength and fragility, intelligence yet helplessness. It forces you to wonder what you would do if you were in that situation, whether you would just give up or whether you would keep on fighting. It's one of those films that makes you feel grateful to be alive, makes you want to live your life to the full and really cherish those that you love. I found myself thinking that I never ever want to go into space! Haha! <br/><br/>Gone was the usual audience chatter which is audible at the beginning of most movies seen at the cinema, instead the whole auditorium was hooked and silent from start to finish. The tension and suspense never relents, for which I'm sure a lot of the credit goes to director Alfonso Cuar√≥n (Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n, Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban). The first disaster scene is one long continuous shot, which is really testament to the directors' skill and vision as it really grabs you and never lets go.<br/><br/>Everything is just so damn fragile in space, every movement is so hard to make, just moving from one place to another and not being able to stop yourself from floating past at the risk of flying off to your death, it's all palpable thanks to expert directing, tremendous acting, perfect special effects as well as impressive 3D.<br/><br/>I loved the way they really stuck to the real world physics of the situations. Gone are the sounds of explosions, instead we have eerie large-scale destruction which is silent. It's surprisingly haunting and more so thanks to the compelling soundtrack.<br/><br/>This is an outstanding movie; I really can't recommend it enough to everyone, even if it's not the kind of film you normally go for. I thought that perhaps it would have limited replay value but, actually, I'm already looking forward to watching it again.<br/><br/>Gravity deserves all the praise it is receiving, Bullock deserves all the recognition she's receiving and this movie deserves to be watched by you.<br/><br/>Best film of the year and one to add to your list of movies to watch before you die.<br/><br/>Rating 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET"
"dognotbarking","9","2","4","16 October 2013"," A royal celebration of the essentials we take for granted
","This is not an adventure movie. Yes, there are some elements of thrill, and survival but they are, in my opinion, only there to convey a bigger story. And the bigger story reminds us of things we take for granted. Gravity, the title of the movie, is absent from the movie right up until the end, and we see how difficult this makes our lives. We don't need big aliens or psychopathic crew members to make our lives miserable in space. The space itself does that very elegantly. The idea that we can conquer the outer space is just too ignorant. The mere absence of gravity show how essential it is to our existence. In fact, there would be no life without it. The space is portrayed as a continuous threat, lacking any kind of comfort, and rightly so. Things that we do without thinking, like walking, standing, keeping our balance, finding our place in space, these become impossible tasks. The lack of oxygen does not help either, of course. When Bullock's character is first saved, she enters the station and reborn with oxygen, literally, as her body assumes fetus position with the cables imitating the umbilical cord. You see this and you say 'yes this is alfonso cuaron making good movies!' The whole movie is so brilliantly shot anyway. Another striking scene was right after she returns to the earth. The spacesuit which is indispensable for her survival in the space immediately becomes a problem once she is on earth. Very well filmed. She is born again, this time in the sea, and crawls back to the shore. She has to try hard to walk again, to readjust herself to earth. It is almost as difficult as the first step humankind had to walk as homo erectus. But she manages, because this is home, and here, there is everything we need to survive. Movie closes with her walking, doing the most mundane looking act, yet you may ask yourself, 'which is more important?Amstrong's first step on the moon, or our first step on earth?' Really, it took a lot of things to make both happen."

"JoshuaYoung","8","2","4","16 October 2013"," Definitely worth seeing, but where is 'Canada' on the Canadarm?
","I struggled with giving this an eight or nine out of ten. The acting was amazing! And the storytelling fantastic. This movie could have been called Suspense and Stress and it would have been more accurate than Gravity.lol. Of course that's a terrible title and I'm happy they went with Gravity.<br/><br/>Many have noted plenty of inconsistencies, for example the fact that nobody's hair floats in space in this movie. My big issue is the fact that the Canadarm, the long arm Sandra Bullock is attached to for the first part of the movie, doesn't have 'Canada' written on its side like it does in real life. Some may argue, this is fiction and maybe it isn't the Canadarm. However, both the Director and Sandra talked about the Canadarm at the TIFF film festival and how it had to be destroyed along with everything else (slight spoiler but that's pretty much in the trailer). So it is in fact the Canadarm.<br/><br/>I remember going to the Kennedy Space Center and watching an IMAX film years ago about how real Astronauts used 'The Arm' as they called it, to save a satellite. I wrote a complaint afterwards asking why it isn't called the Canadarm which is its actual name. The documentary confused the American viewers who were wondering why 'Canada' was written on the side. I thought that would be the last time I saw this lack of care put into Canada's contribution to the space program.<br/><br/>So that's my slight rant about that. Can you imagine the response if Canadian's did a space movie with American Astronauts and left out the American flag patch on their arms? I believe this movie deserves many Oscars and I'm recommending it to all my friends. I'm just a bit sad they left out giving the credit for one of the more important pieces of technology that has helped the space program. Although all technology is vital of course. This was just a big part of it all."

Performances are top notch, Clooney keeps the humorous moments at bay for the most part, and Bullock gives a very realistic performance that is Oscar worthy.

"koen_smit","9","2","4","15 October 2013"," This is what 3D is developed for
","Wow, what a movie. This one is definitely made for a 3D experience and that adds a lot to the eerie emptiness of space. Well, not so empty as there is a lot of debris passing by every 1,5 hours. As a quite inexperienced space-walker, the main character, Ryan (Sandra Bullock) has to survive the multiple attacks by the debris destroying everything on it's path. At first she is still helped by the very experienced astronaut (George Clooney) but she dramatically loses him and turns out to be the sole survivor trying to make her way back to earth.<br/><br/>The way it is filmed, with the use of the 3D and the zero gravity makes this movie a very interesting and scary experience. The camera sometimes takes the point of view of Ryan and you feel the panic and need to survive. Even when she's about to give up you do understand and of course hope that she'll find her survival instinct back. You start learning bit by bit about her background, the loss she had and how she (not) deals with that. In the silence and emptiness of space this all gets a deeper meaning. <br/><br/>I've enjoyed this movie since the first second it started and was in full awe with the images of earth, space and the debris that wreaks havoc with every possible exit. The storyline is about survival, but with adding the background story of Ryan it's so much more than that. Bullock may be nominated for an Oscar for this movie. I think she deserves to win it as well."

Sandra is feeling sick of being in space, if only the poor girl knew about what's coming next... After a few minutes of jokes and awkward space walking, the Astronauts are warned by Mission control (Houston as usual) that Russians have fired a missile into space to destroy one of their satellites, causing multiple debris to fly at high speed into their direction (the debris destroyed other satellites on their way causing a snowball effect, that will eventually destroy all satellites and space stations around the Earth, including the ISS: if there were no Russians, life would be boring). And so it begins. The Indian guy is taken out immediately and spectacularly (it was a second character anyway, no biggie), Sandra uncontrollably spins out of orbit and drifts into deep space, only George stays in control, of course. The rest of the movie is a story about survival in impossible space vacuum conditions, a fight against emptiness, a fight against our own self.<br/><br/>From the very first moment you dive directly into the suffocation, panic, despair and uncontrollable fear displayed by the characters, very well mixed with quite impressive sound and visual effects. The movie, although not without some unrealistic scenes, feels highly real on your skin, is very well paced and takes your breath away quite a few times. The show will tear you apart between magnificent views of our planet and the blood freezing context of life in space. After this, it's good to feel alive and on Earth! Definitely worth watching."

","The problem with this movie is the story. It is contrived. It is also an amalgam of two other movies: Alien, directed by Ridley Scott, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The movie should be complemented for drawing on the work of two such illustrious directors. Now, the movie is well-crafted, meaning that is well made: excellent cinematography, good attention to details, good continuity and above all a strong performance by Sandra Bullock, who saves this movie from hokeydom. Although she does not achieve the level of dramatic tension attained by Sigourney Weaver in Alien, her performance nonetheless is worthy of positive note. Basically, this is Bullock's movie; George Clooney plays a supportive role. Actually, this movie may have worked better if it had featured Bullock alone, floating in space, trying to survive. One thing about Sandra Bullock: it is hard to dislike her screen presence in any of her movies. The story though is so predictable. Accidents happen, even in space, and this movie includes some spectacular shots of things blowing up and falling apart and burning up. So for a CG person, this movie is wonderful. Maybe the story would have been even stronger if it had contained no dialog whatsoever, just a human being, man or woman, trapped in a space suit hundreds of miles above the earth. If anyone decides to make that movie - remember you got the idea from pwnycny."
"WWJDWITHCA","8","2","4","15 October 2013"," Worth Going to but....
","I really like this film, and I believe that most will enjoy it, so I highly recommend the movie for people to go and see, but is this movie great, like people are calling it? Certainly not! Is it great because it's technically excellent from a cinematic perspective? Yes, but the story telling of this film really falls short in the second half of the picture, and it's only 90 minutes long. Sandra Bulluck could not carry the film on her own, and I'm aghast at anyone who says she did. To say she deserves an Oscar is quite ridiculous because the film tapers off so quickly when she becomes lead that they had to bring Clooney's character, Matt Kowalsky back for a ""cameo"" to make the film interesting again, and I'm a person that really likes Sandra Bulluck. Her best line, ""I've got a bad feeling about this mission"" was completely setup by the Kowalsky character as well.<br/><br/>Great cinematography, great story telling for 45 minutes, but almost an absolute bore for 45 minutes. One of the biggest issues with comedies is that are almost always funny during the setup portion of the film, but cannot hold anything during the remaining portions, and Gravity Unfortunately befalls the same fate. This movie has allot of parallels to the film ""Open Water"", which was compelling throughout. The cheesy Hollywood ending of Gravity just shows to this day that brass in Los Angeles still have not guts and had to make this movie more palatable for the general public when more than any film (maybe) I've ever seen demanded a different outcome."
"ajit2106","8","2","4","15 October 2013"," ""Gravity"" is one hell of a ride..
","The excellent staging is impressive and disturbing influenced by the strong acting performance by Sandra Bullock. Impressive, especially when you she was not the first choice for the role of Dr. Ryan Stone considering.<br/><br/>For the physician, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) it is the first trip in space. It is with the crew of the shuttle in the orbit Explorer to install a new module on the Hubble Space Telescope. She is with the experienced astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). Shortly before the completion of their work for outdoor use, the Explorer receives the message from Mission Control in Houston, that in a test, a Russian satellite was destroyed. The resulting debris destroyed in a chain reaction of other satellites.<br/><br/>The resulting debris field races with more than 35,000 kilometers per hour around the Earth in an orbit that crosses the Explorer. Stone and Kowalski are warned but they do have time to react. What remains is the flight to the International Space Station before their oxygen runs out ‚Äì it begins the struggle for survival.<br/><br/>Due to the deafening silence they know that they have lost contact with the ground ... and thus any chance of rescue. Their fear turns into panic, while every breath reduced their small supply of oxygen.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron delivers one of the best films of recent times in which the presentation, the narrative pulse, sound design, installation, photography, everything seems close to the perfection. Stunning images, captivating atmosphere, dramatic events, and all perfectly accompanied by harmonious sounds. No symbols, metaphors, and messages tucked inside the story that asks the audience to interpret themselves.<br/><br/>However, if someone is hoping a futuristic space adventure with plenty of action, will surely be disappointed. ""Gravity"" is quiet but fascinating, credible and genuine because we get to understand that space is beautiful and cruel at the same time. It is a visually stunning sci-fi drama with grandiose and impressive 3D effects. Most small movements are choreographed and performed with the utmost care, because in many cases the actors as a kind of puppet supported to convey the illusion of weightlessness.<br/><br/>If cinema is a visual media, I think this is the best example we will encounter of this wonder of cinema. The photography by of Emmanuel Lubezki and the music by Steven Price enrich the visual nuances.<br/><br/>With 91 minutes of runtime,"" Gravity"" is extremely short, Alfonso Cuar√≥n focused on a dense narrative that fascinates the first few minutes rather than unnecessary points to draw the story in the length, as soon as the danger is noticeable it grabs the attention and seamlessly goes until the end."
"estebangonzalez10","9","2","4","14 October 2013"," A perfect combination of the beauty and horror of space
","""It's time to stop driving. It's time to go home.""<br/><br/>There are so many great things I want to say about this movie that it's very hard to decide where to begin. I could mention how breathtaking and spectacular the visuals were, or how powerful Sandra Bullock's performance was, or how tense and gripping the film was, or how well this film established its narrative structure of a simple survival story, but I would have to begin by saying this is the scariest space has been since Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi film, Alien. Alfonso Cuaron had several years to prepare for this film and he had big shoes to fill because his latest film, Children of Men, was a spectacular thriller. Let me begin by saying he doesn't disappoint because Gravity is even more mind blowing than that film was. The vastness and emptiness of space turns out to be the greatest villain here and Cuaron does a masterful job at letting us experience that fear on a personal level. The movie is only 90 minutes long but at the end you walk out feeling physically weak after experiencing so much tension. All the hype the film is getting is totally justified, and not just because it's visually stunning, but because it is a completely well crafted movie. I thought Avatar was visually stunning, but I still didn't like that movie very much, so it takes more than that to get me on board and Cuaron did it thanks to a great script and a powerful performance from Sandra Bullock. The tone of the film and the attention to detail is truly unique and that is what makes this film stand out above all the other thousands of space movies we've seen. The long shots Cuaron loves to incorporate in his films never worked so much to his advantage as they do here adding to the vastness of space. I really want to experience this film on IMAX because I'm sure it is all the more breathtaking and worthwhile. This is a wonderful film that will end up on many critics top film lists. Gravity manages to draw you into space and experience it in first person. It is as if Cuaron put us inside Bullock's space suit and let the camera be our eyes. Gravity is an overwhelming experience and one you shouldn't miss out on. It is something special.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple: Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer who is on her first space mission working on a satellite. She went through months of training for this specific mission. Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) on the other hand is an experienced astronaut who is in command of this, his last mission. Matt is a self loving guy who enjoys every second of his work, while Ryan is quiet and tries to keep to herself. She seems to enjoy the quietness of space, but she herself has experienced tragedy in her life and hasn't been able to move on. She focuses on her work and nothing else. During their routine mission Matt and Ryan receive a message from Earth telling them to return to the space shuttle as soon as possible because the debris from a satellite explosion is heading their way. As we see from the trailers, the debris reaches them before they can get onboard and all of a sudden Matt and Ryan are left all alone drifting through the vastness and darkness of space trying to survive.<br/><br/>Gravity may not be a character driven film, but the entire movie serves as a sort of metaphor for Ryan's life. She mentions how she spends most of her days simply driving around without a purpose in life and now she is drifting alone through the emptiness of space. Clooney plays a supporting role here but his character plays a key role in Ryan's transformation. At first she is just overwhelmed by the entire incident without a clue as to what she has to do and dependent on Matt, but he manages to calm her down and convince her that she has to fight for survival. Life is worth living despite the terrible incidents we experience. We can either let it suck our souls and simply drift and continue on living without a purpose, or we can rise to the challenge and fight those obstacles and find meaning and joy in life. I think that is the core message of Gravity under all the breathtaking visual accomplishments. It is a simple story about survival with an impeccable performance from Sandra Bullock, breathtaking cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki (The Tree of Life), and it is technically perfect. This is probably the closest I will ever be to experiencing space. The film perfectly balances the beauty of space with its horror and you should experience it through the biggest screen your city has to offer because it is a rewarding journey."

","It's every kid's dream to go into space and one day venture into our Universe. With our galaxy alone being so large, it's no wonder that becoming an astronaut is a dream for many people since it is a chance for silence, beauty and peace. <br/><br/>But what if there was suddenly no one to hear you. The black space full of stars was now filled with shrapnel headed towards you at very fast speeds. What if you no longer had no control over yourself?<br/><br/>Gravity is an excellent movie with arguably Sandra Bullock's best performance of her career. With George Clooney as the perfect co-astronaut, the exceptional casting in this film definitely helped. The thought of wandering the Universe and exploring the unknown ends is a dream to some while drifting away without end is a nightmare for others. <br/><br/>Overall, Gravity is a great film due not only to its superb special effects or compelling acting, but because it strokes the strings in every person's heart for adventure and thrill. It is a reminder of what our Universe has to offer and the potential for all that can happen to us."

"JPfanatic93","8","2","4","13 October 2013"," A superior space experience that must be seen on the silver screen to be believed
","It is rare these days to encounter effects in movies that look so astounding that they pull the audience in completely and won't let go until the credits roll. After twenty-odd years of increasing overuse of CGI, it seemed positive that everything had been done, also owing to the plethora of home video releases containing behind-the-scenes footage that reveals in detail the tricks of the trade, thus enhancing the audience's expertise on what is real and what is not when watching a film. It has diminished the emotional impact of the contemporary blockbuster, which often tends to rely heavily on such big budget effects work, because we spectators think we've seen it all and know it all by now. But once in a while a movie comes along that does manage to sweep us off our feet entirely and immerses us completely into the world its director has envisioned for our viewing pleasure. In such uncommon cases, the often derogatory term 'effects film' turns out both wholly justified and incorrect: the effects it contains do not make a film, but instead engage us into a full fledged cinematic experience we cannot help but be captivated by so strongly that all we can do is undergo it until it releases its grip on us. And then we still sit back in awe for a while longer, with that most pertinent of questions firmly on our minds: how on Earth did they do that?! Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) has crafted just such a fantastic experience with Gravity, a superior science-fact feature that adheres to the laws of physics but constructs its own laws in terms of what you can accomplish cinematographically these days. From a narrative point of view it's simply the struggle of two astronauts (George Clooney and Sandra Bullock) to survive in our planet's orbit after their space shuttle has been devastated by space debris caused by the demolition of a Russian satellite. In every other regard, there is nothing simple about Gravity.<br/><br/>It is most definitely one of the greatest accomplishments in the field of visual effects and 3-D technology in recent years and an incredible tour-de-force on the part of both actors whose capabilities are put to the most extreme test imaginable. In fact, you are pulled in so deeply you neither have the time nor the interest to agree the story is pretty bare and the few attempts at introducing deeper levels of character development ‚Äì including Bullock's character still trying to cope with the death of her young daughter ‚Äì don't add all that much to the protagonists' plight. We run with them because we cannot help but feel we are one of them, and we too must get out of this ordeal in one piece before time (and oxygen) runs out. Applying his signature use of the 'long take', Cuaron opens the movie on a quiet, peaceful note as we witness ""our fellow astronauts"" working on a telescope, a job that suddenly turns extremely hazardous as the debris field hits their workplace hard, cutting them loose, adrift into the endless black ocean of space: all in a single, apparently uninterrupted shot (though few will actually consider that fact as we are already engaged fully by this point). We're slowly introduced to their Zero-G environment, but soon must deal with intense camera movements as we float around the shuttle in fast motions at first, and soon almost unchecked as the mission is spiralling out of control. Their spacecraft lost, our fellow pair of astronauts must make its way to the ISS before it too gets hit by the rubble, and before they run out of breathable air, if they ever hope to get back down to Earth. Unfortunately physics don't make it easy on them and reaching their goal appears ever more hopeless. All to our benefit, as we are treated to some of the most spectacular visual imagery seen on the big screen in years. Gravity is a prime showcase of what 3-D can add to a film other than a higher admission price. Not only is the cinematography breathtaking, we feel part of a three-dimensional environment at all times, surrounded by pieces of space rubble on every side, or Bullock's sweat and tears when we are locked in an escape pod with her in very close quarters. The intricate shots of floating equipment and people going up, over and around each other adds a layer of depth that is not likely to be surpassed in film any time soon. Even though the lack of sound in space deprives us of an auditory experience the likes of Star Wars, the immersive visuals make us forget all about any lack where other sense are concerned. Credit is also due to the seasoned actors, Bullock in particular, that make the whole experience feel that much more convincing ‚Äì though the effect the film has on our stomachs does half their work already ‚Äì by delivering excellent performances few of their colleagues could have matched as they play off against each other and... yes, against what else, exactly? How much, if anything, of what we seen on screen was there to aid them? Even for a trained eye, it's nigh impossible to tell where the real setting ends and the fictional construct begins. Yet we never get the feeling we are watching visual effects, which is of course exactly the trick such effects aim to pull off: don't let the audience know you are only an effect. The result is a staggering, completely compelling cinematic experience, one best seen on the big screen as it is doubtful its full physical and emotional impact is done justice on a home cinema release, though hopefully the latter can tell us just how Cuaron and his team managed to accomplish this extraordinary feat. One thing is for sure, Gravity is gravitating towards well deserved Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematography Oscars."
"ourson66","8","2","4","13 October 2013"," Gravity lacks Gravitas
","Alfonso Cuar√≥n is a brilliant technical director, known for peppering his films with impossible shots (like Gravity's epic opening 17 minute tracking shot, his camera seemingly floating lazily in space with his characters). Indeed, the technical achievement in Gravity is glorious, the sumptuous visuals and constantly flowing camera-work giving a visceral sense of what it must be like to be orbiting Earth in zero-g. This is particularly true in 3D, so unless you are prone to motion sickness, I would highly recommend trying to see this in 3D, something I don't normally recommend. Cuar√≥n's handling of the film's pacing is similarly excellent. Any reviewers you read that call this film ""boring"" have obviously been watching too many video games, or were put off by the lack of hyperactive editing (there are a great many very long free-moving shots in the film), because the film's running time is a very short 91 minutes, and the action begins within the first 5, and doesn't let up until almost the very last frame.<br/><br/>Where the film lacks, is in story. It's a difficult story to manage well on film, because there are only two characters whose faces you see on screen at all, so the entire weight of the film falls squarely upon the shoulders of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, and the believability of their performances. In this regard, the film is in good hands, because regardless of whether or not you like the characters they portray, both actors turn in solid, nuanced, utterly real performances that, especially for Sandra Bullock, are nothing short of jaw-dropping. The real problem with the story in Gravity is that the characters' back-story, some of which is pivotal to the understanding of the film, can only be revealed by the characters themselves (in monologues, essentially), due to the lack of other characters in the film and the disjointed, each-in-their-own-spacesuit nature of their interactions. This leads to some pretty on-the-nose dialogue and exposition, which detracts from an otherwise exhilarating experience.<br/><br/>The only other complaint I have about the film is the score, which swings between silent and overblown far too quickly, and far too often. There are also some fairly significant scientific errors that will annoy the sci-fi crowd, but shouldn't detract from the film for the less scientifically-inclined. Still, this is an intelligent, visually stunning film, a thing of beauty that is very definitely worth a visit to the theatre (especially if you are going to see it in 3D)."

","Gravity is Life Of Pi of 2013. It's a story of survival, courage and human fighting spirit in the endless darkness of space. Like Life of Pi, 3D and CGI here are not just to make more money. The state of the art technology is being used as the storytelling tool and to make your experience immersive. Every frame is picture perfect and the excellent use of background score, camera work, acting and dialogs make most of the scenes memorable. Sandra Bullock as the central character does the astounding job and George Clooney provides the much needed lightness to the otherwise tense plot. There are numerous scenes which will stay with you especially the ones where our helpless characters struggling to stabilize in the gravity free world of space.

With a setup that initially seems indistinguishable from other films in this genre there's reason to be skeptical, but it immediately grabs you by the collar with a taut, multilayered story of strength, faith, and survival, and overwhelms you with some of the most arresting visual effects ever put on film. If there were ever a case to justify using 3-D for a mainstream Hollywood movie, this would definitely be it! Bullock easily gives the finest performance of her career, creating genuine pathos and conveying a gamut of emotions that have not yet been seen in her previous efforts. To see it any other way than on the big screen would be an absolute crime. ***¬Ω"
"maiden22","8","2","4","6 October 2013"," A Wild Ride Well Worth the Price
","Let me preface this review with saying that I loved Gravity. I haven't had this much awe and tension in a movie in a very long time and this is almost entirely due to the the wonderful cinematography and masterful use of CGI by director Alfonso Cuaron and Emmanuel Lubezki. Never has a film put me in the mindset of what the emptiness of space really feels like. To be a tiny dot in the unforgiving mosaic of stars and the violent silence of infinite nothingness. To fall victim to the laws of physics we all take for granted on our calm blue sphere, to be thrown to the lions of loneliness.<br/><br/>The aspect of Gravity that, to me, is glaringly left out of the reviews I have read is the dialogue. Its stale, clich√© and conjured surprising feelings of discomfort while sitting in awe of every other aspect of the film. For any musicians, especially guitarists, it felt like watching a virtuosic guitarist playing the songs of Green Day with the New York Symphony. They script simply did not meet the HUGELY impressive space that Alfonso has created. By no means are George Clooney and Sandra Bullock a Daniel Day-Lewis but are nowhere near D- List actors. Not by name but by their own personal filmographies and notable performances prove them capable of carrying the weight of an emotional performance. While dialogue is scattered throughout the movie in-between amazing set pieces of destruction and computer generated beauty, the jarring blandness of the dialogue feels like speed bumps on the autobahn, ruining the high speed fun and terror of the main character of the film. Space.<br/><br/>The realism created by the visual effects team is so encompassing, you immediately lose yourself in the scale and emptiness of what's truly outside of Earth. The action in so perfectly placed you never once feel a lull in the film. From the initial destruction that sends Bullock hurdling through space, to the high speed fire chasing her through the International Space Station, to the edge of your seat second impact of debris from a destroyed Russian satellite you constantly feel like you as an audience member could be swept into black nothingness at any moment.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie (especially in IMAX 3D/3D) to anyone. It is fun, exciting, beautiful and terrifying throughout the hour and forty five minutes without letting up until the end credits roll. Come into it with the understanding that you will need to let the dialogue wash over you like the tiny waves in between the large breakers that make the ocean so terrifyingly fun. Just as Avatar did four years ago, Gravity sets the bar so high for what a CGI focused film can do to create a space that is simply not possibly with conventional movie making techniques. Go see this in theaters and do not wait for the DVD release, it is truly awe inspiring like nothing we have seen in quite some time."

","Alfonso Cuaron has done a very high level of technical work. Particularly in the first half hour you are severely stretched. The use of long plans made sense. These long plans allow you to focus more on the film and experience the horror of those astronauts. Watching on a small screen becomes a disaster. You need to watch on a very good screen. It is a great lesson to have such an impressive film from such a small subject and a simple script. The realism part can of course be discussed. Music is great to use. The song in the film's finale is really good."

","The emotion really wasn't there, but everything else within it was intense. The directing by Alfonso Cuaron couldn't have been done any better. The visuals couldn't have been anymore gorgeous and realistic. All of that comes with a solid neutral script, lots of suspenseful atmosphere, and a strong message on not giving up when all seems lost. How could people call is overrated and boring. It was not a pitch perfect masterpiece, but it is something special."

","Many blockbusters, no matter how good or bad they are, rarely feel at all personal. Gravity, however, is different. It's a feat of technical wizardry, of course, but setting the film in space was quite possibly the only way for director Alfonso Cuaron to tell the story he wanted to tell. Cuaron doesn't present space as a place of infinite possibility like Star Wars. He doesn't define it by the danger it might hold, like Ridley Scott did in Alien. Instead, he does something ingenious: he uses space as a blank canvas; a completely neutral background on which he paints his characters in vivid detail. After a while, the fact that the characters aren't even on Earth simply stops registering, and elegantly gives way to various situations that test the astronauts' capabilities to their limits. Gravity is a remarkable achievement, and one of the year's best. There are more technically advanced movies in 2013. Some are also smarter. But none have yet achieved such a perfect balance of the two."

Seen it in 3d first then upgraded to imax, which made it even better. I then watched it on my phone & still love it & lastly on dvd, & it is just as good on all formats, which just proves how outstanding this film is.

","This movie opens with a continuously shot scene which is amazingly choreographed and extremely immersive. The clash of dialogue and gradually building music are very well made elements and by the time the debris hits, for the third time ever I actually have butterflies from movie tension. This scene is so well made and tense that if the rest of the movie had been as good, I probably would have said it was one of the best sci-fi movies to date.<br/><br/>However, the rest of the film plays out like your average Day After Tomorrow disaster film, mainly consisting of Sandra Bullock failing to grab onto things and getting unrealistically lucky the whole time. In some ways the story feels well written in the way that new complications keep arising, in others it just feels like the writers are pulling every single possible complication out of their heads to extend this to feature length.<br/><br/>There is also a scene where a character who died in the beginning comes back in a vision that Dr. Stone has. Not only is this uninventive, but because neither the audience nor Stone actually got attached to this character, it means that she is just hoping for something to save herself, which makes her really unlikable.<br/><br/>And a lot of the scenes attempt to heighten tension just by making Stone not be able to do something that should be easy. Heck, she nearly drowns right at the end just because she was being slow to get out. And somewhere or other, there are some scientific inaccuracies to complain about.<br/><br/>That said, this is still the best disaster movie ever made. That's not saying much, but it does better.

","Ok I just saw 'Gravity' and I have to say it's exactly what I expected. There are really not many movies that have the quality that when you watch it you get exactly what you were waiting for. 'Gravity' is one of those rare occasions.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the visuals. The movie is a freaking masterpiece when it comes to atmosphere. The Earth seems menacing and there is no up and down to the camera, that's a great touch for the film to have. I will assume, being a cosmological ignorant myself, that the physics are studied and right, but I really don't know. I believe 'Gravity' deserves every Academy Award it has been given, because every one of them is in a technical aspect. The long shots are beautiful and the cinematography and special effects are somewhat awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the script. The script is one of the single most unoriginal scripts in space opera I've ever seen. It was quickly written just for the sake of making a great 3D experience I guess, because it's really really bad. It steals mostly everything from other films, from '2001: A Space Odyssey' to 'Alien', 'WALL-E' and even 'Titanic' among many more. The pacing is awful, the film feels like a long short: in the first 25 minutes we already have to ""let go"" a main character like WTF? There is no time to get attached to the characters, so what is the point on killing them off just like that? Some scenes are rushed out, others go on forever and there are some unnecessary moments that are very uncomfortable and weird, and don't make sense. Clooney is the most unrealistic thing ever, like he has no feelings and doesn't give a damn at all. And nobody seems to have common sense and some one-liners spread throughout the film are embarrassing.<br/><br/>The most clich√©d thing there is; she has a daughter, she thinks she's gonna die, she's alone in space, something something something. It is well executed in some aspects that make you catch your breath, for example, when Sandra Bullock is losing oxygen or under water, that I give you, is desperating. Other than that, 'Gravity' is the most awful script in space opera history and not even the visuals redeem it from that.<br/><br/>Don't let Quar√≥n distract you with pretty images while he's getting away with such dull writing. If you're going to get a film right, try to do it in most of its aspects. Vide Stanley Kubrick, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>Boring overall. If you see just the first shot of the film, you've already seen the best part."

","Ryan and Matt, the rookie and the veteran astronauts, suffer a terrible accident while undergoing a routine repair mission.

The two are left alone in space, detached from their shuttle with minimum survival resources so they must team up and devise a plan which will hopefully bring them back safely to earth.<br/><br/>I have to say that I really cannot understand why this movie is so highly rated. I am too a fan of the main actors but that doesn't mean that I will give 10* to any movie in which they act. I heard that it looks gorgeous, that it has a great story, etc...etc...but it doesn't. It looks OK but nothing more than that, its story is pretty generic, predictable and linear with very little unexpected events to induce a sense of suspense or drama. The characters don't inspire anything and thus I didn't feel any remorse for their situation. Ryan is supposedly a brilliant mind but she acts like an under average person, not doing anything related to a genius at all. In addition, I simply cannot understand the fate ""chosen"" for Matt, as there was no reason for such an ending to he's character (it's related to Gravity).

I think the script/dialogue is just making stuff up to get rid of him in order to have Sandra Bullock alone to make it more suspenseful. And of course the storyline would get rid of HIM instead of HER because it's even MORE suspenseful to have a FEMALE try to survive on her own than a male. You fear more for the character.

"gloriahur","7","0","0","27 November 2016"," Hope of Gravity
","This movie, from the beginning, is actually quite despairing and gloomy. The setting of the space makes it more desolate and heavy. The situation that the main character, Dr. Stone, gets in right from the beginning of the movie is probably the most dreadful thing that can happen in space, or anywhere, in someone's life. She gets lost in the middle of nowhere, without anyone around, and without anything to rely on except for herself and the voice of her colleague, Matt Kowalski, who is an astronaut, also being drifted away in space.<br/><br/>The past of Dr. Stone and this present situation of her being lost somehow reflects on each other. After her daughter died, she would drive every evening, in silence, heading nowhere, just like she is in space in this situation. She says that the thing she like about the space is the silence of it in the beginning of the movie. Back on Earth, she was also completely alone after her daughter died, cut off from the world. She was lost. But then in space, as she is drifting nowhere, not knowing how she can survive, since she is a doctor, not an astronaut, she hears the voice of Matt Kowalski. He talks to her to keep her alive, and tells her what she can do to survive. And this eventually lets her find a way to survive. Even in her dream, he comes to her and talks to her.<br/><br/>I think this is what she really needed to survive. She had lost hope- she had no purpose of living. But the voice that stayed with her raised her up. Someone was there for her to keep living. This gives her the volition to live, then that was all she thought about, to survive, and to live- to go back to Earth. When she successfully lands on Earth, she (and the audience) is relieved of the presence of gravity, of life. I think that this concise, strong story successfully delivers the message about how we all actually want to live, and how just one person's aid can lift someone up again, without any distracting elements. Some people might think that it's boring at parts, unrealistic maybe, and extremely heavy, but this movie stayed in my mind for a long time, and reminds me at times of the hope of life- of gravity."
"brian_m_hass","7","0","0","23 October 2016"," Edge of Your Seat Excitement for Armchair Astronauts
","The premise of the film is a simple one. Two astronauts must fight for their survival after a disaster occurs during a space shuttle mission.<br/><br/>The film does an excellent job of depicting the look and feel of human spaceflight. Space is a beautiful as well as hostile environment for human beings. Although space travel seems relatively routine, it is easy to forget how dangerous it actually is. Outside of Earth's protective atmosphere, the continued existence of human life is completely dependent on life support systems. When things go wrong, they can go wrong rather quickly.<br/><br/>This film does take a degree of artistic license in its depiction of spaceflight. For example, it is difficult to imagine that a pair of tethered astronauts could carry enough maneuvering fuel and oxygen to travel from the Hubble Space Telescope to the International Space Station. There is a reason why space shuttle and Soyuz missions to the ISS require launch windows. Although both types of spacecraft have the capability of adjusting their orbits to perform rendezvous maneuvers, the spacecraft carry only finite amounts of maneuvering fuel and must be launched into orbits that are similar to that of their rendezvous target. If a large orbital adjustment is difficult for a space shuttle or a Soyuz, it is probably virtually impossible for a pair of spacewalking astronauts. However, the film can be forgiven for bending the science; since, the story would be rather boring if both of the main characters died during the first half hour of the film.<br/><br/>The film does have other shortcomings. Some of the events in the film seem improbable. Considering how nervous and inexperienced Dr. Ryan Stone is in this film, it seems unlikely that she would have been chosen to serve as an astronaut. Matt Kowalski's heroism seems like a bit of a clich√©. Finally, a number of improbable coincidences are depicted in the film; and, these do stretch the film's credibility a bit. Astronauts on a real space mission probably would not have survived the events depicted in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is exciting and riveting. The two main characters are engaging; and, it is easy for the viewer to feel empathy for both of them. Both characters are always at the mercy of technology in the unforgiving space environment. Space buffs will also enjoy identifying the various types of manned spacecraft which are depicted in the movie. It is refreshing to see a film which attempts to depict real spaceflight during a time when so many of the modern space films fall into the science-fantasy genre. Although this film doesn't get everything right, it is recommended."
"martin-rob13","Null","0","0","14 January 2016"," Visually it is awesome
","On every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals, the chinks start showing up. Overall the script is very weak. Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything in its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request, Kowalski (who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while, floating around, spouting inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to disengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts.<br/><br/>We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human. Apart from this minor bit, nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea.<br/><br/>Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense. Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she does it three times), the debris presents itself like on cue every single time. Then a fire in a space station, then running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It's fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense.<br/><br/>Also at times I couldn't shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual. Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them? Really? Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages, why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me. Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can't-understand-this-thing machinery.<br/><br/>The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about. Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy. I wont even mention the in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is."
"dan-2629","6","0","0","20 December 2015"," Brush aside it's unrealistic flaws for an enjoyable watch
","OK, so this film has flaws. Quite a few. Does this ruin the movie? No.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is visually stunning and although others reviewers have commented negatively toward Matt Kowalski's (George Clooney) pointless anecdotes as he thrusts needlessly around space during the task at hand, I actually felt it set up his character quite well as the over confident alpha male. Then a message comes through which (and I'm paraphrasing) tells them to abort... things are about to get crazy.<br/><br/>And it does... Go crazy that is. Debris from another structure is hurtling towards them and after a few near misses Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) gets knocked off and begins drifting into space until she loses visual on the the others while spinning uncontrollably. This event is truly intense. I'm not sure how much credit for that is down to the movies production and how much is just my own conscious thoughts of what that would be like. Either way, I was gripped. Sometimes when watching a movie and things go wrong, it's hard to get past the *of course she'll be OK, she's the main character* feeling we all get, but in-spite of this, I was watching wide-eyed at the screen with no clue as to what would happen.<br/><br/>Then Kowalski appears from nowhere, tethers her, and like an unwilling dog on a rainy day she get pulled around by Kowalski as they make there way to the shuttle. In my opinion, this is where the flaws begin...<br/><br/>They get back to their shuttle/ship/station to find that everyone else is dead. Am I supposed to care? We've never seen this crew and I have no emotional connection to them. Maybe more time should have been used at the beginning to set the scene. To have us learn about these characters and possibly even witness their fate. Without it, unfortunately they are just props. just an addition to all the other floating debris out there. <br/><br/>As they make their way to another station for rescue I start to wonder about the character development even more. It's obvious from her actions and dialogue that Stone is emotionally damaged as well as being under-trained. I do not believe that she would have been given this mission. The training for NASA are famously gruelling, testing your mental and physical strength. Stone currently lacks all of this. We also witness Kowalski trying to calm her nerves asking questions about her life. Surely they'd have been in each others pockets throughout the training and the mission itself and he doesn't know any of this?<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil too much but the movie then basically goes from one obstacle to another as Stone tries to overcome her own demons as well as find rescue. Sometimes repetitive but I do care for her survival.<br/><br/>Is this film believable? No. But it's definitely enjoyable. It's no Apollo 13 but then maybe it wasn't trying to be."

","My complaints aren't just about Clooney's fuel usage, their inertia when going to the ISS, or Bullock's underwear. That's the obvious stuff. What's less obvious is there is little adherence to orbital mechanics in *any* of the film. You can't just point the re-entry vehicle at Earth. You'd have to fire your rockets to decelerate enough to begin losing altitude and so you're slow enough that the friction as you descend into thicker atmosphere safely continues to decelerate you using the heat shield. That is a BIG deal. The atmosphere is otherwise lethal to you, heat shield or not.<br/><br/>Sure, stuff superficially moves basically o.k. and is kind of floaty and equal-but-opposite-reactiony, but most everything else is wrong. It's not just inertia here or a lack of anything pulling Clooney away from the structure there. The latter ""heroic disconnect scene"" could have been fixed with just rotating the damaged station to give them centrifugal force. Gravity is a negligible effect, since they're already in orbit (i.e going real fast laterally and being high enough to be out of the thick atmosphere so they don't burn up). Rotation is easy enough to do with CGI elements, too, and logical since the ISS was just hit by debris. Just requires some expensive computer time at the FX house re-rendering that scene using the already-built 3D models and textures. In fact, you could leave all the principle scene elements as-is and just revolve the Earth around them in the background slowly. Bingo, stupid physics moment solved.<br/><br/>That's unforgivable, but what's more unforgivable is the just point-and-fire-your-rocket view of orbital physics in getting from one place to another that occurs repeatedly! Even if miraculously all of those stations and the shuttle were nearby and visible with the naked eye, which is completely ludicrous unless they made some point of saying they'd all just rendezvoused recently for some long-planned joint venture with the Hubble telescope (hard even in real life), you'd still never be able to get there in a strait line. Orbital mechanics is all about change in velocity governing altitude and then arc rendezvous paths. If you magically had enough fuel and thrust, you'd have to change your velocity, change your orbital path, and loop around a few times until you meet-up with the other object. Otherwise, you'd end up in front of or behind the object depending on your altitude differential. And that's even if you're lucky enough to just so happen to be going in the same direction before you begin the maneuver, which is just about never.<br/><br/>That's actually what's so dangerous and crazy about orbital mechanics: even in the unlikely event the ISS or Chinese space station could be seen and you had A LOT of leftover fuel after your stupid Abyss-opening-scene-like joyriding (yeehaw!), you wouldn't be able to reach it. That's pretty dramatic, in my opinion. The lack of air and the possibility of space junk causing you to explode into a mess of sparks aren't really the most interesting part of this orbital stuff, in my opinion. Everything is moving fast up there (otherwise you would fall back to Earth) and it takes a lot of energy to change the arrangement, let alone do that in a way that matches with the path of anything else, let alone actually meet-up with it.<br/><br/>There are people making the argument that you can't have a dramatic and captivating movie where all this is accurately portrayed. What about Das Boot, Alive, Men of Honor, K2, Pressure, Everest? They all tried to be realistic about other dangerous environments that cut you off from civilization and safety. I realize the Martian tried this, but that's more obvious, too. He's on another planet. What about the bizarreness of being right there, visible to someone with a telescope, and there's nothing anyone can do to save you? That interests me. I don't think you have to severely compromise physics to have drama and keep people in the seats, rather in the case of an orbital emergency film, the physics is where much the danger comes from."

"unbrokenmetal","Null","0","0","15 November 2014"," Hostile environment
","When something comes out of space to threaten someone in the movies, it's usually a gigantic object ('Armageddon') or an alien invasion ('Independence Day'). 'Gravity' tells us about tiny objects, space debris with an average size of less than an inch, that's a very clever idea to start with. And it's not the whole planet that needs to be saved, only 2 people have to find a possibility how to get safely back on the ground, that's all! Less definitely means more in this case, because when they spend the majority of the budget on the special effects, it's exceptional that the human characters remain in the centre of our attention. The show never gets into the foreground, all the spectacular sights merely provide the background for the 2 actors. In opposite to 'Silent Running', it doesn't hit you with a message, either. It's entertainment and very well made, even if, as some previous reviewers pointed out (I need not repeat the same points here), some physics are dodgy, but a list of technically completely accurate sci-fi flicks would be very short. The makers of 'Gravity' succeeded in making outer space a convincing, hostile environment. But in the first place, 'Gravity' stands out from many soulless sci-fi flicks due to its human qualities. Surely not a movie to be forgotten easily, I'll probably remember it like 'Oh yes, the movie with the 2 astronauts drifting in space'."

","This movie has been rated 8.7 here on IMDb for a completely unknown reason. The movie is nice, 3D, stunning visuals; yes, you see George Clooney, solid as usual; and you also see Sandra Bullock, in bathing suite. The latter seems to be the only main attraction of the movie as far as Bullock is concerned. The characters are completely flat, a half hearted attempt is made to give Bullock's character some background (drama with a lost daughter), however it doesn't make you feel for her character. The scenario is as shamelessly predictable, even for this kind of movie. Hopping from station to station to reach earth, that's the story. Basically only an excuse to showoff the nice 3D pictures, however a demo, documentary would have sufficed for that, no need to call it a movie. Also, the little parts where something happens is really completely shaded from any luster by clich√©s, clich√© camera standpoints, clich√© music building up that completely predict what is happening.<br/><br/>So, nice for the 3D, but that trick is shown after 10 minutes. And yes, you see a nice milf in bathing suite, if that is the attraction you are looking for. Further, you got 10 minutes of screen time with Clooney. However, that completely sums up any value or interest that this ""movie"" might have.<br/><br/>Don't go, watch a video free from NASA, watch Speed or The Net with a more younger and sexy Bullock, and see something else with Clooney; but don't waste your money and time on this piece of celluloid that is supposed to be a movie."

The music was an abomination: loud, trite, sentimental, and manipulative. Clooney was mediocre; Bullock, appalling. I haven't hated an actress so much since I saw Laura Dern in Inland Empire.<br/><br/>There's a crucial part in the movie in which Bullock's character, a medical engineer, is overwhelmed, exhausted, and gives in to her inevitable demise by cutting off the ship's oxygen. The movie would have been OK if it had ended then.<br/><br/>Instead, thanks to the opportune appearance of a ghost, she survives. She, in fact, survives one crisis after another aided by more Dei ex machina than you'd find in a Taiwan factory which manufactures plastic Jesus figurines for your dashboard.<br/><br/>There are more crashes and explosions than in the entire series of FAST AND FURIOUS; more noise and banality than on Fox News.

"mig-cm","10","3","8","5 May 2014"," A superb masterpiece, that only conscious heads and hearts will understand.
","I had to create an IMDb account just to review this particular movie and I will explain why. For too long I avoided watching it. My friends and most people I know kept bashing on ""Gravity"" and making comments on how ""poor"", ""lame"", ""slow"" and overall uninteresting it is. So, that kept me from even looking up the trailer for it... After a couple weeks I felt this urge to watch it, just to have a good laugh on how ""stupid and ridiculous"" it supposedly is. Let me just point out right now that I like mostly all genres of movies but focus mainly on Action/War/Terror movies, for those usually entertain me the most. So when I decided to watch this movie, I wasn't expecting much... just the big laugh that people were telling me I would have.<br/><br/>By the time it was over I got off the TV, sat on my bed, laid back in awe, and realized this is probably my favorite movie ever. Such is the power of watching a beautifully written and directed masterpiece + having the lowest expectation + being used to fast-paced ""popcorn"" movies + being really in need for a movie like ""Gravity"". The movie held all my attention from the very first minute. Not for a single moment was I bored, for there is tension, action, emotion and beautiful photography in literally every second of it, and it's all so superbly balanced, in a way I've never seen before. It's been a very long time since a movie touched and moved me like this one, so I wanted to kinda thank that by writing this review and recommending it to anyone who's thinking about watching it. It's a complete breath of fresh air from everything I've watched to date.<br/><br/>There are people who simply didn't like this movie for a variety of reasons and that is perfectly fine. I can understand that. But then I see so many people stating this is the worst movie ever made... well, those people are probably used to only watching Vin Diesel movies and their own favorite movies (probably Nolan's ""Batmans"" or The Fast & Furious series, or The Avengers, etc). I'm not saying this one's better than those, though. I'm not comparing anything. Those are all great titles, and I'm a fan of them too. But ""Gravity"" is like ""Her"", ""WALL-E"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or ""Moon""... you gotta be conscious and open to fully enjoy it."

Anyone who has watched NASA TV broadcasts of shuttle/Hubble/ISS walks will laugh at all the stupid dialogue that this movie pushes forward as a reality. 2. The Russians, as joint participants, would never use a missile to experimentally blow up a satellite close to any working space endeavor. And, there are much easier ways to allow a satellite to de-orbit and burn. And, just to test missile capability for satellites again there are much easier alternatives. 3. Although space junk and natural space entities can reach relative speeds in the tens of thousands of mph it is far fetched to have so much debris accumulatively arrive so quickly. 4. Velocity and acceleration is far more fine tunable with pressurized gas from a MMU so all that flying about was a ""bit"" excessive. Even the movement by hand seemed excessive. 5. The talking out loud dialogue presented by Bullock would be comical to any who has faced life ending desperate situations. 6. Clooney's scenes were just as far fetched. 7. The tumbling escape module, all aflame, with heat tiles rarely in a position to help should have left her as a cinder. 8.

"chrisdmeads-304-886334","9","3","8","10 January 2014"," Revolutionary.
","Spanish director Alfonso Cuaron returns, pushing the technological boundaries within cinema in his box office smash hit Gravity. Cuaron's already impressive filmography which contains films like Children of Men and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, perhaps has its most impressive creation. This film demands to be seen in 3D, something which I didn't think I'd ever be saying.<br/><br/>Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and novice medical engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), are carrying out a technical mission in space when disaster hits and the accumulative debris of many destroyed satellites, kills their colleagues and destroys their shuttle. Adrift in space where nothing can carry sound and it's impossible to live, the two must work together and overcome their inner demons in order to survive.<br/><br/>The undoubtedly mind blowing special effects and the technical ambition and mastery of the whole production, are of course Gravity's main assets. Massively entertaining and engaging set-pieces in which destructive debris storms wreak havoc, are unlike anything ever witnessed in the history of cinema. What was so impressive about these set-pieces though, was the way that director Alfonso Cuaron chose to handle them. A lesser director of big box office films such as Michael Bay would've chosen to ignore the fact that sound doesn't carry in space, in favour of creating a film with loud and overblown action set- pieces. However, in the very capable hands of cerebral director Alfonso Cuaron, this scientific fact isn't ignored and is instead, used to magnify the suspense and horror of these explosions, that occur under a foreboding backdrop of unsettling silence. Steven Price's suspenseful score and the 3D technology are further tools utilised by Cuaron, to create this jaw dropping horror story.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock gives the best performance of her career in the lead role, conveying the sad and disconnected nature of Ryan Stone well. She also reacts in a convincing manner, as a person faced with an inconceivably horrifying situation. Co-star George Clooney was a perfect casting choice and is able to lend his charmed personality to the role of the chatty and enthusiastic veteran Matt Kowalski, with inconsummate ease. Keeping with the theme of great casting choices, the decision to cast Ed Harris as the voice of mission control was a nice heads up to the similarities between Gravity and space survival thriller Apollo 13, which Harris starred in.<br/><br/>Gravity is very easy to view from a thematic standpoint, as the film is essentially one long allegory. The emptiness and isolation of being in outer space is meant to be a reflection of the emptiness and isolation in lead character Ryan Stone's life on Earth, which she carries as a result of her very traumatic past. George Clooney's chatty astronaut Matt Kowalski is a representation of your everyday person, getting on with and enjoying life. It is this sort of influence that Ryan needs to give her the will to survive and return to Earth. The basic message of the film is that life must continue no matter what tragedy you've encountered in the past.<br/><br/>However, for all of the high praise that Gravity deserves, there are some underlying problems with the film. Despite being better than initially expected, the writing is nowhere near the quality of the writing in the other excellent films that Gravity has been bracketed with in the lead up to the major awards ceremonies. Brilliant writing and memorable dialogue are essential factors in determining whether a film is a classic or not and while Gravity has a better script than most blockbusters, the writing needs to be better in parts. Furthermore, the film lulls a bit in between its spectacular action set-pieces and this partly derives from the fact that some of the writing isn't quite engaging enough to fully sustain the audience's attention.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Gravity is a revolutionary survival horror blockbuster, whose impact will be as keenly felt in the future as that of masterpiece The Matrix. Its two strong lead performances and refreshingly short run time largely help to overcome the problem of a script that isn't up to the scratch of 2013‚Ä≤s other exceptional films. However, Gravity more than earns its place among these elite efforts."

I would have expected more from a high budget movie but what you see is really what you get and nothing more.

","I got hooked by this movie since I saw the trailer of it and the actual movie exceeded my expectation. Gravity is a survival themed movie and different from the rest of its predecessors - or at least those I have seen - there is nothing in this movie that really seems threatening. Unlike in a natural disaster movie where you can see the earth moves and bends trying to swallow the main character, or vicious animals that lurks in the dark and jumps out to eat people. This movie offers none of that but you can feel the tension, the anxiety and the rush of Doctor Ryan Stone (played by the still mesmerizing Sandra Bullock) trying to survive in space. <br/><br/>90% of the movie takes place in outer space with no sound and little light which is superb since it's true to the fact that you can't hear anything with no oxygen. Stunning camera works and visual effects. Almost Final Fantasy-ish in animation but better than Avatar.<br/><br/>The acting is marvelous just how you would expect from Bullock and Clooney - who is once again retains the role of a no-care-in-the-world tough guy. But the spotlight is indeed on Bullock. It must be hard to act on a movie where the entire thing revolves on your acting because this movie has no one except her to do all the acting. <br/><br/>The story is, well, there is no story. It just about how space is, a person who got lost in it and trying to get home. It could be a little boring for some because the movie is slow paced and centers around in the psychological state of the characters and the depiction of live in space instead of all the actions. But if you like simple movies that digs deep into the characters' mind then you surely will enjoy this. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is fantastic. Watch it in 3D if you have the chance (because i didn't) and it should be better in it. A 9/10."

","James Cameron was correct when he said Gravity is ""the best space film ever made"" (with a close second for 2001: A Space Odyssey). The special effects are magnificent and seamless, the cinematography and choreography are breathtaking, and the thematic elements are not reduced by the simple concept of the story.<br/><br/>This film is beautiful to watch. If you watch it for nothing else, just enjoy the enthralling scenes of debris tearing through shuttles and space stations, or the amazing shots of Earth from space. Cuar√≥n's signature long cuts contribute to the palpable tension and realism of the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are astounding. The zero-gravity environment is completely believable and precisely created. It is astounding to think that this film could not be made so seamlessly without actually filming in Earth orbit.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is excellent, and though George Clooney's role is relatively minor, Clooney is also great. Some of Gravity's criticism has been toward the supposed weak characterization and synthetic banter between the two characters, but this was not evident to me, and is really a footnote on a nearly flawless film.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat weak and simple, but completely original and mostly accurate. The only inaccuracy is the proximity of space stations and debris orbits, but, again, this is a minor detail. Cuar√≥n makes the most of this story with some beautiful and simple messages.<br/><br/>We march toward death as surely as gravity draws falling objects toward Earth. But it's one hell of a ride. If you haven't seen Gravity, watch it as soon as you can."

","I was a bit reticent in the beginning considering Bullock's previous movies, but i have to say the director made the right pick as her acting was truly impressive. Also, another nice thing about the movie is that they did not prolong the scenes unnecessarily, things that tend to happen with actors like Bullock and Clooney. It was actually quite captivating from beginning to the end and pretty much scientifically accurate. So, to sum it up, considering the spectacular visual effects (you really need to see it in 3d) and the solid acting from both protagonists, this makes an enjoyable experience especially for the sci-fi genre buffs."

","I don't get it. OK the CGI is fabulous but one could watch a lot of movies/shows with great CGI and special effects. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock plays a doctor/scientist who is good enough to work on a special project in space. She has baggage, who doesn't? The film portrays her as a ditsy doodle. She talks about how she crashed in the simulator, won't follow command instructions and when she gets into trouble has to dream up a tip from the dead commander to get out of it. The lowlight came when she was in the Chinese station and didn't know which buttons to push so she goes enny meenie minie mo... Oh come on <br/><br/>This kind of sexism should have gone out years ago. Of course Sandra is perfect for the role. No wonder they had to go down the list of actresses who either turned them down or managed to escape from this mess.<br/><br/>To make matters worse they had to tie this up with a big Hollywood bow and have her survive."

Nonstop idiotic dialog be damned.<br/><br/>The model for great action films starring a single woman character is Sigourney Weaver in Alien. Bullock exhibited little of the same grit and determination.

But it must have been mind-boggling because without the 3D, it was pretty stunning.<br/><br/>Not much here in the way of story -- Sandra Bullock plays a woman literally lost in space and trying to find her way back to earth, via a shuttle that's rather far off.<br/><br/>The neat thing for me about this film is that the director took his time with the moments rather than rushing through and trying to have an action sequence every two seconds. We watch Bullock, alone, as she goes through various thought processes and attempts to figure out what to do. One rarely sees that type of thing anymore.<br/><br/>Bullock is excellent, and it's a great role for her - adventurous, athletic, and emotional with a few light moments. George Clooney's role is small, but he's likable.<br/><br/>For me, though, the star of this film was the beauty and the silence - something that we're not used to today.

"mrsnagem","9","3","9","14 October 2013"," Simply a masterpiece.
","Few people realize the sheer amount of awesomeness contained in this film- Instead, it is criticized for its long shot sequences and (to some) dull storyline. I, instead, find that this film is somewhat revolutionary. To elaborate on this, few films have had such amazing shots in them that roll on without getting stale (the first one lasts for a good 17 or so minutes), and I find myself feeling sympathetic towards the characters in the film, like few films have made me feel.<br/><br/>The cinematography is simply amazing as well- even though the majority of the film was made in a 3D software (Like Cinema4D for example). while watching this film one finds that they actually feel like they are floating helplessly through space, possibly to their demise, much the same as the characters in the film. I Did see it in IMax 3D which may have had something to do with it; there's just something about seeing tiny particles of space dust float into your vision as you see the sunrise glide over the earth.<br/><br/>The only problem I could find with this film is that the storyline isn't really physically possible- Due to the orbital locations of the space stations, it would not be plausible for someone to float from the ISS to Russia's space station, and then even further to china's space station. Nevertheless, this doesn't exactly effect how amazing this film is.<br/><br/>I May even go see it again, its so good. This film is definitely one of my all time favorite films."
"JSanderO","5","3","9","7 October 2013"," Old Story New Setting
","There is hardly anything technically wrong with this film. The 3D, the amazing special effects deserve all the credit they will get. And the acting was flawless. Directing was first class.<br/><br/>The plot, that is the story however was nothing new and loaded with the usual clich√©s. Will Hollywood ever free itself from clich√©s and stereotypes? Gravity tells same story that we are already familiar with: Protagonist being pretty much alone in a very hostile environment and facing their mortality and summoning up what it takes to survive reflecting on their past. In this case survival means overcoming a series of pitfalls (major ones) which to his viewer represents a bridge too far and very much what Hollywood will reach for to make a thriller. Reminds me of Ahnold as a superhero... I digress.<br/><br/>As I watched the movie immediately began about a couple of people on some ocean mission in perhaps the Southern Ocean and finding that that the ship they were working on was hit by a rogue wave from an unpredicted storm and the female protagonist (of course it now has to be a female to be PC) was forced to get into a life boat and make her way to a rescue boat which it turns out was also devastated by the storm which blew through and she next tries to get to another ship for safety and so on and so on... finally driven ashore by the storm landing next to the shore on a hauntingly beautiful but almost alien looking part of earth. I could well imagine the protagonist and the Cloony character going through exactly the same conversations and mental work... to survive at sea and one falling overboard and disappearing.<br/><br/>The survival in the face of repeated disasters in a hostile environment is a story we've read, seen or heard before. I found absolutely no new insight into the human condition or what survival is about under hostile conditions. You either give up or try anything and everything to survive. And these stories are remarkable but this one is hardly credible and asks the viewer to accept way too much *coincidence* to advance the plot. There are real accounts of survival which would make a compelling movie and probably have been made into films (though I haven't seen them). Does fantasy trump reality? For the sci fi lover I suppose the answer is yes.<br/><br/>No way would the author let the Sandra character get into the first pod and make it to the ISS and safety. Indeed that would have been an awesome and possibly a credible story of survival but hardly what the current generation of sci fi viewers and lovers of action flicks would pay for... they simply want fantasy and the unbelievable to pass for a glimpse of reality. They want their super heroes! Putting this story in orbit was not enough... It had to be the perfect storm on steroids.<br/><br/>The film is compared to Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyessy and is hardly in its class. Technically yes, even more advanced, but not in terms of having the viewer transported to a whole different place in the very distant future... where men have evolved very little. No new human condition concepts in Gravity.<br/><br/>Hollywood people have made enormous progress in the technology of cinema, but seem to sink into the same story frames and clich√©s. Acting, directing and dialog as well. Scripts? I don't think improvement too in many cases. Gravity is a perfect example of this (problem? and why I attend Hollywood films less and less with the exception of a few film makers who produce excellent experience in all ways that cinema can.<br/><br/>Aside from seeing the space environment, which was stunning, I was mostly bored and knew exactly what was coming. When a film is so predictable it loses my interest."

They were bouncing all over space like a couple of monkeys.

"kira02bit","5","2","5","12 October 2015"," Nice try, but sublimely overrated
","Take a compelling concept, a fairly convincing representation of things that can go wrong in outer space, a first-rate lead and noted director and you get Gravity, arguably the most overrated film of 2013.<br/><br/>The film opens with some astronauts, including Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, doing some repairs in outer space. When a shower of space debris leaves two of them adrift and the rest dead, they must try to make their way to a close by space station against the odds and in the inhospitable environment of space.<br/><br/>I enjoy good science fiction and with the reviews and pedigree on this film, I really wanted to love it. And there are certainly some very good things it has going. Its convincing visual splendor for one. It also hammers home the constant danger of space travel and will undoubtedly cure anyone with fantasies of such to think twice.<br/><br/>Additionally, it features a truly marvelous central performance by Bullock. Because Bullock is known notably for comedies, it often takes people by surprise when she turns up in a straight dramatic role and hits a home run, but despite some career missteps Bullock is a reliable actress. She makes her character here sympathetic, intelligent and gutsy even when quivering with fear, and even manages to gloss over some of the story's annoying aspects regarding her character. By contrast, Clooney is on screen so little and basically plays himself that it seems pointless to even judge his performance.<br/><br/>The film sports a brief running time, but feels like its double. The first time chaos hits and we get a diversity of vertigo inducing shots of gloved hands desperately reaching out to grab hold of flimsy objects to prevent them reeling off into the void of space, it is disorienting and scary. Unfortunately, the film repeats this same theme over and over and over again. A character will reach the next safe haven, only to have the debris shower show up again and force them to vacate for yet another safe haven, complete with lots of grunting and desperate grabs for flimsy pieces of metal. It gets old pretty quickly.<br/><br/>While director Alfonso Cuaron has successfully created an outer space that is intimidating, he is far less adept at choreographing what happens in that background. By the time our central character is on her third failing haven and must again escape while disaster erupts around her, you have seen the steps so often that they no longer hold much suspense. In fact, the film becomes ever more ponderous with each repetitive set-up.<br/><br/>As intelligent and courageous as Bullock's character is, she is still stuck with a rather familiar and irritating back story. We find out during the course of the film, that her father wanted a boy, she was a single mother and her daughter is dead from an accident. The film distributes these tidbits from the character in such a way that its veiled implication seems that if she does not safely make a return to earth, at least she is only a scientist without a family. Her character even grudgingly seems to imply such a thing herself at one point. It is pretty annoying to hear such bilge come out of a character's mouth and one could be sure that they would never have written lines for a male star - like Clooney - in such a way. The fact that they were likable and in such dire straits should be enough to wish them to escape, but positing a position where one laments that she failed as a wife and mother (and was a disappointment to her dad), so maybe her not being saved would be alright.<br/><br/>The worst decision is one that sacrifices what realism the film has in a sequence that stops the film dead and removes the viewer completely from it. At the two-thirds point, a ""ghost"" shows up at an opportune moment to advise Bullock on how to solve a tricky problem. The sequence comes from out of so far left field that jaws will hit the floor. I think filmmakers of this brand of sci-fi really need to address whether they want to be scientifically authentic or whether they want to include faux-theological overtones and affirmations of spirituality sops to be thrown to the faithful, but they cannot do both and maintain an undisturbed air of science fact. The film never really recovers from this segment, which reminds us in no uncertain terms that we are watching ""only a movie""."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Matt (George Clooney) are two astronauts, working on a space station, whilst trying to juggle their respective emotional baggage. All is going smoothly, only for a big disaster to strike and the pair finding themselves desperately trying to get to safety. When Ryan finds herself stranded on her own, as the less experienced explorer, she must use all her wits in a desperate struggle for survival.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron's short, critically acclaimed space drama plunges us straight in to the action from the start, slowing closing in on our two main characters, who we are forced to make a connection with on the basis of some piecemeal small talk as they go about their business, with the famous performers playing them relying on their assured, seasoned on screen personas that they've each developed over many years, with Clooney's smooth talking, wise cracking man's man approach, coupled with Bullock's hard ass, cynical girl in a man's world thing. Shortly after we feel all settled in, the realization slowly dawns on the characters and the audience that something's wrong, and the tension sets in, and we feel as though we are in with these people as they are forced to rely on their instinctive human ingenuity to survive.<br/><br/>Interjected between the various seat edge moments, our heroes are left merely to wonder aimlessly, but as they do, they (and we) are witness to some truly breath taking cinematography, of the vast spacial glacier and the outstanding, grand space station, leaving the wow factor on more than one level. At some point, Bullock becomes stranded from her companion, and forced to survive on her own, as the tension and the stakes start to rise that little bit higher. Somehow, in the space of under an hour and a half, you are left feeling as though your senses have been taken on a visceral, mind bending ride, where by the end it's become genuinely nerve wracking as to whether she'll survive, even though inside we're pretty sure.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron has crafted an original, novel picture, that takes a well trodden format but delivers it in a way that you really haven't seen before. Clooney and Bullock are an effective double act, even when they're not actually on screen together, and it deserved to win the awards and get the acclaim it did. *****"

","I didn't believe the hype. I had a slight interest in seeing this at the theater but never got around to it. I finally just got the DVD in Netflix and I figured this would be just like Avatar. A visually stunning piece of work that was otherwise just a bland movie when not seen in the theater in 3D. Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>Gravity has no more than 2 actors in the entire movie. There are two other people that die 5 minutes in and the rest of the movie is Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. You'd think, how can these two floating around in space for the whole movie keep me entertained? Easy, through a series of tense situations and a perfect score. The film sets up right in the beginning that there is so sound in space. All you hear is them speaking and Sandra Bullock breathing heavily. There are scenes where satellites are being destroyed by debris and instead of loud explosions that you've grown accustomed to, there is a great score that tenses you up and allows a sense of dread to come over you.<br/><br/>In the era where every blockbuster thinks it has to be 2+ hours long, Gravity is a tight 90 minutes and it maximizes every single minute. I always hate in movies when a 30 second timer goes off when in reality it's two minutes. In Gravity, there are no flashbacks or cuts in time. The same amount of time has passed for us as it has for them. Gravity is nothing short of a triumph in modern day filmmaking."

","GRAVITY, in my opinion, is an excellent out-of-this-world adventure. I thought that the special effects were eye-popping, the outer space setting was spectacular, and the whole production design was good-looking. When Ryan (Sandra Bullock) couldn't get in touch with anyone, I got a little bit scared. This was because I didn't want anything bad to happen to her and Matt (George Clooney). This was especially true whenever they floated away with a whoosh. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Warner Brother has scored again. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent out-of-this-world adventure to any Sandra Bullock or George Clooney fan who hasn't seen it.

","Incredible visuals. It's a clich√©, but IT IS almost like being there. This technology has to be more than just a green screen and CGI. I've been to all the Sci-Fi, car chase/crash flicks and have never seen anything like this in them. The CGI, for lack of a better term, is well worth the price of admission. I've read a few sour grapes Gravity reviews on IMDb and if those people need a comparison of a really over hyped, incredibly God Awful movie go and see The Wolf of Wall Street. While Gravity is the best movie of the year Wolf is without the slightest doubt the absolute worse. Getting back to Gravity, if there is a small negative its the small chit chat between Clooneys character and Houston/Bullock. Its so small I didn't let it effect my 10 rating.

","I want to line up the users & critics who gave this movie a glowing review; tether them to George Clooney, & Sandra Bullock and let them float in space for eternity. And I wish the honorable folks at the academy awards would get pummeled by space debris for even considering this POS for best picture award. I would have gladly parted with my money if Sandra Bullock and George Clooney had died in place of the Indian space buffoon at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>How wonderful would it be to take away Oscars from actors and actresses for subsequent poor performances?

"jimbo-53-186511","3","2","5","23 March 2014"," Gravity is visually impressive, but lacking in pretty much every other area
","Gravity, this is all I remember hearing about earlier this year. It was nominated for a whole host of Oscars and managed to win 7 Oscars. I think it fair to say that one would expect to see a film that at the very least would be 'reasonably good'. However, when the film ended I didn't even think that it was OK.<br/><br/>I think the main problem lay with Clooney and Bullock. They didn't share particularly good on screen chemistry. Clooney's character was particularly annoying; every 5 minutes he mentioned wanting to beat some guy's record for Space Walking. OK we get it, it was quite funny the first time, but do we have to keep hearing it over and over again? The dialogue generally was dreadful between Bullock and Clooney. I think the dialogue was meant to come across as 'playful', but I just found it 'cheesy and 'cringeworthy'. Clooney's character was a creep and I just found him really annoying. There is one scene where Bullock is trying to board an alternative space station after their space station is destroyed by flying debris. She tells Clooney that she is low on oxygen, but yet Clooney continues talking to her and asking stupid questions like 'Ryan? That's a funny name for a girl'. Small tip, if someone's low on oxygen, it's probably best that they conserve their oxygen levels by not talking a lot. There are other inconsistencies such as Clooney's character disappearing without any reason and then only appearing later as an hallucination (although truth be told I was relieved that his character disappeared as I couldn't have stomached him throughout the film).<br/><br/>For the second half of the film, it's left to Sandra Bullock to carry the film. In fairness to her, she does a reasonable job, but she was always battling against a rubbish script. What was all that about when she was howling like a dog? That seemed to go on forever.<br/><br/>If you take out the spectacular effects and impressive cinematography, you are ultimately left with a film that is badly scripted, poorly acted (in the case of Clooney, I thought Bullock did an OK job) and worst of all boring. There was very little in the way of story and no real reason to care for any of the characters.<br/><br/>This film won Oscars in the following areas; Cinematography, Directing, Film Editing, Original Score, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing and Visual Effects. In other words, all style and no substance which perfectly sums up this film. However, at the BAFTA's it won the award for Best British Film (surely this was fixed or a sympathy vote)."
"tomgillespie2002","4","2","5","16 March 2014"," A massive disappointment, but certainly a beautiful one
","Movies in space are as common as they come, be it the shaky sets and questionable science of the 1940's and 50's, the camp and kitschy 60's and 70's, the alien-filled deep space of the 80's and 90's, or the explosive CGI of nowadays, audiences have always had a thirst for space opera and film-makers have always had a vision of the great darkness above the sky. But never has it seemed so real, so beautiful and so utterly terrifying as it is in Gravity, Alfono Cuaron's first movie since the excellent Children of Men (2006). It is a truly stellar vision, possibly the finest use of special effects ever. Yet oddly, I kinda hated Gravity, because for all it's promise and early vigour, it's just your average Hollywood popcorn-muncher wrapped in a pretty bow.<br/><br/>Deep into a space mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope, rookie engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) focuses on her work while the wily veteran Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) hums pop tunes and makes cocky remarks. Suddenly, they are hit by high-speed debris from a Russian satellite and are flung into space. Their shuttle, Explorer, is destroyed and their entire crew dead, and their only hope is to float across the great nothing to a Chinese space station, where they hope to re-connect with Houston and find a way home. But with the debris quickly making it's way back around and the perils of nothingness in their way, Stone is faced with some quick and tough decisions.<br/><br/>It's a shame I didn't get to see this in the cinema, as, although I'm not a fan of the 3D revolution, the staggering visuals and wonderful cinematography would have no doubt complimented the medium. Space here is a terrifying beast, the first time cinema has really captured how vast it really is. When Stone is first flung away from the Hubble, she spins manically out of control, reaching out for objects that aren't there, screaming when there's no-one there to hear her. Of course, smooth operator Kowalski is on hand to fly out and rescue her, but in those few minutes of desperation, she is truly alone.<br/><br/>Yet away from the action, Gravity dabbles in terrible, ham-fisted dialogue, familiar disaster-movie set-pieces, and heavy-handed metaphorical imagery about birth, death and life. This is the kind of film that has lines like ""you've got to learn to let go"" and ""clear skies with a chance of satellite debris."" Normally I would brush this off as your typical pap but I wanted and expected so much more from Gravity. After the heart-pounding opening 20 minutes, the film begins to drag, and actually feels long for a movie of just 90 minutes. Bullock's character is meant to an underdog, sympathetic in her never-say-die attitude, but she comes off as inept and annoying, and I fail to see why the Academy found her performance worthy of an nomination. A massive disappointment, but certainly a beautiful one.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

"spam-917-215663","2","2","5","8 March 2014"," Worst space movie ever (even ""Dark Star"" was better)
","This movie is boring at best. Sure it has some nice CGI effects in it but the ""story"" is pretty much non-existent in this flick. I can't wrap my head around the fact that so many people accept this junk as a triple-A title. The CGI-scenery, the light, the camera etc are all nice and well done but this is definitely not a good space movie. It lacks depth, the characters never develop good enough for the viewer to sympathize with them, in the contrary: they seem to actively keep trying to annoy the viewer. This goes especially for Sandra Bullock, who without a doubt is one of the worst actresses in AAA movies today (in my humble opinion). Some additional acting classes wouldn't hurt. All she seems to do in movies is heavy breathing - you might as well watch pornographic videos with the audio of this movie. And even then you won't be able to enjoy it because she can't deliver any credibility - it just seems fake and unprofessional. What that woman is doing in space is beyond credible. That does _not_ mean that George Clooney _does_ deliver though. His character lacks just as much development in the movie, all he does is talk calmly to counter the stress that Sandra is generating. I love you Sandra as a person, but you should have turned down this one. It does not help your career to be in such a mindless movie no matter how well funded it is.<br/><br/>But (and this is a huge _but_), in the actors defense, it all comes down to the writers. Writers seem to lack the ability to come up with something better than this nowadays. Which is very sad because it means they have been losing their creativity. If you want to see a better movie about space you're better off watching ""Mission to Mars"", which is not ""great"" either but definitely much better. The director definitely did not have a vision with this one either. He seems to focus more on CGI rather than character development. What can I say - with that equipment and funding they all could've done a better job.<br/><br/>What a waste of time, money and effort. Sorry, but this one is a big fat fail."

","This is a story of survival in outer space orbit. It's pretty standard fare camouflaged by a lot of special razzle-dazzle effects. The script is mundane and repetitive. There are one and half actors (George is killed off at the mid-point) and they barely hold your attention. George Clooney's comments are simply glib and Sandra Bullocks are variations of ""I'm in deep trouble and can't breathe"" and ""Which button do I press on this spaceship"".<br/><br/>Sandra wanders and spins and gyrates from one spaceship to another. The plot is very thin. You can watch the first 15 minutes and the last 10 minutes and basically you have the story. Watch ""Apollo 13"" for a far better and intelligent story."
"axel-koch","6","2","5","2 March 2014"," A visual masterpiece, although far from flawless concerning story and characters
","Gravity, or, as I like to call it, 99 Reasonable Arguments Against Becoming an Astronaut, is one of the most visually striking and impressive films in recent history and definitely a benchmark for all the science-fiction flicks to come after it. The good news about this is that Alfonso Cuar√≥n didn't solely achieve this because of the hundred million budget he was provided with, but also through wonderful imagination and, I assume, loads of research.<br/><br/>Writing a script with only one or two on-screen characters in a life- threatening situation has lately become a Hollywood screenwriter's favourite thing to do and Gravity doesn't exactly reinvent this drama sub-genre. That isn't of much consequence however, as the UK/US co- production is centred on a person's behaviour and the emotions induced under these grave circumstances. Sandra Bullock is this person in Gravity and quite possibly gives the performance of her career (if not an Oscar-worthy one), as she remains realistic even when she's the only person we see and thus undergoes even more scrutiny than otherwise. There isn't really anything we get to know about her character other than her daughter having died at the age of four, but just her being in and attempting to handle such a situation is highly interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Anyway, what you'll really remember about Gravity are the visuals. As far as I've read, pretty much anything besides the faces of Bullock and her colleague in peril, George Clooney, was created through special effects, and yet, the film is one of the most lifelike and believable depictions of space ever made. And while I'm unaware of how much cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki participated in the looks of Gravity, the result is an immensely good-looking motion picture, showing space as a place of heaven-like beauty in one scene and as a frightening and dark setting for a horror film in the other. Every visual aspect about it is meticulously wrought and stunning to look at, making you appreciate just how much work was invested in realising every tiny detail about the film in the best way.<br/><br/>With such a big-scale production, a plot less thin and predictable would've been desirable, especially due to the fact that you need more than just visuals to make a film rewatchable. But there is really no denying that Cuar√≥n has accomplished a most impressive and breathtaking film with Gravity, that should at least scoop the technical trophies at the Academy Awards."
"TROYELAWSON","6","2","5","2 March 2014"," Not Oscar Worthy!
","Although the eye candy is delicious, this movie is more far-fetched than a James Bond flick. Just because it has a star line-up, doesn't mean the film has content that qualifies for the Academy Awards. Many people criticize the Oscars, and this is a first for me to say that this nomination was a mistake. Don't get me wrong...Gravity was entertaining, and kudos to the CGI people, but that's where it ends. The film's big problem is leading the viewer to believe that this could happen based on facts and science. The acting was adequate and the director was able to transfer emotion and circumstance to the viewer fairly well. Instead of miraculous survival, the film should have focused on how one faces certain death."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie, and being a fan of Sandra Bullock in the process, I simply had to see what it was all about; needless to say I liked it well enough but can't help but wonder if all that hype is misguided.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron directs a 90 minute film in fine style; the spectacular cinematography and effects are conducted with such tenacity you can't help but feel you're actually in space! It really is astounding work, that alone marks a 10/10!<br/><br/>The casting of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney is an interesting aspect; in my opinion, Clooney is bordering on the annoying side but Bullock adds a real sense of sensitivity and emotion to the part of Ryan Stone (even if she is just talking to herself nearly all of the time), while any dramatic scenes add a sense of urgency and feeling to the viewer to want to stick with the story and find out what happens next. It is these characteristics to Gravity that make it stand on its own two feet well enough.<br/><br/>However, although Gravity proved an amiable enough film to me (perhaps due to the technical complexity surrounding it), too much emphasis has been placed on this. In the not so near future it may be seen to be a slightly - if not highly - overrated movie. 6/10"

"IllyaBenkard","9","2","5","14 February 2014"," 90 glorious minutes in a roller-coaster of emotions
","People were talking so much about how awesome this movie was. So I had to watch to realize what they were talking about. The trailer looked great, showcasing a movie that actually cared about physics and mathematical stuff. <br/><br/>The thing is: I didn't expect the movie to be so groundbreaking.<br/><br/>First of all I'd like to congratulate Mr. Alfonso Cuar√≥n and team for the excellent piece of visual artwork that I have watched and damn these very same guys because this very piece of artwork made me shed some good tears - and that don't happen since the first time I watched ""La vita √® Bela"" with Roberto Benigni.<br/><br/>The movie is short, but the amount of realism is one of the shocking points of the movie. The astrophysical board that worked in this movie actually cared A LOT about laws of physics. This is one of the very few movies around where there's no sound in space. People may find this declaration useless, but it really matters and counts towards the experience. Besides we have actual day cycles at space, what gives a whole new dynamism to the scenes<br/><br/>Let's talk about the visuals now. The rendering of the spacescapes are gorgeous. I've never seen such detail in a CG work depicting the Earth as seen from the space in a movie. The destruction of the space structures, starting by the Explorer, when the debris hit it is a mess in excruciating visual detail. All that shrapnel and debris being thrown at your face looks f***ing scary, specially if you watch it in IMAX 3D.<br/><br/>As for the storyline, it's not something too innovative, but it's well designed and makes you not want to miss every scene and dialogue. A few of them are, in my opinion, simply unique and, believe me, incredibly deep. There are lots of scenes that make you think about yourself as a human and your role in this life, a thing you wouldn't expect from this kind of a sci-fi space survival movie.<br/><br/>About the cast, actors go all natural, like if they were actually long time friends, but not letting go of the responsibilities of being a crew of a NASA Low-Orbit mission. Sandra Bullock's role was well executed by her and as for George Clooney, while short, we end creating emotional bonds with him and even getting some comical relief when hell breaks loose, by the relationship of them both. Phaldut Shama's appearance, while really short, is very joyful to witness. Ed Harris as control is also nice to hear. You would miss him a lot if comms were cut like in the movie. :)<br/><br/>I wanted to dedicate a paragraph for Mr. Steven Price and his team. The soundtrack of the movie is as short as it, but every song is simply unforgettable. Specially in the last scenes, when my face became a river of tears. The music fits like a silk glove in the hands of a queen with the atmosphere, visuals and dialogues. The aggressive sound of synthesizers combined with the strings add a whole dramatic tone to the impressive destruction scenes, while the crescent serenity of the orchestra takes the relief and final scenes moon high, making it just awfully perfect. A wise choice, as I believe not even Hans Zimmer, Steve Jablonsky, Zack Hemsey or Brian Tyler would do better.<br/><br/>I must say...this movie may seem overrated but it is for a reason: it's good! It's punching strong and will make you leave the theatre with shaking hands and watering eyes. I TOTALLY recommend this film, as it's undoubtedly the best of the genre and deserves to be in IMDb's Top 20.<br/><br/>90 minutes of pure tension, anxiety, reflection...and a travel back home.<br/><br/>My vote for ""Gravity"" is a well deserved 9,2/10."

Sandra Bullock deserves another Oscar after this as well as best director for Alfonso Cuaron and Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki. I can't recommend this film enough. Ground breaking, beautiful and technically perfect.Film schools will be studying this film in the future.Indeed the best space film ever done."
"CinemaCaveBlogger","7","2","5","4 February 2014"," See it for its technical marvels, but this film's significance will fade with time.
","Gravity (2013), directed by Alfonso Cuaron, explores the emotionally grueling experiences of a medical engineer, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who has been sent up into space to service the Hubble space telescope alongside veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and flight engineer Shariff Dasari (Paul Sharma). Things begin to go awry when Houston advises the crew that the Russians have destroyed a satellite with a missile strike, which has resulted in a chain reaction of space debris orbiting the planet at their altitude. This debris eventually hits their location and destroys the shuttle, marooning the remaining crew members at an altitude of 559 kilometers. The film takes on the perspective of Dr. Stone as she uses her wits and limited training to find a way to get back to Earth.<br/><br/>The actual narrative is pretty bare, but this is a non-issue to me given that it is a film about a personal journey. Why did Russia blow up a satellite? What is the political environment at the time of this film (which takes place in the near future)? We don't know; but we don't need to know. This film isn't about the context of the situation, but the situation itself. The film, more-or-less, is paced in real time, and thus, eliminates the need for exposition to fill gaps of time that we do not witness. <br/><br/>The first 10 minutes or so of this film has one of the most technically- advanced sequences that you will ever see on the big screen. For me, it brought back memories of Cuaron's Children of Men (2006), which had a car-sequence involving a flaming tree, machine gunners on dirt bikes, and a ping pong ball that, at the time, was one of the most impressive interpretations of the ""long take"" that I had ever seen. The opening sequence of Gravity is no less impressive, with zero-gravity acrobatics providing a visceral experience that may very well be the closest many of us ever come to floating in space.<br/><br/>Additionally, Sandra Bullock's acting is as good as we have ever seen from her. She's a natural at playing a neurotic character brought into extraordinary circumstances. Think of Bullock's portrayal of Dr. Stone as a more seasoned and mature interpretation of her role as Annie Porter in Speed (1994). Gravity sees her tread a more pronounced character arc, but both films highlight the emotional highs and lows that Bullock can take the audience. There is one sequence in particular that I feel will resonate for most people. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I'll be relatively non-descript and just say that this scene involves her character using a radio to communicate with Houston at what appears to be her lowest moment, only to find that she has tapped into the signal of an Inuit fisherman. This man, Dr. Stone's only connection to Earth, then begins to sing a bed-time song for his child. Bullock's character, feeling that there is no hope for survival, begins to use the song to comfort herself in one of the most beautiful and devastating scenes in the film.<br/><br/>There is little doubt that the film is a technical masterpiece with solid performances, but I feel that where the film falls flat is in its incessant need to entertain the viewers with zero gravity explosions and tense sequence after tense sequence. I was certainly swept up in the theatrics of it all for the first half, but towards the end the misadventures of Dr. Stone start to become tiresome and unbelievable. Now, I understand that this film is about overcoming impossible odds, but I feel the filmmakers passed a threshold when it comes to suspended disbelief. By the end, I was holding myself back from shouting ""Oh, come on!"" in the theater. At one point, a woman beside me let out some exhausted laughter over the lead character's rotten luck. This ultimately took me out of the experience and made me very aware that I was watching a movie.<br/><br/>There are other minor issues that I have with Gravity (including a ham- fisted homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey), but what really resulted in me leaving the cinema disappointed was that I went into this film hoping that this could be added to the canon of great sci-fi. To me, sci-fi is at its best when it deals with very complex or controversial ideas, or when it's used as a societal critique. ""Gravity"" is more of an action film set in space. Don't misunderstand me, it's a good action film peppered with moments of artistic brilliance, but I don't see it being remembered and revered in the decades to come.<br/><br/>Final verdict: 3.5 out of 5<br/><br/>__________________________________<br/><br/>Read this review and more at http://cinemacave.blogspot.ca !"

","Gravity opens in space, greatest yonder, the camera's gaze on earth's big blue sea, hovering about in liquid infinity. Slowly, the astronauts come into view. Kowalski is George Clooney's seasoned veteran of the stars, and the soothing voice of reason to Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), the medical engineer who's just been contracted to install an important device thing on the Hubble telescope's important device thing so that man can continue to make giant leaps for mankind. <br/><br/>While spacewalking and telling a story about one of his exes, charming Kowalski and Stone get news that, due to a Russian vessel's collision with a satellite somewhere else in earth's orbit, shards of debris now hurdle toward them at the velocity of a ""speeding bullet"" (and are circling the earth at the rate of one orbit per this film's running time). The mood turns on a dime from leisurely work to utter urgency. The action in the coming scenes is flawlessly executed and the filmmakers utilize the actors, camera and the synthesized setting to maximum effect.<br/><br/>At the crux of Alfonso Cuaron's new movie - a slim 91 minutes and the most worthwhile time I've spent in a cinema this year - there's a particularly arresting image during a zero-G tussle between the astronauts and their attempt to stabilize themselves amidst the speeding debris' unmitigated havoc. In a heartbreaking exchange between Stone and Kowalski, the camera captures a wide shot of the two astronauts and a tangle of slight nylon ribbons barely touched by the sun, holding Ryan and Kowalski together. It's a beautiful, fleeting moment. The ribbons and bodies are outstretched for just a moment, showing the complete desperation their situation foretells.<br/><br/>Newton's laws of motion were never made so abundantly clear, especially in a story where the burden of gravity is non-existent. For instance, the tethers attaching the astronauts to their vessels are never at rest, continually in captivating, sinuous motion like sea snakes. When we see Stone and Kowalski moving through space seeking refuge in one of their stations or pods, we have no idea of their rate of speed until they get closer and need to latch onto something - which will keep them from being in perpetual orbit themselves, until another object comes along and causes an equal and opposite reaction.<br/><br/>Aesthetically speaking, the zero gravity world of space allows for endless aesthetic choices. Since space is a vacuum, we hear none of the astronauts' exo-shuttle actions, except their dialog. This allows for not only the imagery to take center stage - as opposed to films dominated by dialog - but it makes what they DO say to be ever more significant, like those last few molecules of breathable oxygen in their suits. It also renders all of the debris' destruction a silent matter, begging the presence of music, here composed by Steven Price (a relatively unknown musician/composer until now). Price's score is a form of controlled chaos - a powerful analog, living and breathing structure with steep, raw and ominous synthesizer crescendos and manic strings - almost a character itself within the larger purpose it serves. <br/><br/>Visually, there are countless opportunities for a filmmaker to use the blackness of space, and the fluid movement that zero-G allows, to cinematic advantage. When Stone initially gets flung from her safety line, she flies into the depths of dark space in the center of the screen, getting smaller and smaller, and then when the screen is blackest we then see her careening back towards the camera, her peril none the lesser. Yet Cuaron, to his credit, doesn't necessarily need to take advantage of this. In other scenes he lets the camera drift about, sometimes slowly panning or floating between characters and within their cavernous structures, and then sometimes witnessing the chaos of the orbiting debris, all seemingly without many cuts at all. This greatly aids the story into a very cohesive, seamless whole, going from whistle-while-you-work to dire fight for survival. Cuaron is no stranger to this mellifluous style. In his previous feature Children of God, he does much the same thing, gliding a camera following Clive Owen through 9 minutes worth of bob-and-weave, bullet-and-bomb traffic. Emanuelle Lubeszki is the cinematographer in both films (in addition to Malick's Tree of Life) and may very well be nominated for his work here this Oscar season. <br/><br/>Of course none of this technique and style hold much weight without the stellar performances of the leads making it a story worth a damn. Clooney is an apt, semi-optimistic romantic and attractive enough to make Stone wonder about a lost loved one, but Bullock becomes the emotional reserve into which Gravity invests it's lasting power. She is the emotional element, the fourth dimension space cannot occupy.<br/><br/>There are the expected homages to cinema's forbears - numerous shots of floating pens and a womb-like Sandra Bullock a la Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey. Some of the more tragic scenes of falling bodies recall DePalma's underrated Mission to Mars, a criminally overlooked contender to the space film canon. Ultimately, though, Gravity holds it's own. Cuaron conjures images of floating fire in once scene and a remarkable close-up of one of Stone's tears in a later scene. Just as he's aware of how tall an order a space movie is, he is ecstatic yet tactful about showing the genre's possibilities. After all, in so many ways, filmmaking is about quality control. <br/><br/>Although some of the music choices near the end suggest happy ending resolve, and the end is a bit over-the-top down to earth, Gravity is an astronomical achievement. Ultimately, it's a movie that is less about everything than past cinematic odysseys, so there are no unanswered questions, which is perhaps the reason for its digestibility among the common viewership. It does pose some important questions about ourselves and our unfathomable universe. It will move you and it will make you glad you're on solid ground."

","In my opinion if you've seen the trailer then you've seen the movie. The effects are interesting for about 5 minutes but beyond that there is nothing to this snorefest. Maybe I missed something but then again I like a story that has more to it than something that can be written on a post it note in large writing. I don't hate this movie but if I had seen some of the more recent user ratings of this movie I would not have wasted my time, unfortunately I only saw the high rating and went with that. Usually IMDb is reliable but the current rating (8.3) seems crazy high for a movie that is so dire. I really would never watch this movie again and can only suggest that if you like to be entertained when you watch a movie then avoid this one."
"cleary-joshua","10","2","5","27 January 2014"," ""Gravity"" is a simply breathtaking film, and is hands down the best movie of 2013...
","""Gravity"" first came onto my radar about halfway through 2012, on one of those lists of films to look forward to later that year. The film's release was delayed quite a bit, but more information kept coming through in early 2013. In January, I declared, somewhat ambitiously, that it would be the best film to be released in 2013. After I watched the mind-boggling ""Children of Men"" for the first time in April last year, I was certain that I would love this as well. I built it up so much, told everyone that it was going to be amazing, and then in the few minutes before it started, I panicked. What if I'd over-hyped it and ended up underwhelmed? The lights went down, and within minutes of the start of the film, I knew I'd been right. ""Gravity"" is a simply breathtaking film, and is hands down the best movie of 2013.<br/><br/>Let's start with the plot. I won't say too much about it, for once, because I managed to go into this knowing almost nothing except the basics, and it made it even more magical for me. The film follows Dr Ryan Stone (Bullock), a teacher and astronaut, on her first mission in space. She is on the last spacewalk of her mission with Matt Kowalski (Clooney), when the Hubble Space Telescope is hit by space debris, and they are separated, with Stone floating through space. Over the course of a mesmerising and thrilling 90 minutes, Stone and Kowalski attempt to get safely back to earth. The plot, however, is not the film's most important part. The two characters are interesting, and their dialogue and character developments manage to be funny and moving at times. Clooney does a great job as the experienced astronaut, while Bullock is simply outstanding, bringing across the fear and emotion of her character so well. For Stone, the journey is not just one about getting back to Earth, but it's also a rebirth for her, getting over the loss of her daughter, and Bullock makes you feel the pain that she does.<br/><br/>The film's main attraction is undoubtedly the visuals ‚Äì It's like nothing I've ever seen before. The CGI of space is flawless and beautiful, and especially in 3D (it's one of the 3 films I've ever seen where 3D is worth it) you actually do feel like you're stuck out there with them. Cuaron's direction is completely evident, with his love of long takes coming through here. The first shot of the movie is around 17 minutes, and the constant panning of the camera to show you the action and vastness of space is not at all irritating, as you would expect. The film has everything, interesting characters, a good action plot, and fantastic visuals, and will keep you white-knuckle for the entirety of its running time. I have no doubt that this is one of the most original and stunning films I've seen released in recent years, and cannot wait for Cuaron's next effort."

","Wow, what an emotional ride! Right out the gate this movie is intense! At first the beginning of the movie is mostly what was shown in the previews and once that episode is over, for me, I was thinking, ""How are they going to stretch this into a 1.5 hr movie?"" Well, they did and it was intense the entire way! At first it reminded me of movies like ""Buried"" or ""I Am Legend"". Not much interaction with other characters, just solitude and thoughts from the performer and I believe that's what makes the emotional connection stronger to the actor performing, because deep down you are going through what they are and you inexplicably want to do something, anything to help in their endeavor, but all you can do is watch and hope they make it through whatever perils lay ahead. With top entertainers such as George Clooney and Sandra Bullock (who I love!) it's no wonder this movie was popular and greatly talked about after initial release (I don't get the luxury of opening nights anymore) My only regret is not having the opportunity to watch it in 3-D. I heard this is a movie actually enhanced (not just gimmicks) by 3-D. Just watching it in 2-D I could tell some events would give off more of a reaction from the added dimension.<br/><br/>So if you haven't yet seen this movie, I highly recommend it."

","While I was captivated by the Gravity's masterful cinematography, midway through the film I realized that it is really not a sci-fi movie about space, or about being an astronaut, but rather a representation of the classic quest myth as described by Northrop Frye and further defined as the monomyth by Joseph Campbell. <br/><br/>Our hero, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), has struggled on earth with a great loss, her daughter's death, and is numb to life. She must travel to the ""underworld,"" in this case outer space and battle her demons in order to redeem herself and recover her ability to live. As in the classic myth, she has a mentor, Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who guides her through her trials, but in the end she must fight alone to win her battle and return to life. <br/><br/>We see her floating in the space station as a fetus, and in the final scene she is reborn, nearly drowning in the process and emerging from the sea as if from a womb, even having to learn to walk again, stumbling on the beach. But she has survived the challenges and has now been restored to life. The setting in space is tangential to the theme; space and the astronaut's technologies are secondary, merely an updated setting for the archetypal hero quest myth. The movie is lyrical, and while a technological tour de force, more importantly Gravity arouses primal emotions by way of its structure as a universal myth."

Whatever it is: contempt for the audience, the arrogant ignorance of film makers, or the desire to cater to the 50% of people who are below average in intelligence, I find movies harder and harder to stomach, and in this case not because of the vertigo from motion sickness but from constantly rolling my eyes at the stupidity.<br/><br/>For those who enjoyed this movie I say, ""Great.""

","I am not an eager follower of sci-fi movies / space dramas without real enemies to fight, and the reasons I decided to watch Gravity were good actors and short duration (the latter is uncommon for such movies); true, I had read about high praise, but I did not get it under my skin :) Therefore, I observed a pleasant and talented actress Sandra Bullock and her similar counterpart George Clooney in the course of their actions... They did well as usual - although Bullock had much bigger role and I recalled similar Clooney from Solaris - and everything was decent/good, but no wow! feeling... As for the plot/script, even for me as non-physicist, there were too many odd phenomena, and floating Post-It notes and pens in the spaceship seemed more like a practical joke. Of course, cinematography and directing are well done, but all in all - with no new angles in the script and the ending's predictable nature, I am unable to consider it conceptional in the movie industry, just a well-polished creation."

","Just like Doctor Stone is gonna tell people a hell of a story after returning home, the director has also presented to us a hell of a film, in every sense there can be. Alfonso Cuar√≥n has set up a few boundaries of the sounds we can hear in space and conditions under which we can hear them, which has made the film more realistic. It's important to be realistic because ""Gravity"" is not a science fictional story like ""Avatar"", it's a story that can happen to us any day now. ""Gravity"" should be counted as one of the greatest films in the history of movie industry for the reason that for at least two hours it has put the audience's mind from normal life to outer space. This motion picture reminds me of another film I've just watched, ""Rush"", which basically carried the same thought that no matter how far we've gone, we'll always die, we'll always be driven into a corner where things just lose control. This weakness, powerlessness, sadness and cruelty is a kind of feeling that Human need to feel at times. However, while being humble, human beings should always find ways to improve themselves, to break limits, like Dr.Stone, traveling from Discovery to ISS, from ISS to Tiangong, knowing though at hand of death, she shall have no fear, for it would be one hell of a ride."

","By far the best use of a fully immersive 3D environment since Avatar, this is certainly a film to experience on the biggest screen you can get to. 3D is perfect for space, the stark outlines of objects against the emptiness of space or a beautiful, distant earth working amazingly well, rather than being distracting or headache inducing. <br/><br/>That's not to say there aren't any frantic action scenes, in fact oddly enough this is my chief criticism of the film. Poor old Dr. Stone, played by Bullock, is certainly put through the wringer in this bad day at work, the ever increasing perils and sheer bad luck she experiences becomes predictable, and a final credibility shattering sequence involving a fire extinguisher made it clear that as unique beautifully made as it is, it still follows Hollywood action film logic (I also couldn't help but think of the far more beautiful fire extinguisher as propellant sequence in Pixar's Wall:E). <br/><br/>For a film set in the silence of space, there is a lot of dialogue which gets tiresome, but to be fair there are several touching, quiet scenes too. The use of special effects is simply astounding, and any fan of movies should go for the immersive experience, if not the credibility stretching plot."

","Gripping space thriller about two astronauts, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) on her first space shuttle mission and Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) on his last, who have to fight to survive after an accident sets them adrift in space. Visually stunning film that is obviously best seen in 3D. Trust me, I'm not big on 3D and see it for the price gouging gimmick it usually is. However, this is one film where the viewing experience is actually enhanced by it.<br/><br/>The story is simple. So simple that it's the type of movie that really depends on its leads more than usual to keep it interesting. But they do deliver. Sandra Bullock is excellent, though admittedly the role does play to her strengths. Clooney plays Clooney, likable and stoic. We're told this is his character's last space flight before retiring. If you've seen any cop movie ever, you know there's not a bigger bullseye to have painted on your back than being on the verge of retirement.<br/><br/>It's a good movie. A little over-hyped but these days every moderately good film is over-hyped, unfortunately. Try not to let that prevent you from trying it. You'd be missing out on a solid movie if you did."

","Almost every pre-Academy Awards season brings for me the big Hollywood movies disappointment. A big studios film, usually directed by famous or at least interesting directors, getting raving critical acceptance and breaking audiences records for the year or for the eternity. A few years back the name of the sensation was Avatar, last year it was Lincoln. I go, I buy my popcorn, I sit down with the best intentions of enjoying it, and ... flop. When I exit the cinema theater I ask myself 'Is this all?'. 'What is the fuzz about?'.<br/><br/>This year with Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity it's even worse than in the past years.<br/><br/>Before you ask - yes, I have seen the 3D version in a well equipped cinema theater. I saw it in good visual and sound conditions and I was not enthusiastic at all about the cinematography and sound effects. I actually believe that cinematography was quite banal, and the few moments when some screwdrivers flew to our faces could not compensate for a film that takes place 80% in the open space - meaning open stellar space, and cannot provide even the National Geographic documentaries effects or emotions. The story is completely incredible from any point of view. If this is supposed to be science-fiction the science is completely flown, and the fiction non-credible. In other words, impossible on all grounds.<br/><br/>Neither can Sandra Bullock and George Clooney save this film. To their defense I should say that they are given a very clich√© relationship to act. Clooney's hero text actually provides some of the rare sources of emotion and fun in this film, but this is too little.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron directed previously at least one science-fiction film I fell in love with - Children of Men. What a difference between the action-ridden and the human tension there and the routine stuff we get in Gravity. I can understand his attraction into making such a film, it's a challenge for a director to film a story in either a small and confined environment or in the infinite space as here, and some of the greatest successes came from movies with theme like this. Unfortunately, he was not up to the challenge on almost any respect."

The previous three reviews I posted were of movies that I believe should never have been made under any circumstances. (Look them up by clicking my user name.) Gravity, for me at least, was different. <br/><br/>I read through many of the bad reviews others have posted here and I was amazed at how many people wanted to go into great detail about how the physics of the movie were not credible. Well, sure, of course - it's a movie! If we only ever dealt with the possible and realistic then movies ranging from Dumbo to Star Trek would never have been made. It's called the suspension of disbelief folks and Hollywood puts butter on its bread because of it. If viewers have not worked that out yet then, frankly, why watch anything? <br/><br/>I think Sandra Bullock did a great job carrying this movie more or less on her own. And, if reality is the marker here, when we consider that for 90% of the time she was emoting with only a green screen for company, what she did was actually remarkable. <br/><br/>Go see Gravity.

","What is cinema? Its the perfect blend of sights and sounds that should stir your audio visual sensory and in the process entertain you. Even if its got a paperthin plot, amazing performances and the right setting and score can create wonders for the audience. Its also a medium with which we should be able to live out our fantasies. Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity fulfills everything a movie should do. Forget deep space battles and X- Wings or the Enterprise swishing past by (if possible), forget Xenomorphs and LV 223. This is real life and it is at its best here.<br/><br/>Gravity opens with a shot of earth from space, it panned for some seconds and I was left skeptic, questioning if the whole movie would be so. Images struck me from 2001 A Space Odyssey and while 2001 was never EVER a bad movie, I didn't pay to watch it once again. My misconceptions were raked, minutes into the movie when George Clooney and Sandra Bullock's characters came into view, chattering, fixing stuff on a space satellite. A few more minutes in, they were left stranded in space with nothing but their wits and spacesuits with depleting oxygen. Our protagonists from there on takes us on a bonafide roller-coaster ride through space ensuing chaos & thrills enough to make you feel the usually-harmless-intermission-to-empty-your-bladders, intrusive!<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron has created a flawless masterpiece here. Gravity will dumbfound you to levels beyond that you will even forget that you are watching a movie. There were times where I forgot to breath like many in the audience. You feel you are inside the protagonists spacesuit and believe me the beautiful world will immerse you, not having to think twice that you are watching a movie. On a surface its a survivalist movie, but under the surface it has complex levels of philosophical goodness. There was this particular scene where Ryan Stone takes on a foetal position as soon as she gets inside a space station¬Ösimply awesome. Alfonso Cuaron, as evident from Children of Men, is a director with a panache for rich visuals and simultaneously telling a gripping story and the same can be seen here in Gravity. The plot isn't much to brag about but it wonderfully adheres to the visuals, promising a journey you are not likely to forget anytime soon.<br/><br/>Had the actors weren't of caliber, it could have gone utterly wrong, considering you have barely 3 actors the whole of Gravity. But when you've got Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in the lead, you can set aside whatever ill notions you've got. It could be considered a female- centric movie and Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone leaves no space for disappointment. I wouldn't be surprised if she ends up with an Academy Award (let alone for the movie or the visual effects). George Clooney, as usual, brings the charisma and charm, the wisdom as well as dalliance to Gravity.<br/><br/>The visual effects are stunning and beyond words. For someone who's never been to space, Gravity was as authentic an experience that I could have had and I am exceedingly pleased with it. This is the kinda movie, theatres are made for. I watched it at the IMAX and I was sucked into the 'out of the world' experience. The visuals rich, advanced and said to be engineered just for the movie, it was an orgasmic sight to behold. For a movie which is stripped much off its sounds, the score comes into play less often as expected but when it does, it does make for a terrifically tense experience. Two thumbs up for Steven Price's captivating score.<br/><br/>I can't recommend Gravity enough. Watching this on a small screen will never do justice to the efforts the cast and crew has put in the movie but more than that its a definitive experience of space travel. Why would you want to shell out millions (like thats possible) when the same could be experienced with a few bucks? That could be a implausible question but its as close we can get to space travel (And frankly this movie has made me astrophobic). One of the best movies of the year and worth every penny spent on the IMAX experience."

OK it's a movie and we can expect a degree of artistic license with the science, but really this is so way off that the whole movie loses credibility. No complaints about the acting, given the script they had to work with, but I don't see anything especially worthy of nominations or awards for these performances.

"JohnWelles","9","2","5","7 December 2013"," Modern Classic
","""Gravity"" (2013), directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, is at its heart, a film of survival, of battling an inhospitable environment against all odds, with no help and little chance of success. Framed like this, the film looks less like a science fiction film and more like a tale of survival. Cuar√≥n has endeavoured to make the space environment as realistic as possible, from the interior of space stations to the movement of the human body in zero gravity. Imaginatively utilising 3D, he shoots the many scenes set in the deathly silence of space to simulate the appearance of the camera ""floating"". The audience feels like they too are in the midst of space, buoying alongside Clooney and Bullock. This creates a sense of credibility throughout and makes the peril the characters face even tauter. Cuar√≥n has crafted a milieu that is ideal for showing the fragility of humanity against the vastness of the cosmos; writing the screenplay with his son Jon√°s, they populate the drama with only two characters to reinforce the emptiness of space.<br/><br/>These two characters though, are the audience's anchor, and are refreshingly well-written, recognisably human, reacting to events in a way that conforms to reality. Both Clooney and Bullock are excellent, never letting the extensive CGI dominate, while being appropriately ordinary enough to allow the viewer to identify with them, particularly Bullock. This is crucial for a film that concentrates on so few characters.<br/><br/>The cinematography by five time Academy Award nominee Emmanuel Lubezki perhaps acts as another character in the film, being the prism through we which enter the drama. Starting with a bravely held shot of Earth, it permits us to slowly make sense of the conversation over the radio between the astronauts and NASA (represented by an un-seen Ed Harris, one of the stars of ""Apollo 13"" [1995]). It continues with an extraordinary, thirteen minute long, continuous shot that is supremely virtuosic, their incredible duration carried on throughout the entire film. Yet this isn't done for its own sake; in doing so, Cuar√≥n brings you into the film and introduces a sense of claustrophobia with people stuck inside their spacesuits and the cramped interiors of escape shuttles and space stations. This had to be worked out in immense detail far in advance of shooting, meaning cinematography and editing (by Cuar√≥n and Mark Sanger) is intimately linked.<br/><br/>The music by Steven Price is very good, allowing for silence where there needs to be, and overall this exemplar of pure cinema, with no villain except the harshness of the universe, is probably the best original film of the year. It masterfully builds tension and character simultaneously and remains resolutely human throughout.<br/><br/>Hollywood can still surprise."

This movie is of course nothing of that sort. It contains nothing magical that couldn't happen in the real world.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, Gravity is a movie about surviving in extreme conditions and, to a lesser extent, about portraying the motive one has to carry on despite overwhelming odds against one. It features impressive visuals best experienced in a movie theater (preferably 3D!). That said it's well worth watching and the excitement you'll receive will be greater than the feeling of getting ripped off by the expensive movie tickets. I would, however, have wished for a deeper pondering about the motives of hope a human being has amidst a seemingly hopeless situation. I found the real motives of the protagonists to stay alive too superficial, but if you are more into core action - then this movie will seem almost flawless."

","Really an incredible movie. Heart-pounding and riveting to say the least. The film pulled me in a couple minutes into it, and held me there straight to the ending credits. The acting, especially by Sandra Bullock was incredible. And George Clooney did a great job too, he added a light comedic edge. I watched this movie in IMAX 3D, and I wouldn't recommend watching it any other way. There's something about IMAX that just makes the movie so much more realistic, and it makes you feel like you're in the movie with the characters. I never was really into 3D, because it was usually uncomfortable, but the Gravity experience with 3D was incredible."

","Space has always been an interesting setting for films. It takes the characters into the unknown, promising to put them in immediate danger. Anything could go wrong, and most of their resources and equipment must stay untouched and in perfect working condition if they want to survive and touch Earth again. However, most of these films add to that danger by providing creatures, a mission which is extra dangerous, or making other humans within the setting a threat. Gravity is special. It does not use any of the previously three described cases, and instead puts the characters in mortal danger by a simple, yet very plausible scenario. <br/><br/>Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer who has been contracted by NASA to create and install a prototype machine and computer which will provide further data to their investigations. She is accompanied by astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and two other astronauts. Within the first few minutes we see them working on the satellite which will hold Dr. Ryan's machine and computer. 2 minutes later the team is informed that Russia has destroyed one of their satellites with a missile, possibly to avoid any of their information in the satellite from being leaked if the pieces of it land on Earth. Seconds later the debris of the destroyed satellite is flying by them, some of it hits their ship and satellite, and Dr. Ryan Stone is sent into the void when her tether breaks, with nothing but her space suit and working tools. <br/><br/>All this happens within the first 10 minutes. It sounds dangerous, but it is nothing like watching it on the big screen and hearing it (greatly aided by 3D). All hell breaks lose around them. Everything turns to chaos in a few seconds, and soon Dr. Ryan has lost contact with everyone and finds herself spinning and floating in endless space. A few minutes later of panicking and hyperventilating (from both the audience and Ryan) Matt makes contact with her. For the next hour or so we watch them in torturous suspense attempt to return to Earth safely. <br/><br/>After the first 7 minutes the whole movie is one edge-of-your-seat ride. In the whole movie there are only a couple of scenes which slow down, provided to let the audience breath for a few seconds before the characters are thrown in mortal and unforgiven danger once more. All this is aided by phenomenal special effects. We never doubt that Matt and Ryan are floating in zero gravity, or that a slight change in their momentum will either save them or kill them. The score does the same. It makes us feel more tense or sad, depending on the scene, and the sound is aggressive and precise. The 3D is greatly immersive. It only pulls you into space and makes everything look more real and dangerous. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's performance is great. We never see anyone other than isolated Dr. Ryan Stone in Sandra Bullock's body. It is amazing to understand that for close to 80% of the film she is in front of nothing but a green screen for the special effects, but it is never noticeable. She carries the bulk of the movie and she does so smoothly and naturally, as if she was actually there in space, trying to survive and get back to Earth alive. <br/><br/>All in all, a great space suspense/thriller."

","First of all, let me just start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Alfonso Cuar√≥n's work and that for about 1 hour and half I just felt I was right there in space. ""Gravity"" was one of the most promising movies of this season and without any doubt it was successful. This space epic, about two astronauts (George Clooney and Sandra Bullock) who are lost in space after a huge explosion in space, is full of action and impressive special effects. After James Cameron's ""Avatar"" I have never thought there could be a movie with greater special effects but I was wrong. The mix between the well written storyline and the special effects make this an Oscar nominee for sure. ""Gravity"" is definitely one of the best movies of the year and the proof that sometimes 3D can improve our movie experience. The IMAX Experience of ""Gravity"" just made the movie more amazing than it is. In conclusion, Alfonso Cuar√≥n's new movie is one of those which I expect that years from now people will talk about. ""Gravity"" scores 10 out of 10. <br/><br/>IMAX Experience Review: Sound: 8/10 Visual Effects: 10/10 3D: 9/10 IMAX Experience Score: 9/10 -IMAXWORTHIT-"
"erbania64","10","2","5","26 October 2013"," Not the classic space movie, this is epic stuff
","What a great movie! I enjoyed every minute of it and cannot say if it is the acting, the music, the amazing special effects, the directing or the cinematography or all of them put together. The fact is that I was really concerned that I wouldn't like the movie. I'm reluctant to believe movie critics when they say that a film is a masterpiece. I don't go to see a film just because it is blockbuster. I'm not even a huge fan of Clooney (I am of Sandra Bullock, though). So a lot was against this movie and my expectation level was at the lowest.<br/><br/>But once the film starts, the 1st sequences already put you at the edge of your seat. The grandiose cinematography puts you in another dimension of entertainment. It is a very peculiar movie: only 2 actors, very few scenarios, little dialog, restless action ... I see why so many people love this movie and why some deeply dislike it. Warner has hit the jackpot with this title, good for them!<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock may get an Academy Award Nomination, it wouldn't surprise me. This movie is her 100% alone in space. She's splendid in her own space misery fighting a heroic battle against the impossible.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron becomes now for me a great director with great style, talent and class. He knows how to provoke emotions visually, just to the right point he wants.<br/><br/>Go see it, with no expectations, and let yourself go and share the fun!"
"vijayadar","10","2","5","13 October 2013"," GRAVITY - The best film I have ever seen
","Just watched the most amazing film I have ever seen. I must say that I am not fond of what film buffs call sci-fi and fantasy cinema, with its special effects and camera tricks that are so intriguing and beguiling. Somehow, despite all the high technology and the enormous amounts of money spent on creating mind-boggling sets, the narratives fail to rise above the mundane, and one is left wondering at what the creator of the film was trying to convey that could not have been said with simplicity. Most of the so-called hi-tech movies are modern versions of the old Westerns that were such a delight to watch when we were young. No amount of special effects that made Star Wars such a great success at the box office can make it a better or a more engaging film than Gunfight at the OK Corral or The Last Train from Gunhill. Hollywood has made a huge investment in studios, sets, and technology. To recover these investments the producers feel that they have to make films with special effects that can use this technology, and scripts are tweaked to include the use of mental pyrotechnics in order to keep the spectators on the edges of their seats. Blockbuster films like Avatar, Inception, Oblivion, and the Dark Knight saga exploit these techniques to the hilt. Their recognition all around the world, and the Academy and other international awards they routinely win, would seem to justify the investment that the industry has made in these technologies. But all the special effects and all the technology only add to the visual appeal of the cinema; it does nothing to the content. And that is why Gravity is such a different film.<br/><br/>In the hands of Alfonso Cuaron Gravity becomes a profoundly philosophical experience; an intense, emotionally exhausting journey into the universe that is unimaginably vast and incomprehensibly complex. The story is so simple that it can be written in just one page. No wonder actors like Angelina Jolie, Natalie Portman and a number of Hollywood celebrities made themselves unavailable for the role of the leading lady. I can imagine them telling the Director that the script gave them no scope to display their histrionic talents, and that they would not like to waste their energies on such a project. Even the male lead played by George Clooney had been offered to Robert Downey Jr., the star of the new Sherlock Holmes films, but he too might have found the role too minimal for his star status and discovered that he had ""scheduling problems.""<br/><br/>Teaming up with his writer son Jonas Cuaron, and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, with whom he had earlier made the immensely successful Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron has created a masterpiece, a film that grips you from the first scene, shakes your every nerve, and leaves you physically and emotionally drained at the end. Sandra Bullock, playing a medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone, on her first space mission, is a devoted scientist who leaves her laboratory every evening and drives home to a meaningless existence outside that lab. George Clooney is Matt Kowalski, a veteran astronaut, on his last space mission as its commander. The two are performing a routine space walk while repairing some instrument aboard the Hubble space telescope when disaster strikes in the form of a Russian satellite disintegrating and crashing through space destroying other satellites, creating a veritable assault of space debris that crashes at astronomical speeds into whatever it encounters in its path. In the process the two astronauts get separated from their shuttle and are set adrift in the vastness of their surroundings. All the resources available are contained within their space suits, and with Oxygen levels dropping, their chances of survival are reduced to near zero. <br/><br/>How the two cope with their predicament is the narrative of the 90 minutes of this stunning film that has perhaps the most wonderful visuals of the universe as seen from 600 Kms., above the earth. This, we must understand, is not a Discovery Channel documentary, but a human drama taking place not on terra firma but in an atmosphere of zero gravity, where there is no atmosphere to speak of. The film revolves round these two actors although we do hear the voices of the mission controllers and the third astronaut aboard the shuttle, who happens to have some connection with the Indian subcontinent, and who keeps singing the famous ""mera joota hai japani"" song from Raj Kapoor's Shree 420. The film is shot in 3-D, which makes the viewer get totally involved in the action. In space, where there is no atmosphere to carry sound, and where silence is supreme, the Director has introduced a musical score that heightens the drama, and only science purists will cavil at this cinematic license. I am not sure how accurate the physics of the film is, but for an average, reasonably well educated viewer, it should not matter. The performance of Sandra Bullock, a late choice for the role, is undoubtedly her best till date, and I am sure the actors who passed this role must be rueing the fact. Bullock should easily win the Oscar for this performance of a lifetime. George Clooney has yielded top billing to his co- star, although his performance is no less commendable. <br/><br/>Gravity should be the hottest favourite to win a clutchful of Academy Awards this year and I cannot see any other film coming close to it in the race for the top honors, including all the technical awards. Overall, it is an extremely satisfying film that raises difficult questions about the limits of science in an infinite universe; and whether the laws of physics are the only tools required to resolve the riddles of existence; birth, death and the human response to intangibles like love, care and despair. It raises questions about the validity and the role of spirituality in a world governed by science."
"briandnoss","6","2","5","20 October 2013"," Not Oscar-worthy
","This is a decent movie and the special effects were great. The 3-D very much enhanced the experience. That being said, despite the Best Picture and Best Actress buzz I've seen about this movie, it is not of that quality. Some of the events of the movie are simply implausible ... one might expect a miraculous event or escape in such a movie, but the constant move from one to another became distracting. It reminded me a lot of Speed in this regard. Sandra Bullock's performance was fine, but she was somewhat miscast. Her space shrieks were distracting (listen in the previews to her 'Ahh ... Ahh ... Ahh' in her nasally voice, if you want to know what I mean). George Clooney was also fine, but he was basically playing himself, which I didn't find particularly engaging or interesting. He was much better in the Descendants.<br/><br/>Overall a decent date movie with great special effects and 3-D. If it gets nominated, it will be on those merits. Don't go expecting an Argo quality story. In terms of other movies I've seen I describe it as Speed meets Life of Pi ... set in outer space."
"halliejopo","7","2","5","13 October 2013"," Good film, very overrated.
","I am definitely in the minority here, but I will go ahead and admit that Gravity failed to impress me that much. I went to the theater with very high expectations after hearing how it was ""the best movie of the year"" and seeing its 97% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Although I thought that, yes, Gravity was good, it was not nearly as amazing as the critics made is out to be.<br/><br/>The visual effects are obviously the best aspect of Gravity. The scenery was stunning and some of the effects the filmmakers were able to pull off were awe-inducing. Another great aspect of the film was its ability to thrill and stress the audience. Gravity was made centered around the audience.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's performance was mostly very good. There were parts that I felt her acting went a bit over-the-top.<br/><br/>The main aspect of Gravity that I had a problem with was the characters, or lack thereof. The movie obviously centered itself around Sandra Bullock's character, almost too much so. There were basically only two other actors that you ever saw. I can understand why Alfonso Cuaron would do this, to make the audience feel the sense of isolation, but it was way too much. With only one character to focus on, the movie's plot was almost uninteresting. Also, another thing that bothered me was how clich√© Sandra Bullock's character was. Her back story is almost identical to every other Hollywood Blockbuster character's story.<br/><br/>Overall, the visuals were fantastic, but the plot and characters were only so-so. I have seen critics mention these downfalls before, then defend Gravity by saying that it isn't a movie about the story, its about the visuals. Yet I find it somewhat ironic that these same critics praising Gravity slammed Avatar back in 2009 for it being all about the visuals.<br/><br/>So yes, Gravity is good. It's a nice, solid movie. But it is not a movie to watch more than once, or to watch outside of a theater. Undoubtedly, Gravity will win a substantial amount of awards. I am not saying that it does not deserve it. I can tell that the filmmakers put their heart and souls into making this film, but Gravity still has several weak points that should have been fixed."
"januaryman-1","7","2","5","13 October 2013"," Stunning images
","It's hard to write of Gravity without introducing spoilers, but I'll give it a summarized shot.<br/><br/>The images are stunning. The local theater is only showing 3D; that may be the only choice. I'm not a glasses fan, but the 3D is done very well. The sets are also very nicely done.<br/><br/>There are a lot of places where it is quite difficult to suspend disbelief on some of the technical points. Gravity is not accurate in the physics sense (from what I read) and a few other places, but to discuss them is to give away things. Just accept Gravity as a suspenseful movie chock full of memorable images."
"SeriousJest","6","2","5","13 October 2013"," Well Done for What it is
","This film is about 2 things, as I see it: space-station missions and survival. I think the movie accomplished an interesting story in both respects. As to the latter, the film did a good job of establishing a desperate pace, in which: every second counts; there is little rest for the weary, and Murphy's Law is in full effect; and no one is going to save you but yourself, so you better nut up or shut up¬Öfor good. Space is a perfect setting for these themes, as the movie effectively conveyed the isolation of space, the importance of rigorous training so ingrained that certain actions become involuntary, and the sheer wonder of modern technology. These aspects of the film, along with its breathtaking scenery and its compelling acting (by the way, props to Bullock for her hard work on that rocking 49-year-old body!), almost make it a Must See; but overall, my reaction to a friend who tells me that he hasn't seen this flick will probably be more like ""It's worth it if you ever do, and see it in 3-D, if you can"" than ""You really need to see that movie.""

"Reno-Rangan","10","2","5","13 October 2013"," It's time to go home!
","'Gravity', one of a best space movie ever produced. Remember I am not comparing it to any space travel and alien themes. Definitely it was this year's 'Life of Pi'. Easily one can put it into his/her's all time favourite list. There are very few breathtaking 3D movies I have seen in my life and it is one of them along side 'Avatar', 'Hugo', 'Life of Pi'. Probably you will miss something great if you miss this movie, especially in digital 3D. You will have whole life with you to see this movie at any time and day but watching it when it is served hot and spicy will be the best shot one can give. So all I can say is don't miss this movie at any cost.<br/><br/>Okay lets talk about the movie and its storyline. The story of this movie takes place approximately 600km above the Earth where astronauts sent to repair the Hubble space telescope. During the final spacewalk, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) on her first space expedition accompanied by Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) gets a warn message from their mission control in Huston. As that destroyed Russian satellite's scattered fragments are approaching them at very speed. Soon after they loose contact from the control station in the Earth, now they have to abort the mission and reach the safe place. But it is too late for them and what comes after is the chain reaction of the destructed Russian satellite.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock was very good as well looked so hot in off the astronaut costume. There are no running, dancing or any gun fights like that happen in space travel theme. As it is happening in the space everything are floating and drifting so within that limited offer to give an actor to perform she did a wonderful performance. George Clooney did not have much scope for his role, within his limited time span he was as usual very nice.<br/><br/>It won't waste much time, within starting few minutes the visuals makes you to feel you are in the space. Since it takes place in space, we know the objects floats in zero gravity so there are many visual pop-ups. Most importantly the intense pop-ups are excluded like that happens in commercial movies, everything are looked very natural like that happens in the space. It was a great achievement cinematic, to show the enormous space with most of them covered with dark background in 3D other than Earth's. Yes, with a dark background it is hard to see the depth of an object in 3D so the graphic designers did a wonderful job to make it work. In some of the scenes the camera view transforming into a character's view which were something I never seen before, surprisingly awesome.<br/><br/>It was a simple storied movie but a breathtaking stunts, we were expecting all these years for it without knowing. A little late but came at the right time when the graphics and 3D are beginning to boom the cinema world. As you see it was not a rocket science to understand the movie but of course it was a bit about rockets and stuffs. What I am saying is anyone can easily understand the movie, it was not that complicated at all. Even kids can enjoy it, only if they are okay with loneliness, distress kinda mild mind tortures.<br/><br/>This year's Oscar buzz begins with this movie, what a way to begin. I will be very sad if this movie won't get at least a single golden trophy in an upcoming Oscar ceremony. I think I can expect nominations in the category of visual effects, cinematography and best female lead for Sandra Bullock. As well there is a strong chance that this movie could get into the top 10 for the best motion picture nominee list. But still I don't how everything goes in the next couple of months because there are many great movies are in queue to hit the screen. Such Oscar movies are '12 years of Slave' and 'American Hustle'. I got a feeling that its big box office will impact a lot at the American Academy Awards. If everything I said happens, on that particular night I will have a little smile remembering this review I wrote.<br/><br/>As you see I might be a bit overwhelmed by a watch but I am sure this will be the best 90 minutes you will ever spend time for a movie in 2013. To encounter the real space atmosphere you must see the movie on a big screen as well in digital 3D. Hope you will enjoy it more than I did or anyone around you.<br/><br/>9¬Ω/10"

Gravity might be the greatest movie of the decade. Arguably, it could be better then Kubrick's 2001. Here is why it is perfect.<br/><br/>When you make a movie, you have to have a sense of direction you are going to take the movie to. The director knows what he wants to make. He wants to make a fascinating look at space. Not only that, but he wants to make a realistic movie about being stranded in space. It works all the way. This movie is more frightening than 1979's Alien because you feel like you have no air. It actually feels that way when you're watching Gravity.<br/><br/>Now, The first 15 minutes of this film is a long shot that shows the action of the astronauts. This gives lots of suspense of what will happen to them in the next few minutes turning into the whole entire movie. They are stranded in space and are trying to get back down to earth. <br/><br/>The effects are pitch perfect. It actually looks like they filmed in space. But its only just visual effects. <br/><br/>The film is extremely accurate to what would happen if you were in this situation. Such things as hallucinations and situations of getting more oxygen are shown. <br/><br/>The movie is also extremely overwhelming in emotions. The musical score does the best job at trying to make you feel scared and sad. <br/><br/>Gravity Is Super Effective. It is riveting. It is captivating.

","It's funny how a literal change in point of view can beautify the hell out of something. Before I get into the meat of the film, I have to mention it had an unfair advantage over any other film in history. This film exploited the overview effect with the first capable match of technology and affordability (also paired with raw talent) to show the Earth as if it (and it is) ALIVE. The film attempted to contemplate life and it's echo's, and did so in an honorable way. However, any acclaimed intellectual can see that it is not a contextually deep film. It has strong highlights backed by unreal cinematography (if we can still use that term to describe CGI), but isn't a 100% complete film. <br/><br/>George Clooney (10/10) may have been the only capable human being on earth to fulfill, with elegance, such a prototypical role. Sandra Bullock (6/10) did not give enough UMPH. There is no other way to describe it, I just needed MORE. I think Natalie Portman, Charlize Theron, or Hilary Swank should've been casted. <br/><br/>I don't feel like explaining my opinions today, and I'm about to go intoxicate myself beyond any societally acceptable means.

"The-Sarkologist","9","2","5","12 October 2013"," A breathtaking ride through the terror of being trapped in space
","When I first saw the trailers for this film I wasn't really all that impressed but something inside of me made me want to go and see it today after book club. So, I wondered up to the cinemas at Melbourne Central to see the 12:30 session, which turned out to be in 3d. Now, I am not a big fan of 3d movies because I don't feel that they add all that much to the film, unless of course the film is a certain type of film.<br/><br/>Gravity is that type of film.<br/><br/>To be blunt, there were scenes in the film that literally gave me vertigo, and while I did not necessarily feel like I was floating in space, I certainly felt that I was really, really, high up. I am seen a few films in 3d, and the only ones that actually made me feel anywhere close to that would be the 4d films that I saw at Disneyland and at Warner Bros Movie World, and even then those films had touch aspects to it to add to the illusion. Gravity is simply a film that was filmed in 3d.<br/><br/>This is one awesome. One could say that the tag line of Alien ‚Äì in space, no one can hear you scream ‚Äì really should have been left for this film because this film, with its lack of monsters, and feeling of absolute hopelessness, was much, much more terrifying. Okay, the physics may have been bent a little to add to the film, but other than a few plot devices, they were pretty spot on.<br/><br/>As I said, this film is terrifying. It is about a woman who is working on the Hubble Space telescope when the space shuttle is struck by debris from an exploding satellite, and is left stranded in space. The first few scenes actually has her spinning off into orbit, and the way Cuaron puts you inside the spinning space suit literally adds to the terror.<br/><br/>The whole concept of this film is not just the nature of loneliness, but also the nature of helplessness. In space, if something goes wrong, it is very, very, hard for people to be able to get up there to be able to help you. In a way, this scenario almost suggests that the entire space program has been set back decades, and the possibility that our modern telecommunications system has effectively been destroyed. Okay, in reality, the debris would probably only make one orbit of the Earth before heading higher, but as I suggested, sometimes it is good to bend the laws of physics to add to the plot."

","Do we really breathe properly? That's what I was thinking after I saw the movie. I don't know, maybe I was a little bit emotional after I saw the film of Alfonso Cuar√≥n. But I think I will not make a mistake if I state that living is a lot like breathing - you have ups and downs and sometimes you enjoy it, other times you can barely get through it. With such a soulful movie in front of us we cannot stay indifferent. From the first glimpse of our beautiful planet to the last shot of the sea shore - we are engulfed in a spacious journey which endeavors in the bright and dark places of our inner and outer human universe. In a broader aspect - this is a story about our place in life and space and how we perceive it. I'm not really sure if I have seen a better performance by Sandra Bullock, but I'm pretty much convinced that it will not be the last of her magnificent reincarnations. And George Clooney not only looked as the calmest person in the cosmos - he convinced me that to be a parental figure, you have to work hard and always act natural. This is the best way to represent what is truly happening in your mind and heart. Every breath of the main character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is co-experienced by the viewer. No matter how calm or fearful, her breathing is heartfelt, because we all know what is fear and tranquility and how these two can change their places suddenly. That is why I enjoyed every minute of this spectacle. It was entertaining, enlightening and rewarding. A guide into finding the will to overcome yourself and live life as it is."

Its about how she survives n is helped by a friend n inner strong instinct & how she fights all the demons in herself & makes her way back to earth. It really keeps you seated tightly in your cushioned seats n one can only exclaim in wow at the gorgeously picturised view of earth from up there. Plus the special effects like the tears converting into bubbles, devastation caused by the incoming debris... n not to forget the confidence n the next to perfect booming voice of George Clooney with all the humor thrown in. An awesome experience. Will surely be counted as one of the forerunners in the list of inspiring tales a list that includes schindler's list,etc. Cant afford to miss it.."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Hopefully you aren't expecting yet another in the seemingly endless stream of unadulterated praise fests for Alfonso Cuaron's critically beloved and audience pleasing Gravity. While the mass appeal is certainly understandable, I've never been one to sit back and accept the surface value.<br/><br/>There are two elements for discussion here: the visually stunning and technical marvel from a filmmaking perspective, and the emotionally-manipulating and somewhat emptiness of the narrative story-telling and characters. On the technical front, one would be hard-pressed to come up with a more impressive film. It is simply breath-taking, especially when seen in the format it should be seen ... 3D IMAX. Rarely, if ever, has space seemed more real, more beautiful and more ominous. From the extended opening take (Cuaron is known for his long takes), to the numerous shots of Planet Earth (from dominating the screen, to reflections in helmet shields), we are drawn in to the space walking and perils of Kowalski (George Clooney) and Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock).<br/><br/>From an entertainment viewpoint, the film works as high-stress, thrilling space mission gone bad and ultimate survival story. What left me feeling a bit distracted and hence, quite annoyed, was the often eye-rolling dialogue seemingly designed to force our connection with the Clooney and, especially, Bullock characters. I prefer to experience my own emotions in both real life and in movies ... obvious cues and manipulating tugs through weak character development drives me away from, rather than towards the desired connectivity. My issues with the film are not related to the numerous scientific issues identified by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. This is all explained away by Mr. Cuaron's statement that the film is ""not a documentary"". If we can be cool with Forrest Gump creating the smiley face, we can accept that Sandra Bullock can navigate her way between space stations with a fire extinguisher.<br/><br/>Despite this, it's tough to argue against the technical marvel and thrilling experience created here. The 3D adds depth of field and adds a touch of realism, rather than the gimmicky tricks we often see with the format. With only a couple of jarring exceptions, Steven Price's score is minimal and complimentary to the quietness of space. Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men) re-teams with Cuaron for the extraordinary look. Some of the symbolism was a bit overdone - recurring umbilical imagery for the re-birth, but it's done to ensure no viewer misses the point. Finally, I got a kick out of Ed Harris' voice coming from Mission Control (think back to The Right Stuff and Apollo 13)."

","Visually stunning...but Claustrophobic! I had the urge to walk out after 10 or 15 minutes, not because it was bad, but because you really do feel like you're in space. And the director keeps you there, with no earthbound cuts in the action. Just the right amount of CGI, which, after the usual blockbuster overkill of ""things moving everywhere on the screen,"" I appreciated. You feel the vastness and silence of space, and it's not someplace I want to be. Not sure what folks are thinking about Sandra Bullock's performance being ""Oscar-worthy."" She's good, but not that good. And Clooney is, well, vintage Clooney. So I guess I'm not recommending it, but then again, I was too busy trying to wish myself back on the ground. Others obviously loved it."

Next came ""Aliens"", the movie which puts James Cameron at the A category. However, after these 2, I thought ""What a pity, Sci-Fi is such an amazing genre, but from here, it's going generally downhill.""<br/><br/>Then came the year 2013.<br/><br/>Somewhere around late August or so, I came across this ad with the trailer, an upcoming Sci-Fi film called ""Gravity"", starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I thought ""Hey, even if this won't be a great Sci-Fi, it'll still be a box office hit.""<br/><br/>THEN, I watched the trailer and as god be my witness it was one of the fastest 2 minutes of my life and goosebumps went all over my body.

I dare not say that this is as good as or better than ""Alien"" and/or ""Aliens"", but I won't be surprised to see ""Gravity"" at next year's Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Essentially, if you're a Sci-Fi cinemaniac, and you enjoyed ""Alien"" and/or ""Aliens"", welcome back to space with zero ""Gravity""!!!<br/><br/>10/10"
"The_Film_Cricket","10","2","5","5 October 2013"," A film that you only think that you think you know.
","Alfonso Cuar√≥n's ""Gravity"" is barely 20 seconds along when an ominous on screen title reminds us that ""Life in space is impossible."" With all of the advances in space exploration in the past 60 years, this seems gloomy and unnervingly closed-minded, yet Cuar√≥n backs it up. He then spends the next 90 minutes proving this statement to be correct. Space is a hostile, cold, merciless environment unfit for human habitation. One false move and you'll suffer for it.<br/><br/>One of the great achievements of ""Gravity"" is that Cuar√≥n portrays space without a single ounce of romanticism. He sees it in terms of cold reality. The story is lean and spare (the movie is surprisingly short), presenting a nightmare scenario involving only two people, with a handful of others who exist faintly around the film's edges. One is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who is on his final mission. The other is Bio-Medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who is on her first trip into space, tagging along to help do some work on The Hubble Telescope. Bobbing and floating around in the blackness of space with the earth looming behind them, they are privy to such breathtaking sights as the polar ice caps, the northern lights and a nasty hurricane pattern somewhere in the vicinity of Florida. Cuar√≥n's brilliance here is that he puts us squarely in the environment itself. We are there with these two travelers, and that makes their dilemma much more palatable. He gets the details right from floating debris ‚Äì chess pieces, pens and partials - to floating tears.<br/><br/>At first, things seem unnervingly calm, yet we know something is coming and when it does, it happens at with scary ferocity. Stone and Kowalski get an urgent message from Mission Control (voiced by old reliable Ed Harris) that a Russian satellite has exploded and has caused a chain reaction, destroying other satellites and causing a massive shower of debris that is headed their way. They have seconds to react. In a moment, the shuttle is gone and they are drifting through the infinity of space. The fate of a third astronaut is a grisly reminder of what they're dealing with.<br/><br/>What follows is one damned thing after another as Stone and Kowalski try and figure out how to get to safety in an environment dead set on robbing them of it (Kowalsky clocks how long they have before the debris comes around again). Much of the adventure cannot be revealed without spoilers except to say that while you know the plot, you don't know the specifics. Cuar√≥n creates tension by rooting his plot so organically that it seems to be happening in real time. He keeps the story and the characters very spare, only employing what is necessary to the story. He doesn't gum the movie up with a lot of perfunctory dialogue and needless scenes. Much like ""Apollo 13,"" the dilemma is the story, but unlike that film ‚Äì where the astronauts had mission control to help - this one cuts the characters loose to fend for themselves. Communication has been lost and they are literally on their own.<br/><br/>The characters are also very spare. We learn a little about Stone and less about Kowalski. She's adrift on her mission and in her life. Her space back home is as empty as the blackness she's floating in. Having suffered a tragedy, her life is now meaningless except in her work. Yet, the tragedy in space opens up something in her, a regeneration of will that could only be brought on by crisis.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is, for a lot of the time, a one-woman show. Clooney is good, but Bullock gives her best and most stirring performance playing someone who is pushed to the absolute edge of what one human being should have to endure, arriving at the pinnacle of decision of whether to keep going or let herself be consumed. This is a very physical performance, given in long stretches without dialogue. Cuar√≥n circumvents getting to know her through dialogue by giving us long, lingering shots of Bullock's lovely, yet wounded face. Her face becomes the film's most enduring image, peering out through her visor with large eyes that suggest more than she is willing to tell. Inside of her is twisting a weary soul whose body is being subjected to the same measure of extreme physical punishment that she has suffered back in Illinois. Yet, this is a story of how she is forced to finds her way out of the darkness. There's a brilliant shot mid-way through the film as Stone floats in a fetal position with an air hose behind her, looking like a baby in the womb. It's a symbol of rebirth that comes as a jolt.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock has always been the most down-to-earth actress of her generation. She's beautiful, but unglamorous and she can reveal more about her emotional state in her silences then most actress' can with gobs of dialogue. Here she creates a character without a lot of exposition and we come to care deeply about her. In a way, this movie that seems to be about the harshness of exteriors becomes a moving drama about the wilderness of interiors. The sparseness of Bullock's character allows us to attach our own feelings. She's a person living in limbo both in space and on the ground. ""Gravity"" begins with the information that ""Life in space is impossible,"" and as we come to follow Ryan's journey, we discover that this statement is also about her."
"Al_The_Strange","10","2","5","4 October 2013"," ""Clear, with a chance of satellite debris.""
","Working in space is full of inherent dangers: astronauts on a space walk are always in danger of being untethered and flung into open space, to either drift eternally or fall to the Earth and burn up. An astronaut could run out of air and suffocate. If anything happens to the EVA suit, an astronaut could decompress. There's always the threat that random debris orbiting the planet could strike an astronaut and end his life very suddenly. Space is too wide open to have any margin of error; the film Gravity even starts with the statement that it is impossible for life to exist in space.<br/><br/>Some films have touched upon the dangers of space here and there, but of all the space movies out there, Gravity is easily the most earnest attempt to make a plausible and creditable thrill ride out of showing astronauts in peril. The film is simple and minimalistic, using only two main characters and a simple situation to make them struggle for their lives. As the astronauts suffer a tragic space accident and are forced to use their limited air and resources to find a way back to Earth, the film tracks their every move and focuses on all the dangers and problems they face. What makes the film great is that there is always a new problem to face: it's not just 90 minutes of floating in space, it's a survivalist story that smoothly progresses from one thing to another. Despite the perils on display, the film also showcases some gorgeous imagery, showing vast views of Earth from orbit, with city lights, clouds, and auroras clearly visible along the planet's surface. Some of the most jaw-dropping sequences, however, show a silently violent storm of debris that rips through space shuttles and space stations, obliterating them into thousands of pieces of debris. The experience overall is visually marvelous and tensely gripping.<br/><br/>The story is as minimal as it can be; the plot is solely devoted to the survival story, with the astronauts drifting from one target to another to try and reach home. Characters are colorful and likable, but aren't really explored in depth. The simplicity of the story, however, is part of what makes it great; the film takes its time to breathe and let the experience take precedence.<br/><br/>Part of what makes the film work, however, is its cameramanship, which is extraordinary. As an evolution of the prolonged shots used in Children of Men, Gravity has many sequences where the camera always moves and tracks the action without cutting. The opening sequence in particular must have run for ten minutes or so without a single cut. The camera swings around and swoops through space to replicate the effect of actually being in space, and it does so without being erratic or annoying; the imagery is always smooth and flowing. As such, the editing is ingenious. Acting is pretty decent: Sandra Bullock is surprisingly earnest in this role, and I believe this may be the best of her career, for she plays a character that we love to root for (and is not all that goofy either). George Clooney is pretty much himself. Writing is very good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and marvelous special effects. The film also uses a very interesting soundscape; because there is no air in space, the film keeps actual sound effects to a minimum, but it fills the void with the dialogue, and with Steven Price's enchanting music score.<br/><br/>Astronaut movies are few and far between as they are (the only other good contenders I know of would be The Right Stuff and Apollo 13, and I daresay Space Cowboys). As it is, Gravity is my new favorite among space movies, for it presents a fundamental story in a creditably fashion with superb skill and craftsmanship.<br/><br/>Recommended! 5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"

","Gravity challenges convention with its brilliantly bold and refreshingly simple plot; a disaster during a space shuttle repair leaves two astronauts adrift in space. And they must fight to return to earth. End. Gravity is unchallenging to watch and is bound by the uncomplicated mission of putting the reliance on the viewer to make the difference. This movie is about the intimate, inextricable relationship between challenge and reward.<br/><br/>The script has been honed within an inch of its life and actually has a surprising amount of heart. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney rise to the occasion with aplomb. No small feat, considering the story's brilliantly executed shifts from white-suspense to emotional density. Bullock in particular has an immense screen presence in this film and somehow manages to outshine the breathtaking cinematography. This is her best performance yet and she deserves gold statuette nom.<br/><br/>The camera work is vintage Cuaron. Gravity is blessed with his trademark excruciatingly long, cut-free scenes with pivoting, panorama motions. It's disorienting, unnerving and it fits the atmosphere perfectly. I love that Gravity's character is so transparent. It cannot be any other film than an Alfonso Cuaron film. <br/><br/>Gravity is discreetly and unbearably tense, with a runaway train sensation in the way it builds up suspense; nothing frantic, just a no- nonsense rush that just builds and builds. If you're prone to addictions, Gravity will turn you into a suspense junkie. What's amazing is the scale of the pyrotechnics, tension, emotions prowess and how beautifully they combine. Gravity is hugely impressive without any single element dominating the experience, everything rises in unison.<br/><br/>I'm not sure such brutal calculation of response has ever been coupled to such emotional intimacy. Gravity is simply a breathtaking experience. Here and now, in the immediate aftermath, this is one of the greatest films ever. And for that, I owe Alfonso Cuaron an eclipse inducing debt of gratitude."

"verinibusiness","1","4","14","30 October 2013"," A Good Film, but Over-hyped
","Yes, there is no denying that gravity is a solid film. However, the only reason why I'm rating it a 1/10 instead of a worthy enough 7/10 is because 8.6/10 for this film is simply too high.<br/><br/>The plot was very limited, and because of this, they were ultimately effective in delivering a some-what entertaining experience; which was, in my opinion, because of the cinematography, sound and editing. <br/><br/>The acting, script, and plot were nothing short of mediocre, however, the use of angelic music to heighten certain scenes in the movie, as well as the utilisation of a variety of sounds (sometimes even being complete silence) was done perfectly and captivated most of the audience. An example of this was the high-pitch noises which compelled the viewer towards the plight of the protagonists situation and added a sense realism. The camera work should also be commemorated. But hey what can you expect from Alfonso Cauron after his critically acclaimed Children of Men which was notorious for it's hand-held like camera techniques, and cinema verite. Visual effects were also top-notch i may add. <br/><br/>Bottom line: This movie should be rated a 7.5/10 not 8.6/10. It is simply too high for such a mediocre storyline, script and acting performances. I recommend seeing it in 3D though.<br/><br/>Also, to give you a perspective on the absurdly high rating gravity received, (it is currently 8.6) it is rated higher than any other space movie that i know of (including 2001 space odessy, alien, and the original star wars). Do you actually think gravity is worthy of being #20 on the top 250 movies of all time IMDb list? It's currently higher than gladiator, the departed, dark knight rises, American history x and saving private ryan; which are all, in my opinion much much much better and worthier to be in the top 250 than gravity...."

","For starters, I think you should know this is the first review I write in IMDb. However, I was so angry at this movie and so astonished by its rating that I couldn't help but come here and try and save somebody else's 90 minutes. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is a mission specialist sent in space to do some magic, but since the start you're constantly shown how she sucks at her jobs and how in general she is unprepared to do anything in space. The only other character, George Clooney, is supposed to be an expert astronaut who ends but being a total kid by just being focused on beating the record of untethered space time.<br/><br/>For some unfathomable reason, the Russians (evil guys because duh.. America...) decide to take down a satellite with a friggin' missile, instead of making it land like all normal people do. This causes a chain reaction where, for extreme bad luck, practically everything humankind has in space is destroyed.<br/><br/>Aside from the laughable premise, a few unbearable things make this film a waste of 90 minutes, I'm going to keep it short just to save you some extra time.<br/><br/>1) conversation between the two characters is dull and pointless. 2) main character keeps narrating everything she does and think. Jeez just shut up, you're alone in space, who are you talking to? 3) George clooney's character is just an idiotic parenthesis 4) The endless chain of incredible bad luck the main character has can only be explained by the fact that this movie needed to be longer than 15 minutes. No other logic thought can justify any of it. 5) the only good part of the movie is the graphics, but for that you can just watch interstellar or the martian and also enjoy a good film."
"jedmonds-691-762586","4","3","10","16 October 2013"," Great potential ruined by poor script
","Walking into Gravity last night, I was expecting a deep, scientific, philosophical masterpiece of a film. That's what all the critics were saying. To say I was disappointed is a grave understatement. This movie had the potential to be great, but the script in particular ruined it.<br/><br/>The first thing that stands out to me is the lack of characterization. Apart from the short conversation about Ryan's family in the beginning, we are given no insight about the characters lives on earth. Did Matt have a family? Did Ryan have any close friends? We'll never know. The lack of characterization made me neutral about the characters, and that neutral quickly turned to negative for Ryan after five minutes of her panting and wheezing and wasting her oxygen like a goofball. Matt, however, wasn't so bad. I stayed neutral with him. George Clooney gave a solid performance for him.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothers me about this movie is the number of scientific inaccuracies. I can understand if you get five or six subtle, small scientific facts wrong, but in this movie, they got a few major scientific facts wrong. For example, satellites don't orbit at the same altitude; so therefore, one satellite exploding wouldn't cause a chain reaction. Another example is the fact that you wouldn't see satellite debris flying at hypersonic speeds coming right at you.<br/><br/>This film also has a lack of realism. When Ryan is adrift in space, and only has about six percent left in her oxygen tank, why is she panicking and breathing so rapidly? Surely she would've been taught ways to calm herself and slow down her breathing. *SPOILER When Matt is right on deaths door, he makes witty remarks. Nobody on this planet would be so laid back and calm staring right into the face of that horrible death. *SPOILER OVER. Also, when Matt was goofing off and wasting his engine flying around while Ryan fixed the satellite, you know NASA wouldn't tolerate such an obscenity. And the fact that Ryan's in space after only six months of training. Those are just a couple examples but there are much, much more.<br/><br/>The main thing that takes away from this movie is the incredibly thin and clich√© script. The characters literally spoon feed you the theme of this film: ""Don't give up, keep pushing"" through their dialogue. The scenes in this movie are incredibly simple, they try to go from point a too point b without going into any extra detail about the characters, the events, etc. For example, why did Russia launch that missile? It's almost as if a high school student woke up one day and said ""Let's haphazardly write a space movie!"" <br/><br/>To give credit where credit is due, the special effects and CGI were breathtaking. It's a shame it was wasted on such a mediocre movie. Unfortunately, special effects cannot carry a film, and you get used to it after about 10 minutes of staring at earth in the background.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is pretty mediocre. Poor script, annoying characters, a lack of realism, and scientific inaccuracies. The only good thing about this film was the special effects and CGI. It had so much potential that was unfortunately butchered by a simple, thin script. 4/10"

","With all the scientific care and detail that Kubrick brought to 2001, Gravity is a cinematic triumph of believable events that could happen. It is a serious warning to NASA and the governments of other countries that space is a horrifically dangerous environment that should not be trifled with. The domino cascade of mishaps and accidents frames the stellar performance of Sandra Bullock and provides her a vehicle for Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and the team of Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron, noms for Best Picture, Director and Writing. George Clooney provides comic relief at the beginning of the film, but it is Bullock that conquers and triumphs in this one. This movie MUST be seen in 3D. The zero G effects are outstanding and startling. Gravity may be too intense for children under 13, and for those with faint hearts, or breathing problems. I know I'll never get to space, but this film is a more-than-adequate substitute for the real thing. I'm still out of breath."
"iamzorg","10","3","10","4 October 2013"," Top 10 of the Decade
","I awaited this for quite some time when I reviewed its budget and resource leverage (heavy funding on two actors, cinematography, and footage rights from NASA). Disregarding from my pre-analysis and onto the movie; it was one of the top 10 best of the decade (fact). The film utilized reasonable advertising and frankly, I thought it would be hit or miss when seeing the trailers; don't believe what I said about miss, it was dead-on-target gold. My reviews rarely go into detail of the movie, for the sake of urging you to just go see it since everyone has their own interpretation, but it's obvious this film's strengths excel on every wavelength of the spectrum. My opinion of its only weaknesses are: slightly sub-par self-dialogue for such a huge breakthrough flick, intense spiraling sequences for those who view it in theater and get easily queasy, and the obvious twists that unfold (like that feeling at the end of Inception to put it into simple terms). These weaknesses in no way detract the viewer's interpretation and I guarantee you will love it. Lastly, I recommend you see in 3D (not something I would EVER say as I hate the idea), but it puts the scenes into perspective (such as the character being inside of the pod and focusing the shot to the outside of the window); spend the few extra bucks and do IMAX as well for superior sound. This is not a movie to be deteriorated by viewing on your mobile device for sake of saving money; this is the ""James Cameron"" film of today, if you don't see it, you're missing out."

In the end, the scene that Sandra Bullock got out of the water, I mean how come she could get on land in that way from an ocean?? I was expecting there would be someone who came to rescue.

","Gravity is a visual masterpiece. Oh well! You might have heard this compliment for this movie so many times that you would be giving a big yawn at this very moment. But then you have to understand that not mentioning the visual marvel that the movie is would be a gross injustice to the painstaking works of four and a half years the movie took to be made. Gravity is a story of two astronauts tethered to each other, adrift in the vastness of space. Now to begin it, it may seem that there is not much of a story to build upon or much of a character to create. And given its adherence to reality and science, you would think what would be there to interest you for the ninety minutes of its running time. Well, there are the great visuals. The opening shot contains some of the finest view of earth from the space. The imagery it creates of the space is beautiful as well as haunting at the same time. The movements of the characters and objects in the gravity and zero gravity are captured beautifully and the way beautiful set pieces explode in the space is just breathtaking. But saying that the movie relies heavily on the visual gimmick would be a huge mistake. The story has a flow and way of building up tension by creating hurdles after hurdles in the way of survival of the astronauts. Being rooted so much to its documentary style survival drama, it surprised me how much tension it created from the nothingness of space. Visual. Flawless. Check. Tension. Exists. Glitches here and there. Will come to that later. Check. Now characters. There is only one character that matters. In fact, Alfonso Cuaron says that everything in the movie is a metaphor for that character, the character played by Sandra Bullock, Dr. Ryan Stone. Concerning the initial character arc, the first half seems to be bit disappointing. It establishes well, the coolness of the head and limitless courage needed to survive in the harshness of the space as well as the humour and banter needed to keep the aloofness or the isolation in the limitless space away. But what it seems to fail to establish is the character. The conversation seems to run into the mundane with the words like ""learn to let it go"". So many times I have heard that stuff that every time my ""boring bell' goes off after I hear them. It instills into you the sad realisation that the director is trying desperately to infuse some humanist core to the story. And then coming to the second apparent drawback in the first half. The tension. As said earlier it exists, but it fails to garner my investment into it. The big set pieces exploding. The characters drifting. I am on my seat's edge. But my emotional investments are lacking. It is like hell with them. I would care less if they die. But it is in the second half the movie clears all your apprehensions, all your complains, all your doubts and it shines. Everything fits. The tension escalates. The stakes rise. You discover that the journey of the character's self discovery or transformation commandeered the mood of the movie. And once the transformation hits home, you sit there breathing and holding and breathing with the character on the edge of your seat rooting with all might that the gravity take her home. The first half compliments the second half in a way that will leave you all satisfied. It is not a great character work , but it is praiseworthy and admirable for its perfect juxtaposition of humanist drama with the space survival story of a soul in all its isolation. Gravity is a wonder child of Alfonso Cuaron and the only way you can justify his four and half years of his work is by viewing on the biggest screen with 3D glasses. Gravity is a science fiction with awe and wonder for the infinity of space captured impeccably on the celluloid , but at its heart, it is an existential brooding with an ache for home and appreciation for life."

I probably left some out.<br/><br/>Quite simply, this is the best film since Avatar. Like Avatar, it combines excellent acting with a great story and amazing special effects.<br/><br/>The result is an experience that is moving on a visceral level and also inspiring.<br/><br/>I saw Gravity on IMAX in 3D, but I think it would be great with any system.

","The movie rides on it's truly spectacular visuals and space perspectives of Earth, and what it's like to work in near orbit. It has great production values: the music score, cinematography, and overall direction are excellent. And Clooney's performance never disappoints.<br/><br/>The script, however, turns out to be shockingly bad. So much so that I had to skip over scenes that were just too annoying to bear. Inaccurate physics, convenient to weak script writing, was the first thing to lose the plot and me as a viewer. All the more illogical and peculiar since this is a movie founded in the marvels of science.<br/><br/>But the disappointment didn't stop there. Bullock portrays a caricaturish, 80s style hysterical woman, who is so out of her mind that she's forgotten how to operate her own body, never mind a space capsule; and too often delivers corny, sentimental, self indulgent, overly long monologues that can't possibly appeal to any emotional adult. Or, at the very least, I can't see it appealing to a viewer looking to be entertained, not observe an emotional basket case navigate outer space.<br/><br/>Then there are the unrealistic plot points. Like every time she makes it to the next vehicle, so does the debris, even though the 90 min orbit time hasn't elapsed, etc.<br/><br/>The often ludicrous and hysterical script continues when she finally makes it back to Earth. There, she almost drowns in the capsule, but escapes, then can't ascend because of her suit, then almost gets tangled in kelp...<br/><br/>The final blow, just as the movie reaches its end with just 5% credibility remaining, she reaches the shore, but she can't stand up as if she's been lying on her back in zero gravity for months on end. And just her ability to stand again is supposed to be the grand finale of the film's message and raison d'√™tre.<br/><br/>This film earned multiple awards, and its hard to say why. And it's a real pity, as it seems such a simple remedy: write a better script. It let the rest of the production down. The movie could have been fantastic."

","Gravity is a perfect example for huge budget films and gadgets, delivered by lack of talent. First of all, this movie brings nothing new or impressive. I would like to say that the visuals were amazing and ground breaking as the film premise, but unfortunately there is nothing really new here. The scenery was indeed beautiful, but so was Space Odyssey which was made about 50 years ago. The experience of staying alone in space was nothing near the claustrophobic tension of Alien.<br/><br/>Then, there's the script, or should I say the lack of... The dialogues were flat and full of clich√©s, and the sound was a cluster of mumbles of rubbish between the astronauts and their radio. It is very obvious that the film makers relied mostly on visuals with this one. Unfortunately the camera work was not brilliant at all, apart for some parts which were not bad, but it was mostly nauseating. They even tried to do the ""fetus"" shot with Bullock floating in fetus position, but that was too forced to be creative. That was done just before Sigourney...sorry, Bullock, started removing her clothes and started floating around in her underwear, because the film was not clich√©d enough until then.<br/><br/>And the highlight - the cast. A huge budget film with a high caliber actors, and what do we get? Clooney's acting was stale and uninspiring. It seems as though his mind was in what's for dinner later, rather than his struggles in space. Bullock was just as much of a catastrophe. It is hard to separate the bad acting from the bad script, but watching her floating around in space without any supporting cast, was painful.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is like slow torture. It's only saving points were decent soundtrack, occasional moments of thrill, and the hope that it will all be over in an hour."

","If you find excitement about seeing Sandra Bullock rolling around in space panting for two hours, this is the movie for you! The main point of this movie was simply to show off how good CGI is nowadays. The CGI was in fact amazing to look at, which is why I gave it a 4. But it is a truly lacking movie besides that. There's not really much plot and the characters are the generic carbon-copy helpless female and George Clooney (yes George Clooney is his own category). That scene where she barks like a dog on the phone.....though touching to most, I found very embarrassing. I got what was happening in the scene....but...just no. I watched this back when it came out....and that one time had left a strong impression on me. This is one of the most overrated films on IMDb. ""The Exorcist"" has an 8 just like ""Gravity"". Now let me clarify this. In ""The Exorcist"" those two hours are filled with such classic scenes including (but not limited to) a girl peeing on the carpet, spider-walking down stairs, puking in a priest's face, ""why you do this to me Demi?"", and a priest getting hurled out a window and down the alley stairs. All ""Gravity"" has to offer in its two hours is (like I said before) Bullock rolling around and crying in space and hallucinations of George Clooney. What a waste of celluloid!"

","I watched this movie with a great deal of expectation because there was so much hype about this movie (not to mention the multiple Oscars it received this year). What I did not know was that I would have to endure the most excruciating 2-hours of my life. This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever watched in my entire life, right there with Swamp Thing or Mega Shark (SciFi channel original movie).<br/><br/>As many reviewers pointed out, there is almost no story in this movie. The special effects are nothing to write home about, and the physics and science in the movie are seriously flawed in most parts (I have an engineering degree, so I know one or two things about the law of physics). It is also filled with so many clich√© that it was really difficult to take this movie seriously.<br/><br/>Further, the acting was so horrible that it was embarrassing to watch it with both eyes open. Sandra Block was usual herself--as annoying as ever. She continuously blurted out incoherent words. It seems that her acting skill has never improved since Speed.<br/><br/>Also, it is extremely annoying to see the constant efforts of Hollywood to flatter Chinese (Did you watch ""2012""?). In the end, it was the Chinese product that brought Sandra Block safely back to the earth. I understand that Hollywood needs to sell movies to China (after all, it accounts for more than 1/4 of the world population), but please stop flattering them. It is getting really annoying.<br/><br/>I admit that I could encounter with a bad movie from time to time. Not all the movies can be like Shawshank Redemption or The Lord of Rings. I picked a wrong movie and wasted 2 hours of my life. It was my wrong-doing. However, what I cannot understand is the glaring reviews that this movie received by the critics and movie-goers alike. I do not rule out the possibility that I may be a stupid one, but it is a complete mystery for me how this could be considered to be a good movie. Is this a bad case of ""group think"" in which everyone is afraid of saying the truth? Let me tell you something: ""The king is naked"" and ""this movie is really, really bad."""

To be completely honest the ISS kinda saves the day here, its performance as a damaged version of itself easily being the best piece of acting of the movie.

","As the title says, the movie is a HUGE disappointment. The plot is dull and not well thought out. The characters are two dimensional, even though only 3 of them appear in the whole movie, so we can't say the movie is character-based. Ruling that out the movie must be plot-based, which is hard to say considering you could cut out the movie to around 20 minutes of actually plot. The only upside to the movie was the incredible cgi, but is that really enough? Might as well call it an animated movie...

I think it's the perfect example of how nefarious the awards system can be, and don't appreciate the avalanche of critical acclaim it's received.<br/><br/>Especially when there are tons of better movies from this past year deserving the praise.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron did not deserve best director for this picture, and it's to the Hollywood Foreign Press's great discredit that he was awarded the Golden Globe for such a mediocre product.<br/><br/>I haven't received a legitimate argument for why he won the award, so I'm assuming it has much to do with his ethnicity. Every article I've read on the subject, seems to suggest he won Best Director for 'good reason,' but then never goes on to cite why.<br/><br/>Because (much like an auteur) he personally wrote, directed and edited his own screenplay? It's written poorly, and Steve McQueen accomplishes a similar feat with 12 Years a Slave.<br/><br/>I don't enjoy badmouthing movies. Cuaron worked hard to put this together, and seems like a nice man.<br/><br/>But I have no issue with Cuaron, and appreciate his efforts. I take umbrage with the hype and accolades Gravity has received since its release.<br/><br/>Okay. I'll talk about the movie for a moment before complaining some more.<br/><br/>I forget where I heard this, but somebody put it perfectly when they said Gravity felt like ""it began in act two, and ended halfway through act three."" So if you're looking for a well- constructed, polished and original narrative, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>If you live under a rock, you mightn't know it's 'visually stunning.'<br/><br/>There are three or four solid moments, where the tension's high, and the plot stays on a compelling track.<br/><br/>The 3-D is sharp. I honestly have no idea if it's the sharpest I've ever seen, but I don't ""feel like I'm in space.""<br/><br/>That's bullshit, and I'm sick of hearing people say that.<br/><br/>(Okay, here we go again, beware the spoilers below.)<br/><br/>The four good scenes are thus: 1) the fire extinguisher 2) Sandra flipping end over end 3) Clooney being detached and 4) Clooney's ghost showing up.<br/><br/>Now. I would rather not lose Georgie boy so quickly. I care zero percent about Sandra's plight, because I have no investment in her character or conflict. I have no context in which to place this individual, so I'm just supposed to care about her because she's an astronaut in trouble? That's a lot to ask from your audience, and it doesn't make for compelling storytelling.<br/><br/>When Sandra's finally in a somewhat safe location, I realize I've nothing tethering me to her character.<br/><br/>Okay, so she's safe ‚Äì what does that mean to me in the grand context of the film? Well, she's halfway to making Clooney's self-sacrifice worthwhile.<br/><br/>But all for what? It's unclear why she's out there in the first place! What do I care if she gets home?<br/><br/>What's consequential about her getting home? She survives dull circumstances with nothing at stake. There's no grand scheme here.<br/><br/>This is what I'm trying to get at, my proverbial audience ‚Äì this is shallow writing.<br/><br/>For example, if we'd seen Sandy make a costly mistake early on (during the absent Act I, perhaps) we might care about her character overcoming this lack of confidence; these feelings of apprehension and indecision.<br/><br/>Gravity is an excuse to do visual 3D tricks in space, and while that may appeal to some, I much prefer the story come first.<br/><br/>I wish ghost Clooney was really alive, and hitchhiked on the tail of a passing comet. That's the kind of outer space visual I'm looking for. Now that we're out here, might as well venture a little further from the Earth's atmosphere, right?<br/><br/>I'm kidding, but seriously.<br/><br/>I heard someone on NPR (I believe) mention how Cuaron's ability to bring together diverse groups to make this film is to his great credit as a director.<br/><br/>First of all, it's a movie about two beautiful white people, and that's it. As noted above, the entire conflict of the movie hinges on your unquestionable compassion for Sandra's character.<br/><br/>Secondly, how the hell does this have any bearing on the resulting film that's produced?<br/><br/>There is zero correlation between a production team's level of diversity, and the quality of the motion picture.<br/><br/>I find this mildly revolting. Movies' should not be awarded points for this sort of reason.<br/><br/>Gravity's mediocre at best, and not worth revisiting for my tastes.<br/><br/>Sorry, Fonso, I bet you're a good dude, but I don't love your film."

In space, if something has to pass by something else at a distance of a few metres or hit it by luck, then it isn't going to happen even once.

If you enjoy watching things fly around and Sandra Bullock grunt and gasp for an hour and a half, by all means watch it. Dialogue, what little there is, is insipid. Plot is preposterous. I can only imagine NASA workers laughing and rolling their eyes. Anyone seriously interested in the craft of filmmaking, take my advice: Don't waste 90 minutes of your life. You can't say you weren't warned."

","For non-science orientated people, I get how the cinematography is impressive and strikes you as a very good movie. Perhaps even the character building (of which there is little) bits appeal to you. However it is a totally implausible movie that made me turn it off after 30 minutes. <br/><br/>Star Trek and Star Wars and other sci-fi movies put their solidly in the realm of fiction by being futuristic thus having other tech's available which allows otherwise impossible things to happen and be believable to the watcher. This movie is set near-present day, and so it has to be believable in the realm of what is available scientifically today.<br/><br/>**** Spoilers from this point onwards ******<br/><br/>Immediately, several questions are asked in terms of movie validity...How is a totally unprepared mission specialist allowed up to service the HSP? Why does she proceed to continue working after the alarm is sounded? - that is just stupid and unrealistic (if you were clever enough to be a mission specialist, you should realise it's pretty dumb to ignore an alarm in space). Why does she continue to breathe ridiculously hard when she's told to breathe slowly to conserve oxygen? Why would you say ""you're fine"" when asked for your status, when clearly this is the accepted protocol for giving your readings...surely this would have been covered in training? Why does she fail to grab onto anything at all of the space station (even moving through tangled parachutes she fails to grab anything) it's just luck of the roll that her foot gets trapped? Why are the Soviets blowing up satellites with missiles? How does this cause a ""chain reaction"" that destroys all other satellites?? - surely what the Soviets would do is drop the satellite into low Earth orbit, blow it up, and let the debris burn up in the atmosphere. These seem like ""set-ups"" for the story to continue, not plausible actualities. Please, if anyone can answer these questions, I'd love to read your response.<br/><br/>*** End spoilers ******<br/><br/>I have to say Titanic 2 was a better movie than this pile of trash - I watched Titanic 2, expecting it to be terrible, and actually was quite good in places. For a high budget movie like this, I expected so much more and was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't waste time hoping that it's a good movie."

","Honestly, I don't understand all the perfect reviews praising the movie. If what I saw had a story, then it was a very bad one.<br/><br/>1) If you are going to make a movie with a setting in the space, shouldn't you at least follow the laws of physics (Newton's laws of motion?) I understand that it is fictional, however, in order to make it believable, shouldn't it convince the audience, me, that the characters were struggling in the space? There were so many errors and I don't even think the whole movie can happen.<br/><br/>2) I didn't find it visually stunning and I guess it was my fault to watch it in 2D. When did movies require 3D to be enjoyable? A good story makes a good movie and CGI is merely an accessory to story telling.<br/><br/>What did I learn from the movie?

"carlosmorenong","10","2","6","3 February 2014"," A Terrifying, Outer-space Experience.
","Gravity will take you on the closest outer-space venture you will ever to experience. (Astronaut Viewers not included)<br/><br/>I want to start off by stating: Gravity is a film made to experience the incredible horrors of outer space. It's not made to rival other films in terms of writing, character development, or storytelling. Gravity is a bottled simulation of space. And that's a good thing!<br/><br/>The suspense in Gravity is much different from one of ghosts or zombies films. The heart-racing suspense is delivered from the constant struggle of an astronaut (Bullock) trying to survive a devastating wreck. And the viewer is taken along for the ride.<br/><br/>I strongly suggest watching the film at the theater, as the large speakers accommodate the sound design, soundtrack, silent frequencies, and not to mention a large screen that pulls you right into perspective! <br/><br/>The dialogue may seem poor, but I believe there to be a contrast of a Smooth-Talking Cloney, and the breathless peril of Bullock. The film is only focused on a single task, surviving. While many other films used various locations with rich set designs and architecture, Gravity keeps the viewer confined to the point of claustrophobia in small spaceships and the darkness of space. A suspenseful location which is sure to cause anxiety, peril, and anguish that is sure to bet the fast-running zombie. <br/><br/>Many people will argue the film is just an hour and a half Special Effects, and in this present day, Special Effects seem to be a burden for any ""REAL"" talent in film-making and storytelling. Sorry, you crazed SFX ranters, the film could have not been filmed in space. But to those who do enjoy the hard works of SFX Artists, you are in for a Beautiful Sight of Planet earth, and the terrifying vacuum of space.<br/><br/>Gravity is a film you must experience, for its haunting tale of survival, leaves us to understand how small, weak, and defenseless we really are against the universe."
"ramkoil","1","2","6","27 January 2014"," Horrible Acting and Directing a shamble
","I reluctantly watched this movie after reading all the great reviews in IMDb. Suffice it to say that I did not have high expectations of this movie. The movie starts with fantastic camera works and imagery, and eventually centers on main actors. As usual trying to convince the audience why they have selected the Sandra Bulluk character to do this work (I watched the movie last night and I can't remember her Character name ) A person with no space experience who crashed every simulator training and who has to read the manual of the scape pod in emergency. Wouldn't it be more reasonable to just make her an experienced operator? The credibility of the movie is greatly diminished by this. It makes this yet another Hollywood nonsense of a story. Hay Audience please deposit brain in box before entering cinema!! <br/><br/>The movie is riddled with inconsistency and stupid unbelievable illogical decisions and plot holes. Not worthy to be called a science fiction.<br/><br/>Next a movie such as this which centers only on one actor requires a good actor. Sandra Bolluck may be good in Speed or Miss Congeniality, but she cannot act one bit in a serious movie or science fiction. This movie was cringe worthy throughout. I have never waited so impatiently for a movie to end. This was not OK or bearable; this was bad with capital B. <br/><br/>The scene with the AM radio and Chinese fellow on the other side unnecessary. The assumption that command center was out of reach, again unbelievable. The acting so bad you could not connect with characters at all. In this movie the character has to put in word how they are feeling,(that is what she does) because you cannot get it from their acting. They tried hard to make this movie similar to Space Odecy, but a miserable failure. These days we don't have the acting, or directing talent to pull anything of that caliber off. My advice don't waste your precious hours on this so called movie. Just for the record George Cloony could be cut and pasted in any movie, the guy cannot act. Let us give him benefit of the doubt, here. The guy didn't even bother, he was so detached, from the movie atmosphere he may have as well been acting in a comedy. What a shamble! The following scene are copies: - The howling scene, from Mel Brooks space balls, Only Space Balls was a good comedy, this was not. - The undressing scene ‚ÄìBarberrella , only Jane Fonda could act, and you connected with her. - The fetus scene from space odyssey, only these two movies should not be mentioned in same sentence."

However the minute anyone calls this new or revolutionary, is about the time anyone who doesn't plaster all their expectations and enjoyment solely on visuals should stop listening. <br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of sci-fi and space, I wanted to enjoy this movie, though I questioned the over-hyped cast and shameless showcasing of CGI I went into it with an open mind. But it wasn't long until I discovered a lot of what I originally expected, something I like to call ""Avatar- syndrome"". Referring to a film that distracts people with lovely effects and visuals, which cover-up a pi**-poor story full of clich√©s laden with cheesiness. Take away the great effects and everyone would notice what this movie is; bad. Just bad. Predictable, characters lacking anything unique whatsoever- Sandra Bullock is the rookie that messes up to unbelievable lengths, which adds another element to the movie, just how unrealistic it is that a person as incompetent as that would get anywhere near the space program. And of course George Clooney playing the same character he is cast as 90% of the time: a care-free hot-shot lady's-man who always knows what hes doing. <br/><br/>Its unimaginative and is just a survival-disaster movie. Also moving on to how this movie is supposedly ""revolutionary"". Am I missing something? We've known how to showcase space in movies since the 60s. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" Ever heard of that? Or how bout ""Alien""? Do I have to bring in ""Star Wars""? I understand this is different technology that we're talking about, but really?

","I am going to start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and then proceed by defending why exactly that is and why I disagree with some of the movies criticisms.<br/><br/>the big thing I hear is that this movie is not completely realistic, and that this can break the immersion of the film.<br/><br/>I agree with this for the most part, but the parts that were unrealistic didn't break the immersion(at least for me), they helped the story, and it was in fact some parts that ARE realistic that people have problems with, such as...<br/><br/>*Major Spoilers below*<br/><br/>1.the rope scene- while many say that this was a not accurate, I (and many as well) say that it is. the thing is that the astronauts are NOT at a standstill at this point, while many are assuming that they are. if you look off to the side of the screen during the scene you will notice that the parachute is still being dragged, and that the pair is still decelerating (relative to the space station of course). while you might not have WEIGHT in zero G, you still have mass and inertia, making thing move differently in space. once your start moving in one direction, you don't stop, now the rope was slowing them down, but it wasn't doing it fast enough, it was getting untangled and very probably both of them would've been lost. when clooney let go, he lowered the amount of time and energy needed to come to a stop by more than half- giving Sandra the chance to stop pull herself back in.<br/><br/>also some people are saying that the in space the sun is actually white and not yellow like in the film because it is our atmosphere that gives the sun its color. this argument actually tells how hard the filmmakers worked to make the film as true as it is, because the sun IS white- the part where it is not is during the sunrises, in other words, where the light travels through the atmosphere. you can actually see the color fade as the sun rises far past the earths horizon.<br/><br/>as far as the story goes, it got better as the film progressed. some had issues that the ""weakest"" survived, but this is the wrong way to look at it. Sandra was the character that grew the most; in the beginning she was ready to give up and die,but it was when all was lost and she was staring death in the face, that she found the will to live. the film also used metaphors to suggest that Sandra was not truly alive in the beginning, when she reached the first space station we see the womb scene, then throughout the movie she changes as a person.<br/><br/>*also clooney didn't come to visit sandra from the afterlife, her brain was oxygen deprived making hallucinations common, and clooney didn't tell her anything she didn't already know; this was just her brains way of reminding her<br/><br/>I also felt the re-entry scene was very powerful emotionally, and when Ryan landed on earth reborn, taking her fist steps as a new person, with a new look on life... well lets just say that I left the theater very satisfied indeed."
"Red-Barracuda","10","2","6","8 January 2014"," A beautiful film about the lethal indifference of outer space
","It's all too infrequently that a film like Gravity comes along. And by that I simply mean a movie that truly shows the possibilities of what a blockbuster film can be. It's very rare that such state-of-the-art special effects and A-list actors are combined together to such extraordinary effect, in a film that uses these things in ways that are surprising, intelligent and genuinely artistic. This is Hollywood movie-making of the highest calibre. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n has to be given enormous credit for overseeing such an intensely cinematic film, while underpinning it with a feeling of authenticity that elevates it to an even higher level. It's a very rare thing to have blockbuster effects used in such a way to make the audience experience something so incredible that nevertheless feels so real.<br/><br/>If you praise the film to someone who hasn't seen it and they then ask you what it's about, it's kind of difficult explaining the impact by describing the story. It doesn't sound very interesting on paper and that is because the story ultimately isn't very important. Gravity is pure cinema. Where a lot of movies would work well in a book, this is a film that could only work in cinema. I have never been much of an advocate of 3D technology; I have felt it is really just a money-making ploy by the studios. When I have enjoyed it in a movie like, for example, Dredd, it's really mainly because the film itself is very good in the first place. With Gravity, it's the first time that it's actually felt necessary. This is a film that really has to be seen in a theatre, preferably on an IMAX screen, such is its immersive power. Visually, it is a tour de force. The incredible, opening shot is an extended unbroken single take that simply takes the breath away. Obviously this was achieved by studio trickery but it is never less than believable and goes on for what must be fifteen minutes, in which time we revolve around the space shuttle, hover over the Earth, go up close and personal with the astronauts, experience the violence of an outer space disaster and then even move into the helmet of an astronaut for a personal point-of-view. It's simply breath-taking and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has to be given huge credit for his amazing work on this film. The icing on the cake is provided by Steven Price, whose astonishingly effective score plays up the tension extremely effectively. It's what could best be described as loud, minimalist music that really feels correct for what it actually is - music in a void. It contrasts superbly with the use of silence, which the film often is; which of course is another subtle way in which it differs from most blockbusters.<br/><br/>I think one of the things that makes Gravity such an overwhelming experience is that it is so visceral visually but so intimate in other ways. The huge scale of events is mixed with the deeply personal emotional and physical experiences of the central character played by Sandra Bullock. Despite the presence of George Clooney, this is pretty close to being a one woman show. Bullock is very good and convinces consistently in what must have been a pretty demanding role to pull off so believably. She brings the human aspect to proceedings, making us empathise and feel the full impact of the situation. Gravity has to be the most realistic portrayal yet of what the difficulties of life in space actually are. But it achieves this objective in such an overwhelmingly beautiful way. Ambitious pure science fiction such as this is not often given such big budget treatment. In this sense it resembles the granddaddy of them all, 2001: A Space Odyssey, but without the mysterious ambiguity. But with the beauty intact."

Space never felt so enthralling yet so isolated, and by the time it was over those 90 minutes felt more like a heartbeat.<br/><br/>I can't give any of the plot away because any giving of information other than the visuals of the movie would give away this compendious plot, that being said, it still works wonderfully with the CGI this whole movie essentially enshrouds itself in.<br/><br/>Well, if you haven't seen gravity yet, what are you waiting for?

","First of all, I loved this movie. I am a science fiction fan and love movies about space. This movie was so wonderful for the visuals alone. But when everything went to hell and debris started hitting the space shuttle, George Clooney did not panic or anything. He just kept doing his space walk and was super calm. Even in the scene where George Clooney cut his line so Sandra could live, he was very calm. I would have been screaming!!! Also, when that one astronaut had a piece of debris crash through his helmet, his face froze instantly and a rock crashed through his face? I know how it is in space, and it is NOT that way. Also, fire in space? You can't have fire in space. No way. And Sandra's hair never lifted and her tears were not frozen. When George Clooney knocked on the window and opened the hatch with Sandra completely exposed in her pajamas, she did not suffocate or freeze/burn. And is it me? Or was the Chinese space station just a little bit too similar to the ISS? Hmmmm. Jake won't see this but he should be aware that it has a beginning, middle and and end. I enjoyed this more than the Tom Cruise IMAX movie titled SPACE. What about when she used a FIRE HYDRANT to thrust herself to another space station? That seemed very unlikely since fire extinguishers can't work in space. But heck, people seem to love Star Wars and all of that stuff happens that is literally IMPOSSIBLE. Such as a green dwarf lifting a space ship out of a swamp? I mean COME ON!! So, if you can look past that kind of stuff, you will LOVE Gravity as I did. I noticed that there were some Obama suggestions in this movie. That did not bother me though. Oh, I forgot! What about going to the bathroom? They never showed that!"
"haosstoposto","9","2","6","7 October 2013"," Suspense from the beginning until the end
","I will not elaborate much about this movie because it is not really about the story, it is about atmosphere. The plot is simple enough, we have two astronauts stranded in space without communication with NASA or anybody else. Sandra Bulock plays a newcomer in space, subdued and probably depressed mission specialist who survives space catastrophe. With her is veteran astronaut played by George Clooney who saves her on more than one occasion and gives her moral support. The casting is right and possibly Bullocks greatest achievement on the big screen, after row of forgettable comedy movies. The photography of the movie is superb and 3D effects really contribute to the suspense. I will try to avoid spoilers because in the movies about a catastrophes there is only one question ‚Äì will our hero survive or not? There are of course some scientific inaccuracies but for the sake of dramatisation, it is OK. All in all a movie which can be easily recommended but watch it in 3D."

","I went to see this movie expecting a masterpiece-considering the reviews on IMDb. What I found was a good, but not great, movie experience. The good things about this movie are the spectacular scenes from the Earth as well as all the techniques used to make it (names of which I don't even know!). But I think it lacks a strong story and character development. You get almost no background information on the characters, and all that happens in the movie is bumping into stuff and surviving them! I didn't even get enough action and excitement. I also think some of Sandra Bullock's lines did not exactly make sense! I mean who would take the time and energy to talk like that in a life and death situation?!"
"TheConnoisseurReviews","8","2","6","6 October 2013"," ""Gravity"" Review
","""Gravity"" is a directors film though and through. Alfonso Cuaron does a magnificent job of creating the feeling of being in space. When I was watching this movie, I really felt like I was drifting through space much like the characters as they tumbled and twirled around in the vast emptiness of the unknown. There's a lot of quiet and somber moments in this film, mostly with the characters floating around and just talking about their life. However, it's always absorbing. As you're drawn into the experience, you feel as if you are there with the characters witnessing everything first hand. The cinematography is quit brilliant and is a major factor in giving the sense of being in space. The camera masterfully spins and turns weightlessly in a way that it would in space without giving a dizzying feeling. My breath was also taken away a few times from the sheer beauty of some of the shots and how they were composed.<br/><br/>The script on the other hand is quit good as well. The story of letting go and moving on is handled well with a lot of attention to visual story telling. It gives us a real sense of the terrors and loneliness of space, a place were our screams can't be heard. The themes of letting go are handled very well as we see the characters learn and grow. My gripe with the script would have to do with the dialogue. Some of the things the characters say either take me out of the film at times or make me feel like its unnecessary. The dialogue also sometimes felt like a crutch as it sometimes stated the obvious.<br/><br/>The cast is incredibly small, but it is no short of big names. George Clooney as Matt Kowalski gives a solid performance. Kowalski is a typical quick talking charmer that Clooney is so accustomed to playing, but the character does provide some of the lighter moments in the film. The real standout is Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone. Ryan has a hard time letting go of the past as she had a terrible tragedy befall her. Bullock plays the character well with little quirks of uncertainty and gives us a very likable character that we can all cheer for.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is stunning and a treat for the eyes. From one jaw-dropping shot composition to the next, I was almost always in awe of what I was seeing. Space looked incredibly real and Cuaron and crew made everything look so seamless. The score isn't bad either. It's usually quiet, but when something goes down, it really aids in the terror and urgency of the situation. Not only that, but it can also be powerfully moving and uplift as well.<br/><br/>Overall, from a technical stand point, ""Gravity"" is a masterpiece. I was almost always in awe of what I was seeing and a lot of the credit goes to Alfonso Cuaron. He really gave us an experience that heightened our senses. From masterful cinematography to stunning visual effects, it is a treat for the eyes. Wonderful and unique shots are spread throughout this film and I really fell like I've never seen anything like this before. The only complain I have for this film is the dialogue. While interesting, I felt it didn't fit well all the time with what we were watching. This movie was at its best when it was quiet. I give it an incredibly high 4/5, an experience."
"Taylor_Gillen","7","2","6","5 October 2013"," Innovative Thriller A Must-see
","Alfonso Cuaron does it yet again! After ""Children of Men"", I had high expectations for this film. I was worried that the trailer would fully summarize the film, but there is a lot to experience by watching the entire film. I would certainly classify this as a thriller, because space is a scary place. With good use of sound (or lack thereof), camera angles, and cinematography, this movie deserves a solid 7/10. Though the movie is intended to make the audience feel alone and isolated, I still wish that the cast was larger (or at least more developed). Other than that, I saw no issues with this movie. I keep thinking of ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" If Alien had not used this tag line first, I think it would have been fitting for this one."
"westerfieldalfred","7","2","6","5 October 2013"," Underwhelmed
","When I was 12 I saw the first 3-D movie, Bwana Devil. When I was 26 I sat front row center to see 2001 in Cinerama. From the first reviews of Gravity I was hoping for another quantum leap in viewing experience. I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong - I thought the CGI was perfect, the 3-D wonderful and the acting excellent. However, in between 2001 and Gravity I've experienced 3-D on a my home theater screen, including several IMAX NASA films. As a result, to me Gravity felt more like a documentary. I couldn't really get involved with the characters. It didn't help that the director often mistook mass for weight. In space you're weightless but still retain your mass. No one could maintain a grip under some of the situations shown. And the debris field was much too selective. Even a piece the size of a penny would destroy anything in its path. Multiple collisions such as described would produce a cloud of particles that would be impossible to escape. As a result of these mistakes much of the tension was lost on me. My disappointment is that a really good film could have been a great one."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","6","5 October 2013"," Magnificent
","So the hype for Gravity is at an insane high right now. It's gotten some of the best reviews in years, and that hype has crossed over to the mainstream audience as well as hardcore film buffs. I don't think this is a perfect film, and it's not entirely original, but man does it work. The cinematography is outstanding, as are the sound and visual effects. The two leads are also pretty strong, Bullock in particular giving a performance I'm sure most people weren't aware she could give. This is a truly movie-star performance, one that will be associated with Bullock as a pea for the rest of her career. This is strongly recommended, definitely to be seen on the big screen."
"YJLcool","8","2","6","4 October 2013"," A sci-fi visual spectacle that shouldn't be missed
","Gravity is truly a visually stunning sci-fi thriller about two people (a medical engineer and an astronaut) trying to survive after an unexpected accident leaves them adrift in space. The story is simple, straightforward and predictable, the entire film happens in space and there's only 2 actors you'll be seeing throughout the film.<br/><br/>However, the visual aspects of the film are aesthetically breathtaking and realistic at the same time. The visuals showing Earth or even aurora borealis is truly mesmerizing. It successfully captures the terrifying dangers a person might experience while in space to the audience. In space, it's downright scary when all communication systems down, no oxygen, no gravity, with extreme cold temperatures, no sound where no one can hear you scream, no one can help you and you're all alone. Moreover, Clooney managed to provide enough charm and Bullock's character has a likable personality for the audience to continue watching the film and hope that they manage to survive their ordeal.<br/><br/>The film also provides us some of the character's visual perspectives - out-of-body floating and spinning experience, explosions due to objects flying and colliding with each other in space without sound...I believe this is as close as you can get to have a decent space experience in the cinema.As Bullock's character said in the film, it's truly one hell of a ride.Recommended to watch it in 3D. (although 2D is still acceptable if you're in a tight budget) http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/10/movie-review-gravity.html Rating: 8.5/10"

","This is a great film for teenage boys because it really gets to grips with what it is like to be in space. And as Sandra Bullock has to carry most of the film, it may suit teenage girls too. But many reviewers on this site seem to have forgotten the simple physics they learned at school. Yes, objects are weightless in space. But objects still have mass. And mass times velocity is momentum. That is why Matt has to detach himself. His momentum is too high. Weightless yes, but too much momentum. Notice that whenever anyone opens an airlock, the pressure of the residual air in the airlock means it bursts open and you have to cling to the handle."

","Gravity (2013) directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, starring Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone and George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky, depicted American Astronauts stranded in space after their shuttle is destroyed. The concept is very interesting and has the potential to be a great story, but the film was lackluster in its storytelling. I waited for the story to pick up and get interesting and it never did. The film felt slow and the story never picked up; even the end felt abrupt as there was no build up to it. The story had no progression and felt very one note. There were moments that seemed very forced to try and make it exciting and interesting but they felt out of place in the movie. Although, there were aspects of the movie that were interesting such as, the first person shots, and the silence during parts of the film. The silence was powerful in that it truly reflected space. The first person shots were unique and made you see the film through the characters eyes. But these moments did not make up for the lackluster story telling. The ending was OK and worked for the story; but also fell flat of the grand moment it was set up to be. Overall the film was slow and didn't measure up to the epic story that it could have been."

","Before I watched this movie I wondered how you could make an entertaining film about two people floating around in space. In the middle I wondered the same thing. By the end I figured it's probably impossible. Yes there are some amazing aspects to this production, mainly the superb quality of the expanded space environment which presumably is exactly what it is like 600km from earth and the awesome views of earth. But this film won 7 Oscars. For what? OK 2 for best film featuring what it would be like to be in space for a while and best views of planet earth as seen from a spaceship. But the other 5? Your guess is as good as mine. I know the back story of Dr Stone was supposed to make us all desperately hope she got back to earth safely but honestly every time she frantically grasped onto a piece of space station I found myself hoping that she'd miss and drift off into oblivion so the credits would roll and I could go and do something more productive than watch an ageing film star faff around in the great abyss."

","A group of astronauts from the US space station are outside the space station, and the hostess is repairing the space station outside the US space station. Suddenly, a message came that Russian missile fragments might have flown, and then the information changed again. Russian missile fragments hit the satellite and were flying towards them at a high speed. They came, and the scraps hit the female lead Beside the pillar, the pillar broke, and the hostess held the pillar and spun quickly. Matt said to loosen the pillar, the female host tried to loosen the pillar. Just keep flying like this. Matt rescued her with help. At this time, her oxygen content was only 5%, and they returned to the US space station and found that all people were dead and floating bodies. They decided to leave here to go to the Russian space station.<br/><br/>Going to the Russian space station, Matt pulled the hostess with help and desperately flew to the Russian space station. The hostess's oxygen content is getting less and less. Matt is chatting with the hostess. Does anyone on earth miss you? Or will you see you? Anything to commemorate? The hostess said that my daughter died because of an accident. This is the most missed by the hostess. Matt has been chatting and hopes the hostess will persevere. Approaching the Russian space station, Matt accelerated and flew over. The two of them violently hit the upper end, and finally the rope was broken. The two were connected by their hands. Finally, the female host 's feet caught the rope and grabbed Matt with their hands. It was very dangerous. , But Matt said you let it go, you can definitely survive. Matt let go, still saying that I might be the person who has been flying in space for the longest time. Matt used a walkie-talkie to remind the hostess that the hatch was at the top, and the hostess went in with difficulty. Taking off all clothes, the hostess marched inside, went to the innermost, found the intercom, tried to contact Matt, but had no hope. Suddenly the space station caught fire and the hostess wanted to save the fire, but there was no hope. She entered the main cabin with a fire extinguisher and separated. She needs the main cabin to fly to China's Tiangong space station. But she was tied up by a parachute. She tried to fly a few times without using it. She went out and wanted to manually disengage. In the process of screwing, the space debris flew over again, and she hid in danger. Probably because of the disaster, the parachute broke away and she entered the main cabin.<br/><br/>The terrible thing came again. The main cabin was not motivated. She was desperate for help, but she was a human. She heard dog barking and was learning to bark. She wanted to hear more. She wanted someone to pray for her, she heard the child crying, and she wanted to die in a lullaby. Suddenly Matt came in and said, ""Do you want to live? If you want to die, simply turn off all lights."" The hostess woke up again, but Matt disappeared, just fantasy. The hostess exhausted almost all of her power, and tried to use the power of the landing system during the fast landing of the cabin. She flew towards the Tiangong, and then flew into the Tiangong with a fire extinguisher. She entered the Shenzhou cabin and ordered her to leave the Tiangong space station. Flying towards the earth, the parachute was first opened when the cabin was approaching the earth, and the power of the landing system was turned on when it was three meters above the ground and sprayed towards the water. Fall into the water. The water immersed in the spacecraft, she sank to the bottom, and she took off her space suit again and crawled out of the water."

","The only aspect of this movie that stopped me from walking out of the theater halfway through was the visual effects. Other than that, this film had almost no story or character development and an awful script. Would you like me to summarize it for you? Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are astronauts who encounter an increasingly dangerous situation when on a routine mission in space. George Clooney dies, and then about every 20 minutes something new (very predictably) goes wrong. A frantic and overly emotional Sandra Bullock (very predictably) manages to work around each problem at the last possible second until she (very predictably) makes it back to Earth. The worst of all is when she seems to have ""given up"" and a dead George Clooney appears to her in some sort of corny hallucination and instructs her on how to escape her latest peril.<br/><br/>This is movie is the epitome of what I hate about major Hollywood movies...extreme predictability riddled with fake ""suspense."" As a viewer, never did I once believe that the final outcome would be anything other than Sandra Bullock safely returning home. Without the stunning visual effects, this movie would be completely unwatchable. I will never understand how or why critics were so high on this movie, but this is just one of many terrible movies of the last decade to receive such undeserved acclaim."

And who cares about the acting, Sandra Bullock did a fine job.<br/><br/>The film tries to show you what the experience of being in space is like and how scary it can be.

The zero gravity scenes (virtually the entire film) were very believable; I guess much of it was filmed in a centrifuge environment. Some of the effects were a little dubious (such as times when Bullock/Clooney appeared to be holding onto things - or each other - and streaming out as if air was rushing past them - obviously not something that would occur in space); but these minor imperfections can be ignored for the greater visual masterpiece of the whole film. Certainly a film to be appreciated by all. And I only saw it in 2D: I guess it would be that much better in 3D..."

"LillyPip","5","1","2","6 July 2016"," Very pretty, scientifically flawed
","Gorgeous CGI. I'm not sure what planet we were looking at. They said it was Earth; I'll take their word for it. It was beautiful, whatever it was.<br/><br/>I'm no astrophysicist, but even I noticed the glaring implausibility of it all. Physics in space just doesn't work that way, you guys. The detail in the spacecraft looks amazing, though. I'm not an expert by any stretch, but I dabble. And this is a visually stunning movie.<br/><br/>On to the not-so-good.<br/><br/>The writing was mediocre at best, and cringeworthy often. Thankfully, there were long stretches of silence where one could just admire the view. The writers made Clooney into the most plastic, voice-box action figure I've seen this side of a counterfeit bargain-bin GI Joe. That was quite an accomplishment. There wasn't much to like in Bullock, either; the generic Damsel in Distress trope we all outgrew when we hit puberty.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ahead: Also, hats off to the screen writers for their continued tireless efforts to vastly underestimate audience intelligence. Bullock: ""Oxygen: 2%"" Clooney: *randomly keeps her talking, using up more oxygen* Bullock: ""My display is redlining!"" *panics* Clooney: ""You have about 5 minutes of air in your suit."" ... ""So where do you live?"" ... ""What are they doing at 8pm?"" *more talking, more oxygen*<br/><br/>At first it seemed odd that Bullock's character was unprepared for emergencies in space, but maybe it's not totally impossible that a person could hide past trauma or mental instability during the screening process and become an astronaut -- I mean, we did have a prior astronaut pursue a coworker across the US in her diapers that one time. She kept her crazypants hidden for a while, so I guess that's technically possible. And does literally every member of the crew, including researchers, need to know how to use every piece of equipment that every country has floating up there? If that's so, it's no wonder we're still sitting down here eyeballing the stars. That said, the eenie-meenie-miney-moe thing was still a bit silly.<br/><br/>Interesting how, though the debris orbited the entire planet every 90 minutes, causing massive destruction to wherever the protagonists were when it hit, there was negligible damage to the next place they would go? The ISS (until the debris hit while Bullock was there, destroying it), the Tiangong-1 (same). Seems they should have been destroyed before they arrived. There were several mistakes like this that didn't take a scientist to notice, and I understand they consulted several. This is unfortunate, because it starts to drop you out of the story quite a lot. If you actually are a scientist, I'll bet it's quite maddening.<br/><br/>Clooney's death scene, while dramatic, was stupid and would make Newton kick grass. But I don't think any of us were really sad to see him go. Later, when he showed up at the Chinese station and climbed in, I was ready to believe it because the science had been so all over the place by then, I was thinking, sure, why the hell not just throw open the hatch to space and scream and breathe and not wear a seatbelt and be fine. Whatever.<br/><br/>Far and away the most egregiously, mind-numbingly, unforgivably stupid scene in the movie for me came toward the end when Bullock was jaunting to the plummeting space station. Whoever decided to go with the fire extinguisher scene from Wall-E should be demoted to donut boy/girl until they've had time to think about what they've done. That was beyond asinine. The re-entry hatch entering bit was implausible, but the Wall-E reference just made it ridiculous.<br/><br/>Overall, I've know I've been hard on it, but I do think this movie is worth watching. If you're nerdy or a science buff, it's likely to raise your hackles a bit here and there, and if you're a physicist or work in space sciences, you might actually hate it. But it's visually beautiful despite its flaws."

","Imagine Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's mediocre acting placed into a film that has almost no storyline at all and is held together with fairly poor dialogue and you will wonder why Gravity was watched by anyone at all, never mind enjoyed by audiences and critics alike. <br/><br/>The answer is simple: cinematography. It is the amazing camera-work that holds this film together. For the most part, the film only has one character in the form of Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) but dull writing and careless acting means that the audience don't even care about her or anything that happens in the film. However, the film is truly orgasmic to look at and you don't have to know anything about cinematography or special effects to know that this film does both of those things right. <br/><br/>Despite the cinematographic porn being displayed on the screen it is difficult to see why this film was so loved because aside from this the film was essentially average."

","OK, this review is a million years late, but sometimes it takes a while to determine what went wrong. I like this movie, but: it was a bit short, and somehow, it felt like a last minute term paper. It was refreshing that it didn't follow the conventional plot arc, yet, again, something was missing. I don't think traveling back to before the mission would have been necessary, but maybe if we had known a little about the rest of the crew prior to the mishap,it would have provided more emotion of loss. Oddly, Sandra's character, Ryan, had no familial photos as the one crew member carried with him, to anchor her underlying despair. other than that, I think everyone did a great job. I liked the ominous danger music, even though it vaguely reminded me of ""Jaws""."
"callanvass","8","1","2","29 April 2015"," I have to tip my hat!
","Due to all the hype surrounding this movie, I decided to stay away from it. I like to go into a movie with my head clear and my expectations low. I dislike movies that are ""oscar bait"" Some of them try way too hard, and I end up being very disappointed. The wait ended up being longer than I expected. Every time I'd go to watch it, something would come up. Gravity is a case of style over substance. The story engrosses you until the end, but It's not gonna be remembered for the story. The tension and suspense are so high, it manages to make you forget that the story isn't anything special. There are some moments that truly startled me. It also takes advantage of an ideal setting. I'm not huge on films set in space. Some of them move way too slowly. That being said, being trapped alone in space is one of the most terrifying things imaginable. It's an easy recipe for success, making the viewer constantly uncomfortable with all the tension. Near the beginning of the movie, Ryan (Bullock) is asked what she likes most about being in space. She replies ""The silence! I could get used to it"" foreshadowing what will happen. The visual effects are as good as advertised as well. The performances are top-notch. Sandra Bullock has always been a favorite of mine, but she's really become a fantastic actress. She owns every single scene she's in. Her plight was a fascinating story to watch unfold. Despite that I had to suspend disbelief by how much bad luck she was in, it added to the suspense. She conveyed all her emotions perfectly, and she showed the right amount of vulnerability and courage. In my opinion, Clooney is highly overrated. He certainly adds presence here though. His smart-ass persona made things livelier with some timely humor. There is also a big twist about him, which I didn't see coming at all. It also made me doubt if it would end happily or not, which is rather impressive, considering it isn't easy to keep me guessing.<br/><br/>When the end credits rolled, I was mostly pleased. It's SLIGHTLY overpraised, but admittedly an impressive achievement. I was rather surprised how short this movie was. I thought it was a good decision though. This movie taught me to appreciate life, and to never give up. It's a great spectacle that everyone has to see at least once. Try and ignore they hype, you'll be better off that way.<br/><br/>8.7/10"

He has already delivered few of the memorable movies of last decade which includes Y tu mam√° tambi√©n and Children of Men. There will be mistakes in a movie while depicting physics, Alfonso Cuar√≥n is not a physicist, he is a person from art. To imagine the a movie in gravity-less space for a person from art is so difficult that there are not a lot of Gravity-alike movies.We can't do many things in space, like we can't cry, even if we cry the tears won't flow out of our eyes. We won't simply thrown away from a space ship as there will be a little bit of gravitational force between the huge spaceship and tiny 60Kg human beings. But if Sandra Bullock would not have been crying how will the filmmaker show bring the emotion in the movie. There was a real need of Geroge Clooney's comeback because Ryan was loosing all her hope to go back to earth.

","2001 it is not, but GRAVITY is a tense and, at times, thrilling movie about survival that coasts on its stunning visuals while paying little attention to story and character. The plot is simple: two astronauts who are making modifications to the Hubble Space Telescope have to fight for their lives after debris from a Russian satellite starts to make its way towards them. The cast is quite small, and only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney have any screen time. Everyone else is just a voice on the intercom. George Clooney does his usual ladies' man routine, which he does quite well, and Sandra Bullock does a good job of a woman who never should have been allowed in space in the first place. That aside, they do an admirable job with the script they were given. Where the movie really excels is in the visual department. Alfonso Cuaron spent many years developing this concept and technology to make this movie, not unlike James Cameron did with Avatar, and it shows on screen. These are some of the most impressive space effects that I've seen in a long time, although calling them ground-breaking might be giving it a little too much credit. The score is also worth mentioning, and helps to maintain the tension throughout the film. Still, I felt like the story was lacking enough, and the middle 45-50 minutes of the movie lags quite a bit. I have a feeling that I'd be looking at this movie differently had I saw it in theaters, but I didn't, so this is how I feel about it. The first half-hour, and the last 20 minutes were superb, but the middle dragged a little too much. Overall, it is a movie worth seeing, although to get the full effect of the visuals, it would probably be best to see this on the largest screen possible and with a decent sound system. Best movie of 2013? No, but it's still pretty good for what it is."
"TheMarwood","7","1","2","26 October 2014"," Special effects that are truly special and dialogue in special need of being reworked
","Gravity is a film written around six long scenes that are directed with technical perfection and padded with scenes that are always well done - but anchored down by expository dialogue completely unnecessary in a survival film with one character who just can't seem to either stop talking to herself or informing us very, very slow audience members about her perilous situation. Any film would be lucky to have a great sequence and Gravity has half a dozen of them and they are usually sustained by shots that don't contain a single edit for minutes at a time. There is so much in this film that is great and worthy of repeated viewing, but the whole is less than the sum of its great parts. The opening 13 minute unbroken shot is not only a technical accomplishment, but sets up this narrative without ever feeling like a gimmick or a shot designed to bring attention to itself. When Stone gets the Soyuz parachute tangled and the debris takes out the ISS, it's one of the most spectacular destruction scenes ever filmed. The simple structure for Gravity perfectly suits the film, but some cringe inducing dialogue needed a serious rewrite. There's too much that's fantastic in Gravity to let any criticisms deter a viewing. Highly recommended."

Its also claustrophobia inducing and a hell of a thrill ride, yet despite all that Gravity just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Now I can't claim to know anything about physics but it all just seemed far-fetched to me, so that basically what you've got here is a disaster movie that without all the amazing visuals is just okay.<br/><br/>Gravity reminded me of ""Apollo 13"", in that everything that could go wrong does, for astronaut Sandra Bullock -who is having the worst day ever. George Clooney is just being George Clooney (he's barely in the movie), a space cowboy playing the same character he is in all of his other movies. Charming, flirty, heroic in a humble way. He was this guy on ER like a hundred years ago.<br/><br/>Anyways I'm sure if I'd seen this in the theatre I would have given it a higher rating as that's how its meant to be seen but that would still be based on the special effects not the story or the acting or the gratuitous floating underwear scene.<br/><br/>Still I don't regret watching it, the effects are game changing and it must have been gruelling for the actors to film.

","I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater which I'm still kicking myself over because in 3D, the movie had to be visually stunning. The film was made specifically to be seen in large format theaters with IMAX and 3D capabilities. Plot and dialogue wise, it's no ""Citizen Kane"" but the sheer scale of the visuals on the big screen is what won people over. It took what was probably the best part of ""Avatar"" (the technical work like graphics and CGI) and threw it up on the big screen in an epic way. This isn't a movie you see for the dialogue, it's all about the visual. If you don't own a 3D TV, find a friend who does and check it out. For some people, not all, it may change their minds on how they view the film. Even the director said that unless you see in on the big screen in 3D, you miss about 80% of the filmmakers vision. Not to mention that almost everything except the actors faces during the space walk were CGI. That is some impressive work."

","Gravity is one of those movies you regret not seeing in the biggest theater possible. The way it looks, how the camera moves around, the angles they go with, the special effects, the whole visual package is just phenomenal to look at. Easily one of the most impressive films in a while when it comes to the whole ""moving pictures"" aspect.<br/><br/>Gravity keeps things simple and focuses on the essentials. It is meant to be an experience, rather than a statement of something profound. That doesn't mean there isn't a story or even a point to be found within it, but they are both secondary to the vision. Kind of like a Nirvana song. There are lyrics, but the music came first.<br/><br/>And what music, or visuals in this case, it is. Gravity steals your breath away from the very first scene, with a long establishing shot where the camera simple circles around the space station from one astronaut to another, without a single cut to be seen. Amazingly beautiful, which the rest of the movie easily keeps up until the very end. I'm also impressed how full they managed to make the space look. This could have simply been white human blobs floating against the darkness of vacuum, but through good angles and orbital location, they manage to make it look better than that.<br/><br/>The rest of the aspects work very well as well. The absence of sound in space is utilized well and the actors are all at the top of their game. Though, to be fair, whereas Sandra Bullock completely submerges herself into the role of Ryan Stone, giving a very impressive performance, with George Clooney I always saw only George Clooney in space. Still a good performance, though.<br/><br/>Gravity will pull you into an unforgettable journey and is one of the most ambitious and impressive scifi films to come out in years. Definitely worth checking out."

","With stunning 3D visuals, this film shows space in a way never seen before. Looking down on Earth in 3D even gave me some experience of what the 'Overview Effect' might be like for astronauts. There were great moments of action and excitement, and some great portrayals of weightlessness. These successes, however, are outweighed by some elements that have a complete disregard for sensibility and the laws of physics. <br/><br/>There's plenty of other reviews that point out all the physics mistakes, so I won't repeat them all, but Clooney's character detaching himself and floating away for no reason really got me screaming at the screen, and the back-stories made no sense either. Not to mention everything seeming to share the same orbit... These mistakes really spoiled what could have been a great movie.<br/><br/>With a few simple fixes (change the character's back-story, change the original mission target away from Hubble, to something on the ISS itself, and a few minor physics tweaks), this could have been a hard- SciFi masterpiece, but as it is, it's just another passable sci-fi action film; take everything with a pinch of salt."

","I expected the movie to be about the psychological tensions of being a female captain in a traditionally male-dominated world. Nope that was not it at all. Sandra Bullock is the only character alive for most of the movie. She has to carry the entire movie. It is a special effects/disaster flick. She moves from one space station to another, escaping by the skin of her teeth, as they are blown to bits by space debris.<br/><br/>The special effects are quite believable. I don't know how they were done. People and objects float rotating serenely. There are no crude wires to get in the way of the action.<br/><br/>The space stations are incredibly cramped. I can imagine the locker room smell. They look completely plausible. I had waves of claustrophobia just looking an them on the TV screen.<br/><br/>The movie ended too soon. I was far from convinced she was home free. I wanted to see something of what happened to her character, Ryan Stone, after she made it back to earth.<br/><br/>Some things did not make sense. What was this somewhat clueless woman doing on a space station? Why could she walk immediately after months in space? Why is there so much noise in space especially when dialogue makes the point there isn't? Why is there no way to make radio contact with earth from any of the space stations?<br/><br/>For me it was too repetitive. Too much action and not enough psychology.

","After winning seven Oscars this year I couldn't wait to see what the buzz was surrounding Gravity. It blew my mind. It is engineered so well that everything about it is incredible.<br/><br/>The visuals are probably this film's most prominent feature ‚Äì given that the scenes of space and the Earth have been created almost entirely using CGI it is a breath-taking and strangely immersive setting, giving a real sense of emptiness that is heavily contrasted with the restricted space shuttle scenes. Alfonso Cuaron truly deserved his Oscar for Best Achievement in Directing. Running a close second is the acting ‚Äì Sandra Bullock and George Clooney hold the film entirely, being the only two actors featured in it, and that really adds something to the feeling of perpetual emptiness and solitude associated with space itself. Bullock is the real star of the show here, the simplistic but effective story centres on her and she portrays a vulnerable, relatable character in this film incredibly convincingly and with many complex elements. I've seen a few other films that she has been in and I was impressed at her ability to really branch out in this film and offer such a strong performance. George Clooney does well as Bullock's astronaut partner with a calming and authoritative character that is just as likable as Bullock's. <br/><br/>As I mentioned above, the story itself is fairly simplistic although it offers a deep insight into the lives of Clooney and Bullock's characters; but it's so effective, almost giving the impression of time having no meaning out in space (the pace of the film reminded me of Jim Jarmusch's wonderful Only Lovers Left Alive (2014)). <br/><br/>Gravity is visually stunning and beautifully acted, keeping you on the edge of your seat and drawing you in to the fascinating unknown that is space.

","3.5/5 <br/><br/>Gravity gives us some of the most impressive visuals ever put on screen. It is also mostly accurate to the rules of space like there being no sound when debris collides with the space shuttle. We are pulled into space itself and it is a magical experience. What really brings us in is some impressive camera work as well, like showing the astronauts' perspective of what's going on in front of them, and hearing their loud breaths. Everything is fully detailed and at its place as far as sound, visuals and mostly accuracy. If there are any flaws in accuracy, mostly only astronomers would be able to tell. It won't bother anything at all to how impressively well done everything is. <br/><br/>The movie is pretty thrilling as well. The visuals create some very realistic disaster situations that don't go over the top to coincidences, but what can really happen in space, a fragile place that can be disastrous to mankind. It does a great job at showing that.<br/><br/>The problem however is the emotional depth the movie is and sometimes the direction it goes. It is sometimes is too busy with the visuals that it doesn't give much time for character development. There are emotional scenes that are supposed to be gripping and compelling, but they aren't really compelling unless we have a backstory that is somewhat interesting. It is kind of effective in a way, but the movie works much better if it was a more visual wonder than emotional, like 2001 A Space Odyssey. The story was not about a certain character, but mankind itself and it told its story through visuals, not emotion or dialogue. Gravity tried to do both, but too be honest, they should have just stuck to more of a visual approach or give us some interesting character background. The story is obviously about a character surviving. Let us get to know her more! <br/><br/>If only the emotional backstory was more compelling I would be happy to be with the crowd of saying it's one of the best films of the year. But I would say it's a good movie, but not a great one. People will go to theatres expecting a visual wonder. For the most part it succeeds, but the emotional parts will distract you. But I guess people just want more eye candy and if they do, this is for them. Still I can recommend this for the thrills, and visual wonder it creates to the screen. Gravity is a tense, and very thrilling visual experience that is well shot and paced."

It was very inconsistent, you could tell that the two people writing it were just not on the same level.<br/><br/>The dialogue was more than cheesy at some points, it got pretty bad. At some points it was great, and at some point maybe even awful. Yep, definitely felt inconsistent.<br/><br/>This is why I feel it might be a little unfair of me to say that I don't think Bullock deserves an Oscar for this, pretty much all of her weak acting was in the sequences with the poor writing and there isn't much an actor can do about a poor script. But yeah.. I'm sticking to my opinion.<br/><br/>Clooney on the other hand, I loved and I think it has a lot to do with how moderately his character was used.<br/><br/>From what I've heard from people who's met actual American astronaut ""veterans"", he embodies it perfectly. He definitely had some great line delivery and did very well with his facial acting.<br/><br/>Overall this film was great, does it deserve to win for best picture however?<br/><br/>Perhaps, I wouldn't be jumping out of my chair in anger if it did. But definitely best visual effects, without a doubt.<br/><br/>But maybe leave your son out of the loop on your next project Alfonso.."

","Enough been said about the impressive visuals and acting of the movie. What I think is undermined is the message that the movie try to convey to the viewer: To continue and fight in the face of a continuous and fervent adversary. Here the adversary is the void space and we learn that it's such a dangerous (yet mesmerizing) place.<br/><br/>We can NOT call gravity a very scientific movie. For instance traveling between shuttles and space stations is not possible because they orbit on different altitudes and inclinations.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie is deeply spiritual. I invite the viewer to note these incidents and try to connect them to the moments they happen: <br/><br/>1- Matt Kowalski (played by George Clooney) talks about Ganges, a holy river in Hinduism: ""you should see the sun on the Ganges, it's amazing"" at a very decisive part of the movie.<br/><br/>2- We see a painting of Saint Christopher (the saint of protection) in Soyuz capsule (these capsules are the only saviors in the space).<br/><br/>3- We see Buddha status in the Chinese Shenzhou (again in the capsule).<br/><br/>4- The appearance of Matt Kowalski in Soyuz capsule.<br/><br/>P.S. I think this is the first time I've seen Sandra Bullock not getting naked in a movie. kinda disappointing as she promised us some action with Clooney :)"

","It's Friday, valentine's day all over the world, and I decided to stay home to watch gravity with great expectations. I have to say earlier this same day I had had to cover a coworker's English lab class at school where I teach English. Since it is nearly the end of the school year I wanted to play gravity for them in the lab big screen. But a 12- year-old dissuaded me not to play on the basis she said of boredom she had experience at the local cinema. I played a different movie instead. She didn't put out my expectations on the film, nevertheless. So later, I played the film in my place by myself. And the film by itself proved to be a master piece. All thanks to amazing writer- director Alfonzo Cuaron and outstanding performance by Sandra Bullock. Both giving merits to walk out with the gold at the academy awards this season. The picture is dramatic, edgy and well written. The cinematography is great as well, and the end reasonably satisfying. I have many thoughts about this gem but I can't convey them into writing. All I have to say in the end is ¬®Houston, I got a good feeling about this picture¬® The bottom line, if you are a kid or are easily impressed this film might not be for you. You may find it boring."

The themes of rebirth and sorrow are hammered home in a visually stunning way.<br/><br/>However, the most incredible thing about the film was Bullock. She impressed me in every way. One scene in particular stands out (all I will say is that there was some barking involved!).<br/><br/>George Clooney was also great, despite his short screen time. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this was a highly entertaining flick which is technologically and emotionally incredible. <br/><br/>And did I mention how GREAT SANDRA BULLOCK WAS!"

","As I watched this movie from the beginning,I knew this was great. The script, the photography and the direction are quiet awesome. There's a lot of pseudo science nerds trying to put this movie down because a pen did not float in zero gravity as it is expected to float. Get a life! This is one of the best movies of 2013,and for good reasons. First, the casting I think it's quite good. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney could not be better for their roles. Second, photography is just outstanding. I could watch this movie easily four or five times without getting bored, because every time you discover something you missed before. There's quite a few of good lines and the technical specs are great."
"jrc619","9","1","2","30 January 2014"," A Technical and Thematic Masterpiece
","Gravity is a film that I never expected to be so effective at what it tries to achieve and convey. The film provides a simple concept, astronauts adrift in space that need to persevere and get home yet this simple concept is one of the strongest aspects of the movie as it conveys it's beautiful imagery, orchestral soundtrack and excellent acting.<br/><br/>It beautifully encompasses such themes as mortality, nature, helplessness, perseverance and rebirth. Imagery and dialogue convey these themes especially well in that we journey and sympathise with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) throughout the movie as we witness one horrible event occurring after another, anything that can go wrong will go wrong.<br/><br/>Gravity is also an absolutely beautiful film and can stand tall with special effects cinema legends of the past. While not perfectly scientifically accurate, the film portrays the concept of space travel in a gorgeous, unknown but horrifying visage. The soundtrack is perfect for the movies style from the opening scene to the credits, orchestral and ambient themes perfectly capture the mood of each scene.<br/><br/>Gravity is named by many critics as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time and certainly one of the best this year. Tarantino names it as one of his favourites of 2013 while Cameron regards it as one of the best space films ever made.<br/><br/>If you go in with the expectation of a simple premise, expect a film that focuses on an individual level and exceptional CGI then you will thoroughly enjoy it. It doesn't aspire to be the next generation of film making but it does achieve far more than it intended.<br/><br/>Minor complaints are pacing and a few science plot holes that don't distract from the main movie but still prevalent when you identify them. Know that this film isn't for everyone but if you love Sci-fi, love CGI done properly and appreciate poignant themes then this film should not be missed.<br/><br/>9/10. One of the best Sci-Fi films of all time and one of the top of 2013."

It was a well shot film the acting was great. One of the great things about the film is that yeah the location and story line worked but I could almost see it working anywhere else like under water too.. I enjoyed it very much.. I look forward to what this team does in the future. I think when you put a high caliber production company like them and the acting talent that that have it would only result in a fine end product.

"A_Voice","8","1","2","26 January 2014"," The best Space movie!
","A superbly acted and directed space sci-fi thriller!! Visually a stunning extravaganza with Sandra Bullocks superb acting and Emmanuel Lubezki spectacular cinematography. The critics are right, it is probably the best film this year and actually a ""2001: Space Odyssey of the new millennium.<br/><br/>Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is stuck with veteran astronaut (Matt Kowalski) after being hit by a space disaster.<br/><br/>Have you ever wondered what space is like? what it is like to be in zero gravity? etc. All the answers lie in a viewing of this film, preferably on an IMAX screen. The only regret I have is that we don't have any IMAX here in India. Nevertheless this film is not just a film but an experience.<br/><br/>Visually driven films tend to lack proper story telling and in many cases a proper story, and in almost all cases no remember able performance. But this film is different, as much as it relies upon its superior bench-marked visuals, it is a plot and character driven story. It might lack character development, but there was no need for it, though George Clooney's character is developed well enough, whereas Sandra bullock's crowning performance is probably her career best.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n waited for the right technology which was delivered to it by Cameron's Avatar, and Alfonso implemented it to perfection by combining it with his ""long shots"" compelling direction and calculative writing. Along with extraordinary visuals the film also features an excellent soundtrack, and it is my pick for the Academy awards this year. I was very disappointed when Emmanuel Lubezki was snubbed by the academy for the Tree of Life, but this year it is impossible to beat him :).<br/><br/>Direction: Extraordinarily, compelling and top notch.<br/><br/>Script/Screenplay: Calculative and Strong. Has just the right thrills and character development as deemed necessary. Nothing feels ""thrown inn"" or ""forced"" Acting: Sandra's best, probably an Oscar is on the way, if not for Cate. George was great as well.<br/><br/>Music: A sure Oscar. An extremely excellent score and very very well executed.<br/><br/>When the film ends, you want to see more, you feel like I wish it was 3 to 4 hours long. If you haven't seen this yet, better go and watch it till its in theaters, it is not a film meant to be downloaded by torrents or watched on DVD or even Blu Ray."

"lynchfilmlover","Null","1","2","22 January 2014"," Must Be Seen As Intended
","I had missed this on initial release but due to the Oscar nomination, my local cinema gave it an extra week of a 3D run. I had heard and read so much that this film is the one made for 3D. up until now I had avoided 3D and had only seen the Doctor Who 'The Day of the Doctor' at the cinema in that format.<br/><br/>The film very much goes straight into the story with a scene that is a continuous 13 minute take. Straight off the bat the 3D effects are startling and I have to agree, from the offset, I have to agree that this is a film you must see that format. Sadly I am imagine that seeing this on DVD in the future, in 2D, will lose so much. In fact the effects in this are simply astounding, groundbreaking and totally breathtaking. The depth of the dimension is a joy to behold.<br/><br/>This is a 90 minute film and you would wonder how the story would stretch over that time. Trust me, it does. It is pretty much a disaster movie from start till end. The only criticism is that there really is no character development. All we really know of Dr Ryan Stone is the brief mentions of what happened to her daughter. Having said that, the story and imagery are the principal factor here, not the character. For that reason the film would not be a 10/10 for me.<br/><br/>I must agree with a fellow reviewer who mentions Lumiere's 'Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat' (1895). This film is groundbreaking. Even rare cinema goers are understanding the need to have seen this as it is intended. Some of the audience I talked to prior to showing were attending there very first modern 3D film. I hope that it is looked back upon in the future up there with the likes of 2001 and others.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock excels. She is in practically every scene. George Clooney is surprisingly annoying and I didn't warm to him at all. There are not many films where the cast list is so low and that is one of the pluses of the film. It feels like the whole 90 minutes is one take, of course that is impossible but that is how seamless this film is! Interestingly I found Stone's attempt to contact someone for help a but unsettling as is was very weird. The person she is contacting, obviously has no idea what the hell is going on and who she is. Sadly within the film we only see her side of the conversation. However, on researching after the film, a short 6 minute film shows the conversation from the other point of view where you see the Greenlandic Inuit fisherman who intercepts Stone's transmission. Aningaaq as he is called is a self-titled short written and directed by Gravity co-writer Jon√°s Cuar√≥n. I will reviewing that on here at some point in the near future.<br/><br/>There are many hints towards rebirth in this film. Also, the end of the film is a metaphor for the evolution of the human, progressing out of the amniotic fluid to being on all fours, then stood but curved and finally stood erect. In fact you can also say that the beginning of the film depicts the pinnacle of human achievement and end with the dawn of mankind.<br/><br/>I am so glad I saw this as intended and I urge anyone who can catch it in cinemas before it is too late, to see it in all its glory."

","An astronaut with a tragic past finds herself alone in space after a catastrophic event engulfs her shuttle. It is only through facing certain death that she re-discovers the will to live.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the most immersive, compelling use of the 3D format to date, though given that the format has failed to live up to its potential, that is not exactly high praise. The arena of space is thoroughly explored in 3D, and the swinging camera, extreme close ups and mammoth wide shots suitably convey the claustrophobia and agoraphobia that space must engender in astronauts. Sound design is also persuasively authentic, though the screeching soundtrack that cuts before silence in the open sequence could have been toned down a decibel or two. The special effects are top notch and clearly the film's biggest selling point. They unashamedly draw attention to themselves, which unfortunately means they work at the expense of the narrative.<br/><br/>The plight and journey of Bullock's character would have been much more cathartic if more thought had been given to dialogue and tempo. Instead, she swings from one mini-disaster to another, Bullock apparently channeling Annie Porter doing her best to drive that bus in 'Speed.' Bullock's performance is engaging rather than outstanding. Clooney, on the other hand, is simply miscast. Like the effects he is too obviously cinematic, too much his cheeky, charming self, too much a reminder of the artifice and Hollywood-ness of it all. I suspect a more grounded character actor like Stanley Tucci might have excised this role of the frivolousness Clooney's presence inspires.<br/><br/>Wonderful effects, a considered deployment of 3D, and a story that is enjoyable if not exactly sublime, make this a good outing for those who enjoy event cinema. Like Avatar, this film's weaknesses will come into sharp focus on DVD. And with a running time close to 90 minutes, the filmmakers should win awards for economy and self-discipline. Big screen cinema, but not one to re-visit."
"rooee","5","1","2","28 December 2013"," Empty space
","I just don't get it. I've watched Gravity twice now. I'm seeing the lovely long takes, the exquisite vertiginous photography, and the clever sound design. I'm receiving the magnificent special effects loud and clear. But I'm not getting anything else from the film. When the praise for an artwork is so unanimously glowing, you find yourself either wanting to love it or inclined to hate it. But with Gravity, for me, it's worse than that: I find it mediocre. It's a classy space-based smash-'em-up for those who couldn't bear to admit enjoying J.J. Abrams' Star Trek movies.<br/><br/>The film is written by the director's son, Jonas Cuar√≥n. The story concerns a rookie engineer, Ryan Stone (a solid, nappy-free Sandra Bullock), who we meet being guided through a Hubble mission by old-hand Matt Kowalski (a woefully miscast George Clooney, going full Buzz Lightyear). Soon the news comes over the radio that a cloud of debris is racing toward their position ""as fast as a high-speed bullet"" (as opposed to a sluggish bullet?). 90 minutes of spinning, dancing chaos ensues.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n proved in 2006, with Children of Men, that he could push the boundaries of action cinema whilst also portraying interesting characters in a rich narrative. Gravity does the action stuff brilliantly, but the script is a B-movie stinker and the characters are... well, like film stars playing astronauts. Dotted throughout the film is beautiful imagery, but it's either irrelevant (Ryan curling into a floating foetal position) or accompanied by Clooney verbally informing us it's beautiful. These characters make the sight of the sunrise bland.<br/><br/>Imagine the zero-gravity scenes from 2001: A Space Odyssey stretched to an entire film. (Albeit with more explosions and a lot more gasping.) Kubrick was attempting to depict the complacency of humankind; how technology had drained the awe from our species. I'm not sure what the Cuar√≥ns are up to here, beyond giving us a very elaborate and expensive tech demo. Are they simply trying to make us experience a visceral thrill, or is there something deeper? Something about the way we humans are forever spinning away and towards each other? Alas, father and son are only here to elaborate on the physical realm, not the psychological, philosophical, or spiritual. For that reason, I can't see this ""pure cinema"" experience being one that will improve on the small screen."
"Cristi_Ciopron","6","1","2","22 December 2013"," More Was Needed
","A _techno‚Äîthriller about the terrors of the void without boundaries, 'Gravity' was directed, written, produced and edited by Cuar√≥n, being an author movie, a small‚Äîscale outing showcasing Sandra B..<br/><br/>The story is focused, though the style seems a bit bland, despite the harshness of the events.<br/><br/>Clooney is frankly annoying.<br/><br/>These said, Cuar√≥n made a suspenseful, enthralling movie, interesting if not entirely satisfying, about survival near Earth. It was hugely pleasing (I'm overstating, surely) to see Sandra B. leading a tout story about the choice to live, about choosing to live. The story is straight, impressive, clean, averagely intelligent. And not so much the facts shown, but the template, the syntax; it begins leisurely, but the mastery shows.<br/><br/>'Gravity' is, in fact, a thoughtful movie, more thoughtful than it might appear. Good movie, and it doesn't have a thesis, but a position, a standpoint. At times, when required, it's scary and intense.<br/><br/>Clooney remains a silhouette. We aren't shown a lot of him.<br/><br/>There is a certain experimental attempt, a quirk, but the result is unconvincing, somewhat undersized, charmless, unsatisfying. It might turn Sandra's appeal into blandness. (It might, but it doesn't, since Cuar√≥n isn't enough of an author to really warp the footage.) Cuar√≥n mentions Bresson, but more was needed to enter the contest. More dare, more thought also, a finer script perhaps, besides the simply intriguing quirk. In the unity of Bresson's movies, of each of his movies, the style is made possible by the script, by its inner thoughtfulness, it's a unity; in Cuar√≥n's hands, the stylistic attempt has to fail, being severely misunderstood, as no thorough script is provided, but a premise for a roller-coaster.<br/><br/>I think Cuar√≥n misunderstood Bresson's art‚Äîif he ever really thought about it.<br/><br/>Remember Clooney's 'Solaris'? A similar ambition, also given as a family movie, an average cartoon.<br/><br/>Bresson and Tarkovsky were both mistaken by the directors as making style, when they were deepening very good scripts (and, of course, bringing unequaled skills).<br/><br/>Some very brave directors, people like Welles, who came from Expressionism, once imposed the notion of style over content, and this understanding has lasted, it has stamped Hollywood until today; but Bresson and Tarkovsky come from a different, even opposed, aesthetics, where style doesn't trump content, but boosts it (Iosifescu called this, 'the quiet style', he meant literature), a trend who didn't cherish style as a sovereign entity, the triumph of the form (think of Antonioni, of the mature Truffaut, or the way style dissolves, is taken over by content, even in the best of the late Fellini).<br/><br/>So, it is not about style and lack of style, but about style of a subtler nature. A quieter style. And so, beginning with Cuar√≥n, we reached a cornerstone of the cinema aesthetics.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading, if you did."

However,this movie makes me feel very excited. I even started to meditate on some questions which I never thought before. What's the meaning of a human being, to live on or to die? Without gravity, we will flow into the endlessly dark and quiet universe forever, absolutely loneliness, can u imagine that? If it happens to me, I'll be definitely scared and panic. After watching over this movie, I am keeping thinking a question. We are destined to die,our earth is eventually to be destroyed, our university will doom to disappear, so what's the meaning of to live, to have,or to enjoy. The answer is really terrifying me. My friends told me to stop thinking that kinda questions. Because we cannot change anything. We are so useless when we face the ending of our world.

"HelenMary","8","1","2","4 December 2013"," Wow! a visually stunning film; this is what 3D is for.
","This is a film that was bound to do well; Bullock and Clooney, both big draw names and both very talented actors, popular and with appeal for both serious and comedic roles. They had good chemistry on screen despite limited contact, but mainly Bullock shines on her own for the majority of the film, and other than that the majority of anything happening you just have their faces and their voices and still the film carries weight in terms of gripping the audience. I can't remember the last time I was in a cinema when people were so quiet, I barely wanted to bite my popcorn! I think people were stunned.<br/><br/>Difficult to review without spoilers but the premise of the film is well known; people in space, they run into difficulties... Apollo 13 was similar, problem after problem, tense like a roller-coaster. This was particularly tense and gripping as a) it's in 3D so everything is more vividly shown and b) Bullock has a way of drawing you in to her little world and c) you can imagine how mind bogglingly scary it would be very easily. Being in space, outside in it, free-floating... alone... Brrrrr...<br/><br/>Bullock had worked hard for this role, she had worked out A LOT and it must have been physically draining as a lot of the scenes were weightless and unless they used CGI (which I think they did, a bit, very well) and/or some very clever wire work, she was doing long scenes in free-fall anti-gravity plane flights - difficult!! She did it brilliantly and convincingly and you could really believe it was all happening to her. The plot is very slim - but there is a little back story and in the absence of lots of varied events and dialogue and back and forth, there is pathos, existential epiphanies and some really touching moments. Sounds are made use of, music (a great score and soundtrack) and attention to detail in the sound effects. There's no glamour, and emotionally Bullock was very exposed without anything to hide behind just raw emotion and fear and struggle. I got a bit teary at one point, I will admit.<br/><br/>The real star of the show was Gaia - Planet Earth; however they depicted it, whether it was real space shots or CGI or whatever, it was magnificent, it added the spectacle and the backdrop to a lot of very close in action sequences, and the infinite reaches of space were engrossing when you got to look out, it felt huge in the cinema with the 3D glasses on, really beautiful. I haven't really appreciated 3D much before but in Gravity it was necessary and it had a point to it. In the confined space of the space pods on the station, the effect was so realistic as to be there - and some of the scenes were shot out of Bullock's eyes making you right there in the action. Little details like that, the use of the lens as eye, things ending up on the lens to give the impression of intimacy and being there, the use of reflection (very arty in places) and the whole visual of the film was one of the best I've seen. The CGI in this film; the 3D effects though were incredible - mind-blowing = a special effect was tear drops floating in front of the viewers eye/the lens, tiny details were what made this film despite the scale of it. It had the same visual effect as... remember the first time you saw T2 or Matrix? Like that.<br/><br/>Whilst I thought this film was superb in terms of visuals, stunning and very artistic, and the performance by Sandra Bullock was especially raw and worthy of accolade, I can't see that Gravity would translate well to DVD unless you had a screen the size of your wall. It is a big screen film, a 3D film, and without those two things I don't think the impact of it would be as great and so it has limited appeal. I don't expect its a film you could (or would want to) see over and over again either and once you know what happens, the tension is probably gone."

Stone is on her first mission and Kowalski on his last and his matter-of-fact wisecracking humor sharply contrasts with Stone's studious solidity. Things change rapidly from order to chaos, however, when an off-course Russian missile destroys a satellite and releases a shower of shrapnel into orbit hurtling in the direction of their shuttle. Stone and Kowalski are the mission's only survivors, left spinning helplessly in space after their shuttle is destroyed.<br/><br/>When contact with home is broken, they keep talking to whoever is out there, listening to themselves, hoping to be heard. We are with them in space with the sun-drenched image of the Earth always present thanks to the breathtaking cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki. Tethered together, floating 600 kilometers above the Earth with their oxygen running dangerously low, the only option for them is to make their way to a capsule on either the International Space Station or a smaller Chinese orbiting platform to find an escape pod to take them home. Along the way, Dr. Stone has to deal with fires, extreme temperatures, mechanical failures, and language barriers just to stay afloat.<br/><br/>Demoralized by a tragic incident in her life that has left her feeling that life is simply a random throw of the dice, Stone must call upon reservoirs of strength she had not known she possessed to transcend the barriers that stand in her way. For her, getting home requires the courage to let go of her attachments and experience herself newly, to see her life as birth and rebirth. Although the personal drama feels calculated, Gravity is a dazzling achievement and one that hopefully may begin to lead us away from seeing the universe in terms of our fears to one of a deeper reverence for its mystery and beauty. Without doubt it is a film about surviving and reaching one's goal, yet, more than that, it is about learning to appreciate the ride."
"gbacquet","8","1","2","24 November 2013"," A minimalistic piece of cinematic beauty
","""Gravity"" is a perfect example of how special effects can be used in an extraordinarily clever fashion to enhance the story instead of trying to tell it. <br/><br/>This very minimalistic movie, with only two characters on screen, is visually stunning. It follows the aftermath of a space shuttle being hit by debris which leaves two astronauts adrift in space with all the odds against them. <br/><br/>Space, with its vastness, unpredictability and empty silence becomes a character all in its own as our protagonists try to survive. That's when the special effects create a fantastic, wondrous world that captures the audience as it lays trap after trap for Ryan and Michael, played wonderfully subdued by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Especially the former, who totally plays against type and succeeds. <br/><br/>You're never at ease, you never what know what's coming, what's true or what's an illusion and I don't think you'll ever feel the same about going into space. <br/><br/>The short running time, the tension build-up, the intensity and the (for me) very satisfying ending make this a movie that you really shouldn't miss; it is a unique and beautiful piece of cinematic art. Movies which generate this kind of hype usually draw a lot of regular movie goers while driving away those with a more sophisticated taste. This time I'm pretty sure neither group will be unhappy."
"will51224","9","1","2","22 November 2013"," You'll feel like you're in space with them
","I finally got around to seeing Gravity, and it was one epic experience that certainly lived up to the hype. Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone (yes, she's a chick with a guy's name), a medical engineer on her first mission in outer space, accompanied by George Clooney's Matt Kowalsky, a veteran astronaut who's on the brink of retirement. Everything seems to be going smoothly until an accident involving space debris destroys their shuttle, leaving the two of them floating aimlessly in space, where no one can hear them and no one can find them. All they have is each other as they try to make it out of their terrifying predicament alive. Just imagining being in that situation is freaking me out right now as I'm writing this.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer, I thought the idea seemed original and it looked like it could be entertaining, but I wondered how much of a plot and how much character development could occur in a movie that seemed to be merely about two people stranded in space. It turns out that my skepticism was unjustified, as it offered more than just an amazing visual experience. The plot may be basic, but it's laid out extremely well. The two main characters, especially Ryan Stone, have interesting enough back stories to keep the audience interested and focused on more than just how tremendous everything looked.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock gave an excellent performance. It's hard to believe that 20 years ago, she was driving a bus with Keanu Reeves breathing down her neck. She may even get a second Oscar nomination and stick the middle finger up to anyone who said her 2010 win for The Blind Side was an undeserved fluke. George Clooney did what he did best: he acted like George Clooney.<br/><br/>I have never truly felt like I was there when watching a movie until I saw this one. I imagine that this is the closest anyone could get to experiencing what it's like to be in space without actually being there. Everything looked so real, it was unreal. This is the first time I can say that seeing a film in 3D was worth the extra admission price. It would've been even more awesome to see it in IMAX, but I waited until over a month after its release, like a dumbass, so it had already been yanked out of IMAX theaters. The 3D alone was awesome nevertheless, and I can't even imagine seeing it in 2D.<br/><br/>By grossing over $500 million worldwide, Gravity has deservingly become one of the biggest films of the year, and looks to be a serious contender once awards season rolls around. If you haven't yet, I highly recommend checking it out in theaters while you still can."
"davidgee","8","1","2","20 November 2013"," Audience in peril!
","After all the hype I was half expecting not to like this movie but it was impossible not to be blown away by it. The CGI is totally 'awesome': there was never a moment when I didn't feel I was up there orbiting the earth with Sandra Bullock and the wreckage of her spacecraft. GRAVITY is as ground-breaking (space-breaking?), if not quite as 'trippy', as Stanley Kubrick's 2001 was back in 1968.<br/><br/>There have been documentaries with more plot than this. Why would a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope need a Medical Officer? 100 years ago the Woman-in-Peril theme entailed tying her to a railway track. Here Bullock is adrift in space on her own for ten nerve-shredding minutes. Then the audience has to hold its breath for the rest of the movie wondering if she and and George Clooney can somehow beat the odds and make it back to Earth. <br/><br/>I did occasionally wonder why Gorgeous George was cast in the role when maybe some younger hunk might given the movie a bit more teen-appeal. The same could be said of Sandra Bullock, I guess, but she acts her socks off, presumably entirely working against a blue backdrop for the CGI guys to fill in. You are with this woman every inch of the way. Top marks to her and the director and cinematographer - and those CGI people. This is an Audience-in-Peril movie!"

","Hands down, ""Gravity"" is 2013's best Sci-Fi movie. Within the last couple of years we've had one major effects spectacle each year, and Alfonso Cuaron has done wonders in crafting something both familiar and awe-inspiring. I don't know how he managed to pitch something this ambitious. Filmed in four months at Pinewood studios, heavily researched (to an extent) and shot entirely in impressive lengthy 15 minute takes. Cuaron, against all odds has managed to convince studios to let him make a film of incredible spectacle with some great cinematography by the inventive Emmanuel Lubezki. All in the black vacuum of space, he still manages to incorporate some of the darker traits from his previous movies as well as constantly keeping you on edge and building tension.<br/><br/>Short story short(er). Five astronauts get caught in the midst of razor sharp debris, resulting in the destruction of their spacecraft and heavy casualties. In a race against time before complete loss of oxygen, veteran Matt (Clooney) & newcomer Stone (Bullock) must work against all odds to get back to earth, or risk drifting away into the vast emptiness of space.<br/><br/>The roles are a breath of fresh air for both Clooney and Bullock. She has the most to prove as this is far different from her usual outings, and she managed to bring a performance I didn't know she was actually capable of (Even though she is a reluctant astronaut, thanks Louis C.K). It's really hard to go in depth on a film of this calibre, mostly because I personally kept away from the hype. In a nutshell, it features one of the most radical depictions of space in a long time, and proper NASA terminology and oxygen deprivation build a level of struggle and believability. Zero gravity has never looked so livid, and the constantly orbiting camera is as superb as it is nauseating. But I do want to make clear that even though I have praised this film for its levels of science, one key scene that changes the entire drama of the movie is where they float away from each other and the physics are altered for the sake of the story. It's a little gripe I know, but personally it definitely would have been wise to somehow alter that. <br/><br/>Final Verdict: Regardless, ""Gravity"" is a film that my praise lies mostly on superb camera skills, technicality and very imaginative craft than a story driven piece. Rest assured future depictions of space have a lot more to live up to from now on. 8/10."

"RyanCShowers","Null","1","2","15 November 2013"," Alfonso Cuaron finds life in space
","Space draws ours interest because most of us will never get to experience of the wonders that lurk there. Director, Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is the best alternative to a trip to space. There's no hyperbole that comes with describing Gravity because it is in fact magnificent.<br/><br/>Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer sent to space with experienced astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) to service a Hubble Space Telescope. Before completing their work on the Telescope, they are hit with debris from another Satellite when the two individuals are separated and communication is lost. Dr. Stone, not a trained astronaut, must find her way to return safely to Earth.<br/><br/>In 2009's Avatar, James Cameron advanced visual effects to new heights in order to fit his image of the fictional world, Pandora. Like Cameron, Cuaron's vision required him to invent new technology in order for the film to have the intimacy he desired for his audience. The visuals are essential to the enjoyment of Gravity. This isn't a film that could hold its weight with the screenplay alone.<br/><br/>Gravity is the best use of 3D ever in film. I'm not a supporter of 3D, I never have been, but Gravity gives me hope that the future will properly suit each film that uses 3D to enhance the experience, not just a means to boost the box office sales. Cuaron makes us feel that we are taken off of Earth and shuttled into space with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. We feel like we have become a part of the story, like a miscellaneous object floating with the characters. If Gravity lacked 3D, Cuaron would have had a more difficult time transporting us like he does.<br/><br/>Children of Men, one of Cuaron's most praised films, became famous for scenes that consisted of the long, uninterrupted takes. Instead of three or four minute scenes of that nature, he pushes us even further with ten minutes without a single editing cut in Gravity. This flow allows the audience to funnel its focus into the film and think about nothing else. Cuaron only cuts when it is necessary to give us the perspective of his heroine.<br/><br/>How hard would that be? Plays go uninterrupted for hours at times, why is it so special here? Because the camera-work must follow the characters, who succumb to gravity while they try to solve their predicaments. The camera zooms in on the two actors as they float frontwards and backwards, upside down, right-side up to make us empathize with the characters, as well as establishing and tracking shots to show the magnitude of the action and scope out outer space.<br/><br/>The special effects are so realistic that a naive man would believe Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were trained as astronauts to shoot the film in outer space. Visual effects are hardly ever a sole reason to see a film, but Gravity is now the exception to that rule. Film critics and analysts have been left baffled to understand how Cuaron conducted the thorough realism of outer space.<br/><br/>When an actor is offered a role that is a one-woman show for two-thirds of an entire film, it can be daunting decision to sign on. Sandra Bullock doesn't let the pressure affect her portrayal, in fact she pulls something out of her that we have waited for her entire career. Bullock doesn't challenge herself in the romantic comedies and the ""Feel Good"" Lifetime-style dramas she often selects, but in Gravity she delivers a strong performance that makes me proud of her acting ability.<br/><br/>Creating movies is like a balancing act. Screenplays that are intricately written with great details and higher meanings typically won't fare well if the director's mind is on spectacle. Gravity has spectacle at the top of its list. The film has so much to show us, therefore it makes sense for not having as much to tell. But, Gravity manifests that thinly plotted script can have as much meaning and life value as any novel adaptation.<br/><br/>Gravity is about life. Not just life in space, but it questions how every one of us view life. Are we prepared to give up on everything because we've faced obstacles that have knocked us down, or is there beauty in fighting and climbing the ladder of life? Alfonso Cuaron finds life in space.<br/><br/>Gravity proves stereotypes wrong. Who ever made it a rule that movies in space or containing action had to be unrealistic? Like me, you may have seen the trailer and posters for Gravity and may think ""I'm not in the mood for Science Fiction."" I'm sure there are some inaccuracies, but there's nothing predominantly unrealistic about it, the setting just happens to be in outer space. Don't wait for the DVD/BluRay, it won't be the same as the smashing experience in the 3D cinema.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>Rating: 9"
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","10","1","2","15 November 2013"," This is a Solid SCI-FI survival Film and My Favorite movie of 2013.
","I Loved This Film and i found it Very impressive.The film has beautiful visuals and great special effects.It truly is a Visually stunning Film. The only problem i had with this film was the small cast and to be honest that's not really a big problem,but i just couldn't help but wish there were more people in the film i guess you could say that would add a bit more Action to the film because then lots of people would be in a tough situation rather than just two people.But like i said before that's not a huge problem,the film was still very good and i thought it was very well made.<br/><br/>As i'm sure a lot of people already know the film is mainly about just Sandra bullock and George Clooney and the two of them having to try and survive in space after an accident occurs. I must say the Action at the beginning of the film was very intense! when Mission control warns Sandra and Clooney that a missile was heading there way.Communications get lost with mission control and a high speed debris strikes the explorer and Ryan stone (Sandra Bullock) gets detached and floats off into space. George Clooney plays Lieutenant Matt Kowalski and he tries to rescue Sandra bullock and get her back to the space shuttle.<br/><br/>I must say i liked the characters in this film i thought George Clooneys character was likable and sometimes funny and Sandra Bullocks character was also very likable because she cared about her fellow astronauts and there is a scene in the movie when she tries to help George Clooneys character during an incident and that made me care about her character because she tried to do the right thing and George Clooney Likewise was the same. these are the sort of characters i like to see in movies (Likeable) ones that (help each other) not characters that we don't care about. Now granted when the film began we didn't know much about the two characters but even then i thought they were OK because they were nice and as the film went on their characters grew on me and a little more depth was given to them and that made me like them more.<br/><br/>What i liked about this film was that it really sucked me in! i felt like i was trapped in space with the two characters and when the characters felt scared i felt scared for them and when they felt sad i felt sad.This film also has a very Dark atmosphere! and i thought the film did very well in that respect because when you see all of the horrible things that happen in the movie it makes you feel a sense of dread,or it did with me at least.<br/><br/>The music in the film was also good and i liked the sound effects during the Action scenes i thought they were well done and i liked the ending score to the movie.The film started off with a bang and from then onward the film is mainly about surviving,so if people go to watch this film expecting It to be (Action packed) you will be sorely disappointed. The Movies story is about (survival) and hard and sad times so don't expect to see explosions every five minutes!. The film does have Action just (Not all the time). Be warned the film does have some slow spots,however that did not stop me from enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>To sum things up is this film Perfect,No but its still a very good film! and its definitely worth watching.I thought the acting was Good from both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and i thought they both played their rolls very well. I heard Sandra Bullock has been getting a lot of praise from people and frankly i think she deserves it! i thought she was Great as Dr Ryan stone. The supporting cast were okay and at the end of the day the film entertained me.i found it rather captivating and involving,i was sucked into the film and i found it quite emotional at times. I'd say this Film is just as Good as (Moon) and just as captivating as that film was. Gravity gets a 10/10 from me and Its The Best Movie of the year and it deserves a watch from everyone."

She is a scientist sent in space for a single scientific mission. We do this currently. <br/><br/>""These objects just don't orbit anywhere--ANYWHERE!!!!--near close enough to each other to make these events even remotely possible."" You are right as we currently don't have the next generation shuttle and the Chinese don't have a space station yet, so yeah they don't orbit close enough since they are not yet real. You gifted child you. <br/><br/>""No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate a Soyuz capsule in a few seconds of reading the manuals."" The soyuz capsule is currently an emergency reentry vehicle on board the International Space Station, astronauts are trained on it, even scientists who are not expected to use it. It is pointed out in the movie. The pilot would be the mission commander..... forget it, yeah she learned to fly from the manual, you are a clever little .<br/><br/>""What happened to Clooney character? Is he waiting to appear in the sequel if the film succeeds?"" What?!? are you serious? The whole emotional power of what happened to him comes from the fact that you know without seeing it! <br/><br/>""The Chinese craft was already heading toward earth...how?"" Its not a craft but a space station in a stable orbit around earth balanced between its inertia around the earth and the pull of our planets gravity.The station was loosing its orbit after the collision.... ohhh just forget it, it was magic.<br/><br/>Lower your expectations, stop watching movie trailers and enjoy a solid movie."

","I really want to convey how thoroughly enjoyable this movie was, but at the same time I don't wish to gush over it. The reason being, that if anyone was reading my review with the thought of watching the film, it is possible to build something up too much and precipitate disappointment.<br/><br/>So no hyperbole, just a cool, clear, opinion, delivered with an almost scientific emotional detachment.<br/><br/>1. Ask a question, to whit, should I go and watch Gravity, the new science fiction thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney ?<br/><br/>2. Conduct research and make observations. Which I did, after reading up on this movie, the consensus seemed to be a favourable one. I had also observed previous efforts by the actors involved and had enjoyed them.<br/><br/>3. Propose a hypothesis. The theory being that it would be to my benefit to drag my TV loving backside down to the local purveyor of IMAX entertainment and watch this film.<br/><br/>4. Design an experiment to test this hypothesis. Plans were quickly drawn to rendezvous at 19:45 BST at the Odeon, for a screening of the entertainment.<br/><br/>5. Test the hypothesis. I watched the movie.<br/><br/>6. Collate results and draw conclusions, to support or reject you hypothesis. The results were that I had a fantastic evenings entertainment. Watching a tense, thrilling tale of two astronauts left stranded, by a terrible accident, in orbit, two hundred miles above the Earth. <br/><br/>I concluded that the fantastic performances given by the two leads in the piece, combined with assured and innovative direction from Alfonso Cuaron and some dizzying special effects on the IMAX screen, produced a infrequently experienced, yet palpable sensation within me, that for the purposes of this experiment I choose to call, ""thrilled to bits"".<br/><br/>I strongly suggest you conduct your own experiment, as I did, in relation to the subject matter. I feel confident you will draw the same conclusions I did.<br/><br/>I did notice that some people here on IMDb seemed to have drawn somewhat muddled results from their experimentation in this area. Their conclusions were tainted by perceived scientific and procedural inaccuracies within the film. Having a limited knowledge of these things, I could not hope to debate these issues on any kind of an equal footing. (SPOILER-ISH) That said, I did read a vehement ""technical complaint"" in relation to something (completely scientifically impossible) that occurs in a scene which is well established as a dream sequence. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that."
"guchrisc","Null","1","2","12 November 2013"," A sublime Sandra Bullock is lost in space.
","A force, such as gravity, pulls the object into a curved path as it attempts to fly off in a straight line.<br/><br/>Thus a small object in space will orbit a large one.<br/><br/>This 91 minute, Warner Brothers film, rated 12A in the UK, tells the story of a small object, like a space-station, or to be more precise, a very small speck of an astronaut, played by Sandra Bullock, in orbit around the relatively very large Earth.<br/><br/>Space is big, and in this vast Universe there are planets and stars, with a lot of space in between. This space is a void, a vast nothing.<br/><br/>Film opens in space above Earth. At first we hear nothing and see nothing. Then a faint communication is heard which gradually gets louder. We see a small speck get gradually larger. It is a spacecraft and astronauts are working on it as it orbits high up above the Earth.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock plays one astronaut, George Clooney plays another. Mr Clooney's astronaut is an experienced veteran. Miss Bullock's astronaut, by contrast is a rookie. Both are engaged in a spacewalk. Mr Clooney is enjoying his time in space however mission-control are worried about Miss Bullock performing her allotted task without getting sick.<br/><br/>Those viewers who experienced the shaky camera of the recent 'Captain Phillips', will be glad to know that this film is completely different from that. You, and I, and Sandra Bullock, may have no idea of what is up, and down, but only mission-control will worry about sickness in this film. Viewers while experiencing a realistic representation of weightlessness in space, in this film, will not find it filmed in such a way as to make them queasy.<br/><br/>In the vastness of space around Earth, mission-control detects a collision between two other space-craft. This sets off some sort of localized intergalactic bar-billiards game. Broken bits of spacecraft are now heading towards our astronauts who are now in deadly danger. Film shows realistically the danger presented by these fast travelling objects. All are in orbit, and in the void of space, there is no gravity or atmosphere between the objects and anything they may hit. Collisions in space, in Star Trek, or similar films, have been done before, but this film shows the danger in a realistic way, that other films have failed to capture before.<br/><br/>When the collisions occur, they are catastrophic. Astronaut Bullock loses her tether and floats off, spinning out of control, into space, alone, and with a finite amount of oxygen.<br/><br/>It has been said that Miss Bullock spent a lot of time preparing for this role. She certainly conveys to us viewers the problems of weightlessness in space. As well as objects hurtling through the void of space, we also get a good representation of the problems of inertia. Propulsion gets you moving in relation to other objects, but how do you stop? There are lots of bone-crunching collisions, attempts to catch and get a hold of objects are all well portrayed. All of this while hurtling through the void of space, orbiting above Earth.<br/><br/>George Clooney is perfect in the supporting role but Sandra Bullock is the real star of this film. The film is clearly a Bullock vehicle but this space vehicle had to be very good. It is. Actress Bullock has been given a tremendous space vehicle. Astronaut Bullock could only wish she had such a space vehicle.<br/><br/>Great as this film is, Sandra Bullock has to carry it, for it to succeed, and carries it, she does, with a truly sublime performance. Miss Bullock has graced the silver-screen for many years now with great performances in rom-coms. Her everyday girlish charms have contributed to some of the greatest examples of the rom-com genre. There has never been any doubt that she can do light, but what about the meatier, more serious, stuff? Earlier this year, Miss Bullock appeared in the surprisingly gritty 'The Heat' female buddy-cop action-comedy. Here though she goes much further, this is her film, a true action film that is exciting, scary and tense. It is a tour-de-force.<br/><br/>Film has some shocks, surprises and twists. It is also tense and emotional. You may find it useful to carry a hanky.<br/><br/>This 91 minute film reminds us of the earlier Warner Brother films of yester-year. From start to finish there is not a single wasted scene.<br/><br/>The harshest of critics of 3D films has said that this film should be viewed in the 3D format. This reviewer followed that advice and was richly rewarded for paying the extra. Some cinemas give out, and collect back in, the 3D glasses. Mine did not. Instead of paying my usual UK¬£7.50p, I paid ¬£9.60p plus another 80p for the glasses. I saw a great film and get to keep my Sandra Bullock 3D glasses for ever! Before the film I endured some poor 3D film previews. They did not look good but rather unreal. No problem with this film though. The 3D effect really helped in immersing into the film. However it was all the little details that made this film. Watch as the smallest of things float about into your vision and grow bigger and bigger as they approach you. Again it is the details of these smallest of things that complete the effect of putting you in space with Miss Bullock. Weightlessness makes everything float about, and boy does it! Knowing that we are not in space, we are so immersed in this film that we feel that we are. Even get into the head of Miss Bullock as the camera gives a POV from inside her helmet! <br/><br/>Be it breathless, or breath-taking, Sandra Bullock delivers a truly, truly, sublime performance. This is film-making at it's very, very, best. This really is a must see 3D, and must see, film. 10/10."
"Frogfisher","9","1","2","11 November 2013"," Beautiful, intense and so very simple
","I like simple ideas and even more so if the results are as simple in it's execution. But to get a truly well done minimalistic result a lot of work goes in to it. Sometimes even more than on more complex projects.<br/><br/>Gravity is simple. Very simple really. Sure there is a storyline. But there are no twists, no surprising external influences on the course of the story. There is a very limited amount of actors and elements we need to relate to. And there is no protagonist. It is as close as you get to a real life drama. <br/><br/>But in it's simplicity it is also extraordinary beautiful. And here it is clear the effort to make it simple is truly complex and monumental. Cuaron is a man known for long shots, swooping camera movements, toying with effects, point of view and other visuals. And it feels like this is what it all leads to. It is perhaps the most beautiful film I have seen in the cinema. It is crisp and truly awesome images we see. Even when everything is chaos and hopelessness sets in the images are beautiful and scary. The effect are just breathtaking.<br/><br/>My favourite scene involves an astronaut seemingly disappearing into darkness set against the Milky Way as a background. It is such a powerful images and full of so darkness and light and infinite space. It is a scary and yet awesome.<br/><br/>Clooney is great, Ed Harris is comforting and Sandra Bullock is at her best. And that is all there need to be said about the cast. That is all there can be said.<br/><br/>The 3rd act does turn into Hollywood film territory as the fight for survival comes to an end. And the turning point is quite clear to me in retrospect. But even during this Cuaron makes the film beautiful and suspenseful. Even if we know the outcome. Almost at the very end the whole cinema literally gasped.<br/><br/>Cuaron has made a breathtaking film using his usual tricks and his sense of visuals. I think this is the film of the year so far. Nothing has come close to the impact this film has had. For me and clearly for a lot of other people. <br/><br/>And watch it in 3D. It really works."

If 2001 was searching for life, this is about survival. with perfect direction, cinematography and a blending background score this movie sure is worth time money and much more. i can't remember much time when i had my hands off my mouth. with flawless acting from Sandra Bullock she sure can be a strong contestant for the next academy awards. a film worthy of best picture too. And Alphonso Cu√†ron could be the best director."

","Gravity comes as a Sci-Fi space saga with some breath taking and stunning visuals purely through extraordinary VFX. The story can broadly join the genre - Survival flicks like Frozen (2010), Cast Away (2000), Wrecked (2010), Life of Pi (2012) etc., But this incredible story takes you to experience space itself if you watch in 3D and feel the calmness, emptiness, point of nothing, pitch black, black hole, silent black valley however you will describe that experience once out of the movie hall. With a very limited but powerful casting the director Alfonso Cuar√≥n has given us a visually magnificent and sumptuous tale of a lady survivor in space. The cast includes Hollywood's well known talents Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as Dr. Ryan stone and Matt Kowalski respectively. George will be there for few minutes and has done the role of a veteran astronaut who is a kind of light hearted person even after facing a divorce. Sandra the show stealer gives us a stunning performance in surviving hardships in space as well as a grieving mother who has lost her daughter recently. Especially her expressions during panic moments and courageous face looks to overcome the tough time she has in space been so real. The entire movie was so well crafted and was technically sound on the space concept side as well. No doubts the entire credits go to the VFX team. Verdict: Enjoy this movie with your family only in theatres with 3D technology and strap your seat belts for outer space experience. Definitely you will come out with lots of questions and discussions regarding space life and NASA. <br/><br/>This year's Oscar best female actress on a lead role Sandra bullock and best Male actor in a lead role Tom Hanks for sure<br/><br/>-Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran (bsiva84@gmail.com)"

","I enjoyed this movie, and so did my girlfriend. I don't know why it received such a high rating? I thought that the new Star Trek, and Star Trek into darkness, we're also excellent movies which deserved higher ratings like this, or gravity deserved to be a little lower to maintain a level of fairness and equilibrium. We also thought the special effects were great in the 3D format All awesome movies, and it comes highly recommended from both of us. (Rated a little higher than I would. She would be closer to 9. I have to say, that I would give Sandra a ten, and her hair a two. In summary. This is a great night out, and we enjoyed it thoroughly."
"RyanNilsen","9","1","2","5 November 2013"," Visually stunning and absolutely breath-taking!
","""Can't beat the view"" astronaut Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney says and he's right. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Harry Potter 3), Gravity is about two astronauts, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski, who are servicing the Hubble Space Telescope, until debris from a Russian missile strike on a nearby inoperative satellite causes them to abort the mission. However, the debris practically destroys the space shuttle knocking out all communications with mission control and sending Stone and Kowalski spiraling into space with nothing but a tether holding the two of them together! This results in the two astronauts to struggle for survival with nothing but each other in what is one of the scariest and most dangerous situations ever. <br/><br/>Again, ""Can't beat the view"". The visual effects in Gravity are GORGEOUS! Some of the best effects I have ever seen in all of film. Its one thing to have incredible effects in a movie, but its another to have them immerse you in the story! That is what Gravity does. You feel as though you are in space with these guys and are struggling with them. At one point when both Stone and Kowalski are low on oxygen I found myself inhaling the same time they were. This film is breath-taking. I have no idea how this movie was made. Opening with a 12-minute long, one cut sequence of the camera just floating around seems unbelievable. Not to mention the attention to detail with everything floating is very impressive. The one criticism I have for this movie is the script because at times it seemed some things Clooney's character was saying seemed unrealistic, but the writing and dialogue is not what you look for in a movie like this. This movie is an experience and one of the coolest I have ever had in a theater. Which brings me to my next point, SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS. Do not wait 6 and a half months for ""netflix"" or ""redbox"" or whatever you do, see it in theaters. This movie was not meant to be watched on a little phone in a subway. Even though the entire movie is just with two people, you never get bored and you will be on the edge of your seat. Clooney gives a solid performance and Bullock gives her best performance since The Blind Side."

","I thought that this movie was great.. Amazing graphics and storyline.. Good for those who enjoy a good movie.. It is a slow moving kind of movie but when the action begins it is intense.. I did go with my partner and he didn't enjoy it very much so I'm guessing its up to the viewer really.. Ideal for anyone who lives Sandra bullock and George Clooney.. Those two make a great duo in this movie.. very glad my partner and I had the spur of the moment to go and watch this movie.. I wouldn't say great for all ages but it wouldn't hurt bring your child along.. (in my opinion) It didn't just drag on wither which was a good thing.. Always had something happening"
"justarandomoviefan","9","1","2","2 November 2013"," Fine movie -- would have rated 10 but for music at end.
","I thoroughly enjoyed Gravity -- saw the 3D version -- but for the overbearing music at the ending. Sandra Bullock's character finally returns to earth, survives reentry, splashes down, swims to shore, crawls onto a sandy beach, and then -- comes a very loud orchestral and vocal score with this soaring, supposedly inspirational and triumphal music. Too much -- I get the fact that her survival has been miraculous and that she must feel wonderful having survived, but for me, simple nature sounds would have been enough. Skip the orchestra, please. I thought the 3D effects were effective, especially those that featured all sorts of articles floating around the cabins of the various spacecraft that Bullock visited. Where was the Velcro when the crew needed it? All in all, a very enjoyable movie."
"pc95","9","1","2","2 November 2013"," Best of 2013
","Watched ""Gravity"" tonight, directed by Alfons Cuaron, and will admit I loved the movie. I am on the whole a harsh critic on movies, having watched so many, and am happy to report this movie assumes my vote for best in-theater watch visually since ""Avatar"". Also on sheer entertainment value it also beats out ""Mud"" this year for best picture. The visuals are so well done that you could've put in amateur actors in the movie and it still would've been good, however, Bullock and Clooney certainly enhance the experience, and are excellent. (major spoilers) Perhaps most enjoyable for me was Bullock's characters hallucination or vision sequence that clearly took some of audience for a ride. Momentous visuals, and gives a feeling of the vastness of space and the insignificance of earth's size compared to space. Lastly, just great, simple suspense and superb music. 9/10"
"bpatrick-8","Null","1","2","27 October 2013"," It's really Sandra Bullock's show
","I know--George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are billed as co-stars, and somehow one expects--from Hollywood clich√©s--them to develop some kind of romantic relationship as they are trapped in space following the destruction, on the part of the Russians' blowing up a satellite, of their space shuttle. It doesn't happen; Clooney keeps telling the undertrained-for-the-mission Bullock things to do, which she doesn't. Eventually they have to untether themselves, with Clooney drifting off to his death. Bullock then has to make it to a Russian skylab, then a Chinese one, and it's remarkable how she works the buttons on the control panels on each, considering that the labels are in the native tongues, not in English.<br/><br/>Then there's the issue of her keeping her sanity: laughing at some Chinese program she picks up on her two-way communication, talking to herself and trying--still--to get a grip on the death of her young daughter.<br/><br/>You can't but feel the helplessness of two people stranded several hundred miles (distances are given in metric in most cases) above Earth, the rest of the space-shuttle crew wiped out, and two--then one--person trying to get to a vehicle which will take her home--with no one, not even ground control in Houston--to help. Does she make it back? You'll have to see the movie.<br/><br/>This movie kept everyone in the theater where I saw it completely riveted. And I, too, will not be surprised if Sandra Bullock gets Best Actress in the 2014 Oscars. It's her movie--not Clooney's."

"dunelop","7","1","2","17 October 2013"," Some Sci-Fi, Some Action, Some Drama, Average Script, Average Acting = about a 7/10
","I like sci-fi, do you? then you may likeee this movie<br/><br/>*but* it's no documentary (i.e. don't expect to learn anything new or cool that you didn't already know or assume). Double I.E. - whatever you've ever hoped to be portrayed in floating-in-space movies you've already seen in movies like Apollo 13 and Armageddon.<br/><br/>I like action, do you? well, this movie has some, i.e. a little, like 4/10 worth quantity-wise, but it's like 8/10 largely due to the nice visuals, animation-graphics/cgi/rotoscoping/whatever-you-call-it. If you like to play video games like me you may like the occasional moments of being suspended in space and wondering which buttons one might push to reorient yourself, while avoiding debris at the same time.<br/><br/>I like drama, do you? this movie could just barely qualify for drama, though it's no save-the-world Armageddon, or Downtown Abbey, or whatever you please. I did tear up in parts near the end, but i do that moreso than most others do generally anyways, i presume. I tear up too when the trumpets blow during starting-television coverage of breakfast at Wimbledon each year, if you know what i mean.<br/><br/>What fails most about this movie is the blatant use of two of the worst and most-gratuitously used emotional tugs of all time, the same-old never-ending clich√©' oft-used in movies about ""Ditzy girl gets chased, falls down, shoe comes off (or heel breaks)', barely makes it out"" routine, and the man needlessly sacrifices self for woman routine. I found myself angry at the film about 5 to 10 minutes in when i realized that that was the direction they were taking it with the S.Bullock character. And then i more or less had to give-up completely on the reality-aspect and emotionally-involved aspects of the film with the purposefully and needlessly gratuitous hangin'-by-a-thread/throw-me-a- line use-of-death routine. (Literally). I have no problem with total carnage, ala Saving Private Ryan, or everyone lives, ala The Lord of The Rings, but gratuitous use of men stepping on grenades so that some ditz- girl can go the distance is bound to turn off much of the population, both male and female.<br/><br/>Like i said in the subject line, about a 7/10. IMDb says budget was 100mil - i guess i can see that, and you can too just by looking at the long list of animators used on this film on IMDb's credit-page for this movie. I'm glad i saw it; i wouldn't say it wasn't worth the money, as it at-least adds to the cannon of sci-fi movies i've seen over the years, but i doubt it rises to the level of water-cooler talk that a Apollo-13 did, nor should it. I suppose it's OK, in-a-way, to see a director or script-writer try to make a minimalist movie that largely revolves around 2 characters, as that tactic is seldom used, and for that the director could receive some credit, however, if he'd wanted to, he could have elongated the introduction and the conclusion just a bit, though what he had worked in a get-to-the-point and let-the-viewers'- imagination-decides-what-happens-next sort of ways. I can't really comment too much on the acting, since these are your typical, typecast, big-budget actors doing big-budget roles, and sadly, they seemingly took stereotypical scripts that involved the aforesaid helpless-girl/chivalrous-guy routines.<br/><br/>Don't expect to learn anything, but be impressed with the visuals, much like you might for a Transformers, or really any modern movie that now uses cool-unknown effects from the minds of all sorts of background contributing artists. Whoever is responsible for some of the scenes and/or camera work involving the destructive-chaos and debris-mayhem, what with the dangerous fly-bys and rotating camera views, deserves some props for viewing-angle-choreography.<br/><br/>Last word, i almost forgot... yeah i partly went to see if because i was wondering if it was at all based on reality, which it is obviously not. There's no Apollo 13, true-to-life history to be had here. It's all fiction. And lastly, there were a couple brief shots of S.Bullock trying to make her look like the Tomb Raider girl (if you know what i mean), albeit in an A Space Odyssey fetalesqe position, it's just too bad they had to use a B-rated, KeanuReevesish/MatthewMacConaughy type actress to do it. I would of rather wished she either puked or crapped her pants at some point, or just gone all-out hysterical, as no doubt many of us would, or at least let out some primal-scream of victory at the end, not the emotional mediocrity we were given. Washed-up-on-the- beach yes, but Lost it is not.<br/><br/>Oh, and also (last last word), the other reason you may decide to see it is because of the title character, Clooney. i admit his bearded-pieces in recent years have given me more hope that he, too, may rise from B- actor, kevin-costner-like movie-qualities, even though his bearded characters still had a one-dimensional, or overly violent quality to them. Sadly, it seems he has taken a minor step back in this role, though due partly to the script/script-choice, as his character is whittled down from main-draw marketing, to passe'-narrator, repeating for 1/2 an hour what we were all already thinking (relax, breathe, calm- down, relax, calm-down, breathe, relax, breathe, calm-down, etc. etc.)."
"Hellmant","8","1","2","11 October 2013"," I didn't think it was that good!
","'GRAVITY': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>This sci-fi 'man vs. nature' disaster film has already won over critics and audiences alike (in the first week of it's theatrical release) and is now considered the frontrunner to win 'Best Picture' at this year's Oscars (which would make it the first science fiction film to ever do so). It's directed by acclaimed Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (who also helmed such critically loved films as 2006's 'CHILDREN OF MEN', 2004's 'HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN' and 2001's 'Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN'). He co-wrote the film with his son Jonas, which is about two astronauts lost in space while struggling to survive the elements and make it home alive. The film stars just two actors: Sandra Bullock and George Clooney (along with the voice talents of Ed Harris, who has appeared in other classic space films like 'APOLLO 13' and 'THE RIGHT STUFF', and a few others). Bullock does give a very impressive performance and Cuaron's direction is once again topnotch but it's the 3D visuals that really make this film a one-of-a-kind experience.<br/><br/>Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first mission in space. Clooney plays Matt Kowalski, the commanding astronaut of the flight on his last space mission before retiring. They're on a routine spacewalk attempting a tune-up of the Hubble Space Telescope when debris (from the destruction of a Russian satellite) comes hurdling their way. The debris damage their shuttle beyond repair and kills the rest of their crew, leaving Stone and Kowalski adrift in space tethered just to each other. Communications with Mission Control are completely lost as the two attempt to make their way to the International Space Station near by.<br/><br/>The film has been praised by my favorite filmmakers James Cameron (who received a 'special thanks' credit at the end of the movie, along with some of my other favorite directors like David Fincher and Guillermo del Toro) and Quentin Tarantino. Cameron called it ""the best space film ever done""! It's also been praised by real life astronaut legend Buzz Aldrin and almost every film critic. It's guaranteed to get multiple Oscar nominations and (like I said) is now predicted to take home the top prize. I didn't think it was that good. I enjoyed the movie but didn't find it to be one of the very best of the year. Technically it's a flawless masterpiece and the 3D is amazing but it's not as visually striking (or nearly as good a film) as Cameron's own 'AVATAR'. Bullock does give one of the better performances of the year playing a character that's similar to another classic sci-fi heroine: Ellen Ripley (in vulnerability and resilient strength) and the 'man vs. nature' storyline is always a compelling one but this movie mainly works as a beautiful visual feast and little more. Does it deserve to win best picture and all the critical praise it's been getting? No... but it is definitely still worth seeing for the scenery alone.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4"
"cultfilmfan","10","1","2","21 October 2013"," Gravity
","Originally going into Gravity, if I have to be honest about it, I was not quite sure what to expect and my expectations were not all that high. Seeing the early trailers for the film made me a bit concerned that the film would either be incredibly boring and just another long line of excuses in using this 3D technology for effects and what not, or that the film would be kind of like the summer spectacle films released that have big star power boasting it as well as a lot of special effects and action scenes and quite frankly I was not interested in seeing a movie like what I just described. On the other hand there were tons of reviews by critics and users online calling it one of the best films of the year and some calling it one of the best science fiction films of all time. The great reviews did peak my interest a little bit and I finally gave in and went to see Gravity. My thoughts? Overall, pretty impressed. The film was not boring, or self indulgent with special effects as I had worried that it may be and also it was not action scene after action scene with endless and ridiculous special effects either. What, I got instead was a more quiet and subtle film, but nonetheless one that packs an emotional punch. To either compliment, or ridicule the special effects and visuals of the film, would not be right seeing as I opted out of seeing the film in 3D and instead just saw a regular projection booth version of the film. While some of the cinematography and visuals were impressive, I think they would have even been more so in 3D and that is where a lot of praise from critics and online reviewers are coming from, so seeing as I did not see it in that medium, I will stay out of that debate and just say that what I did see was impressive, but that with most films like that, that it was neither here, nor there for me and the effects neither added anything, nor took anything away from my viewing experience either. Gravity, is above all a film about survival. I will not go into any more details than that, so you can enjoy this spoiler free review and discover the film on your own if you decide to do so. The film has a shorter running time and while sometimes I like films to have a bit of a longer running time to add more character and depth to said films, I personally found that keeping Gravity, at the length that they did was not only a good decision, but one that suits the film perfectly as well. Everything you could want was put into the 90 minutes of this film. You had really good character study as well as interesting storytelling and an added emotional content that I felt really helped create mood and both empathy and fascination in watching the characters as well. There were times, especially in the beginning of the film, where it got quite tense and I could feel myself going with the film into those emotions and feeling the type of dread and fear that these two characters are feeling. It wasn't the most pleasant feeling in the world, but at the same time I appreciated that the film had an affect on me like that and that what I was watching was connecting to me and myself to it as well. Going through their whole ordeal during the course of this film, I got scared for these characters, cared for them and at times were rooting for them to make the right decisions to save themselves and get to safety. The empathetic and emotional content really added to the overall feeling of the film thanks to some top notch writing and direction as well as the very impressive lead performances of the film. If, I have to be perfectly honest about it, I would have to say that nothing I have seen Sandra Bullock in has ever really wowed, or moved me in any way. That being said, I have not seen a lot of her films because they have never interested me and same with the style of performances she often gives as well. Keep in mind that I never saw the role that gave her the Oscar for The Blind Side. Perhaps if I saw that, I may feel a little bit differently. I have to say however that she completely held her own in this role and gave a terrific performance that is sure to earn her an Oscar nomination next year as well as perhaps the Oscar itself. She shows so much vulnerability and strength in this role, but we can still see how fragile and scared she is inside during the course of the film and how she tries to triumph that is not only interesting to watch because of the writing and directing, but also for her strong performance as well. It completely changed my thoughts on her as an actress and I hope she is allowed and chooses more projects like this where she is allowed to show this great acting range that she has. The film has a slower pace at times, but there is so much both visually and with the characters that you try and take in, that it is never boring and you are always watching with absolute fascination and awe. I credit the filmmakers for not making an action packed film with explosions and special effects and instead giving us a real story that looks real and feels real too. We feel what these characters do and their ordeal through this film is often felt on us the viewers which is not always an easy task to accomplish."
"filmboxonline","10","1","2","21 October 2013"," Tense. Masterful. Stunning.
","The movie begins with a man made craft floating in space; a speck in a vast universe that is yet to be conquered by mankind. This opening shot is around 17 minutes in length and within 02 minutes in to this shot, several people in the theater gasped ""wow"". So did I. This is the most spectacular opening shot I've ever seen in a motion picture and the movie is a visual triumph by all means. If you were a fan of the single shot sequences in Alfonso Cuar√≥n's previous movie ""Children of Men"", then this one will blow your mind.<br/><br/>There has been lot of hype about this movie, and Gravity delivers. I am predicting 03 Academy Award nominations for this already; Best Picture, Best Director and Best Visual Effects with the latter having a high chance of winning. Unlike any other recent science fiction / space movies, Gravity isn't a movie about a parallel universe with advanced technology or concepts. It's a survival story set in space, with one tense moment after another. Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, two A-list heavy weights perhaps suggested by WB studio in case the film needed the star power push considering the bold concept of the film. It works but the true star in Gravity is neither a person nor a living being, but a technical achievement; it's visuals that take you along for a breathless ride. <br/><br/>The argument of whether 3D cinema must exist or not continues, but all it takes for a movie like ""Gravity"" to reminds us that 3D can be spectacular when used by filmmakers with a clear vision. In honesty, watching this in a normal screen would be similar to owning a sports car yet only using it in its first gear. Gravity is tense, moving and even terrifying. Combine that with amazing shots of space, this easily becomes my favorite movie in 2013."
"twilightsparkle1234","5","1","2","19 October 2013"," Great visuals and... that's about it
","Did the movie critics see the same movie I did? Yes, the movie has good photography but it fails at everything else, it tries so hard to be emotional but those attempts just make me cringe every time, it's ridiculous. I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. George Clooney's character is clich√©d and uninteresting, Sandra Bullock's character is annoying, there's almost no story put into the movie and some parts of it are just straight ridiculous (Sandra Bullock floating in fetal position for like 30 seconds, Sandra Bullock pressing buttons like a retard and the barking scene), it's so stupid it's embarrassing, if you want to see a good space movie go watch Ron Howard's Apollo 13."
"ericeast","7","1","2","19 October 2013"," First half better than second half
","Not really a spoiler, but I will put a spoiler warning on here just in case. First half of the movie is excellent, suspenseful and ultra realistic. The second half however goes a bit too far and loses its realism and the suspense takes a hit as a result. The film is most suspenseful when things are in the realm of possibility, but after one too many death defying feats one after the next you begin to realize you are just watching a movie and the suspension of disbelief is destroyed for the more avid/sophisticated viewer. I know, I know, I sound like a total film snob, but I think directors try to do too much to create suspense and they end up having the adverse effect by going a bit overboard."

"edo-landwehr","5","1","2","19 October 2013"," Beautiful visuals, hell of a storyline
","At first I must admit that I am not a big fan of Bullock and Clooney. Because of al the great reviews around I decided to watch this movie in 3D.<br/><br/>The starting scene is visually amazing, it takes about 15 minutes of continuous filming. Somewhat similar of what we have seen in earlier films of guaron. After this scene we soon realize that the storyline has nothing even remotely interesting to offer. <br/><br/>Even if you let aside the credibility of occurring events, there is no character development even present. The only thing we get to know about one of the characters couldn't have been easier. No creativity involved.<br/><br/>The story development and ending is so bad it might as well have been the story of Adam sandlers latest rom-com.<br/><br/>Aside from this really bad storyline, the visuals are unlike anything I have ever seen. Generally I am not to fond of 3D movies because it doesn't add anything to the quality of the movie, but at this movie it really improves everything you see. The amount of attention paid to details in every shot is also amazing. I think you can watch the scenes in the space stations a couple times and still discover new details.<br/><br/>Summing these things up I think it is a big shame that the storyline hasn't been developed more. The characters were very, very thin. Although I can understand why they cast Clooney and Bullock (budget - sponsor wise) I think the movie would have been a lot better with characters with a less Hollywood-feel.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend seeing this movie, but see it in cinema, in 3D. Expect a space documentary, and you'll be amazed by the details and viewpoints."

"aravindia75","5","1","2","19 October 2013"," Great Visuals but a bit too unbelievable for me
","As a lot of hype has been going around about this film I decided to catch it up at a local theatre. I was surprised to see the show was sold out (a rarity these days as many movies run at empty hall or just half full capacity these days). I admit I went with a lot of expectations to watch this movie and after watching overall let down! There are far too many unbelievable situations in this movie which requires a lot of suspension of disbelief, for example in the beginning of the movie the 3 astronauts and crew (inside the spaceship) have to face an avalanche of debris racing towards them at super high speed and though 1 astronaut and the crew get killed the other 2 (clooney and bullock) escape unscathed with no injury. Then Bullock's cable snaps and she goes drifting away at high speed and her oxygen levels are at almost zero levels yet George clooney manages to save her and pull her towards and they both go at high speed towards the Chinese spacestation to which they crash at super high speed and guess what neither of get injured, no fractures, broken ribs hell not a scratch on them! For a movie which has aimed to realistically create space it was too much for me to watch both of the main leads escape unscathed! And this is just the beginning! For the next 1 hour there is one after another of near similar situations like this where the main lead almost gets killed but by fluke or something gets saved and finally she manages to get back to earth where even after crash landing her pod sinks into the bottom of the lake and she manages to somehow escape and come to the surface! I can suspend my disbelief for certain kinds of movies such as fast paced action movies such as those starring James Bond which has unbelievable stunt sequences and the hero escapes without a scratch on him but when I go to watch a movie like Gravity which is hyped to be a very realistic movie taking place in space its hard for me to suspend my disbelief! By the way though Bullock's performance was quite OK (compared to her other films) I personally feel she was a wrong choice for this film! I somehow couldn't accept her as some sort of a woman alone in distress trying to save herself! I feel the original choice for this film Natalie Portman would have been a great choice for this film! She has that innocent look to her face plus has an intellectual look to her as well! To conclude would I recommend this movie? yes if you are the kind who loves fast paced scifi action with lots of near misses kind of situation but if you are the kind who is expecting this to be in the level of say 2001: a space odyssey you might wanna give it a miss!"

","There is no other words to describe this film other than a piece of art. It seems like its only purpose is to deliver an extreme amount of anxiety to the audience as the watch the perilous and beautiful adventure of these unlucky astronauts play out as they become mesmerized by the flawless special effects and the perfection of the editing and directing. The only issue in the film can only be described by giving a SPOLER ALERT. Up until the scene in which Bullock receives a visit from her late friend Clooney, the movie was perfect. But after this confrontation, it took me out f the movie and it became predictable. I knew how perfect the editing was, so when Clooney opens the door to the escape lodge and Sandra just covers her face, it was ridiculous. First of all, what, did Clooney like, swim over to this escape lodge, and when he opened the door are we really supposed to think Sandra would have survived the door opening? I knew that she had to be imagining this, so it took me out of the movie. And I didn' like the way she got this inspiration from her conversation with him in this scene. He barely even said anything that inspirational. It should have been much more emotional, showing a motivation behind the fight for survival by Bullock. It's like she didn't even need to talk to her dead friend to get this inspiration. And I didn't like the end, it seemed a little rushed and forced compared to the large scale factor of drawn out and gorgeous shots in the rest of the film. I don't think she would have been able to just get up and walk away after being in space for so long, it takes months for astronauts to walk after being in space, never mind swimming around up 30 feet of water. Its like after the scene in the escape pod, the rest of the movie seemed rushed. But up until then, it was beautiful to watch, and the intensity could put someone in a nervous sweat. Definitely check this one out, because it is truly magnificent film making. Grade: A- (92)."

","I loved the STUNNING visuals, and I can accept the physics ""goofs"", but what I can't accept is trite symbolism in a movie, especially when they beat you over the head with it, like they did in several scenes in this movie... Come on, the ""Rebirth"" scene in the ISS, with the hose that looks like an umbilicus, really!?!?! Was that necessary to the plot? Speaking of the plot, I loved the flow, but it seemed to me that they pulled up short on the ending, they could have carried out the ending to some kind of closure of events, yet it seemed to me like they cut the ending in an attempt to keep it at the magic 90 minute mark. So much of this movie was done very well, yet they cut corners on many other aspects of the movie, and needlessly so if you ask me.

"alexcomputerkid","8","1","2","17 October 2013"," Gravity is a good film and I guess I wouldn't call it overrated but you might say it's something of an unfinished movie.
","In this day and age, when it comes to films about space, there are some very different kind of films. On one end, there are truly low budget horror films like Jason X , Critters 4 and Leprechaun 4: In Space. There are also some decent small, indie films about space like the popular 2009 Moon and Europa Report from 2013.<br/><br/>That said, Gravity breaks all traditions regarding space films. Gravity has a well known director in Alfonso Cuaron, two big name actors, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in the leads and is trying very hard to appeal to a mainstream audience. When you put it all together, Gravity is one solid space movie but not perfect.<br/><br/>With the exception of the very last scene, space is the setting as we follow medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney ). During a standard spacewalk to the Hubble Space Telescope, the crew learn from Mission Control in Houston that debris is drifting towards them from a dead satellite destroyed by the Russians. As the debris damages the Shuttle and eventually disengages them from the ship, Ryan and Matt find themselves stranded in space with no communication with earth and oxygen running low.<br/><br/>I do not know why big name actors were needed in this film. Some of the small space films I mentioned earlier were just fine without a big name cast and in some ways very popular actors can be a distraction to an original film with the interesting subject like space. None the less, these leads are accountable, and do some very fine acting with some well established characters. Ryan is kind of a loner with a rough past and has lost a young child and is still very much recovering from that and trying to find herself. Ryan's lost daughter is her main source of motivation and support for her. The leads do have some chemistry and both are quite likable and this is good.<br/><br/>The plot is not complex and very simple and this lends itself to a short running time for this movie. One main focus of this movie is to simply show space. Through excellent design and cinematography, it makes space look spectacular and strangely claustrophobic and it really stands out. There are some highlights to the plot but it is still too thin. At times, I felt a little bored and it felt like there just was not enough to this movie. If there was just a little more to it, this film could have been something else.<br/><br/>As credits roll, one question I had was, ""What is the meaning of the film?"". Frankly, there doesn't seem to be one. Without it, you could question why should I care about this. The film doesn't even touch this. Why not? It's a beautiful movie but so what? Gravity is a good film and I guess I wouldn't call it overrated but you might say it's something of an unfinished movie. That said, this is a film that will be most important more on a second or third viewing"

She copes with this burden beautifully.<br/><br/>What more can I say? It compares favorably with 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of isolation and space (Ryan Stone and deadly space debris storms as compared to David Bowman and HAL). A similar feel exists here.<br/><br/>It was a very memorable night out indeed for me."

"Vikram19867","10","1","2","15 October 2013"," A magnificent vivid portrayal of the perils in a world without gravity
","I walked into 'Gravity' with high hopes, and it delivered. The only previous work by the director I'm familiar with is 'Great expectations', which is a movie which will stay with me forever, being a mature and coming-of-age piece of cinema for me.<br/><br/>Gravity however, is futuristic, captivating, and a thrilling ride of a film, delving into a dimension and accomplishing successfully what only greats like Stanley Kubrick did with 2001 A space odyssey, Ron Howard with the masterful Apollo 13 and and Ridley Scott with Alien.<br/><br/>There is a tension in space, a fear of the unknown, which only few artists have encapsulated in their works over the years. It is not just about protagonists battling antagonists, but the triumph of one over oneself, braving odds and emerging champion.<br/><br/>Gravity's story develops well, as it explains how Russians have the right to dispensation of defunct spy satellites. One such missile strike chains a reaction of destruction of existing satellites, imperilling the lives of astronauts with debris hurled at them at high speeds revolving in orbit.<br/><br/>Sandra bullock outshines in her performance as a doctor on a space mission gone defective, as she drifts, marooned, confronting and overcoming unending space hazards. Her emotional turmoil is captured in astounding manner, and one which propels the movie. George clooney's performance is an excellent one, delivering comic timing and uplifting the mood of the film, empowering Sandra bullock, and ensuring she survives the trauma and perils of the space catastrophe, all on her own.<br/><br/>Some facts, satellite details and their use (Russian and Chinese orbiters) might be scientifically arguable, but it's certainly not a shot in the dark. If not delved into in detail, one would say the technical aspects and display/use of equipments is credible.<br/><br/>Gravity is one of the best movies of 2013, and one of my favorites alongside Elysium, Oblivion and Pacific Rim. It is an very real and terrifying vision of survival in a world void of gravity. It has been critically acclaimed and rightly so. Highly recommended. Don't miss out."

","With the high reviews and large box office showing for the movie Gravity, I was really looking forward to it. I have always garnered an interest in space and this unknown frontier is a brave new world. I did see the movie in 2D, not 3D, but I believe that a good story is a good story no matter what format it is presented. It s about when the space shuttle is hit with space trash, debris and then thing run amuck. The two surviving astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) struggle to make it to an old abandoned Russian space station. With lots of heavy breathing and intense accompanied music, these scenes of a close death are built up. Sandra Bullock looks amazing and she plays her usual nervous, unsure character. Lacking where her usual snort laugh and giggle.

","This film is definitely one of the most stunning films ever to reach the silver screen. Both the technicality and simplicity of the shots allows the viewer to fall straight into the film. However, this experience was short lived. I don't know if it was the director's fault or the audience. Perhaps you would witness this when you watch the film in the cinemas.<br/><br/>The plot takes us from one crises moment to another, in a very entertaining fashion. You will find yourself in certain instances, holding your breath. But when this dramatic device became more affective, especially towards the end, something happened...<br/><br/>...The audience laughed... collectively.<br/><br/>This did ruin the story's climax, but I also understand what had pushed the audience to this unexpected reaction. I know I'm speaking with a sense of ambiguity, however you will know what I mean when you witness the film's resolution. I found myself asking then, did they laugh because the journey was becoming too superficial and contrived? Or was the audience unable to bear the series of bad luck, that tipped them in a domino effect of relief to... laugh it off? In my honest opinion, I think the director should have been more careful with the final hurdle. It ruined the cinematic experience as the film can't be viewed in any other way.<br/><br/>Rounding up, watch the movie. Is it worth your money? Absolutely."

","The preview trailer for this film grabbed me immediately, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Alfonso Cuar√≥n (A Little Princess, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men) and Harry Potter producer David Heyman, the critics were all raving, giving positive reviews, and Jonathan Ross said that it should definitely be seen on the biggest screen in Britain, the Odeon BFI IMAX in London, in 3D, so that's exactly what I did. Basically from the Space Shuttle ""Explorer"" a small crew of astronauts are making repairs to the Hubble Space Telescope, commanding the mission is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) on his final expedition, and on her first journey into space is Mission Specialist and bio-medical engineer Ryan Stone (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sandra Bullock). Everything is calm as the astronauts work, but then the voice of Mission Control (Ed Harris) warns them a missile strike by the Russians has occurred on a defunct satellite near their location, a chain reaction has caused debris to scatter and is speeding towards them, they must abort the mission before it reaches them. Communication with Mission Control is lost, but the astronauts continue to transmit hoping to be heard, the debris strikes and causes destruction, in panic Stone is forced to detach herself from the shuttle, leaving her drifting alone in space, with only her suit keeping her alive, and she is scared as her oxygen level is low. Eventually Kowalski responds to her call for help, locates her, and they make their way back to the damaged shuttle, it is unusable and the rest of the crew are dead, the only option is to use the thruster pack to travel to the nearby International Space Station (ISS), at least a ninety minute journey before debris threatens them again. En route Kowalski asks about Stone's life back on Earth, she tells the sad story about the death of her young daughter, they reach the damaged but still operational space station, the crew evacuated and the parachute from the other capsule has accidentally deployed, it cannot be used to return to Earth, Kowalski suggests they use remaining equipment to travel to the nearby Chinese space station ""Tiangong"" and use a module to return home. Another problem occurs when Stone's leg gets tangled in the parachute cords, the thruster pack has no power so if she keeps hold of Kowalski they drift into space together, so even with her protesting he detaches himself, as he goes into the distance he stays on the radio to give her instructions and further encouragement, as she runs low on oxygen and tries to make it into the ISS airlock. Inside Stone settles and gets things ready to journey to the next space station, but a fire ignites and forces her to enter the Soyuz and escape, before the capsule can travel she goes back out to release the parachute cords, debris hits again, she is in time before it destroys the station, and she aligns her craft to reach the Chinese station not too far away. However the craft thrusters are out of action, using the radio she only manages to communicate with a fisherman with a baby, Stone is sure that she will die, so turns off the oxygen supply to die a painless death in space, becoming unconscious Kowalski appears outside and enters the capsule, he is annoyed she is giving up and suggests using the landing rockets to travel. She wakes up realising the appearance of Kowalski was a hallucination, but she is determined to live on, she restores the oxygen supply and navigates to the Tiangong with the landing rockets, she is unable to dock, so she uses the decompression force and a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster pack to travel to the Chinese space station, once boarded she finds it empty, but also its trajectory knocked by the debris, and it is falling out of orbit. So she enters the escape capsule, as the ship is breaking up with it re-entering the Earth's atmosphere, Mission Control communicates with her and has can locate her position, and following the heat of the atmosphere the parachute is deployed, the craft lands in a lake, but an electrical fire starting means she has to evacuate immediately, opening the hatch water sinks the capsule, she sheds her suit and swims to the surface, she rests for a moment on the shore, and takes her first shaky steps in the full gravity of Earth. Also starring Orto Ignatiussen as Aningaaq, Amy Warren as Explorer Captain and EastEnders' Phaldut Sharma as Shariff. Bullock gives a graceful, amiable and suitably desperate performance as the talented scientist on her first mission into space, and Clooney is charming, jokey and decisive in his scenes, the direction by Cuar√≥n is swish and polished with this mix of Speed style tension action and 2001: A Space Odyssey with the scale and spectacular effects and sounds of space. With the cool and stylish use of three-dimensional effects, the feeling of claustrophobia inside spacesuits and small capsules, and the combinations of fantasy, humanity and the fight for survival, there is no doubt that this will enthrall and immerse you into the action, it truly is one of the best 3D and space films in years that deserves accolades, a great science-fiction thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Steven Price, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score.

The purely generated images of the vast abyss of space, a cusp of Earth's surface and a gleaming sun astronomically farther away in the background is spectacularly beautiful (and I didn't see this in IMAX...).

These factors led me to be unable to suspend disbelief and truly immerse myself in the story nor become invested in the main character's survival. Further, the plot is tired and worn out. Several movies of a similar plot precede Gravity - which is basically a disaster survival story in space (most notably 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13, among others).<br/><br/>I can't help but imagine the executives at Warner Bros. and how this film came to be: We need a hit film, a huge money maker, but something new, fresh!

","There are a lot of people who are angry about the film based on judging it for NASA realism. I'm afraid the average person doesn't have the background to judge the more science oriented mistakes in the movie. Quite frankly I don't care about that because I go to see a movie to be entertained and not really look for the realism unless it is a re-enacted story and this was not. I think the movie is very miscast. I found this movie boring. I hate to say it was predictable but it was but not clich√©. People have to quit throwing around that word when they review and also quit comparing it to other movies especially 2001: A Space Odyssey which was one of the most boring space movies I ever watched. The focus of the movie was not realism but how this character with little preparation managed to survive. What would go on in your head being essentially marooned in space. Clooney's character seemed to be a token part because of who he is in my opinion. He was his usual charming self but he didn't add much to the movie. I have heard raves about this movie but I don't know why and then there are others panned that were so much better and people simply didn't go to see. My bottom line is entertainment and this didn't entertain me. The ending was bad and I was disappointed. I could take all the rest if there had been some big ending but there wasn't. She got down and was somewhere but I saw no rescue in near sight. I give it a 4 for effort but if you are expecting some big payoff you won't get it.

How did Clooney and Bullock get so caught up in this thing. Speaking of which, ""The Thing"", now that was an intriguing and entertaining Sci-Fi back in its day. I'm referring to the original. I was mostly disappointed by Bullock. Her expressions and reactions seemed lifeless and unrealistic to what was happening. And they start out the ""movie"" stating how in space you hear nothing......and all through the movie there was this annoying sound track. I just didn't get it! So they need some music. But there were many segments where silence would have been so much more effective and less annoying. That's about 86 minutes I will never get back. No, I didn't watch the credits either. All that hype! I am rarely compelled to consider writing a review. I like most movies I've seen. Some, I see multiple times or buy the DVD. This one just irritated me with all the phoney antics.

I guess George Clooney added his winning smile and another big name on the marquis. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it had a few sequences decent action. All things considered, though, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except for 13-year-old girls who are hardcore fans of both ""Armageddon"" and Sandra Bullock."

","The advertisement of this movie was quite promising. This movie lacks logic and reality. I know that this is a science fiction film, but the main plot is absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>At first, i thought that only the first five minutes of this movie is a complete fail, but the rest is not any better. The movie is boring, to say the least. The development of the main character is weak and rough.<br/><br/>I have to admit, that the special effects and the view (space and Earth) is really amazing, but this is IT! The movie is not worth to see again. I think it will fade away in the whole cinematography and no one will remember it, until someone make another one (complete remake).<br/><br/>Movie is nothing special, really.

","A weak, whiny, female astronaut (Sandra Bullock) survives preposterous events in low Earth orbit - approximately 220 miles (354 km) above earth - after the International Space Station is destroyed. Her colleague, played by George Clooney, disappears mid-story.<br/><br/>This has got to be the dumbest movie ever made. There is SO much information available on the Internet and at local libraries to study space, view actual footage of the ISS and it's astronauts as they go about their daily business, and info/video as to how those astronauts work outside the ISS. Because there is so much information available, why should we suspend our disbelief and watch unrealistic crap? We should not. When we do, writers and directors like Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron, and Warner Brothers get away with dumbing their audiences down. <br/><br/>In addition, there are very few good roles for women in Hollywood because Hollywood is notorious for keeping women writer / directors off the set. Why then would Sandra Bullock even consider the role of a weak, whiny astronaut? Ms. Bullock should be ashamed of herself. <br/><br/>The CGI? Forget it. It isn't that great. If you want to see spectacular low earth orbit shots of space and the earth, view the real thing taken by our astronauts. There are ""artistic"" shots of Ms. Bullock's reflection in several windows, and her slowly turning around like an arthritic circus performer. (The shot looks fake.) The DP stays on these shots too long making them tedious, then boring. Also, these shots exist only to counterbalance Ms. Bullock's incessant talking to herself.<br/><br/>The script? It needed a polish. For example, while outside the ISS, George Clooney's character asks Bullock's character if she has a family. One would think that after spending several months with Bullock's character aboard the ISS, he would already know if she had a family or not. <br/><br/>Gravity is a big waste of time. Skip it and watch Alien if you like to suspend your disbelief, like strong female characters, and enjoy cinematography that intensifies the story and its characters."
"donieose","10","2","7","5 June 2014"," Gravity (Originally on TFR Online)
","Following the release of 2009's Avatar, the phrase ""game-changer"" was oft used to describe the film. Now, with the release of Alfonso Cu√†ron's Gravity, the ""game"" hasn't just been changed, it's been turned on its head in the best way possible. Cu√†ron has not only raised the bar for science- fiction (or rather science-fact) films with Gravity, but for all other films too.<br/><br/>Directed by Cuar√≥n, whose previous credits include Children of Men and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (arguably the best film of the series), Gravity tells the tale of astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who are cast adrift in space after a catastrophic incident destroys their shuttle, and their only means of returning home¬Ö What follows are the most tense and exhilarating 90 minutes of film you're ever likely to experience.<br/><br/>The plot itself is fiendishly simple, and all the better for it. Title cards provide us with all the information we need to know, most especially these simple five words: ""Life in space is impossible"". To say that the film is ""science-fiction"" is a bit misleading, as the story is so heavily grounded in the world of ""science-fact"". Much of the tension and fear inspired by the film arises from the fact that it is so concerned with realism. Gravity doesn't concern itself too much with weighty philosophical issues, instead, it posits the simple question of what does it mean to be alone in the universe? Human contact means everything in this film, whether it be verbal (communication between the two astronauts, or Houston) or physical (Stone and Kowalski reaching desperately for each other's hands). ""Don't let go"", reads the film's ingenious tagline, and it serves as the film's literal and figurative maxim throughout.<br/><br/>Ryan Stone (Bullock) is a welcome new addition to the pantheon of sci-fi heroines; at once vulnerable, stoic, resourceful, and ingenious. Having deigned herself to a life of loneliness after suffering a tragedy back on Earth, it is only in her moments of utter despair that her vulnerability shines through. Though she insists that she has nothing to go back to, her will to live serves as a parable for the human condition. This is not a film about avoiding death, it is a film about life and living, birth, and rebirth; all so evident in the scenes in which Stone and Kowalski are tethered together with an ""umbilical"", or Stone curling into the foetal position in zero g. As expected, Kowalski (Clooney) makes an excellent, amicable everyman; he serves as the opposite side of the coin to Stone, savouring the sunrise over the Ganges despite the perilous situation he finds himself in. He too, like Stone, has suffered a tragedy back on Earth, though not as severe as Stone's.<br/><br/>The story itself is so gripping that it's only afterwards that you realise the ingenuity, and astonishing amount of skill that went into the camera-work. Long-takes abound, and the spectacular opening take clocks in at the 17 minute mark, without a single cut. The camera weaves beautifully from within a character's helmet, to the abyss of space outside, seamlessly. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who previously worked with Cu√†ron on Children of Men has truly outdone himself with this film. With no solid plane from which to work, he shows a mastery of visual choreography never before seen, made all the more astounding when you consider that 99% of the film is set in Zero G. Gravity also has the honour of being one of the few movies best enjoyed in 3D. It adds to the story, rather than detract from it. It is employed masterfully by Cuar√≥n, and it never feels gimmicky, or unnecessary. The scenes set within various structures feel appropriately claustrophobic; those set without feel as vastly expansive as space itself. The visuals too are absolutely breathtaking, and the CGI is so seamless and photorealistic that you never stop to think twice about it, you simply accept it as reality.<br/><br/>With Gravity, Cu√†ron and co. have brought something truly special to the world. The entire film operates as smoothly as well-oiled machine, and it's near impossible to truly find fault with it, as every facet lives up to the hype. The film is one of the few that actually lives up to the rabid hype surrounding it, and you will not be disappointed leaving the cinema after it (though you may want to take a few minutes to catch your breath and readjust to solid ground). For this reviewer Gravity provided an unparalleled, immersive, thrilling, and enchanting cinematic experience like no other. Go see it, as soon as you can, on the biggest screen possible. You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Originally at http://tfronline.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/review-gravity/"
"tuhin94","9","2","7","16 May 2014"," Hollywood made a realistic and plausible space movie!
","Believe the hype and the accolades. Just do it. They are all so well deserved for this movie. Those 1- and 2-star reviews? Ignore them. The reviewers probably had no idea what they were watching. <br/><br/>At first, I was a bit concerned about the relatively short runtime of only 90 minutes. However, while watching the movie, I realized the number was irrelevant. This is mainly because of how each scene in the movie lasts multiple minutes and only one camera angle is used for the duration of the scene. While in almost every other film, a camera switch between characters goes unnoticed, it is pretty obvious when it takes place here (NOTE: not a criticism; simply an observation). <br/><br/>While not perfectly adherent to the laws of physics, Gravity takes the idea of realism in movies to a level being demanded for decades. The most important point here is the sound mixing. It was utterly brilliant. There was a great mix between no sound and dampened sound while out in space, just as reality demands it to be. But, as soon as Stone is back in an environment with air (like the ships and Earth), the sound is all back. It is done properly and I love that. I say that it was not perfect because of the scene where Stone has to untether from Kowalski: his momentum would not have kept tension in the tether perpetually and Stone would have been easily been able to pull him back after the initial full stretch. <br/><br/>Truly enjoyable and quite heart-pounding, especially with the first person camera angles. Hollywood needs to take note for every future space movie. Watched 05/06/2014, written 05/16/2014."
"adwright100-31-166862","10","2","7","4 May 2014"," Totally Breathtaking Cinema
","Gravity (2013) directed by Alfonso Cuaron ""Life in space is impossible.""<br/><br/>That's how it opens, this quote and darkness and then we're sunning up to the majestic slow- turning orb of the Earth rising up and out of us as if the screen has suddenly become a window on an alien and dangerous environment. We can already hear the crackled voice of George Clooney and other astronauts and the pinprick of white against the endless dark soon resolves itself into a space shuttle. This is a stella film not because of the stomach-wrenching effects - in Imax cinemas people were suffering vertigo - and not because of the massive screen stars that are Clooney and Bullock. This is such a powerful story because it understands its own theme and reverberates to it through every act.<br/><br/>""Life in space is impossible."" And we are fools to try, we are puny, pathetic, childish gods who think we can buck nature and the enormity of space humbles us utterly. The effects are seamless, so seamless that we don't notice them although 81 of the 90 minutes have been created digitally by the British company Framestore. It is the story here that trumps all technical brilliance and there's that commodity in spades. Sandra Bullock is excellent and it is the puniness of her one human life held up against the immense, indifferent cold of space that begins to turn that opening theme into its antithesis. Life in space is impossible, but life for Dr Ryan Stone on Earth has been impossible too. Her daughter died in a freak fall before the age of five and she is lonely, grieving and lost. Her marriage broke apart and she fell into her work. Now lost in space after a cataclysmic event destroys her shuttle she must try to make it to the International Space Station to find a way back to Earth.<br/><br/>Space is silent, space is pure action and reaction and we get some beautiful experiences of the Newtonian mechanics of colliding objects as the the swarm of deadly shrapnel that destroyed the shuttle orbits the Earth again and again lacerating Stone's other chances of survival. <br/><br/>Life in space is impossible yes, but Stone survives against the odds, giddy from lack of oxygen, giddy on still being alive and locked in the capsule of the space station Clooney manages to get her to before he bows out, she spins in the foetal position truly alive perhaps for the first time in years.<br/><br/>This is transformative, incredible cinema, adventure, drama and deadly beauty in such a breath- taking package you'll need to take travel sickness pills. Of course it's had all of the plaudits and Oscars and sparkling reviews, a virtually unheard of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes for example. <br/><br/>But the reviews are all true, space without the terror and stomach-churn of going there and what is so poignant and clever is that out there in a place where life is impossible we discover that no of it matters, the politics, the petty nonsense and that what we have, our mortal, puny lives is the single most unifying thing that binds us. Life is possible here and only here. Gravity pulls us to our home, gravity holds us here and within its thrall we have the glorious opportunity to truly appreciate what a wonder being here at all is.<br/><br/>You need to see this film, ideally at the cinema, if you can bear it, at an Imax. Probably best not buy popcorn in the foyer though.<br/><br/>***** Five stars"
"elaine159","9","2","7","2 May 2014"," Gravity...Good movie by my book
","The movie Gravity got many mixed reviews. I am not the kind of person who is normally into Sci-fi movies, however this movie definitely caught my attention. Just watching the first few minutes of Sandra Bullock spinning in space made me have a little anxiety attach because it made me feel like that was be going through space. This was not just for Sci- Fi lovers but also people who like dramas. I believe this is why the movie did so well was because it brought in many different audiences. Yet if you are a serious Sci-Fi lover this movie may not exactly be for you. Yes there are some flaws but it is after all just a movie with some amazing special effects but for the serious Sci-Fi fanatics you will pick out all of the little details that most wont making this movie not as good for you. This is why I believe it did have the bad reviews it got was because they were getting down to the serious nitty gritty. Where most of us just watched it and did not even notice what they would. The people who did not like this movie did not understand the main story line. It is after all just a movie there are going to be special effects because they are not really going to space to shoot this movie. You cannot forget this is just a movie when watching it and is this a likely story to ever happen, no most likely not. At the same time I can think of many movies I have watched that were very good and the story was not plausible at all. No everything is not going to be perfect or factual because again it is a movie! The main point I took away from the movie was not the facts such as if someone were to really talk in space they would not be able to hear you or if you were to cry the tears would not just float through space but stick to your body. I more noticed that only someone will the will to live are the ones going to survive. Ryan Played by Sandra Bullock does a great job showing the transformation between not really caring what happened to her to realizing she had to do this for her late daughter who passed at the age of four due to a simple accident. To the people who liked this movie I agree with you! I believe there are amazing special effect that made me feel like I was actually in the movie. The scenery is one of the many things that pulled me into this movie. Just the cover alone made me feel like it would be worth my time and money. The effects actually made me have to stop watching the movie when I was in my room alone in the dark because it felt so real to me that it gave me a little anxiety attack. Imagining yourself up in space all alone and you have no one to talk to but yourself. Putting yourself exactly where Ryan was would be very difficult. Would you have the guts to do all that she did? Most of us would not. You have to have the will to live to make it. You are able to tell at the begging that Bullocks character did not have the will and was in the mood of damned if I do and damned if I don't. You will either die in space by running out of air and supplies or you can take the chance of trying to get back to earth and possibly die that way. With that being said the little hallucination that Ryan had where one of the astronauts came back and told her she had to do this for her daughter made her realize she had to at least try. Some may say that this part is very unlikely yet if you are running out of air you are going to start acting a little goofy. Therefor this happening was not that unlikely. This lead to the turning point and you can see the emotion in Bullocks actions. She was very determined. This movie was for sure worth my money and time. The movie made me take away something other than learning I never want to go into space but that if you are determined to accomplish something you will. There is nothing or no one stopping you except for yourself. Ryan wanted to get back to earth not for only her daughter but for herself and to prove that she could do it. There is a big message I actually got and it was where there is a will there is a way."

","Gravity was more of a comedy than a drama for me due to its laughably inaccurate technical aspects. Yes the special effects are visually impressive, but they could not make up for the movie's technical flaws.<br/><br/>IMHO this is science fiction 1930s Buck Rogers style. In spite of its technical flaws, an actual story might have saved Gravity from being a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Pros: Sandy B. still looks hot in her underwear! (I hope that wasn't a spoiler!) Impressive visual effects when ""persons"" were inside the various spacecraft, especially the translation (movement) of ""persons"" through the various vehicles, and the individual floating objects that ""persons"" encountered along the way.<br/><br/>Cons: The depiction of all aspects of orbital mechanics, especially: the movements of the astronauts outside the spacecraft; everything about the orbital debris; and the damage caused by the orbital debris."

","I would never rate this movie as a 1 or 0, because the visuals are simply too amazing to take credit away from the marvelous people who produced them. I personally, however, enjoy seeing more than simply visuals. I found that between the overbearing music playing throughout the movie to the distracting string of constant bad luck, it gives the plot, along with its actors, no credibility whatsoever. There is no worse feeling than watching a movie and not being able to relate to it in any way. Everything was so over-the-top and trying so hard to be the ""most intense movie you've ever watched"" that it completely missed the mark. I am still amazed that this movie won so many awards beyond the visual ones it received (which it deserved greatly). I still would recommend to people to see the extremely amazing visual effects we are capable of achieving in today's age, but I strongly disagree with all of the praise this film is receiving as a complete package. Depends on what kind of movie-goer you are."

","Bullock plays herself in space as some computer tech repairing some satellite on a space shuttle. Mission commander is Clooney playing himself as well. They get a notice from mission command on earth that a satellite has blown up sending debris their way and that all satellites are being hit and eventually they'll lose communication. Clooney orders Bullock to finish up, but she thinks she knows better and keeps tinkering with a computer board. And indeed they end up hit with debris. Bullock ends up tumbling out of control detached from the arm that was holding her to the shuttle. As she goes flying out of control she loses communication with everyone.<br/><br/>When all hope seems lost. Clooney appears and grabs her. With his jet pack they go back to the shuttle and discover it's destroyed and some other guy part of the mission is dead. They make their way to the nearby international space station that has a released parachute with hundreds of belts entangled. Clooney realizes that for them to make it, he will have to let go.<br/><br/>Bullock arrives at the station, but there's a fire in one of the sections which quickly expands everywhere else. She escapes in a pod to the nearby Chinese space station. There she has one more chance to escape in a pod to earth. But as earlier as well, oxygen becomes an issue, plus she isn't exactly at flying these craft.<br/><br/>Gravity is a pretty looking movie. And how could it be otherwise. These days the least you can do with a space movie is show cool sights. A bit of annoyance is the constantly rotating and floating camera.<br/><br/>The story itself is surprisingly simple and empty. Our main character finds herself in an emergency and everything that could go wrong does go wrong and then some. The writers aren't a bit shy about exaggerating things and/or forgetting about realism when it suits them. Twice in the movie, oxygen becomes a problem, but it's also quickly forgotten when it's not convenient to the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Performances are very weak. You can accept Bullock in a many roles--an astronaut computer expert isn't one of them. Same with Clooney. At the same time, Bullock (and Clooney for that matter) is likable enough that you can watch her scream and groan through this movie.<br/><br/>Gravity looks good and Bullock makes a rather slim story watchable. But Gravity is a neither a great nor good movie and certainly not an worthy award winner."

","I love Sandra Bullock and George Clooney but this film leaves me gasping for air much like when Sandra reaches the ISS. Let me say this, the special effects and props are extremely well done hence the 3 stars, however there is absolutely no authenticity to the way a NASA mission is flown. Bullock and Clooney are flying Shuttle mission STS-157 and Clooney being the Commander knows nothing about her background, where she is from, does she have a family - it's like the day of the launch NASA saw they had an empty seat and started asking people if they would like to fly today and Bullock took them up on it. Everything that can possibly go wrong in this movie does for the crew. When attempting to escape in the Chinese capsule she uses the Eeny, meeny, miny, moe method to select what buttons and controls will power up the command module -- and luckily she gets it right from undocking all, the way through re-entry and splashdown - it's just amazing her prowess at selecting Chinese and Russian marked controls. I used to fly in the Air Force and have doggedly followed our Space Program all through the years so maybe that's why I couldn't handle the total lack of technical precision the story followed. I found technical content of this movie to be 0 for 10. About 2/3 of the way through this movie I was hoping for some space junk to take me out. Sorry but I was very disappointed in this one. Best Picture and Best Actress? Not by a long shot. To even nominate this one does dis-service to the films that have actually earned these awards."

","First half of the movie I was amazed, thanks to the great effects, the details and so on. One thing I seriously don't understand though, why is it so often that Hollywood fail to come up with on par scripts? I don't mind dramatization, I mean you can not, and should not expect to project reality into a story with all its boring details. Fair enough. Yet we are casually presented a setting where Russians (them being Russians?) mess up in gigantic proportions (too much Vodka I presume?) and bring down both space stations, together with a good proportion of the satellite network, just like that. Stuff happens, right.<br/><br/>That part being entertaining at best, the debris field as if following the protagonist, reaching her exact whereabouts just at the critical moments, and wiping everything out except her person and the modules she is so innocently trying to board, was boring, and intellectually affronting. Not to mention the probability of something like that happening must be... Well, quite negligible. Stuff happens though, right? Yes, yes, I heard you.<br/><br/>Also the part she boards the Chinese station, they need to present us table tennis equipment floating around, just to remind us it's a Chinese station. I was surprised they missed adding a few chopsticks to the scenery.<br/><br/>So there goes my 5 points to the tremendous effort put into the visualization.

For all the viewers that love a movie to give you a feel of the outside world watch it ! The film has broken a new money making record for the October season making more 55 million on the box office, Gravity will take this award as a new genre is formed.

","This film sets a Precedent for how successful a film can be that relies solely on special effects. Granted they are amazing, this film has been praised and is surrounded by Oscar buzz although it has a weak plot (I.e. little back story and no follow up once she lands back on earth, just so they can cram in the super cool satellite explosions) parallel is the weak acting. That's a bit harsh it's more the lack of acting needed, for 90% of the movie we can't see Sandra Bullock or we just see her face surrounded by her helmet. We don't get a sense of body language or hardly facial expressions, this is a character being dragged through a weak plot, a character that's back story is just blown off and were meant to accept that a local doctor is sent into space to try out a prototype. In summary this is a decent film that is highly if not the most overrated film of the last few years; it relies too heavily on its special effects rather than acting and is not deserving of any Oscar other than visual effects"
"Gibbous-moon","9","3","13","6 October 2013"," You will utterly destroy your chance to really enjoy this movie if you read too many reviews.
","My recommendation to you is to stop reading reviews for ""Gravity"" except for this one of course. I have to admit that I did indeed sneak a look at several of the early reviews for this movie since that is what I typically do before a night out with the wife. I have gotten pretty good at reading between the lines of what I find on IMDb and other sites, correctly separating the wheat from the chaff. My goal of course is to determine which movies are the ""DVD Movies"" and which movies are of the ""Must Be Seen on IMAX"" variety. It did not take long to determine that ""Gravity"" was one of those ""IMAX"" types. So I spent the extra $$$ to see the movie with my wife on opening weekend sporting a pair of flashy yellow 3D glasses. But wait¬Ö Houston, we have a problem. Reading those reviews absolutely spoiled my ""Gravity"" movie experience. Not because I already knew what was going to happen (I had no idea since I did not read any reviews with spoilers in them) but because my expectations were already warped by the way I perceived how this highly rated realistic action/adventure movie was going to deliver the goods and give me that warm and fuzzy feeling walking out of the theater with my wife at my side anticipating an enjoyable and intellectual discussion about what we just experienced. I do believe that we 21st century inhabitants of planet Earth have been so conditioned by our technology and modern conveniences that even our movies must now reflect that same level of overindulgence. Not only do we expect and demand eye-popping visuals, but every Big Budget Hollywood Blockbuster must now contain ultra-complex plots with dozens of twists and turns, a powerful and ruthless villain, a cunning hero and even more inventive anti-hero that use Macgyver-est techniques to save the day, and finally a huge¬Ö and I mean HUGE surprise ending that no moviegoer could have guessed (think ""6th Sense and ""Now You See Me""). Well at least both my wife and I were expecting that kind of movie when we sat down in the nearly sold out IMAX theater. What we ended up watching (that is, after being contaminated by reading the movie reviews) felt more like an episode of Space ""Survivorman"" or ""Man versus Space"" than a critically acclaimed Blockbuster that we both anticipated. So for the next 24 hours after my IMAX experience I replayed every scene, every sound, and every delectable moment that I could remember while attempting to purge any of my review driven cinematic prejudices. As my mind started to clear, I suddenly realized what had happened the night before. On reflection, ""Gravity"" delivers a very different type of movie experience than what I have come to expect from Hollywood and what the glowing reviews would typically suggests. As impressive as the larger-than-life visual and sound effects were, they only exist to help transport the audience from their normal everyday gravity friendly existence to an alien and truly hostile environment where the lack of gravity is the true adversary. What makes this movie an instant cinematic classic is how the tiniest subtle detail is meticulously handled. For example, the 3D effects are only used discreetly to enhance the moods of particular scenes (like the drops of Dr. Stone's blood floating across the giant IMAX screen that help captures the ferocity of the moment). Admittedly, I was originally disillusioned by ""Gravity's"" minimalistic plot line. But it is now apparent to me that the point of the simplistic storyline was to portray a sheer starkness to ""Gravity's"" liner plot. Clear your mind of thoughts of shape-shifting aliens and NASA hidden agendas and let your eyes and ears soak in every subtle nuance that your senses can take in. Allow the convincing story and subversive cinematography to sweep you away from your petty terrestrial existence. Experience every moment of pain and frustration as seen through Dr. Ryan Stone's ""blue and brown"" eyes. Feel your heart pump those precious hemoglobins throughout your body while your mind fights to regain it's equilibrium as you spin helplessly between deadly pieces of streaking NASA debris and other space junk. Notice how your body tenses up every time the distraught doctor is painfully jerked by her tether as she is slowly towed behind Kowalski's experimental ""MMU"" towards the hopeful salvation of a distant oasis in space. There is even a tribute to a Pixar classic near the end of the film that gave me a calming sense of satisfaction. This is not a movie that will ""Laserblast"" you through the final climax. Just remember that a great sci-fi movie experience can still be delivered without the resourceful use of duct tape or the heroine wearing an exoskeleton or even witnessing the final moments of the bewildered Alien Commander as he screams ""No... that's Impossible."""

","Almost 24 hours later, I still have the post viewing thoughts that the Gravity gave me. I have never watch a single movie twice in a single night at the cinema in my life, till Gravity came, I embraced it, first time in 2D and then in 3D. Thought that I would like to share some of the amazing things about this movie without spoilers. This movie unlike other sci-fi, this one is specifically for the grown-ups. The story telling is smooth and fairly easy to understand, yet terrifying and breathtaking. Start from the beginning, the movie managed to have a 20- minute take without a single cut, this is one of the most important thing need to be noticed when watching it. You will always immersed by the breathtaking views in the space, from the first person perspective and the third, everything seems so perfect until something went wrong. It's all about realism, everything is just so REAL. Even James Cameron praised the movie, saying the best space movie ever made. I wonder what's going to be for his Avatar 2. I have no a single clue about how this movie could ever achieved this kind of visual effects. Almost EVERYTHING is done through CGI via dedicated computers. This movie has to be nominated for the Oscars' best visual effects. Enough saying about the visual effects, the acting that Sandra did really letting the audiences being her and sensing the fear she was in. Little did I know, I have not seen many movies that a female is the lead role. But Sandra is and she did perfectly showing how should be done as a lead character. The movie cost 80 mil and spent 4.5 years to make. But 80 mil is actually quite good, not like other sci-fi which spent too much on unnecessary explosions and s**t; and 4.5 years, it is surprisingly long, perhaps due to the tech back then could not been done til recently. And the director did mentioned that it took them long time to select the characters, especially the lead role. The movie soundtracks are brilliantly made, it is very important to make sure they sound right, the reason being is that there is no sound in the space and all you heard just the radio conversations and other sounds transmitted via space suits. If you are an ambient music fan, you will love more about this movie. The movie Sunshine taught me how amazing the scores have to be in order to be enjoyable! So the soundtrack are awesome too. This movie is absolutely EPIC or awesometacular! ""There is none like it. This movie did push the limit of current film techs and made a super fine model for the sci-fi filmmakers or even any other types.....""Don't want to stress too much on the movie clich√© just watch and watch in 3D at all cost.

","Wow.<br/><br/>I mean, WOW.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is -- without a doubt -- the most mind-blowing film I've ever seen. Storywise, it's pretty simple -- a routine Hubble-servicing mission turns into a fight for survival when a destroyed satellite floods LEO with 17,000 MPH debris -- and George Clooney and especially Sandra Bullock both do a great job in their respective roles. But the real genius of this film lies in its special effects, INCREDIBLY long and complicated shots (which totally generate a ""you are there"" feeling), and PERFECT attention to detail. Cuar√≥n has taken Kubrick's ""2001: a space odyssey"" to the next level, and then some. I dare say this puts even ""Blade Runner"" to shame in the ""amaze your eyeballs"" department (although that movie is and always will be the pinnacle of pre-CGI film). The 3D is perfectly used, especially in the spacesuit scenes.<br/><br/>If you can't actually GO to space, this is the absolute next best thing.<br/><br/>I give ""Gravity"" a 10+ out of 10.

Sandra Bullock looked past her prime and her obvious facework looked puffy in space. She was not into this movie and acted like she was just reading her lines. Also too old for the part. The special effects were not bad albeit repetitive. The premise of the movie wasn't very believable - Irwin Allen would have at least set you up for the preposterous plot with some deep-voiced B actor lending it credibility down at control. The name of the movie also doesn't make sense because gravity has very little to do with the plot. I like the name though. This movie would have been a lot more credible with lesser known actors that actually looked like astronauts, and at least two should have ate in in spectacular fashion. Even with a bit of a weak plot, this movie should have been at least a 6.5 with cheaper actors. If I gon on any more I'm going to lower my rating of this movie, so I'll stop here."

","Heading into the theater to see this movie, I thought that it was going to be a great experience. I had heard high praise from friends, it fits neatly into my favorite genre of movies (science fiction/drama), and it just looked like a really, really cool concept. Unfortunately, I left the theater feeling ambivalent.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Gravity"" tells the story of two astronauts who are stranded in space after a freak satellite accident pummels their shuttle and sends them both adrift. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is the cool, cocky, non-stop energy personality, while Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is the nervous, scared, out-of-her-element type. They must somehow find a way to survive in the vacuum of space while planning a return journey to Earth.<br/><br/>I will say this about ""Gravity"": the visuals are absolutely astonishing. It really makes you feel as if you are in space with the two astronauts. I didn't even see it in IMAX, but I can imagine that would be even a more visceral experience.<br/><br/>The trouble for me, however, is that I felt that the plot/characters were never really developed enough to truly care when it all starts to come together in the end. It almost seemed as if director Alfonso Cuaron tried to tackle too many things at once and didn't really ""nail"" any of them. There were shades of horror, suspense, drama, reality, and even humor sprinkled into the experience, but in the end I just didn't feel the emotion that is needed for such a character- driven film like this one to be considered great.<br/><br/>Thus, aside from the spectacular visuals, I was disappointed with ""Gravity"". It isn't a ""bad"" movie, per se, so three stars are in order, but 2.5 would be my more exact ranking. It just never sucked me into the plot or characters."

","At first movie shows a space crew working on a satellite. They got an alarm message the space storm will hit them shortly hence they are trying to get in the shuttle but unsuccessfully. The flying objects are faster than a bullet and the damage on the shuttle is great. Later on the movie shows few storms and a rescuing of a main character Ryan Stone which is very boring, frustrating and the same, it keeps going on and on. There are to many unrealistic things shown in the movie and it will put to sleep those cinema-goers who want more content not just an action with storms and explosions. There is almost no communication and it makes the movie boring as all you can see is the main character in the space going at the one shuttle and then when that tore apart going to another. On every shuttle there is the problem so there is always something which inhibits her but on the contrary she is a lucky winner, all the time she manages to succeed every time.<br/><br/>If you like realistic movies with more characters, communication I really do not recommend you to watch this one. This is just an action movie with great effects so action and space lovers definitely won't regret watching it."

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie for the first time after hearing and reading great things about it. The visuals and special effects certainly didn't let me down, they were stunning throughout. In fact, it seems they spent so much time on the fancy graphics that they neglected to accompany them with a meaningful plot. <br/><br/>Essentially, this is 90 minutes of two astronauts floating around in space, engaging in tedious chit-chat whilst drifting from space station to space station. Sandra Bullock's character has a habit of pressing random buttons whenever she has the chance, with her preferred strategy of selection being the well known astrological formula of 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe'. Unsurprisingly, her intelligence pays off and she lands back on planet earth, unscathed and without so much as a scratch!<br/><br/>If fancy graphics are your thing and you're not too bothered about having a plot with substance, then I highly recommend 'Gravity'.

"Mobithailand","3","1","3","14 April 2016"," Strip away the 3D effects and what do you have left? Not very much I'm afraid
","When I was a kid growing up, I was a great lover of science fiction. I would devour stories by the likes of Arthur C Clarke, John Wyndham and H G Wells and as a kid, before I had any television in my home, I became entranced with radio Sci-Fi programmes, such as 'Journey into Space' and 'The Kraken Wakes'. <br/><br/>In my teens I became a fan of early TV Sci-Fi, such as Dr Who, (of course), The Twilight Zone, and how can I ever forget Star Trek with the indomitable William Shatner.<br/><br/>By today's standards, many of these programmes were pretty corny ‚Äì particularly with regard to the special effects ‚Äì but I loved them, and the stories just caught my imagination.<br/><br/>For many years as a young, budding author, I dreamed that my first great novel would be in the science fiction genre.<br/><br/>I suppose the last science fiction production to take me in, hook line and sinker, was the wonderful, '2001 ‚Äì A space odyssey' which I went to see in London with a friend when I was about 23 years old.<br/><br/>Sometime after that ‚Äì I can't say exactly when or why ‚Äì I fell out of love with science fiction. Every film or TV programme or book seemed to be yet another 'variation on a theme' and for some reason, I could no longer suspend credibility and become immersed in the fantasy.<br/><br/>It was all too boring and frankly - corny; despite the millions spent on special effects and prosthetics that were supposed to transform humans into credible aliens.<br/><br/>I will probably upset many of my readers by including such acclaimed masterpieces as 'Star Wars' in my boring, corny category. These wide screen extravaganzas that cost obscene amounts of money to make, and have attracted hundreds of millions of viewers throughout the world, leave me cold. I actually fell asleep through one of the Star War epics, when I was dragged to see it by my family. It was all too silly and superficial for me.<br/><br/>So in a long, very roundabout way, this brings me to Gravity, which is hardly science fiction at all, as most of what takes place is almost within the bounds of present day feasibility.<br/><br/>But it's as close to Sci-Fi as makes no difference, (IMDb classify it as Sci-Fi), so I confess that I was probably already predisposed to dislike it before I pressed the 'start' button.<br/><br/>There is no question that the film relies heavily on its special effects to woo the audience; so if you, like me, watch it without the benefit of 3D, then I'm afraid you may be in for a tiresome 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I am told that the 3D effects are incredible, and I don't doubt it, but strip them away and what do you have left? Not very much I'm afraid. I think I would rather watch a present day Doctor Who episode than this 'Gravity' tosh , and I haven't seen many of those in recent years as the 'bore factor' kicks in.<br/><br/>The Gravity story is simple. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are on a space-walk around the Hubble telescope, way out in space. The 'brilliant' Sandra is in the process of trying to fix a faulty part on Hubble when all hell breaks loose. They are showered in debris which was the result of some Russian missile doing something it wasn't supposed to do, and are they cast adrift and lose contact with mission control back on earth. Their own space ship is disabled and the remaining personnel are all killed. The remainder of story is about their attempts to get back to Earth by trying to propel themselves to alternative space crafts, (Russian and Chinese), that are floating around the firmament in various stages of disrepair. It is unclear what happened to the inhabitants of these craft.<br/><br/>There is little or no character development and I was unimpressed with George Clooney's 'cardboard hero' persona and his distinctly unfunny, homespun dialogue. Bullock lurches from crisis to crisis, telling us along the way about her dead daughter, (which is supposed to make us feel even more sorry for her) and screaming and sighing at appropriate moments when it seems all is lost. To be honest, you don't particularly care whether either of them make it back or not and you certainly shed no tears. While many may enjoy this spectacle on the big screen in all its 3D glory, if it is stripped of that major selling point, the dialogue, acting, and even the music rarely rise above the mediocre.<br/><br/>What astonishes me about this movie is that yet again, the professional critics are raving about it, and it picked up a whole gamut of BAFTA awards including best British film, best Director and best music, and an amazing 7 Oscars, including best director, best cinematography and best music. Call me a cynic, but is this the George Clooney/Sandra Bullock/ 'establishment' connection¬Ö.?<br/><br/>Just in case you think I am alone in thinking that Gravity is just a piece of mediocre dross, let's see what the good folks on IMDb have been saying:<br/><br/>""Stop advertising this as a good movie! ¬ÖI just don't understand why this score and all the good reviews over the net are all about¬Ö¬Ö This movie has no story development, no character development and the script sucks¬Ö""<br/><br/>Gravity is Weightless.

"geisterschiff","4","1","3","28 March 2016"," Space survival with beautiful orbit shots. Not more.
","First of all: I have been thinking about rating this as 1 star, cause I was seriously disappointed by a movie that won 7 Oscars and being nominated for best movie. Last time I felt that disappointed was when I watched Django Unchained. But to be fair, there are worse movies out there than Gravity, tho they usually have a smaller budget.<br/><br/>The plot itself is horrible. With barely any space training and some emotional problems due to the loss of her baby, Bullock is moving from one wrecked space craft to the next and the next and the next like she did it all her life. All the time either short on oxygen, with a fire in her back, some space debris trying to kill her or her being almost knocked out. Add the Clooney drama moments and that's it. It's a 1 person space survival with Bullock running from one catastrophe into the next and somehow surviving them. That together with zero gravity and beautiful shots of the planet is decent popcorn cinema that feels pretty repetitive after a while. Not more but not less either.<br/><br/>The movie is 91 minutes short and seriously, that's 45 minutes too long. They should have started at the point where Clooney dies his overly dramatized and unbelievable heroic death(which was pre announced already when they stated something about the record time in space). His dialogues are pretty corny anyway. <br/><br/>I can recommend this if you ever wanted to watch a computer animated earth from orbit and objects in zero gravity with monumental music for full 90 minutes. If you want to have any kind of character development, believable plot/characters(and without those the implied drama doesn't touch either), comedy spots(there are some lousy attempts in there) or decent action scenes: Hands off. The movie likely gets better if you switch off any audio and just watch. You won't miss anything important anyway."

So then George says they have to fly next door to the ISS. So they do. And guess what, they just just make it, as George runs out of fuel, and going too fast, so there's a miracle last second catch by dangling ropes. Hmm. And then once they have stopped, ie no more momentum, George decides that somehow the ropes are going to snap...and they start snapping! So he lets go of the rope - how very courageous and macho of him! So Sandra just barely manages to reach the hatch with her last breaths of oxygen. She then removes her space suit - how totally illogical. Then as she's attempting to radio someone, a fire bursts! But Sandra just barely manages to not get the least little burn even though she's wearing very little (and looking good). And she even manages to get to the Soyouz. Then she manages to separate the Soyouz from the ISS and tries to leave. But oh wait, the parachute is blocking her, and the ropes make the Soyouz bounce back towards the ISS! But Sandra just barely avoids the crash. Then she spacewalks to separate the parachute. And just at this moment the debris reappear. And they destroy the ISS and send it spinning - but somehow Sandra doesn't even get a tiny hole in her suit! So then Sandra aims at the Chinese space station. Then wants to get the engine started - but no fuel! So she despairs and lowers the O2 to commit suicide. So then miracle, she dreams of George and he tells her to try and to remember about the landing thrusters! So she un suicides, and manages to fly to the station. Apparently she aimed to well that she makes it at once! Of course upon arrival, she's going to fast, and she just barely catches the last possible handle. Of course. And it happens to be the hatch. Of course. Once in the station, and then in the Chinese Soyouz, she gets it separated, and they fall towards Earth. As they fall, the debris that left with her, somehow passes her! Finally she water lands. Pfew! But she's not done yet: she opens the hatch and water flows in! So she has to wait for the craft to sink about 50ft down, and then leave it! But with her suit she's too heavy! So she has to remove her suit and then swim to the surface! One more lucky escape! Then she swims a mere 10 seconds and already lands on the shore. And she looks up, and the debris that were passing her on the way down, are still flying up there!<br/><br/>BOTTOM-LINE: could have been GREAT about the fragility of human beings in space. Loses all credibility by adopting an unbelievable, Roger Moore in James Bond style of scenario, which would be amusing in its own right, but not in this film which tries to convey a serious message.<br/><br/>MARK: worth about 3 based on the script. I gave it 4 because of the visual effects."

","Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity"" stars Sandra Bullock as Doctor Ryan Stone, a biomedical engineer. As the film opens, Stone is repairing the Hubble Space Telescope. Accompanying her on this spacewalk is Lieutenant Matt Kowalski (George Clooney).<br/><br/>Cuaron quickly sketches Stone and Kowalski's personalities. Stone hates space, human connection, is depressed and is grieving for her deceased daughter. Kowalski, in contrast, is a dapper astronaut with a mega-watt smile. He loves life, people and zero-gravity space optimism. You got problems? Kowalksi's got your back.<br/><br/>When orbital debris destroys Stone's NASA shuttle, ""Gravity"" quickly morphs into a frenetic action movie. Here we watch as Stone and Kowalski, with limited oxygen supplies, make a beeline for the International Space Station. Along the way Kowalksi attempts to cheer Stone up, but she resists his pep talks. Nihilistic, grief-stricken and with no one home waiting for her, Stone already has one foot in the grave.<br/><br/>Upon arriving at the ISS, Kowalski sacrifices his life to get Stone into the station. Once there, more debris peppers the ISS, forcing Stone to hastily evacuate. She hops aboard a Soviet Soyuz module and aims it at the Tiangong, a Chinese space station.<br/><br/>Because she's stuck in the worse damn day of her life, Stone quickly realises that the Soyuz module has no fuel. She attempts communication with Earth, but reaches only lonely Eskimos and their sickly dogs. Resigned to her fate, Stone slips deeper into depression. Luckily a ghostly apparition of Kowalksi appears. Thanks to the power of motivational speaking, this apparition empowers Stone, fills her with self-belief, a desire for connection, vague spirituality and faith in humanity. Reinvigorated by mansplaining, Stone becomes determined to live! Kiss my butt, Newtonian physics! <br/><br/>""Gravity"" climaxes with Stone using a fire extinguisher to propel her toward the Tiangong. Whilst the Chinese station rapidly deorbits, Stone scrambles into its Shenzhou module and returns to Earth. Her landing is a success, but her module touches-down in a lake. Weighed down by her bulky spacesuit, which she frantically tears off, Stone almost drowns. To resist the pull of gravity, the weight of grief, Stone must thus symbolically remove her excess baggage. As the film ends, Stone's been reborn.<br/><br/>Cuaron signals Stone's transformation with much hokey symbolism: Stone is ""reborn"" from the fetal position, sits alongside pictures of St Christopher (the patron saint of travellers) and eventually emerges from water like a recently baptised baby, or a newly evolved creature pulling itself out of the primordial soup. Stone's very name signifies a heavy object, a burdened heart that wants only to succumb to gravity's depressing, all consuming vortex. Ironically, its the very forces pulling her toward death which usher Stone away from the darkness of space and back into Earth's loving embrace.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron has always loved elaborate long-takes. In ""Gravity"" he pushes this infatuation to its limit, his plot reverse engineered for the sole purpose of indulging in zany, zero-G camera-work. This camera-work is mostly intrusive, self-conscious and distracting. Master directors know when to cut, how to compose an image, hold a frame and how to juggle medium, close and long shots. Cuaron, though, bludgeons you with superfluous technique. His shots aren't elegant, just long. Aren't clever, just long-winded. Aren't beautiful, just expensive. And rather than majestic, sublime, claustrophobic or suffocating, his space and spaces feel like zillion dollar Hollywood plastic. Compare to ""Apollo 13"" and ""The Right Stuff"", where man's orbital tin-buckets feel like real, perilous places.<br/><br/>Though ""Gravity"" boasts a clever race-against-time plot, in which our hero leapfrogs from safe haven to safe haven, the film's ""thriller"" sequences are nevertheless mostly silly. Stone uses fire-extinguishers like WALL-E, Clooney's sacrifice is cribbed from ""Mission to Mars"" minus the opera, and the film's shots of bouncing astronauts, exploding machines and flailing arms seem goofy rather than ""authentic"". With more CGI than pixel-poster-boy ""Avatar"", ""Gravity"" never feels more than a blue-screen show-reel made slick by a budget that dwarfs most real space-missions. Stick Keanu Reeves in here, re-title it ""Speed 3"" and inject a sense of humour, and ""Gravity"" might play better. But Cuaron wants to make ""serious art"", a desire which his film is not grave enough to sustain. The film features Ed Harris as the voice of NASA Mission Control. Harris also appeared in ""Apollo 13"" and ""The Right Stuff"".<br/><br/>7.5/10 ‚Äì See ""Wings of Hope""."

","in my opinion, neither quite explains the title which was part of the reason I had so little interest in seeing what looked like (from the trailer) yet another flick about explosions in Space and debris-splattered disasters; so it was a genuine surprise to finally find out that that's NOT what it's primarily about - in fact, this film isn't really and truly 'about' Space at all¬Ö The storyline slowly but surely reveals it's baseline Story to be about the fight for life after losing life - not literally, but emotionally and spiritually - in the wake of the devastation of grief. So after suspending disbelief for the umpteenth time (e.g. we're asked to believe a sequence of totally improbably events all taking place 500 km above Earth - which incidentally once again visually supports a theory I've heard and agree with that in actuality, our planet is itself suffering from a misnomer as by all evidence it ought to be called Ocean instead!), we let ourselves be seduced by the beautifully apropos music in tandem with Bullock's moving performance of a person who has only been existing instead of living - and now needs to make up her mind, whether she's willing to fight for life - which ironically has been taken from people around her who it's clear all wanted to live, but didn't. Her metaphorical salvation (OK so I personally objected to the utilization of the Clooney character as a stand-in for Christ! But let it pass¬Ö) and rebirth, culminating in the humble last-word utterance of an otherwise unremarkable script ('Thank you'), which was by this point a prayer reduced in simplicity to the essence of this experience and gratitude for having made it back, moving me to tears - and coming as it did after our witnessing her tremendous struggle, was genuinely and unusually good¬Öparticularly, in a film emerging from Hollywood and masquerading as an action movie! I was impressed by such artful use of technology appealing to mass audiences while hiding an important message: Life IS worth fighting for, and we all die eventually anyway, so why not try to enjoy the ride while it lasts? :)"
"bjbeardse","9","1","3","30 November 2014"," Great film, Bad Science
","I saw this film in an IMAX theater. I was also the only one laugh my butt off. The basic premise of the film is highly ludicrous, it really shows that film-makers today are clueless idiots when it comes to science. Lets start off with the Main Character.<br/><br/>Why would a MEDICAL DOCTOR be fixing the Hubble? I mean she's not even an ophthalmologist! The repair of the Hubble was undertaken by people with engineering degrees not medical arts degrees.<br/><br/>Kessler Syndrome. A highly unlikely scenario of satellite collisions and domino theory, taken to the extreme limits of statistical probabilities. The amount of debris shown would not be generated by even 500 satellites. Again idiot film-makers not asking or ignoring real world physics.<br/><br/>Clooney's character is a lieutenant. Clooney is WAY to old to be playing a character with that rank. That is akin to Tom Cruse playing Maverick in the next Top Gun and only being a Lt. Commander! <br/><br/>Hubble, ISS, and Tiangong all within sight lines of each other. This is about as moronic as the ""Eject the core"" crap from the first JJ Trek film where 9 THINGS fly out of the dorsal part of the secondary hull of the Enterprise. CORE = SINGULAR!!! Where as here this guy wants you to believe that a MMU can go from Hubble to the ISS.<br/><br/>Geeky Physics and Orbital Mechanics warning.<br/><br/>Hubble 28Deg/570km ISS 51Deg/425km TG 43Deg/397km<br/><br/>Not even the Space Shuttle has the fuel to change orbits that far. It not a question of the altitude, but the orbit inclination. The equator would be a 0 inclination orbit. No the science is horrendous in this film, not to mention the physics, however it is very entertaining."

","Gravity, by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, is a science fiction film / thriller that takes place in the space, as we can guess with the title. The main actress, Sandra Bullock, plays a medical engineer, Doctor Ryan Stone. She is followed by the astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney). <br/><br/>The plot is based on Dr. Stone's first space mission that becomes a disaster after a satellite has just exploded. Almost everything is destroyed there and Kowalsky and Stone are on their own. They face a lot of issues such as the decreasing oxygen or the communication that is cut with the Earth. <br/><br/>In my opinion, this film was a quite good one even though it was pretty long and repetitive. As far as the performance is concerned, I found it very well done due to the 2 great actors. But personally, I thought it was a bit predictable. I would recommend this film to people who like sci-fi movies but seeing it on a TV may be disappointing therefore it is better to go to the cinema to see it."
"bowmanblue","7","1","3","21 July 2014"," An experience more than a film
","Okay, 'Gravity' is amazing. That makes it sound like a film that you have to watch, but, on reflection, I'm still not so sure. I sat through the whole ninety minutes of it and I'm still not sure whether I liked it or not.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not sure I'd ever want to watch it again. It's about two astronauts stranded in space when their shuttle gets struck by debris. First, the good: the two (and only) leads, George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, are both worthy of their A-list reputation and turn in excellent performances. You'll really feel for their plight and be rooting for them to get back to Earth. In fact, the only thing better than their acting is the special effects themselves. Sometimes it feels like you're really there with them as explosions and weightless tools float all about the place.<br/><br/>However, the only thing that lets this masterpiece down is the story (or lack of it). They get caught up in one explosion. Escape. Move on to the next explosion. Escape. Then rinse and repeat for an hour and a half. Having only two characters in the film kind of means that you know both won't die otherwise the movie will have to end.<br/><br/>'Gravity' is truly an epic movie in all aspects (apart from the story... possibly). It's definitely in the same league as '2001: A Space Odyssey' in terms of scale, drama and awe. However, what made it so good was also its drawback. Having long drawn-out shots and minimal cast never really felt like a 'story-film' (if you know what I mean). Sometimes I felt like I was at the Epcot Centre in Disney World watching an exhibition on what space was like.<br/><br/>Yes, Gravity is breath-taking and will certain be hailed as a modern day classic by many. And, I'm definitely glad I saw it. Will I watch it again? No. Once is enough, thanks.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"burlesonjesse5","7","1","3","17 May 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Gravity
","The only actors that pretty much appear in the 2013 sci-fi release Gravity, are George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. They share top billing but in the end this is Bullock's show. She gives a stunning and seething performance as Dr. Ryan Stone, a Mission Specialist who gets caught in a violent (outer atmosphere) debris storm that destroys her shuttle and sends her floating into space. With the help of astronaut Matt Kowalski (played by George Clooney), she is brought back to safety (by way of a tether) and the two of them must find a way to get back to Earth. They have limited resources (the rest of the crew are dead and Stone's oxygen pack is waning) and can't get any type of radio transmission.<br/><br/>This is basically the set up for the rest of the proceedings. My overall view: Gravity is pretty good but not great. From the opening shot, right away it feels like the director is teasing you with a teeny tiny homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey (a space shuttle floats across the faraway landscape of the planet Earth). That's where the comparisons end. This film hints at Kubrick's masterpiece (there's a close-up of Bullock's eyes that channel Keir Dullea with his space helmet on) and it seeks to bring the terror like say, the 1979 gem Alien. But alas, Gravity lacks the eerie beauty displayed in ""Odyssey"" and the nightmarish posture that possessed Ridley Scott's celebrated marvel. Yes, the characters in this flick are in a lot of danger and extreme peril. However, their plights did not shake me. I didn't experience fear with them. Being lost in space is I guess, terrifying. But it's hard to pull off. Open Water, a movie that has nothing to do with sci-fi but carries a similar theme, is a superior thriller that has two characters stranded in a body of water with no land in sight. The fact that they might be eaten by sharks is something that shook me to the core. I didn't get the same vibe with Gravity. I don't think it's the filmmakers fault. This is a picture that is stunning to look at and it has that feeling you get when you think to yourself, ""how the heck did they make this."" I give credit to director Alfonso Cuar√≥n for using the same technique that he perfected in Children of Men (2006). He excels at getting the camera to closely follow every action of the characters (it stays right next to them) while at the same time, having the destruction and chaos occur around them and at close proximity.<br/><br/>Honestly, if there is one major flaw that seeps into this vehicle's veins, it would be this: a lot of the dangerous situations that Bullock and Clooney (more Bullock than Clooney) get into are the plot devices this thing throws in to keep things afloat (ha ha) or moving (they wander into another space station and there is a fire. Bullock's character tries to get home in an escape pod and it's out of fuel. They come into more contact with debris etc, etc...). And then there's the ending that kinda winks at Ron Howard's Apollo 13. Again, Gravity is a good film. But it's not the masterpiece that most critics make it out to be.<br/><br/>I see some good things happening with this picture though. It should get some technical nods come awards time. And I think Bullock deserves a nomination from the Academy (completely different from her performance in The Blind Side, but still terrific in its own right). But is it Best Picture material? Not in my book. Gravity is no doubt an effective way to kill an hour and a half. This movie has a look and a feel like nothing you've ever seen before. But as something that stays with you long after the curtain closes, I feel it doesn't quite hold much weight."
"willcundallreview","7","1","3","7 May 2014"," An overrated but still a Good movie
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Gravity is a film that although I feel was and is overrated, still manages to put together a good drama and with some breathtaking effects, I would still recommend this to everyone. From a fine director who has only really come from the shadows with this film to a duo that share this film and well Ii must also mention they are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood. With it's massive effects come massive affects to the characters and with some speedy space junk to and escape pods everywhere this film guarantees thrilling stuff. I felt this film was strongly good, and here is why.<br/><br/>The story is a good one, not the finest I could think of but with some great thrills and also spills, you are never not gripped to it. I felt that the story at times did rely on it's effects and soppy stories of home to fill in the gaps but nevertheless it is a solid story and even if it is kind of simple still makes for pleasant viewing. The pace is fast and big and you really don't know what will happen next, this one reason rated this slightly higher as predicting what happens around her is near impossible and all down to writing of a great writer and director.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock in the main role does a good job if not slightly over dramatic one at times but manages to be great by the end. George Clooney as back up seemed nearly too chilled to execute his role well enough and just seemed to float around the entire film without trying to do anything. With this there are only ever the two in it which makes for cool viewing as you do in the end get to know quite a bit about them even if the movie is only 91 minutes long, good stuff yet again from Cuaron.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron has to be one of the most underrate directors of our time and I swear he can make any film better than it seems or just generally better. His skill with the word is good too and some dialogues I this although not always executed perfectly by the cast, is great stuff and his choice of dialogue is intriguing at best. I can't not mention the effects which are just massively and crazily big with some sublime work done by the studio behind this, the entire thing looks real and on such a scale too just wow, one of the best film for effects I have ever seen seriously.<br/><br/>I do feel this film is overrated like I said, although Cuaron is perfect and did deserve his Oscar for his work, I got annoyed with Bullocks character and wasn't sure if that was just how Cuaron wanted her to be or Bullock wasn't playing her right. I also will add that although the drama is good and thrilling, this film offers very little more in terms of anything and I cannot see why it is so highly reviewed as it seriously is nothing special(well maybe the effects are but effects don't make an entire movie flawless).<br/><br/>Those who enjoy space adventures will like it as Gravity is basically what it says on the tin, she spins around in the earth's gravity a lot, but it makes for good viewing though. I think Clooney fans may be disappointed as we don't see loads of him and his screen time is just not enough for him to save himself from his stale performance. I know I sound like I hate it but it is actually worth a watch from anyone, no matter what type of film you think you like, this can be enjoyed.<br/><br/>Overall I give this a 7/10 meaning it is Strongly a Good film, it is very near to being very good but certain factors don't allow it to move upwards to there. Don't watch this and say you like it because all critics say they do and because it won Oscars, see for yourself, I didn't find it great but it was good and personal opinion is everything here. One more thing is the score by Steven Price which I am not kidding can make you heart beat faster in the more thrilling parts, and also go see this in 3D if you want even more thrills than it already gives."

","Gravity is a decent movie with a great storyline and a talented cast.The movie is without a doubt one of the most stunning and realistic movies ever made,but I was still disappointed by it,it was just too hyped up for me.I thought that at times the movie relied much more on effects rather than story,which is always a problem,and also the movie was way too short,with a length of only an hour and thirty minutes,a movie like this could have been longer than two hours,there is so much more in space that this movie could have explored,I'm not saying it should have shown aliens or anything because it isn't that type of movie,but we could have seen some beautiful shots of other planets and galaxies,it would have looked beautiful and would have added so much more to effect of the movie.Sandra Bullock does deliver a beautiful performance however and is certainly the highlight of the movie,she delivers a very dramatic and emotional performance and it's movies like these that show why she is one of the most successful actors in Hollywood at the moment.I do think Gravity is overrated,but it's still very beautiful and enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or sci-fi.<br/><br/>Two astronauts work together to survive and keep calm after they get stranded in space.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Sandra Bullock Worst Performance: George Clooney"

They made a film that really moved people and captivated the audience from start to finish. I can appreciate the research that the film did to make it authentic and real. The script was the weakest part of the project. I know this is a way to get an audience, but next time it use something less predictable. However, minus the script, this movie was a success. I did feel like George Clooney's presence was a waste. How many times do we have to see him? I would say the same about Bullock, but she was believable."
"phubbs","7","1","3","12 April 2014"," Gravity
","Well here we are, the big Oscar winner, the talk of the town, so it seems. My brother stuck this on the Bluray the other night when I was at my folks, so without any warning I was thrown into orbit alongside the ever annoying Bullock and Hollywood lapdog Clooney. One thing was for sure, it was gonna be pretty.<br/><br/>The lowdown, a small team of astronauts are fixing the Hubble telescope when a field of lethal debris from a recent Russian missile strike on a satellite, hits them head on. The debris causes massive damage and strands our plucky heroes in orbit with virtually nowhere to go. From here on they must fight to survive by spacewalking to other nearby space stations to try and reach any remaining capsules so they can get back down to Earth.<br/><br/>OK so the first thing anyone with a brain will notice is the special effects, the visuals in general. Without trying to sound too deflating I have come to expect flashy super-duper effects from most modern films these days, its a given really isn't it, if the film doesn't look ultra amazing you'd be shocked. So while this film does have the perfect realistic look of a real NASA film from a real space mission...it somehow isn't overly mind blowing truth be told. It sure does look spot on for total scientific accuracy in every aspect from the space suits, the spacecraft, the space stations, cockpit controls, weightlessness, every little nut bolt and screw, and space physics in general.<br/><br/>So I can understand why this film won visual effects, kudos. But then we have the plot issues and accuracy issues, yeah yeah I know but come on, a big realistic film like this had better get its facts right...yes?, no. First off this Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite?? what the splodge was that about?!. Why would a country fire a missile at a defunct satellite firstly, surely this is bound to cause a chain reaction of problems. Secondly why blow up a satellite that no longer works? seems a bit over the top to me, surely you'd bring on international outrage doing this? causing a massive disaster in space, it just seems a really dumb decision. Then you have the fact that the astronauts lose contact with control completely, really? out of all the kit they have up there on various international platforms they still can't contact control! that's scary right there.<br/><br/>I won't go on about the technical issues as its nitpicking really...oh just one more. The astronauts travel between the Hubble, the ISS and the Chinese space station as if they are all in the same orbit!!. I'm afraid these objects are not in the same orbit and travelling between them would take some planning and a heck of a lot of fuel and oxygen, but hey kudos for trying anyway.<br/><br/>Whilst watching this visual extravaganza I realised something midway through, this film is nothing more than a pumped up Universal Studios or Disney's Hollywood Studios ride (formally MGM). Its all about the visuals and the ride, the plot is minimal and the acting was pretty standard in my opinion. Of course this being shown mainly in 3D only emphasises this notion, this whole experience is merely a theme park ride, hell I'm damn sure this film will be made into a theme park ride seeing as its pretty much there anyway, I can see it now, rumbling seats and smoke. There's nothing wrong with this essentially as it does what its suppose to do and thrill you with flashy CGI, but overall I kinda felt a bit tricked or cheated as it in no way feels like an actual movie.<br/><br/>As I already said the acting didn't inspire me much frankly. I dislike Bullock and have never rated her as an actress in any of her films mainly because she's the same in everything with that annoying squeaky clean voice and image. The same can be said for Clooney who simply plays Clooney in EVERYTHING!!, this guy cannot act one iota, he just does his smooth smug ladies man act because that's all he can do. He acts no better in this film than he does in a recent British coffee advert, its the same performance people!!! only difference here is he has an astronauts suit on sheesh!!. <br/><br/>I won't deny I didn't enjoy the film to a degree, it was nail biting at times which was all made possible down to the stupendous effects. But was it really that exciting? really? I mean the whole thing was so predictable, you know from the start the female will survive because in every film women are now the heroes (see what you have started Mr Cameron, with your 'Ripley' character). There was never a point where I didn't think she wouldn't survive otherwise there would be no film, there was only one slight surprise character wise, and I highlight *slight*.<br/><br/>I can see why this film made a splash and I fully backup the effects award even though in this day and age its not exactly a game changer, I think. The way they went about creating a fully realistic thriller in space that looks no different to something you'd expect to see from real footage is admirable, but that's all it is. Where as 'Apollo 13' was a nail biting epic drama, this really does feel like a short bombastic theme park ride with a wafer thin plot that's no better than a video game. There's been a lot of fuss over this film and apart from the visuals I really don't get why. I feel like I'm repeating myself (I am) but bottom line its a big thumbs up for the effects and realism, but that's as far as it goes for me, my score reflects those two elements only.<br/><br/>7/10"
"katieanderson1985","Null","1","3","9 April 2014"," A Smidgen Disappointed
","Gravity is a really good movie, make no mistake, but two things made me slightly disappointed in it when all was said and done; one was all the hype I had heard, much of it from friends, and two; the special effects were so good and mesmerizing, I did not think the story-line was quite their equal. <br/><br/>As is my habit from time to time, I started examining other things in the movie that might be in error. In the case of Gravity, I tried to figure out what in the movie defied the laws of physics. I'm not sure if being preoccupied by such things causes me to not get submerged in the plot, or that the slightly weak plot makes my mind wander to such things as errors. <br/><br/>Still, it was a very good movie, especially if seen second run for $2. After all, it made me glad that I am on firm soil and not marooned in outer space."

","The good: Strong woman. She apparently outlived George Clooney's character. Great crash-'em-up scenarios. She prays to God to save her life. There is also a Buddha-like statue over the cockpit/dashboard. Maybe both God and nuBuddha save her life. She can really click that helmet back on her suit just in the nick of time. She can really ""swim"" through the environment on those spacecrafts.<br/><br/>The bad: What's the matter with these people? With international space stations, the characters should learn the languages of astronauts/cosmonauts from other nations and cultures. Barking of a dog? Woof, woof, woof? What was up with that? Mayday-mayday was foreign to an Asian person, so there should have been an international SOS ""word or phrase"" that was recognizable to all involved.<br/><br/>More bad: No singing and dancing. Seriously, let me see what else this turkey lacked . . . Realism about all the body slams. Yes, Dr. Stone was slammed against all of that enormous equipment, out in space, yet she survived with merely a bruise -- lots of other people got killed. She all of a sudden miraculously found oxygen when she had been inhaling her own breath. Clooney appeared to her, and inspired her to stay on the alive side of the hereafter.<br/><br/>Worse: Clooney, something like, ""You like my looks?"" Another scene, something like, ""You want to stay aboard here with me and have a 'good time' all day?"" I tell you, this is such ignorant and disrespectful dialogue. Clark Gable he ain't, nor Cary Grant, et al.<br/><br/>The itchy; the so-so: all those tethers tangled around her legs. Reminded me of that old time ping pong toy with the red rubber ball attached to the thin wooden paddle by way of a long gray rubber band. She was able to unloose herself from the rubber bands, and even unhitched the spacecrafts from similar stuff.<br/><br/>The terrible: tons of old-time looking cockpit equipment. The dregs. Yard sale rejects. Nothing high tech here. Was this the 1970s, or current times? (I missed the first few minutes). She even read printed manuals. That is so old-school. Nobody does that anymore. She should have had way more knowledge about spacecraft operation in general. Maybe she could have gone online to get instructions, but perhaps the stuff was so old that there were no online manuals. Wait a minute. Are there internet connections on space stations?

Here, she dumps the spacesuit in the water, and takes forever to reach the surface. No oxygen there, down in the deep. Ryan, stick your arms and hands straight up. She hits the top and all of a sudden floats on her back, or does some kind of backstroke. Were those Blue Angels overhead, or more wasted space debris?<br/><br/>I predicted Clooney would rescue her for real, or at least on the ground or near the ocean, but this did not happen. Where were the international TV news staffs, rescue vehicles, space employees -- nobody was around to help her. Where were Houston and Cape Canaveral falling all over themselves to rescue her? I know, they were still in the Town of Bedrock, shooting slingshots of large boulders into outer space.<br/><br/>Do you think that she even had a welcome-home ticker tape parade?<br/><br/>7/10"
"michaelRokeefe","9","1","3","2 April 2014"," Bullock and Clooney in tandem lost in space.
","A beautifully choreographed masterpiece from director Alfonso Cuardon. Definitely out of this world. Dr. Ryan Stone(Sandra Bullock)is a medical engineer on her maiden shuttle mission teamed with Commander Matt Kowalski(George Clooney), who just happens to be on his last space mission before retiring. A routine spacewalk to make repairs becomes everything but; when debris from exploding Russian satellites destroys the shuttle. Now Stone and Kowalski are totally alone tethered, floating through space with no contact with Earth at all. Oxygen is running out and a decision is made to try and get back to the destroyed shuttle and salvage a landing pod to get them to the nearest help...a Chinese space station. Things will go awry and now a lone survivor must ponder their place in the scope of things. In thoughtful desperation there must be a plan to make it back home.<br/><br/>Astonishing visuals. White knuckle tension. Breath grabbing anxiety. This Sci-Fi thriller also features the voices of Ed Harris, Phaldut Sharma, Amy Warren and Basher Savage. GRAVITY allows me a better appreciation of Bullock's talent. Clooney shows stability mixed with humor. Put this on your ""don't miss"" list."
"abhijitnandy","8","1","3","1 April 2014"," Great movie. Thoroughly enjoyable!
","I think most of the bad reviews are from people who've watched this in the theater. Because the movie has a slow pace. It's a much better movie when seen sitting on your couch at home. Or probably, because it was hyped by the marketing department! Also, I don't know if the guys who dwelled on the nitty-gritty science bits know this - Hollywood is in the business of entertainment, not in creating scientific TV shows!<br/><br/>Anyways, I really enjoyed the movie. Considering that it's just two characters, the movie was quite gripping. And also, I was full of awe seeing the inside of the space stations, the space walking, the dangers and sheer feeling of fear that if anything happens to you in space, there's no one to help you! The pictures of the earth with the clouds, the cyclones, the aurora was fascinating.<br/><br/>Wonderful entertainment. Really enjoyable."
"mario_c","7","1","3","31 March 2014"," A different film!
","GRAVITY is a different film. At least it's not similar to any other movie I've ever seen and it clearly has some particular issues which turn it into a different and unusual film. Some of them are good, I would say even excellent, some of them are not so good¬Ö <br/><br/>The good things: GRAVITY setting is beautiful! The views of the Earth from outer space, the sunrise scene, the cosmonauts floating on space, all of this is done with beautiful images and scenes and with incredible CGI. The special effects are just amazing, superb, I would say! And I also did watch it in 3D and it was wonderful! A magnificent 3D experience, the best one I've had so far (I didn't watch too many films in 3D though¬Ö). The acting by Sandra Bullock is great; she does an excellent job, but she's alone¬Ö The soundtrack, it's also very good and every single track fits very well in the film.<br/><br/>Now the bad issues: The plot! It's so tiny so little that it almost doesn't exist¬Ö There's one plot in this film of course but it's so simple and short that I think that a movie with all this visual greatness and excellent CGI would deserve a better and more elaborated plot, even if it was around the same thematic! It could have been done with more characters, more subplots, etc¬Ö I think it fell a bit too short that way¬Ö (One example that this movie is too centred in the character performed by Sandra Bullock is when she arrives either on the ISS and the Chinese stations and there were nobody there, dead or alive! Why weren't there any cosmonauts? Did they were taking a walk on space? I don't think so¬Ö :) <br/><br/>So, together with some usual and typical Hollywood clich√©s, this lack of plot and the absence of other characters are the most let-downs in this movie to me. But as I said in the beginning all the rest is pretty good!"

","The cinematography was brilliant no argument about that. However, I found I fast forwarded it as I lost a bit of interest possibly because I had a narrator explaining things that I thought rather strange. However, the extras were interesting about the dangers of space junk. I knew this, but the icing on the cake was the short documentary I really enjoyed that. But I wish the film well irrespective of my reaction as I might not be the type of viewer that enjoys, sitting on the edge of my seat movies, or potential disaster movies. I tend to want to know the outcome first, but obviously the film did very well indeed. <br/><br/>I didn't understand a lot of the technical stuff, such as how Stone learned how to control the space ship that was left by Chinese. Her companion suddenly reappearing to help her, made it become some what Sci-Fi fantasy. I realized the message was her will to live above all odds even though it brought back her astronaut dead companion. I got it on a hire DVD so was not able to view it 3D on the big screen that would have changed my mind possibly."
"pisarenco-a","5","1","3","16 March 2014"," Total disappointment and probably the worst movie I recently saw
","Double warning: this does contain MAJOR spoilers.<br/><br/>A movie has to have a good general idea and a detailed plot. As a general rule, good movies are good in all of them. However, not this one. The idea of the movie is that Russians (who else?) blew up one of their satellites, which brought havoc among every other object in orbit. I mean WHAT? Blowing up a satellite? You need a HUGE missile, and it would probably miss. And it would generate huge amounts of space junk, which is bad for everyone. Nobody is THAT stupid. But whatever, what happens if an object explodes in space? Well, most of the debris forms a ring resembling the orbit of the original object. In its initial stage, it's just a small cloud of debris, traveling at enormous speeds relative to the earth. In order to hit that debris however, you need to be VERY unlucky. And if you get that unlucky - you won't get to see it. Any of it. Because of its sheer speed. Unless its on the same orbit as you are, in which case the speed will be virtually the same, and that astronaut wouldn't have a hole through its head, and you wouldn't meet up with the debris again for at least a few months. So the idea is utter nonsense. But that's not all. So you're adrift in space. Somehow an astronaut has enough fuel to go get you, and drag you back to the shuttle, then find a convenient INTACT space station nearby and decides to move there. It's like you can take a walk calmly in space to any space station, and astronauts are waving flashlights at each other as pranks. Yeah, totally, every object in space is there, except for satellite debris, which comes like a wave and hits ONLY the station that you are on, and ONLY when you're just about to do something important, like get in or get out.<br/><br/>So OK, the idea is total nonsense, that only a 3yr old would believe, what about the plot? Yeah, astronauts in space, working, and one is joy- flying his jetpack, listening to the radio, joking... Yeah, this is how it's done. And when Clooney's character is about to let go of the rope, it's like someone is pulling him. It's like he's not a subject of microgravity. Yeah, he's going DOWN. And she? Even if they had the same speed, the same direction, and virtually the same position, she was just left there, floating. Yeah, totally legit. That really made me angry at whoever made this plot. That, and the stupid heroic action of Clooney's character. I was like ""Ok, now all you need to do is pull just a bit, and he'll come to you gently"", then I was like ""WHAT? What do you mean let go? Pull him! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!"". It's an appalling way to kill a character. Worse than Tasha Yar in Star Trek TNG. And what about that re-entry angle? Without ANY input from the pilot, when the whole thing explodes, the capsule just HAPPENS to stabilize in the right position, and just HAPPENS to go in at just the right angle? And what's that wind at the beginning of re-entry? There is no pressure (wind) at those altitudes. First there is just impact by particles, that make stuff burn. Yeah, like you see in shooting stars. And the ship is being destroyed by this wind, while the astronaut outside is just floating carelessly around it. Yeah, sure. And filmmakers, if you want to draw stuff moving at ten miles per second, DON'T draw it. That's it. It's too fast to see it. And you should know from ballistics, that when an object THAT size hits a water melon, the water melon explodes because of the pressure wave inside it. There, we have an intact, but perforated head. Like it was surgically cut with a laser. This is insane! And that fire inside the ISS? First of all, fire is just plasma from the combining of gasses. So if something burns, it constantly needs a supply of gas. If you don't have it - all you get is a ball of smoke, and not a ball of fire. And if something burns inside the station, oxygen gets consumed within just a few seconds. There is giant pressure, no oxygen. So even if the fire is legit, she would've suffocated within 2-3 seconds or after the first explosion. And the pressure inside should've made the whole station explode to bits. Yet she managed to stay alive. And what about that radio contact with that dude with a dog and kid? Surely they could've made contact with someone at ESA, NASA, or the space programs that I don't know the names of, from countries like Russian, India, China, Japan. Oh, yeah, I forgot. Russia is the bad guys who caused this in the first place. Everybody hates Russia. The bottom line: The accuracy of physics here is worse than in ""Quantum Apocalypse""; acting is either very bad (I felt no emotions), or the script for them was incredibly bad; the event succession is as credible as a fairy tale. Don't watch it if you have a functioning brain. You'll regret it."
"an_honest_reviewer","3","1","3","12 March 2014"," Pulled into the void
","Sure, with 100 million dollars at your disposal, there is a high chance you'll succeed in pulling off some spectacular visual effects. I'll also acknowledge the director's effort to add a few aesthetic camera shots here and there: For instance, the opening shot or the brief switching to 1st person view presented a neat treat. But these are so sparsely built on that they are but mere traces of what could have been actually innovative to cinematography.<br/><br/>It is the tragedy of this film that it has no tragedy you can relate to, meaning that even for Hollywood standards the plot is so shallow that it hurt my brain. Character development is constrained to a few minutes that won't go beyond ""Never give up"" and ""Get over your losses"" which resembles philosophical levels similar to those of any random afternoon cartoon show targeted at preschool kids. The most embarrassing moment could be perceived when the Bullock character, out of the blue, displays some religious remorse (someting like ""I don't know how to pray"") obviously indicating nothing but a pathetic attempt to please religious fanatics in the audience. If the Bullock character gets 'grounded' to anything other than gravity, it's to trivial truisms so commonplace that they are painful to discern.<br/><br/>We get to know little to nothing about the Clooney character - let alone its development - making both him and his corresponding actor entirely interchangeable. And would it have been too much to ask as to what actually caused all the problems the protagonists are facing? Due to the incredibly shallow plot I waited throughout the whole movie for an explanation going beyond that of a mysteriously ""misguided rocket"".<br/><br/>In conclusion, anyone watching this movie with an intellect surpassing that of a 5-year-old may attain just about the same dramatic experience by watching its trailer on a continuous loop."

I have never been so wrong in my life. Gravity is a space thriller at most, not a SciFi so if you go and watch it with that in mind, don't. In the movie, a lot of things were awful. First of all, some space facts are shown incorrectly and in the film, a film where ,honestly, only science is the only reason I gave it a 2 instead of 1. It is really boring, and the directors think we asked for a shaken cocktail instead of a movie. After Sandra Bullock gets away from their ship or whatever, the movie is just spinning and meaningless talk until the part where Clooney and Bullock try to reach a space station so they don't get lost in space. That part was actually exciting and I liked it.However, After Clooney gets lost, it turned to crap. Bullock crying about her life all the time, attempting suicide, hallucinating and talking to an Asian she couldn't understand via radio and eventually landing a ship successfully to earth when it had a foreign language control panel and also, she failed all simulations, which should be reason enough for her not coming to space AT ALL. Meaningless script that made no sense. That's all I can say for this movie. More awards don't make a movie great."

To nominate Sandra Bullock for Best Actress is to slap the face of every actress. To give the director an Oscar derides the Hollywood establishment as a whole. Take a long look at the last shots in the film then scratch your head and say the words,""Best Director"". The only thing that stood out in this film were special technical effects. They make the film worth watching but don't expect the plot to be as sophisticated as the effects. Consider the plot to be on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon."

","So we had been wanting to go a cinema and see this in 3D but never got to do that and soon as it was on the shelf at the DVD store I grabbed it along with popcorn drinks and chocolate. We were excited to watch this movie on our own cinema. Right at the beginning I felt it was so far fetched with Clooney floating round and Bullock with her non experience supposedly allowed to even be there. It made me physically ill like on a roller coaster at times and freaking me out so I suppose that was good, but nearly the whole movie with only Bullock alone no dialogue was such a let down. I had expected a lot more in the whole story line but this was just not to be. Found the ending bizzar too, whole thing too far fetched and laughable really. At the end hubby and I looked and said ""fail"". I give it 5 for the effects and fact it made me experience the dizziness. The rest gets a zero from us."

","Clooney and Bullock are fantastic, and the cinematography as well as sound editing are spellbinding. That's it. The script is rife with clich√©s (""half the world is about to lose their Facebook"" ""sunny with a chance of space debris"" as well as random dumb attempts at humour - a Ping Pong paddle floating in the Chinese space station - just come off as subtle racism and idiotic). If Apollo 13 could be completely accurate then Gravity has no excuse... Explaining that nothing survives in space, there's no air, etc is insulting, random bouts of gravity (Clooney is pulled into the void of space by absolutely nothing) and use of the Canada arm without referencing it's makers. This is Apollo Thirteen if it was written by M. Night Shymalan and directed by Michael Bay. Completely illogical, inaccurate, slow and unrealistic. Cuaron is so much better than this. Considering how beautiful this looks, it's a damn shame they didn't put more effort into the script and the more intricate details. <br/><br/>Go rent ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" it's still wondrous and still holds up, and it's worlds better than this waste of talent."

And special it was most certainly not.<br/><br/>While I had some problem watching it till the end I always try to do so, hoping something good will still follow. With this movie however, I was left with waiting for more when the end credits were rolling.<br/><br/>The visuals are absolutely fantastic, make no mistake in that.

"tmf084","7","1","3","26 February 2014"," not bad, not brilliant
","Basically it's like Open Water in Space but with amazing visual effects. What I liked about this movie is Sandra Bullock's performance and how she conveyed the state of mind of the character with the limited possibilities to express emotions she had. I always felt to understand what went thru her head and how she felt. So it was rather easy to care for her and keep me invested. What I didn't like was Clooney's character and how he was written (maybe performed) - I'm sure they wanted to make him appear as a strong, experienced commander who knows exactly how to react in every situation and therefore has time to joke around. But instead he came off as someone who doesn't really care what's going on around him and what it means for himself. He even borders to a shallow 1 dimensional comic relief instead of a serious counterpart to Bullock's part. Though this doesn't make the movie worse it could have made it better if they had gotten his part right.<br/><br/>Additionally a plus is that they at least tried to portray space realistically - mainly how they managed to handle the no sound thing. With music and switching between interior (spacesuit) and exterior shots it generated a vibe that increased the dramatic effect. Basically a similar approach Whedon tried in Firefly. However while most of the physics were portrayed close enough to overlook some of the flaws. The scene were Clooney floats away contradicts the law of physics too much. And since it's a rather prominent moment in the plot it casts a light on all the other errors they made. From a dramatic point of view this cliffhanger moment was probably necessary but maybe they would have found a different way that doesn't defy Newton.<br/><br/>My summary: it's a fun movie to watch, with a good plot and an interesting bottom line. If you're a space fan and you get easily riled up by finding errors in movies then you shouldn't expect too much."

There are only two characters, Sandra and George, and all they do is float around, drifting, drifting, drifting. I only know that George's character is a veteran astronaut "" in command of his last flight before retiring"", from reading this on IMDb...I do not KNOW THIS from seeing the movie, because the movie EXPLAINS NOTHING !! I also know that Sandra is a medical engineer "" on her first ever space mission "" only from reading IMDb, not FROM SEEING THE MOVIE, because the movie explains nothing ! The 90 minutes that we saw, was great for a middle of a movie, but there was no beginning and no ending. We wanted to see Sandra and George at home first, or at the space center, to learn who they are and what they will be doing in space. And at the end, we wanted to see a rescue party save Sandra and see her home...we wanted a resolution.<br/><br/>I only recommend this movie to people who are big fans of either Sandra Bullock or George Clooney."

She is clearly not fit for space flight and she never would have made it in the first place.

"drqshadow-reviews","9","1","3","17 February 2014"," A Rip-Roaring Crush of Emotions, Gravity Doesn't Let Up Until the Credits Crawl
","A fascinating blend of opposing extremes, Gravity is gripping and white-knuckle intense from the word go, but also unexpectedly intimate as a character study. Many of its successes are due to an excellent application of sound design, which flutters from loud, echoey destruction to the sudden stillness of panicked breathing amidst the silence of a total vacuum. Outstanding visual effects up the ante a few more notches, expertly visualizing the helpless chaos of a rapidly-compounding disaster in low orbit in a way that's both picturesque and graphically terrifying. That the rules and environments are all so foreign and unfamiliar only makes it easier for the viewing audience to forget that so much of what we're seeing is CG. The underlying moral is more than a little blunt, and a few laws might get bent along the way, but to zero in on those is to ignore the focus of the ride itself. A cinematic roller coaster in the truest sense of the word, it's one of the most physically suspenseful experiences I've ever sat through."
"luxiangdong","5","1","3","5 February 2014"," Brilliant Visuals, But Not Great Movie
","The visual effects of the movie Gravity are absolutely stunning. Through 3D and IMAX, the breathtaking view of the earth and space is supremely beautiful. The reflection from the helmet seems frighteningly real. When they are hit by debris, everything was crushing apart and Ryan was thrown out alone, tumbling. The set was enormously impressive.<br/><br/>Many people, women specially, don't like this movie because the plot is rather out-of-date. Only two active characters in the movie, and most of time it is only Ryan Stone who is playing. It doesn't make sense that only two of them outside the spaceship survived whereas the all crew inside died from the debris-attack. And it is more ridiculous that every time Ryan operates the spacecraft, the Russian space station or Chinese space station, evil things always happen. It seems that dysfunctions of facilities were the only way to spin the movie out. The only funny part is Ryan was propelled with a fire extinguisher, which reminds me of Wall-E, which has a similar plot. Likely, in the Wall-E, the earth is surrounded by the cloud of the debris, which becomes a catastrophe in the movie Gravity. When Dennis Tito became the first space tourist in 2001, a new era began. Nowadays it seems that everyone, even students at middle school can send something into the space, which at last will turn into the debris floating about. In fact the environment of outer space is easily destroyed; in this movie, an unintentional explosion of a Russian satellite killed all spacecraft one after another. Maybe it is time to consider protecting outer space, not just our own immediate environment."

Also there are a lot of unconvincible, trashy things that I'd rate this movie watchable and 7 only if real astronaut explained it to me as believable.

"jdkraus","9","1","3","20 January 2014"," Alfonso Cuaron's eye of terror in space
","Space. The place where there is no sound. No life. Nothing. Alfonso Cuaron's new hit film is set against this backdrop. Simply calling ""Gravity"" a big-budget a space film does not serve it justice. The focus is on two astronauts, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who are on a mission to repair an old satellite. With a ten-minute single shot introduction, Cuaron introduces us to these individuals, revealing their personalities via comical banter and progressive dialog. Stone is on her first assignment, a little jittery while Kowalski is a veteran and an easygoing kind of guy. This scene would be boring for any other movie besides this one. The visuals and fluid camera movements from one character another is so mind-boggling that you find yourself feeling like your floating in space with them. Seeing this in 3D really helps this perspective. Characters and items drift right into you! <br/><br/>This more than extraordinary intro is interrupted with a violent flow of debris from a destroyed Russian satellite forcing the characters into a game of gliding survival. Anything can happen to these individuals and one bad thing after another follows. Will the characters die? Or will they make it back to earth in one piece? That is the fun for us with the remaining 80 minutes. Many fellow critics have more or less criticized this film for its constant defiance of physics. Yes, Cuaron pushes the boundaries of what would really happen in space. There are times where the audience, along with myself chuckle at the limitation that push the suspension of disbelief. Even some clich√© plot devices of the film survival genre are utilized. Putting all that aside, ""Gravity"" excels on so many other levels. The most prominent is the visuals. It is more than a guarantee that this movie is going to win for Visual Effects category. They have depth and are photo-realistic. You really feel like that you witnessing space and earth from a distance. The cinematography, both CG and real-life is beyond words. The movements and lighting techniques evoke the darkness and sudden bright light of the stars and sun. Another gold statue. It would be a crime if it did not win.<br/><br/>The second aspect that makes ""Gravity"" spectacular is the usage, or rather no use of sound. After all, there is no sound waves to travel or reflect off of in space. Many scenes only record the voices and grunts of the actors when things are growing perilous. The sound effects that are manufactured for the film are cool when used. They add that deep space, sounding element (if there is such a way to put it). A neat method used to emphasize the magnitude of the situation is Steven Price's score. His music, flawlessly mixed with synth and orchestra, captures the direness and intensity of the movie. It grows loud, often overtaking some moments to the point of bombastic levels. The ending piece adds a new element of uplifting hope. Another gold statue. <br/><br/>The third thing that works for this film is the story. I do not praise the creativity of it. There really is not too much to offer in this regard. However, the spin that Cuaron takes with this movie is unique. He makes a simple idea of survival and broadens it into a terrifying and unimaginable scenario. Many sci-fi films often are about survival, ex: Alien, Prometheus, and The Thing. But no other feature has done so purely in characters gliding in space. He does so without making it dull (which is a big trap with this kind of film) or pretentious. No real story is ever original. Just ask James Cameron with ""Avatar."" However, like Jim, Cuaron made a fun alternative with it. <br/><br/>The fourth factor is the acting. Sandra Bullock as Stone is pretty much in every minute of the film. She has unfortunately gotten sort of a bad rap from the kind of movies she has made. Nevertheless, I always considered her a fine actress. Here, she gives perhaps her most humane character ever. She is forced into perhaps the most terrifying situation imaginable and reacts with all the ingredients of any sane person: fear, anxiety, agitation, depression, submissiveness, and ultimately defiance. She does so with believability, with and without the astronaut helmet. One scene in particular, she evokes complete, empathic helplessness. The audience's reaction? Silence. Her accolade nominations are more than understandable and deserving. George Clooney does not reach the same level. Rather, he takes the back seat on this one, acting more like his charming, funny self than anything.<br/><br/>The final thing that makes ""Gravity"" a great film is Cuaron's direction. This is not only seen in the visuals and the acting, but in its delivery. Every shot captured in this film is done so with perfection. His eye of terror in space has set a new standard in science-fiction that has not been seen in about 20 years. He gives us a vision that is something to see, hear, feel, remember, and above all experience. I find it almost an injustice that this movie will be converted to online viewing and Blu-Ray. This movie is meant for the big screen and in 3D. I really hope that this majestic edge will not be lost because of the small screen compression.<br/><br/>Mr rating: 10/10"

Space movie is not so easy with zero gravity setting but the fact that he pulled it off is just worth taking a seat and admiring the technical achievement. Brings the fragile side and the loneliness side of humanity played well by Sandra and Clooney. Visual effects are stellar. Can't tell CG from real. Well done!!"

","I'm still shaken up from what I saw, amazing experience. The movie is a thrill ride unlike any other I have seen. <br/><br/>The movie is pretty short, clocking in about 1 hour and 20 mins only. The story is pretty basic and straightforward. A crew of Astronauts are in earth space orbit and something goes wrong, now they are in a fight for their survival. What sets it apart is how it was all executed. There is a good amount of symbolism and hidden meaning in this movie. Stuff like Acceptance, Moving on etc. Sandra Bullock gave a pretty good performance as a terrified Astronaut struggling to survive. George clooney was his usual charming self, he has perfected that role. <br/><br/>From the get go, you'll see that the movie is breathtakingly BEAUTIFUL. The cinematography is amazing, the CGI is amazing, the scenery is amazing, it just melts your eyes. One of the best looking movie ever. The views of Earth are oh so mesmerizing. The action/destruction scenes are really thrilling and impactful. You don't hear anything (no sound in space), just see stuff getting shredded and destroyed in an awesome yet terrifying way. There is just something very eerie yet great about how it was handled, LOVED IT. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is equally amazing. It switches from beautiful emotional score during emotional or mesmerizing scenes from really tense and thrilling score during action/destruction scenes, enhancing everything to a new level. <br/><br/>Make sure to watch it in HD with a good sound system, lights off and no disturbances. It enhances the experience, trust me. The immersion factor in this movie matters a lot. I only wish I could have seen it in Cinema in 3D.<br/><br/>One of the best movie of last year and one of the most visually stunning movie EVER. Definitely a BLU-RAY buy for me. <br/><br/>8.8/10"

","Despite a mere 91-minute running time, director Alfonso Cauron makes every minute count with a gripping story of survival against impossible odds. The visuals in this film are so beautiful, it's almost as if it should be part of the National Air & Space Museum's archival footage. The action sequences are heart-pounding and relentless. Sandra Bullock pulls out all the stops with her picture-perfect performance. If you've seen this movie, you could probably imagine Ryan Stone being you in that situation. I walked away from this movie wondering what might happen if I were forced to confront such a predicament. This small, yet masterfully made film has it all. Emotion, action, suspense, comedy, drama, horror, you name it. Maybe not as broad of a scope in its plot as we've come to expect in recent years, but most certainly a movie that is a true testament to the human spirit. <br/><br/>With the Oscar nominations just around the corner, here are my choices to nominate this film for:<br/><br/>BEST PICTURE BEST ACTRESS BEST DIRECTOR (potential front-runner) BEST FILM EDITING BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY (potential front-runner) BEST ORIGINAL SCORE BEST SOUND EDITING (potential front-runner) BEST SOUND MIXING BEST VISUAL EFFECTS (potential front-runner)"

","This film was not what I expected - I was actually pleasantly surprised! That doesn't, however, mean it was the brilliant film most have been raving about. The cinematography / cgi work was breathtaking and stood out for most of the film. There was action. Really! And a lot of it! I caught myself on a few occasions glued to the screen, apprehension drawn all over my face. Sadly, my face appeared to have more emotion that that of Sandra Bullock's Dr Ryan. Both she and Clooney (playing the somewhat garrulous astronaut Kowalski) appeared to be going through the motions giving underwhelming performances. As the film progressed the situations Dr Ryan found herself in became increasingly more ridiculous. It all begins with the Russians bombing their own satellite by accident (already, facepalm) creating debris and initiating a chain-reaction of events. And yes, the physics of it all was not as accurate as some might want you to believe. Clich√©s galore, let's also chuck in a side-story about the protagonist's massive personal loss from her recent past - to make her more approachable? Likable? Believable? Oh, wait, to add the existential dilemma needed for added emotional gravitas to the film! Right¬Ö.. Yet one would be able to suspend their belief if the dialogue supported it. In this film, it didn't. It was, frankly, quite juvenile at times. This could of been for me the masterpiece others saw had more effort been put in parts of the plot and most of the dialogue (the later being what I'm holding responsible for both Bullock and Clooney's subpar performances). In summary, NOT the innovative masterpiece expected, however a watchable pop-corn movie nonetheless."

","6 - simply because of the wonderful depiction of space and what it might feel like floating above the Earth in a space suit, surrounded by a few tools and machines that keep humans alive in unimaginably hostile ... nothingness. Space is inexplicable, this film transferred how it might feel to be human in that environment.<br/><br/>However: Clooney, although getting better with age, reminded me of BuzzLightyear that turned me off him in the first place. I think astronauts are professional scientists and Space is no place for a joker<br/><br/>Bullock did an admirable job but adhered to the female stereotype (as did Clooney the male counterbalance). Basically it was too emotional and tried too hard to draw you in to an all-too-human drama, when the vastness of space needed not the intensity of overpowering music to help you feel something.<br/><br/>Plot: just went from bad to worse.

Since then I've avoided the more-expensive 3D films, but I wound up watching Gravity in 3D, and I have to admit that I find it difficult to imagine how it would be without it. Directed by Cuaron, this is an artist really thinking through the technology rather than simply tossing out cool effects. The opening space walk scene is amazing not because a bunch of things fly at the camera, but because you just have this amazing sense of floating in 3D space.<br/><br/>The movie is stunningly filmed, and its suspenseful story of survival is consistently engrossing and well paced. It is so well written and filmed that it is probably quite good even in 2D, but if any movie makes the case for 3D as a tool for serious film making, it is this one."

","Space. Silence. These two terms are a perfect description of the movie. You would think then there is no action in the movie, that the movie is rather boring in general. But you would be so wrong. There is a lot of action. Besides the happening, which is shown perfectly, regardless the methods, technology or computer animation used, there is an action, or better to say quite a storm also in the main actors minds. The first one seems very superficial and shallow, however full of wisdom, in the second character there is fight going on, for which space as a scenery is perfect place to take. A place of piece, a place of silence to think about. George is great, his stories are macho alike, yet behind this shell there is just a human who is scared and trying to convince the others he is not and vice versa, showing he is respectful to space but brave enough at the same time, even though only fictitiously. Sandra is, as usual, perfect in her role. She contributes her ""spice"" just in a sufficient quantity. Her attractiveness is also not distracting you from the initial movie intention, that is piece, that her character deserves. Dive in to Gravity, you will not regret it."
"Amari-Sali","6","1","3","23 December 2013"," A movie which relies more so on special effects than substance.
","Trigger Warning(s): Jump Scare depicting body frozen to death<br/><br/>I saw this film out of curiosity since it made over half a billion dollars, and since I don't think I have seen a film about someone drifting, or stuck, in space since Moon came out about 4 years ago. Then, to add onto the interest of seeing the film, Sandra Bullock is in it and Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted about it, albeit its inaccuracies, but still he said he enjoyed it overall. So with an actress who rarely fails, in modern times, and an astrophysicist I quite admire, I thought why not? <br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>Gravity is similar to I Am Legend, in a way, for most of the film features one sole actor, in this case actress, who we focus on. Said character is Dr. Ryan Stone (played by Sondra Bullock) who we learn very little about, besides she lost her child when she was 4 and now is working in space. Alongside her, for maybe 20 minutes to a half hour, is Matt Kowalski (played by George Clooney) who is Clooney's usual go to charming character but, again, someone we don't learn much about.<br/><br/>As for the story, all 90 minutes of it deal with Dr. Stone trying to get home after a Russian satellite is destroyed and creates space debris which makes getting to earth nearly seem impossible. Add Matt sacrificing himself for Dr. Stone and then you have this inexperienced Dr. who you are left with, and a movie focused on us wondering if she may end up another causality or may return home?<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>When it comes to praise, the almost sole thing worth praising are the visuals. One thing Dr. Tyson noted is that the film truly, visually, is stunning and can inspire someone to want to learn more about space. I'd even say that if a TV company wanted to advertise their latest 4K or 3D screen, this would be the go to movie for it.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>But, to me, outside of the visuals in the film, the rest was boring. From the dialog to the characters, I just felt there was no real attempt to have the audience connect with the characters. Dr. Stone has no real personality and while we are given that one tidbit about her daughter, outside of that she has nothing to draw you to her. And in comparison to other films which rely heavily off one sole actor, like I Am Legend, even her trials and tribulations don't really get you interested in her. If anything, it just makes you want to praise the special effects members and the cinematographers, but certainly not Bullock.<br/><br/>Overall: TV Viewing<br/><br/>I have no regrets not seeing this in theaters. If I want to see a high definition look of space, there are museums and other places to go which specialize in this topic and can explain things to me. As for Gravity, though I'm sure I am in the minority, I think all it has is its visual appeal and everything else is lacking. Hence why I say it is for TV viewing, especially if you have one of the newer TV sets. Otherwise, I would dare even say to skip it."
"shoutsatpigeons","5","1","3","22 December 2013"," Gravity Falls Flat
","My review of Gravity<br/><br/>First off the good, visually it is stunning and some of the action sequences are truly jaw dropping, especially in 3D. The tension is also high, particularly at the start as the feces hits the proverbial fan. Sadly that is all it has going for it, whoever wrote the script needs shooting, some of the dialogue is utterly cringeworthy. One of my biggest problems with this movie is thus: If you are going to have one of the characters spend a long time alone don't have them talk to themselves every few seconds to explain to the viewer how they feel or what's going on, a good actor will show their thoughts and emotions through their body language and facial expressions. Unfortunately the writers for Gravity consider the actors to inept and the audience too stupid to have to pull this off and I'm insulted by that. You're also forcefed the obligatory 'emotional bit' near the end that was so painful to watch I wanted to get up and walk out. In conclusion I do not recommend this movie without being at least fairly inebriated.<br/><br/>5/10 (I gave an extra point for Sandra Bullock's legs which are impressive)"
"antagonist117","6","1","3","13 December 2013"," A great lead and a beautiful production that deserved a better story
","Gravity opens with some of the best-looking space vistas in recent movie history. It makes much use of 3D, with astronauts flying past and objects floating toward the camera, which has a dizzying effect similar to what Sandra Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone, reports feeling while making upgrades to the Hubble. The movie quickly jolts into an intense scene that leaves Dr. Stone breathless and probably has a similar effect on most viewers. In the long, unbroken moment when Stone is recovering from the shock, the film seems on the cusp of a lot of exciting and terrifying possibilities. One of the least interesting of these is that it could turn into a routine thriller, with an endless series of last-second escapes leading into endless new disasters as improbable as they are predictable. This is the route Cuaron chooses. At one point, it got so overbearing that I made myself chuckle at the thought of Bullock having to escape something as absurd as sharks and dinosaurs. It nearly gets there. Dr. Stone's personal arc is, unfortunately, not strong enough to compensate for the plot's failings, though Bullock is a compelling protagonist and it's easy to like and root for her. Probably not since Ripley has there been a female character who so singlehandedly carries a space movie on her shoulders, and for that reason if none other ""Gravity"" is a welcome addition to the sci-fi canon."
"SugarandIce","8","1","3","9 December 2013"," A visual feast.
","First off, if you haven't seen this film, go see it on the big screen today, preferably in 3D. Gravity has excellent CGI which it uses to bring us breathtaking shots of planet Earth and the silent tranquility of space. Sandra Bullock delivers a fine performance in this. The film is highly tense, especially earlier on. There are some nice emotional themes in this film that moved me.<br/><br/>Alright, so this film has received a lot of universal acclaim. However, I will say it is overrated. Yes, it is beautiful and fairly solid. But it suffers mostly from two factors that keep it from greatness. First, is George Clooney's character. He might as well have been a charismatic robot because his characters was utterly unrealistic. Second, around the last half of the movie, Murphy's Law apparently decides to set the universe against Sandra who miraculously doesn't die on several occasions. Willing suspension of disbelief takes some serious blows."
"deadandburied-858-346575","6","1","3","9 December 2013"," Boring?
","Well, I know a lot of people liked this movie and I don't mind, I just hoped I'd like it as well.. <br/><br/>The visuals are great. What I liked most about it was that it felt very real, there are no super technologized fiction-machines so you get to fully enjoy the ""out in the space"" experience and in this it excels. Don't think any other movie provides same level of atmospheric mood that is gently contained within ""believable"" limits.<br/><br/>However, with all that appreciated, I was constantly bugged by the ""simplicity"" of where things were going, and how it all turned out.<br/><br/>First, the movie starts with three astronauts fixing a machine part in the space - two man, one woman. The woman is the one fixing stuff, one of the guys is the ""commander"". They receive an alarm to abort, but the woman keeps fixing it with ""just a moment"" clich√©. Then things go wrong. So, if up until this I was genuinely enjoying the realness of it all, now I am watching somebody who was actually allowed into outer space to fix a machine ""postponing orders"". Okey, she is trained for just 6 months, but following orders should take about a minute to memorize.<br/><br/>Skipping it. At some point the movie starts to shift from ""this is about space"" to ""this is about me"". And the rest of it feels more like watching a person's journey to self-development more than anything else. The other characters are thrown off very easily. The spiritual aspect of the movie is OK, I mean facing your own demons, overcoming something and learning to move on is indeed important but not in any way original, new or brilliant for a movie. Even if it happens in the outer space.<br/><br/>So to wrap it up, I'm not sure how I felt about the change in the movie. I know I was supposed to care for the main character, but I was more annoyed at her for putting everyone's lives at risk. I just didn't find anything in particular amazing about the movie. Atmospheric movies require some patience in general, but with the plot very predictable the only thing I was left with were the visuals, and for that 6/10."

","A fantastic movie, riveting from start to finish; this film has a great story, is intensely realistic, and the acting is... hard to put one's finger on. George Clooney kills it as usual playing the confident, charismatic alpha male role and fills his role well. Sandra Bullock on the other hand, grated on my nerves throughout, though I'm unsure if I should blame her or blame the writer for the portrayal of the surviving female astronaut as a clueless, whining, and petulant child. The absolute inability of her character to deal with reality as it arrives wave after wave is hard to watch at points.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a family-friendly film that is terrifying solely through the realistic portrayal of the harrowing situations a modern astronaut could still reasonably face while in orbit."

","I know 3D films are, for the most part, not all that great, but I'm sure that if you can watch this in 3D you will not regret it. If you can get yourself to an IMAX all the better.<br/><br/>The special effects are pretty much flawless, the only minor detail that broke the illusion for me was that Sandra's hair wasn't all floaty like when someone is underwater. This was the only thing that stopped me believing they'd managed to simulate zero g's somehow, it's really that convincing. <br/><br/>Watching this is kind of like being in one of those simulators at a theme park, except the seats aren't moving, the special effects budget is thousands of times higher, and it's directed by a top notch movie maker. Sound fun?<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, some of the scenes - the opening for example, are just spellbinding. Lava lamps on steroids. <br/><br/>Movies recently have started to feel more and more like video games. Many great games have wonderful cinematographic sequences that switch to and from first-person perspective, infinite zooms and the freedom that comes with filming a virtual world with a virtual camera in a movie style. It seems that sfx are now powerful and real enough for this style of film-making to be used effectively in live action cinema.<br/><br/>Sweeping views that culminate in an in-helmet first-person view, complete with HUD made me feel like any minute now I'd be given control over the protagonist. This doesn't come off cheesy if it sounds that way - it adds to the immersion. <br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Sandra Bullock, I can't really put my finger on why, just one of those things I suppose. I like the movie Speed, and miss congeniality was a good laugh but generally I don't really enjoy her on screen. Despite this I thought she did a really good job and if you feel the same way about her as I do, don't let that stop you from seeing this movie. The story itself is simple but strong enough, and there is a high level of tension that is sustained very well throughout the movie. Even if the format of the tension is a little bit wash-rinse, repeat. And god-damn it Sandra, your life is in danger could you please be a little bit more careful when you grasp onto one of those rungs?! yup; stressful.<br/><br/>A friend of mine remarked to me that they thought Sandra's backstory is a bit unnecessary, and I had to agree. The whole bit about her child doesn't really add anything to the movie other than a bit of a pity party that makes it all feel a bit wet. The situation she gets into is so incredibly desperate as it is, the idea of her not really wanting to live anymore anyway doesn't really hold water, pretty much anybody could lose the fight in those circumstances and we don't need a contrived history to explain her wanting to just give up.<br/><br/>I could be wrong about this but I think that while movies have always had a big influence on the way games are made, there is now some feedback into the loop with games influencing the style of movie-making, if only by having no limitation on camera position and movement and the way they offer a scene to the viewer in the knowledge that they are anticipating to ""become"" one of the protagonists."
"AacCento1","7","1","3","4 December 2013"," Good Film, awesome effects, less talking please!
","This was an incredible film visually, it kept you on the seat of your pants throughout. Sandra Bullock was a good fit to her part, George Clooney however was in no way believable as an Astronaut. Where the film was confident visually, the dialogue really did not help. I felt at the end as did my friend that it would have benefited from a lot less dialogue and back story which was not necessary at all and felt like a filler required for the majority audience. If the film had been filmed in a foreign language and I had not understood a word it would have had more impact. Great films that are suspenseful do not need dialogue to assist, it is in the quiet and with the music and sound and visual views that one really gains a sense of Space. The music was absolutely fantastic. A good film but perhaps could have benefited with a little less Hollywood style influences."

","On the face of it, Gravity doesn't sound like a bunch of fun. The film is pretty much entirely based on a monologue from Sandra Bullock with occasional support from George Clooney. Bullock plays Ryan Stone who is a medical engineer on a space flight. Things go wrong and she is supported by Matt Kowalsky a veteran astronaut. <br/><br/>Amazingly the movie is a lot better than you imagine beforehand. The acting of Bullock and Clooney is fine and the visuals are amazing. It's very hard to believe that the movie wasn't actually shot in space or a gravity free environment. It's also in 3d and a rare example where the format really works well. Very enjoyable!"

","What Gravity does extremely well at is transporting the viewer into space. The floaty camera-work is absolutely brilliant and during the action it's sometimes just damn stunning! Action films could learn a lot from Gravity, as a lot of this film is done in singular long takes which is much more tense and involving to watch than frantic quick cut editing which makes it impossible to see what's going on. I also enjoyed the POV shots which literally put the viewer in Sandra's shoes (or space boots?) and create some fantastic disorientation. The visuals are also consistently amazing. It's hard to believe that basically everything is CGI because it all looks so very real. Even Gravity's biggest critics have to at least appreciate the amount of work that has gone on in the visual department.<br/><br/>However, I doubt that Gravity's stint in IMDb's top 250 will last. Gravity is very much a cinema film. It's a film that has to be experienced on a big screen and in 3D to get everything out of it. At home, on your 20"" black and white portable TV-video combo it won't look so impressive. In fact, a lot of people will find it quite boring to be quite frank. The pacing in Gravity is very slow at times, which I didn't mind, but it could become a chore with multiple viewings. My guess is that the novelty will quickly wear off when it hits our DVD shelves. Part of the excitement of Gravity is not knowing what's going to come next! I was wondering how they were going to make a feature length film from two people bobbing about in space, but they managed it and for the first time it's great! However, when you strip down Gravity, plot-wise, you'll find that there's not too much going on.<br/><br/>The film is all about survival and Sandra puts on an excellent performance as Ryan Stone. The idea of being lost in space is a pretty terrifying one and it's perfectly executed here. Unfortunately, George isn't quite so good. He seems more like a spare part and is only there to look good. Although to be fair, his character isn't too well written. He just seems like some babbling idiot who's not fazed by anything, which is difficult to believe. Gravity is mostly a one-woman show though and Sandra makes Ryan a compelling character. There are some surprisingly emotional scenes as well which are just as impressive as the big set-pieces.<br/><br/>Gravity has fallen into the hype machine a little bit. I don't think it's the best film of the year. It's more like a ride that'll quickly ware thin with multiple viewings. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and I thought that the 3D was used really well, but I wouldn't be in a hurry to see it again. I also didn't find it as intense as others did. I think Black Swan and last year's The Dark Knight Rises are far more intense pieces. Gravity is very suspenseful though and masterfully shot. It's well worth seeing, but be sure to make your first time the best. Seek out the biggest screen you can, put on your 3D glasses and let the film sweep you away. It might not be the best space film ever made, but it's a very entertaining and sometimes incredibly stunning piece of work."

","The limited talents of the Hollywood stars fit perfectly into this minimally plotted survival film. And if there has been a more faithful depiction of space, I haven't seen it. The little saccharin, needed for this otherwise austere show to be swallowed by a studio executive, is quite forgivable. <br/><br/>Along with Avatar, this film knows why it is using 3D. It allows the eye to pick out details (like a coming astronaut) without camera tricks.<br/><br/>One of the attractions is one and a half hours of simplicity. In the current film world of back stories, jump cuts, twists, side plots, non linearity etc, I have to admit this makes a welcome break. In many ways this film is a throwback to previous decades. <br/><br/>Within the bounds of what this film offers, it delivers everything with aplomb. With so little to distract from the survival plot, you could argue that the film has few ways to fall of the rails. But it is up to the director to select his target and execute against it."

Clooney's performance is slightly bland but Sandra Bullock is great in this and gives a knock-out performance, a solid pick for an Academy Award. ""Gravity"" lacks a little in dialog, there are some corny lines and there are several glaring scientific errors, but it's still neat, overall entertaining and hard not to enjoy. Go see it."

","I saw this in the movie theater and watched it in 3D, so I certainly saw this movie the way it was preferred by those responsible for Gravity.<br/><br/>The film is decent but nothing special. The story is interesting, but didn't translate well by the director, who probably focused all his efforts on the visuals, rather than the story. The visuals are interesting, especially in the first 15 minutes, but after that, you're used to it (at least I was), and it's less impressive. Still, I'm sure it's going to get nominated, and probably win lots of Academy Awards in the technical categories. <br/><br/>So why the critical slobbering over this movie? For whatever reason, film critics are obviously so in love with George Clooney that it really doesn't matter what he does...they're going to hail it as a masterpiece. I'm sure he's a nice guy and everything, but is this the reason why they adore his films? Do they think if they give a good review to his movie that Clooney will let them hang out with him and get them laid? I made the mistake of watching Up in the Air, and couldn't believe how bad it was. I avoided, ""The Descendents,"" because I knew I wasn't going to like it as much as the critics, and after I saw it on HBO (or one of those pay channels), I thought it was OK, but nothing special. But with the nearly unanimous high acclaim that this film received, I felt I had no choice but to see what all the hubbub was about.

I accept that the authenticity of every detail should not be an issue since the film is not a documentary; the overall representation and a commitment to scientific truth should suffice. Moreover, even though the film does not introduce or assume any new scientific breakthrough, it is set in future and that makes the story 'Science Fiction' and in SF liberties with technical and technological details are permitted. I have no problem with that.<br/><br/>The problem that I have goes beyond these issues.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of science fiction. For example, stories by Arthur C Clarke. In 'Fountains of Paradise' Clarke describes how the Earth acquires 'spokes' all along the Equator, extending into space to a distance where there is no gravitational attraction pulling an object to the Earth. He postulates development of a synthetic crystal with tremendous tenacious strength. And as an appendix to the novel he presents plans and schemes of such 'towers' already put on paper in great detail by scientists and engineers. As a result, a story which could have been exotic, becomes plausible and comes down into the realm of engineering projects planned and executed by present-day mortals. In 'Rendezvous with Rama' he observes (as a part of the story) that not a few spacecraft accidents are the result of the distraction caused by the unstoppable oscillations in weightless conditions of the two orbs human females and therefore female astronauts possess. Clarke is always conscious of the laws of physics which provide the frame in which everything in his novels happens and so, when the alien spacecraft accelerates towards the Sun without any apparent push, someone exclaims, ""There goes Newton's Third Law!""<br/><br/>Such attention to the manifestation of laws of science in day-to-day life is not an exception in SF. I call such SF as engineering fiction because in it the exotic, fantastic happenings are subordinated to the universally valid Laws of Physics. Such references give an air of familiarity to the tale which then transcends its futuristic setting and attains a sort of contemporary existence; albeit in a parallel universe.<br/><br/>As an avid reader of science fiction, I have a second home in that parallel universe. I do not have to suspend my logical judgment there; all I am required to do is to accept some new contraption or some such technological advancement which is a part of the common existence of the parallel universe. What happens in 'Gravity' is commonplace to a resident of that universe and one does not applaud the commonplace.<br/><br/>It may sound presumptuous but the film began and in a few moments, I had the feeling of being 'at home'. There it was, 'home' and someone had created limelight all around it. My heart swelled. The film being 3-D, I wanted to say 'Hi' to the ones at home, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, without disturbing them of course. They were busy with some repair work and while Sandra was serious and sombre, George was his usual composed self, spreading the contagion of composure - which is more than confidence - into others.<br/><br/>During the interval and after the film, I became aware that I had company. And they near unanimously praised the ambiance and the floating tear drop and the upside down image refracted in it and the 'normal' of the place being expressed so evocatively in the never ending slow motion and the bumps and of course the silence. Their chatter irritated me: this is how my home is, you ignorant guys! I wanted to exclaim at them.<br/><br/>I loved George that he was so composed even the gravest danger and I adored Sandra that though she talked to herself a lot - all alone for a million miles around you; anyone will talk like that - but she did not go into hysterics, was not even heroic but doggedly went on and on and on and laughed at herself a little when she had difficulty standing up in earthly gravity.<br/><br/>I liked the film for taking me home. Come to think of it, I should say, I adored the film. The problem is, these words will be so commonplace if I utter them to anyone at all. They all claim to adore it! How can I explain to them that my joy is different from their pleasure?<br/><br/>Got to see Gravity a few more times to notice and then cherish the smaller details, the nuances one so takes for granted while at home. I just don't want to be in an awestruck crowd, gawking at some exotic object."

","The film keeps you interested in an interesting way. It seems like the kind of film that wouldn't have much to other with the basic story line but the overall experience is pulled off phenomenally. With a few minor things here and there where you feel as if the character is just doing silly things so that the story line can be dragged out a little longer it was still suspenseful almost every time.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil the ending but I will say that I have mixed feelings about it, even though it was good it feels as if it was cut off a little short.<br/><br/>The visuals were stunning and I would easily believe it was actually shot in space if I didn't know any better.<br/><br/>Overall a fantastic film.

This type of film could have gone for 100% realistic and strive for perfection, rather than try and be 50% realistic and 50% Hollywood-fun-but-fake, so as to try to allure audiences from both sides.<br/><br/>Acting: I have to say mediocre. I can't but compare Sandra Bullock to Sigourney Weaver in Alien. A strong female battles for survival.

"Ricardo-36","7","1","3","6 November 2013"," Gravity's charm is in it's bare simplicity, but it brings along flaws
","This is how I would explain Gravity to someone who has not seen the movie, without spoilers, but explaining exactly what they will see:<br/><br/>First, take a regular, Michal Bay-ish screenplay about a space disaster. Got it? OK, so now, you take the first 20 pages off (usually the first act), and throw them out. Now, rip off the last 10 pages (the conclusion of act 3), and also throw them out. Now, you get a black marker pen and cross out every single reference or dialog involving:<br/><br/>* Any character except George Clooney's or Sandra Bullock's. * Any scenes set in Houston or at other space stations. * Any references to explosions, any references to how things should sound.<br/><br/>Now, you get what is left and rewrite it to make it 3 times simpler, but keeping any actions scenes you had.<br/><br/>OK? Now, it's time to shoot this baby. So first, you gotta have Cuaron (the director) watch 4 movies over and over again in order to get the feel and the references:<br/><br/>1- Pixar's WALL-E. 2- Alfred Hitchcock's Rope 3- Any space walk scene from Brian de Palma's Mission 2 Mars 4- His own Children of Men one shot car sequence<br/><br/>OK, now, make sure you get the best technical crew in Hollywood - because this movie needs to look GREAT.<br/><br/>When it's time to mix the audio, all the audio channels with noise, mute them. If the audio guys complain, threat to fire them.<br/><br/>Jokes aside...<br/><br/>This is exactly how this movie feels. A bare basic second act of a great action film. Yeah, there are technical inconsistencies and plot holes. Yeah, George Clooney is playing himself again... But the charm of this movie is how Cuaron kept the good parts, and only the good parts, and made it work. It's half of an action script with scenes that reminded me of (the awful) Mission 2 Mars, but done in a good way. However, it's simplicity and stripped elements bring the feel that ""something is missing"". Movies have a structure that takes decades to change, and although I am all in favor to change, this is a bit too much in a single direction. As for the long shots, it feels gimmicky sometimes.<br/><br/>All in all, a great theater experience, but not something generally amusing to see on a TV or, heaven's forbid, your cell phone. Go watch it."

","Don't go on a space mission with Sandra Bullock. You'll end up with a hole in your face. I mean I would watch the movie again in 3D to enjoy the amazing visuals, but once this movie hits DVD then I can only rely on the bombardment of senseless dialogue and relentless pieces of satellite after satellite. Why have Ed Harris constantly remind the audience about Apollo 13 (a much more responsible and grown up space movie)? Why the constant Oceans 11 smart talk from the most experienced astronaut on the team while the Russian guy is bouncing around on the tether like a 3 year old? Why is Sandra Bullock in space after crashing every simulator she's been in and totally incompetent? And why is every important structure in space within 100 miles of each other and on apparently the same exact orbital plane? And this all started cuz the Russians clumsily blew up their own satellite with a missile?? This movie should be called ""World's Dumbest Space Guys."" You cant even call them astronauts or respect any institution portrayed in this movie as legitimate without completely disregarding the amount of intelligence and preparation that goes into actual space missions. In 2 hours I saw Sandra Bullock single handedly destroy half of NASA. Then she lands and almost drowns. My gf and I were laughing during this scene. I couldn't take anymore"
"ccamp89","5","1","3","2 November 2013"," Beautifully Hollow.
","Film critics need to stop name-dropping 2001: A Space Odyssey. Seriously, enough. There's no quicker way of piquing my interest, and no better way of ensuring my disappointment. Don't get me wrong here. Gravity is a decent movie. It can be quite arresting in its best moments, remains visually stunning throughout, and is reasonably entertaining for most of its duration. You could certainly do a hell of a lot worse for the price of admission these days. But despite its considerable strengths, none of them amount to a truly great film worthy of the absolute universal acclaim it has garnered.<br/><br/>I'm not going to devote a whole lot of effort into explaining the strengths of the movie because they've basically been enumerated by nearly every single critical review on the internet. Yes, this is an undoubtedly gorgeous film. The visual fidelity is really something to behold, especially during scenes depicting space station destruction. The particle effects are definitely the most eye-popping I've ever seen. What's even more impressive than the visual effects though is the truly free-form, highly original camera-work and cinematography. The vast majority of the movie is shot with lengthy, tightly choreographed yet completely unhinged floating camera pans that are dizzyingly complex. The camera-work is really the most resounding success of the film as it completely creates that feeling of weightlessness and spatial disorientation that the characters are feeling and transmits all of that directly to the viewer.<br/><br/>So yes, Gravity is certainly a spectacle and a visual feast, but honestly that's where the good things I have to say about it end. Thematically, this movie is essentially barren. All that's really at its heart is a half-baked attempt at reversing a traumatic, potentially damaging experience into a moment of rebirth, reinvigoration, and self- actualization. It's not even an original idea to begin with, but this isn't a particularly compelling rendition and the characters are at fault. This has got to be some of the most bland, undercooked characterization I've ever seen in a film with such positive reviews. After spending a full hour and a half with Bullock's character, all I feel I've really learned about her is that she's pretty damn efficient at taking on and off a space suit. Oh, and she has a pretty impressive lung capacity. I'm obviously exaggerating a bit- there's a very vague back-story involving the death of her daughter which gives us some perspective into her decidedly withdrawn and, frankly, boring demeanor. But it just isn't substantial enough to make her intriguing as a character and makes it very difficult to really buy into her transformation at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>What's frustrating to me too is the fact that a lot of these issues could've been resolved with a little more exposition. This isn't a long movie at all. It easily could've been 30 minutes longer without even the remote danger of being bloated. Just 30 extra minutes of scenes devoted to characterization could've done wonders for the film and really gave it some weight and emotional resonance. Bullock's breakdown scene in the fuel-less escape pod is the perfect glimpse into the movie this could've been. It's by far the best scene in the movie and the only time where I was truly absorbed in the story rather than just admiring the pretty visuals. In this moment, Bullock's character shows a moment of complete vulnerability as she realizes the bleakness of her situation. She is completely alone, both in the overtly obvious physical sense but also in an emotional sense as well. This is such brilliant moment because it takes the character's emotional isolation since the death of her daughter and weaves it directly into her current physical isolation, creating a nice metaphor that instantly breathes life into the movie and gives it a sense of purpose. The character has essentially been drifting in this dead escape pod ever since her daughter died, and it isn't until this moment that she has finally come to terms with it. <br/><br/>This moment is just as fleeting as it is powerful though, and it comes off as too little too late at this point. I do have some other more minor quibbles with different scenes in the movie that I thought were handled poorly as well. Early on in the film there's a nice moment where Clooney's character says something to the effect of ""nothing beats the view"" and the camera pans over Earth with some really nice ambient music that kicks in. But as it re-circles back to Clooney the music fades to complete silence a little abruptly and the transition into more dialogue feels awkward. There's also a particularly hokey moment where Bullock's character verbally compares her flight in the escape pod to the times where she would ""just drive"" after her daughter's accident. It comes off as a very forced attempt to integrate the relatively useless back-story into the present moment and just ends up being cringe-worthy. There's definitely more moments like this too- Bullock's howling along with the dog on the radio transmission or the corny, triumphant line of dialogue towards the end where she essentially announces something to the effect of ""well, whether I live or die this has been a hell of a ride!"" I realize these are relatively petty criticisms but the film stumbles like this enough for it to take me out of the moment and detrimentally affect the viewing experience.<br/><br/>At the end of the day though, this isn't an awful movie. It offers up some very compelling set pieces, unbelievable visuals, and some truly phenomenal camera-work that alone makes it worth the 10 bucks. But it's also a film that is ultimately very hollow, essentially devoid of compelling characters, and severely lacking in substance. Yes, it provides the superficial thrills and the eye candy. But for a film with so many accolades, it really leaves a lot to be desired."

","If you rented, downloaded, copied this movie, you've wasted your time as this film can ONLY be enjoyed on the big screen with 3D glasses on. Thumbs up to the graphics editor that was most likely the best part of the film. Other than that the movie lacks a proper plot, and it surprised me that such a good actress like Sandra Bullock was given a script that hears her breathing in and out, more than talking. Her hair was cut short which was a bit of a let down. Would have liked to see her long hair swaying in the Zero gravity (with added 3D effects)<br/><br/>Also, when you look through the cast all you see next to the names is (Voice). That brings you to wonder, couldn't the producers afford more actors? <br/><br/>I'm not an astronaut myself but it really seemed to me like it was a tad unrealistic but hey, aren't all movies?

It re-energized my desire to help build a positive future for humanity by creating a spacefaring civilization. The movie shows people living and working in Earth orbit - which is just the beginning of humanity's journey into space. This movie will encourage the safe and sustainable use of the vast resources of space for the betterment of humanity.

","First I think Gravity was a pretty good movie but I don't think it will be good if you don't see it in its release on the big screens of the movie theater.<br/><br/>It's a simple but very dramatic story but on the other hand I was bored for a lot of it. Way too much Sandra Bullock floating around. I have never disliked Sandra Bullock nor have I been a big fan, but in this it was just too much of her and I didn't think her performance was brilliant like some people obviously think, won't be surprised if she ends up getting nominated for an Oscar because of all of the hype but I don't think she honestly deserves to win one for this performance, good but not great.<br/><br/>George is too old to play an astronaut. There, I said it. He's what like 60 years old and we are supposed to believe that NASA would send a man that age up into space? At least that Clint Eastwood/Donald Sutherland movie about old timers going into space was supposed to be a comedy.<br/><br/>Some great effects obviously. But overall this movie is very overrated and just good but not great."

","This is, for short, an impressive series of pictures in 3D. The plot is nearly non-existent. It is a 3D experience but not what I came to watch. I came to watch a Film. You get the constant impression that some things are just there to show off what the graphics department can do. They try to make us feel attached to the characters using pointless sad side stories, and from my point of vue, totally failed. There are major flaws in the 'plot' which kills off the aim of the movie. They wanted something realistic, beautiful and extraordinary and the flaws just make the story unbelievable. Next the music. It controls and makes a film. Here, it is fabulous, maybe a bit overly dramatic, but, it does not suit Gravity. Space is all about the silence. But this music is constantly there, and ruins this moments that could have been wonderful if they were silent. Over all, Grativy is a great movie to watch if you want special effects, lovely scenery and a out-standing 3D experience. But if you want a film with a plot, this is not for you."

There is also plenty of cheese here. In fact our journey home had us picking over the physics and continuity errors - of which there are a few.

"donuthaters12","10","1","3","26 October 2013"," A Film That Is Frightening And Gorgeous
","Thrilling, tense, ambitious, exciting, beautiful, and horrific. These are the words that I mostly hear that is associated with this film and I can now safely say that it does live up to those words. It's praise from critics and general audience is definitely understandable as this film is a powerhouse in direction, cinematography, musical score, and visual effects.<br/><br/>The film is written by Jon√°s and Alfonso Cuar√≥n. Both have written a script that focuses much more on the survival of both Stone and Kowalsky, which I think is a great approach and also can be risky in being discarded as another thriller that does not break any new ground. Gravity does not feel campy as the story places these two characters in a situation that has the audience feeling tense and fearful of the unpredictability of space and the chance of not being able to breathe. The film does also touch on philosophical themes that had me understand the value of life.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n. who is best known for his work on the third Harry Potter film and Children of Men. Cuar√≥n is definitely a great storyteller and knows how to keep both simple and deep audiences to be thoroughly entertained. Cuar√≥n doesn't seem to try to create something unique but rather create something that would evoke something from the audience.<br/><br/>Gravity's photography is handled by Emmanuel Lubezki who is mostly known for his work on Terrence Malick's recent films. Gravity is simply a gorgeous film and definitely may be the prettiest film of the year. The photography captures the darkness and emptiness of space and supports the tension and tone that Cuar√≥n was going for. Visual effects also plays a role in making the film look and feel realistic. I watched the film in 3D, which i rarely do, but it definitely works in this film as debris come by the characters and sometimes come towards us and haves us looking away as it just feels so real and frightening. I cannot decide whether Lubezki's best work is either the emptiness and lifeless picture of Gravity or the beautiful image of life and nature of The Tree of Life.<br/><br/>The film's score is handled by Steven Price, who is a new composer as he has only really worked on three films. Price has cerated a score that kept me felt tense without me knowing that it was Price's score that caused me to flinch or shocked me. The last time a score that had my heart racing was Hans Zimmer's score on The Dark Knight Rises. Gravity's score definitely doesn't stand out in comparison to other thriller-action films in recent years but this doesn't retract from the score's effectiveness to get a reaction out of us.<br/><br/>The film's acting is driven by both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Bullock as Ryan Stone was great in showing the fear that one would feel when they are helpless in space. Clooney as Matt Kowalski portrays the rational thinking that is required from a person when a crises occurs, he is the voice in our head that we must try to listen to but sometimes is clouded by the anxiety and fear that we feel when a crises occurs. Both actors play well with each other and something I deeply enjoyed while watching this film. <br/><br/>Gravity is a intense thriller that haves the audience feeling fearful and anxious of the dangers of space while at the same time delivering a good score and an incredibly gorgeous photography. This is definitely a film that I would constantly come back to in the future as it's themes and approach resonates well with me."
"thefadingcam","8","1","3","25 October 2013"," The best 3D experience ever so far, and also a great artistic movie
","Alfonso Cuar√≥n created a visual experience that cannot be matched by any movie currently, period. And having watched it on 3D it felt like this was the only 3D was ever created, since this was the only 3D I have really ever enjoyed. Gravity is a successfully audacious movie that stretches contemplative pictures smoothly choreographed like a delicate dance into long takes (there is even an 18 minute long one). The silence of the space, the picture of earth, home, always on the background, associated with some beautifully positioned plans and adding only two characters transports the audience to a feeling that I honestly cannot remember with such intensity since 2001: A Space Odyssey, even if they are much, much different in presentation. There is a mix of digital techniques being used, as said by Cuar√≥n himself. Knowing that and seeing the result feeling so real is indeed outstanding. However this movie isn't an experimental exercise on art, and we have a storyline that needs to be addressed. Cuar√≥n keeps it simple and does it right yes, but there is some stuff that could be questioned. The storyline and character development is only briefly presented on screen even if it has a powerful meaning, leaving the question as if did Cuar√≥n meant to take a deeper study on humanity's condition in pure loneliness (and plus, out of its home) through that same human symbolic simpleness that ends up being showed on screen, or did Cuar√≥n just feel the need of supporting the movie with the characters backstory so that it could be a safer view for a larger audience? Whichever the answer, Gravity is a landmark, an author's work that changes the space genre for modern times as 2001: Space Odyssey did in 1968.

The movie goes very abruptly from cool if a little stupid space survival epic, to psychological study in dealing with trauma. And this is where all my interest in the movie stops. The idea in itself is not bad but it is so shallowly exploited and explored that no enjoyment can be had from these moments.<br/><br/>This along with the fact that there is a stupid amount of ""narrow"" escapes and way to many ""SYMBOLISM"" moments that reminds me more of 2012 a space odyssey than anything else."

I was 'disappointed only because of the hype'. Had I gone in not knowing anything, I would have thought it was a really good movie.<br/><br/>It is not a fast paced action movie. In fact, it focuses more on Sandra Bullock's character - and the different emotions she goes through as she finds herself in a very frightening position on her first trip to space.<br/><br/>I think that is where some people get lost. If you're looking for the whole move to be what you saw in the trailer - you're not going to find it. If you like going a little deeper - and appreciate symbolism etc - and don't mind a slower pace because of it - than you will really like this movie. *(SLIGHTLY SPOILER-ISH): You see Sandra Bullock going through a myriad of emotions - from intense panic, fear, strength, hopelessness, faith (and lack of), as well as watching her go from wanting to die to slowly finding her will to live again. You go on a journey learning, once again, how important your psyche is, when you find yourselves in situations that are out of your control. It's 'that' kind of movie.

The second half of this tale is neither believable, interesting nor realistic in any shape or form. Veteran astronaut, George Clooney appears far too cool during a major catastrophe in his attempt to save the damsel in distress, a medical engineer but inexperienced astronaut played by Sandra Bullock. Early on, local critical reviews rated very highly, some referring to a modern day classic of 2001: A Space Odyssey status. I don't think so.

","Once in a while, the Man creates a work of art of such beauty that experiencing it arouses in us very intense, unique feelings of appreciation, admiration, sometimes even awe. This was what I felt when I watched ""Gravity"" for the first time. For the second time, in an IMAX theater, my feelings grew even stronger, because - already knowing the plot - I had time to admire and savor the finest details of the movie. During both showings I came to the same conclusion - that beauty is indeed the product of perfect proportions, and discipline, just like the ancient Greeks believed. When talking about ""Gravity"", we can elaborate on the outstanding performance of Sandra Bullock, the breath-taking images of the Earth, the stunning 3D effects, or the captivating music of Steven Price. And still, none of these elements alone gives the movie its final shape. All its components are perfectly balanced, equally important, and complementing one another. The form of the movie is so disciplined and precise that it brings to my mind a music score in which every bar, every note has its place. To me, ""Gravity"" is a perfect manifestation of beauty and watching it is a pure pleasure."
"kunalkhandwala","8","1","3","23 October 2013"," Dazzling visuals and tale of human will
","The human will to survive catastrophe has been depicted in various elements. While 'Castaway' was about the desperate attempt to get off an island, 'Life of Pi' was about getting onto one. Mountaineers, sailors, disaster survivors and characters genuinely lost, have battled natural elements and phenomena to delineate the human will that defeats all odds. What director Alfonso Cuaron ('Harry Potter & Prisoner of Azkaban', 'Children of Men') does now is suspend a human in an environment of void against some spectacular backdrop, occasionally exposed to threatening objects with the challenge to survive and find a way back home. 'Gravity' soars on the technical genius of a visionary film-maker and his incredible team that creates the adventure in the great spatial void while masking the logic, science and pragmatism with which two astronauts struggle to survive flying debris and vacuum. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is Dr. Ryan Stone, who is awkwardly on a space outing to repair parts of the Hubble telescope, along with Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and the funny Indian astronaut who met a quick fateful end. The Rom-Com specialist doesn't have to deal with much Speed this time around but rather prolonged silence, desperation and inexperience of maneuvering in space. The funny conversations and meticulous processes of repair are abruptly halted by NASA's command to abort the mission due to some flying debris being closer to them than was originally conceived. Russia's missile launch onto their own satellite resulted in this havoc in space that led to severe and totalitarian destruction of human objects around Earth's orbit. With their shuttle suffering carnage by the flying debris, Ryan spins over and over desperate for balance, semblance and reserve until the cool-headed Matt attaches himself to her with a cord as he cruises along toward the I.S.S. with his thrusters. As the communication with mission control is broken and their oxygen levels run low, Matt maintains positivity with his corny conversations, punchlines and his endearing gallantry; a result of which leaves Ryan little time, hope and options. With the debris completing its rotation every 90 mins, Dr Stone must find a pod from one of the space stations that can take her back to Earth, gravity and home. <br/><br/>Much of the drama in space is accompanied by spells of silence, emptiness, and Ryan talking to herself. The thrills are provided by the struggles of moving in space and of course the oncoming debris that creates havoc. Thus, one would think that for the most part, Cuaron's focus would be on character building, plot progression, emotions in precarious situations and alluring powers of a strong cast that can enthrall audiences against the dark background of space. Instead, the director chooses to cast two of the foremost Rom-Com actors in lead roles. When Sandra Bullock isn't gasping for the scarce oxygen, she still sounds as panic stricken as she did when she had to make a sharp turn in a bus speeding at 80mph. George Clooney may have the voice that warrants attention but his charm seems a bit out of this world in the context. One has a difficult time relating to these actors whose backgrounds are solely in their own memory, their body language is only that of suspension in vacuum in a space suit and then there's one more element that doesn't quite help them. With its sheer lack of life, Space does not offer much in thrills, excitement or the unexpected. Ang Lee had a tiger, a hyena, whales, birds, rodents and storms that challenged Pi on his boat ride. Tom Hanks had weather, starvation, injuries, boat building, fire making and fishing as challenges. Ryan does have to find her way into a pod and release it from a station but the only threat really is that of the flying debris. The rest of us mortal beings who haven't been in space cannot relate to the challenges of maneuvering in space, getting in and out of a suit, breathing inside the helmet on depleted O2 or understanding Russian and Chinese equally well to control space stations. That's precisely where Cuaron uses the best of modern film technologies to captivate audiences and overcome such issues. The Cuarons have written a tight storyline that doesn't just wander in space. If the action isn't frequent, the sense of its coming surely is. There is no back-story of the actors nor is there a flashback of their memories. From the beginning, Gravity pulls you into space and impresses you with its visuals and excitement when the astronaut has barely any metal to grab onto for dear life. Many of those moments can make you clench your fist and that's exactly where the film leaves its mark. As unreal as it seems, the film makers have convinced us that we are really up there, suspended in space, faced with flying debris and barely a handle to hold on to. <br/><br/>The post production work on 3D is good, yet non overbearing. Its main contribution is the flying debris that comes onto you but other than that, the great void doesn't have any object jumping out of the screen to impress with 3D. Alfonso Cuaron has directed a well-paced storyline with an exemplary vision, realized by a very talented technical team that quite literally takes us beyond our realm. The story's linear nature and pace release the pressure from actors to portray more emotion and movement than required. It could very well be Sandra Bullock's best performance but that's not really setting any standards is it.....? In the end however, Gravity is about the triumph of human will to survive and endure through its adversities even though, it seems to fall short of being one of those 'epic' tales. Yet, it is genuinely, a triumph of technologies in cinema when you view our spectacular world from up there.<br/><br/><ul><li>8.004 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","Cinematography and visuals are absolutely stunning. They filmed as if you were in space looking out from an astronaut's eyes. A lot of views from inside the space station and space ship. <br/><br/>Bullock and Clooney gave solid performances, but I would have preferred more dramatic actors with more depth (maybe Michael Fassbender and Jessica Chastain?). I still believe Sandra is at her best in the Blind Side and not this film. I think she is better suited working in scenes where she is interacting with other actors and actresses. In this film, it is only her on the screen where she is not able to react off another person's emotions or conversation. <br/><br/>From a story perspective, I felt this film was a little rushed and far-fetched. I like the mystery used and the scenes that left the audience hanging, but this film had a number of plot holes.<br/><br/>Definitely watch this film in theatres to get the full visual experience it deserves.

"motezart","7","1","3","22 October 2013"," Good but not great, like I hoped
","Gravity attempts to portray what astronauts would actually encounter on space missions, how space walks would actually unfold, and the hostility of the environment of space towards anything resembling Earthling life.<br/><br/>The ninety or so minutes of Gravity are the linear unfolding of a series of destructive events in the lives of Astronauts Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Kowalski (George Clooney). Director's Alfonso Cuar√≥n's hones in on these destructive events, treating them as a single, passing moment in time. A moment of crisis.<br/><br/>As far as doing anything in space is ever considered routine, Gravity opens with a group of astronauts undertaking what seem to be standard, routine repairs to the outside of their ship. The tone is jovial, if not a little tense as Clooney zips around the ship's vicinity with a jet pack jokingly. He wants to break the current space walk record of seventy-five minutes. But Mission Control suddenly issues a warning. A massive field of space debris is headed straight for them.<br/><br/>From here on, only chaos reigns as Cuar√≥n begins to eliminate all probable positive outcomes, one by one. After the astronaut's ship is destroyed beyond repair Ryan and Kowalski attempt to propel themselves a floatable distance to a space station. As they push forward through space's vacuum, towards their beacon of hope, space's vastness and hostility are emphasized, along with their minisculity; ""I hate space,"" says Ryan somewhat lightheartedly. This comes after she has just been precariously saved from a perpetual spinning away into deep space, a particularly claustrophobic moment of the film,or rather, a moment in the extreme of claustrophobia's exact opposite.<br/><br/>Gravity has all the individual parts of a film rated high, near a 10, but once the parts are assembled, the whole is not equal to the parts. Even though the film is shot in space, and is set to depict a realistic portrayal of how events like these could take place, the film is really just about Ryan, a single human's struggle to survive, and then with this revelation the epic space setting becomes incidental.<br/><br/>Problem: Ryan is not an interesting character. She seems ill prepared for such a dangerous space mission, and when she talks about her daughter, in a moment that I assume is used to attempt to ground the film in reality by showing us the why, we don't care about her daughter. The current situation at hand is much more interesting. Including this talk about life back home was a mistake that took me out of the moment. I don't care about Earth here; I care about this amazing crisis taking place just above Earth. A space movie should emphasize themes bigger than the individual. The mission should be more important than the life of the astronaut. Simply making it back to Earth alive is not an exciting enough conclusion.<br/><br/>Although maybe the best of her career, Bullock still delivers a subpar portrayal of a character that is herself subpar. I loved Cuar√≥n's Children of Men and I feel here Cuar√≥n's work is great. From a technical perspective, Cuar√≥n's filmmaking is incredible, the cinematography stunning, the portrayal of space amazing, so what went wrong? Besides a storyline that fails to transcend human matters, a factor that Cuar√≥n may have been able to gloss over under different circumstances, when a film centers on a single actor, and that actor is Sandra Bullock, to quote Yeats, ""Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.""

"DareDevilKid","6","1","3","22 October 2013"," A Flawed Visual Extravaganza
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 2.5/5 stars<br/><br/>All hoopla and no real steam. Don't care who found it astounding, or spellbinding, or whatever superlatives are being used to describe this over-indulgent soporific mess of a sci-fi drama. Now the film isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, It's just not as great as it's being made out to be, and that's what peeves me.<br/><br/>In fact, after ages I actually felt like walking out of the cinema hall midway, and I usually don't do that for even worse movies than this. The reason being, that this movie is, plain and simple, boooooorrrrring as hell. The biggest drawback of this film is that it becomes all to predictable and static after a certain point, and that point arrives all too soon.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for Sandra Bullock and her amazing performance, which somehow managed to salvage the disintegrating remains of ""Gravity"", I actually might have walked out on the movie. Sandra Bullock is the life and soul of ""Gravity"", and along with the stunning visuals, the only good thing in the entire movie. George Clooney also manages to get your attention in his surprisingly brief appearance.<br/><br/>The visuals, while exemplary, are not worth your time and effort to sit through the lethargic proceedings. So if you do wish to catch ""Gravity"" just because it's being pushed down our throats as something so cool, and contemporary, and the biggest spectacle since ""Avatar"" (an infinitely superior film), then watch it for Bullock's performance and her performance alone. Sadly, even her mesmerizing and captivating act cannot make us care in the end if her character actually manages to survive the ordeal or not, only because of the painful ordeal the film itself inflicts upon us."
"rubisim","6","1","3","21 October 2013"," Great visuals hide bad script
","This movie has little to offer besides stunning visuals, the visuals go a long way (hence 6 out 10 instead of 1) but they cover up the fact that there is very little substance. The movie only has 2 actors in it; one of them leaves the screen after about 15 min. (Clooney) leaving us with Sandra bullock which just can't carry a movie on her own and has a horrible script to deliver. This is a chic flick wrapped in outer space ""sci-fi"" package. The sheer fact that it cost $100 million dollar to make with such a skeleton crew suggests that the money went to CGI and props. This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen and is also one of the emptiest (content wise), redundant movies at the same time. A movie with a good story to tell requires little effects to work, a movie with a bad story will only have the effects to sell. Verdict: If you are all about visuals and nothing else you will love this movie, especially in 3D. However, if you need substance and not just a nice wrap this isn't for you, not at the box-office and not on the TV when it will eventually get there. 8.6 out of 10 on IMDb (rating when this was written)?! Not justified at all."
"dcobbimdb","6","1","3","21 October 2013"," Visually stunning, so so story
","I went into this with pretty high expectations after hearing all the hype and it getting an 8.6 on IMDb. I love Sci-Fi's, space flicks so this was definitely up my ally.<br/><br/>Visually this movie is pretty stunning. I've never seen so many beautiful pictures of the earth in a space movie. So in some sense it's similar to the old 2001 space odyssey or Avatar where it relies heavily on the visual aspect. But sadly for me I didn't find much more to it then that. The plot is very straight forward and for me seemed pretty hard to believe, even by ""Hollywood"" standards. I saw this in the theater thinking visually it would be one of those movies best seen on the big screen, and in that aspect it was as again there are scenes which are pretty stunning if you're at all into celestial scenery.<br/><br/>For me the story just got too unbelievable. It's not because she's a woman, but here you have Sandra's character, who is a green mission specialist, more or less a technician. Due to some chain reaction or something aboard a Russian satellite (of course, it's always the Russians right?) debris from it is flying around and disables their ship causing them to find another way home. My beef with this is think how big the earth is, well the orbit of earth is obviously much bigger, so we are to believe that some Russian satellite blows up presumably thousands of miles away yet in the entire vastness of the orbit of earth (think three dimensional here) that debris heads right in their path? And not once, not twice, but three times I think as it rotates around earth? So right there I was a bit turned off as nobody seems to really get how ""BIG"" space is. Anyway if that wasn't bad enough somehow this first gen mission specialist gets propelled into space, rescued via Clooney who's wearing a thruster pack, then they travel to some other space station, where she gets on board within seconds of Hypoxia killing her, and disaster immediately strikes, yet she can quickly launch and pilot the escape vessel to a Chinese space station, which is pummeling towards earth, which she enters and quickly figures out how to launch the escape pod to. Yeah okay...<br/><br/>Again the movie is ""okay"" by my standards, certainly not an 8.6 although visually it is great, but we've come to expect that nowadays with technology and CGI being what it is, so outside of that the story itself is basically your typical sinking ship overcoming incredible odds survival kind of story and that's about it. I won't be renting this when it comes out on disk and if I catch it sometime for free I might watch it again, so that's how it ranks in my book."

Indeed good screen effects for no-gravity environment.. but that's all about this movie.. I don't want to talk about great acting skills of any cast member.. actually speaking about cast, it is very limited to only 2.. quite boring script.. but not boring as King's speech.. so little less chance of Oscar.. but still there is.. If you cry in no gravity environment, sure your tears will fly.. but does it make you better role playing? or if you cry or shot like a child all along movie, would it make you great acting player? I don't think so.. All the movie I asked myself, what could be the reason that NASA sends somebody to space who failed almost all space mission test in earth?.. If failing is not a problem at all in these tests, then why they forced a heavily depressive, suicidal, a lost mother for such space mission tests? If you can leave most important questions as unanswered then you can enjoy this movie in a documentary like watching experience.. When movie ended, I was thinking 'fiss' 'fuss' 'fiss' fuss' such a funny toy to use these impulsive space outfits.. reminded me Wall-E's space dance.. :)"

","I cannot figure out what all the hype is about this movie. My husband and I took in a double feature today, Gravity being one of them, and we both agreed that it left much to be desired. <br/><br/>Aside from the beautiful visual effects, the acting was mundane, the writing was insipid, the story was predictable. It was not 'edge of my seat' in the least. <br/><br/>I don't mean to insult people who 'loved' the movie or who think it was 'one of the best made' but really?!? And I don't think it's right to be condescending by asking if people who didn't like Gravity were ones who liked Transformers or Avatar. (never saw Transformers and Avatar was not much better than Gravity) <br/><br/>In my opinion, I don't think Gravity even compares to great movies such as Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Slumdog Millionaire, The Usual Suspects, The Departed, ... just to name a few. <br/><br/>I should have gone with my gut, saved $30 and waited for the DVD release."
"bob_mccall","3","1","3","19 October 2013"," Great Special Effects - Terrible Movie
","I was impressed by the movie's special effects, but the plot itself left much to be desired. If you know nothing of space flight, maybe you will enjoy this movie. If you do, the movie will be an exercise in pain. Long odds situations, and oversimplifications abounds. From the first 10 minutes of the movie in which George Clooney spends his time just circling around the space shuttle, to somehow, a missile which destroyed a Russian satellite creating some sort of domino effect on all other satellites causing a resultant ejection of space debris, and a loss of all communications with the earth. Just horrible. George Clooney un-tethers himself from Sandra Bullock after he pulls himself towards her to result in slack in the tether. If there is slack in the tether, he is no longer pulling away from her and therefore there is no reason to release himself from her. Also, although Sandra Bullock is a mission specialist who would not be trained to fly even the space shuttle, she ends up flying not only a Russian Soyuz, but also a Chinese ship. Thank God all of the ""instruction books"" were written in English. The more I think about it, the more terrible I think this movie was."
"gustavo-chavesmc","8","1","3","16 October 2013"," Great Sensations
","The great success of the film are the sensations. Feeling of solitude, contemplation, fear, despair, relief, anxiety, dizziness, lack of oxygen, lack of sound in space, even the feeling of weightlessness you can feel. The Director inserts the viewer inside the helmet of astronauts. And it really was fantastic. It's the kind of film that is well worth it to see the film by sensations. The story is nice and could be true, although I find it difficult that outcome happen. The film deserves the note that gets on IMDb, but I hoped for a different outcome, more unpredictable. Anyway, it does not take away the brightness and focus of the Director, which was precisely the feelings of people in that situation. Everything was very well explored. I liked George Clooney as the talkative astronaut than the Sandra as protagonist. I do not think she did an interpretation worthy of Oscar. Already Clooney was excellent as supporting actor."
"asha-albert","Null","1","3","15 October 2013"," The most visually stunning movie ever!
","Gravity is unlike any movie ever told.<br/><br/>The plot is simple - two astronauts are adrift in space and have to a find a way to rescue themselves and get back to earth. Nothing more, nothing less. What grabs the viewer is the treatment of this simple storyline and the incredible way in which the movie depicts it.<br/><br/>The movie begins with these words against a black screen """"At 600 km above planet Earth, the temperature fluctuates between +258 and -148 degrees Fahrenheit. There is nothing to carry sound. No air pressure. No oxygen. Life in space is impossible."" No music, no dialogue, as the screen disappears, replaced by our planet. It fills the screen and engulfs the viewer within it, so much so that you feel like you are floating, spinning along with it. And you see this spot, in the distance, to the right. The spot moves closer to you, drifting on its orbit until finally it arrives, filling the screen, blocking your view of earth, and you see the American space shuttle and a team of astronauts floating outside it. And then you are inside the movie, part of it, experiencing the same space as the astronauts, a feeling of utter weightlessness and peace.<br/><br/>Within the first thirty minutes, everything changes. Peace and serenity becomes utter horror. A routine repair mission becomes a disaster, with one astronaut dead, and two others drifting into space. The rest of the movie revolves around their efforts to get back to earth.<br/><br/>As I said, a very simple plot, and in the hands of a lesser director, or lesser actors, the movie would have been a disaster as well. As it is, Alfonso Cuaron's vision is ably supported by his lead actors Sandra Bullock (playing emotionally damaged yet strong enough to single-handedly carry the day) and George Clooney (effectively playing himself - suave and breezy as always). There are no other actors, except Ed Harris as the voice from Houston, and a couple of other voices.<br/><br/>The problem is that rather than dwelling on the actors' performance, exceedingly good as they are, my mind keeps going back to the special effects, the result of more than a year in post-production. There is one incredible shot that I remember - when the character of Bullock is cast adrift into space. There is dead silence punctuated only the sounds of her harsh gasps. The camera moves towards her, closer and closer, until her terrified face fills the screen, and then incredibly, suddenly, the camera is inside her helmet, and we are looking at the vast expanse of space through her eyes, and realize how awfully alone she is. And that's just one scene of the movie. Right from the utter desolation of space to the cramped confines of a rescue ship, the director's vision has imagined it all, and he has brought us into the ambit of his imagination.<br/><br/>Gravity is not a movie you just watch, it is a movie that you experience, it is a movie in which you get involved. Remember, in space, no one can hear you scream."
"edroberts417","8","1","3","14 October 2013"," ""Gravity""
","Gravity"" is the story of two people who find themselves marooned on that most desolate of desert isles‚Äîouter space.Alfonso Cuaron, who wrote (along with his son, Jonas Cuaron)and directed ""Gravity,"" is unarguably one of the best in the business and, by adding ""Gravity"" to a list including the impressive ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""Children of Men,"" shows himself to be one of the most versatile, as well. Unlike the other two, which deal with relationships between, in one case humans and in the other societal forces. ""Gravity"" is about the interaction between one person and the void of outer space‚Äîin other words, nothing. <br/><br/>Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a medical researcher and space newbie, is visiting the ISS for the purpose of some experiment or other. We're never told what it is, but that doesn't matter. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), is a veteran space man and, apparently, Stone's minder and affable tour guide on this seemingly routine mission. Other than a voice from ""Houston,"" they are the only characters in the film--but make no mistake about it, this is Bullock's show, and, in large part, a one- person show. It's a risky place for an actor, or a director, to go--if it fails, it fails miserably. The dialogue must be authentic, the pacing needs to be spot on, and action sequences must be perfectly placed to keep the audience's attention and break up the monologue in the right places, and Cuaron, with the exception of a few lines of dialogue, gets it right. There are no draggy bits begging to be over with. There is no voice-over interior monologue in ""Gravity""--all of Ryan Stone's thoughts are spoken and that can be heavy burden to bear. <br/><br/>It's always exciting to see an actor successfully step out of their comfort zone and that's what Bullock does in ""Gravity."" She's frequently played fish-out-of-water characters before‚Äîan alcoholic in ""28 Days,"" an undercover cop/beauty queen in ""Miss Congeniality"" and an inspiring, rebellious Dallas suburbanite in ""Blind Side."" But here she is not only outside societal norms (It appears she is a wounded loner back on earth and, besides that, not many people go to outer space), but outside the realm of humanity generally. <br/><br/>What there is of unspoken introspection is provided by Matt Kowalski's dialogue. Clooney plays Kowalski perhaps a bit over the top. Although we expect supreme competence from an astronaut, he is at times too calm, too chatty, coming off as comfortable and cheerful floating around in space, untethered to the space station, as he would be at a backyard barbecue. But that's okay‚Äîhe's there mostly as a foil against which Bullock works. Not to mention, Clooney is an exceedingly likable actor and listening to his, for the most part, one-sided banter provides some much needed subtle comic relief from the tension and sense of chilling helplessness <br/><br/>""Gravity"" is essentially a thriller and, like most thrillers, everything is going along just fine until something goes terribly awry and the protagonist is called upon, against dread and self-doubt, to rise to the occasion. In this case, Stone and Kowalski find themselves stranded in outer space‚Äînot in the space station, mind you, but floating around in space suits‚Äîwithout any communication with ""Houston"" and a good distance from the space station. <br/><br/>One of the most refreshing things about ""Gravity"" is Cuaron's use CGI. It's unnoticeable, seamless, and he avoids falling into the pit of a CGI fest, like almost every other director who has access to a computer seems to do. He strives for an accurate portrayal of the space environment, and does it elegantly. Even the casual science geek could fine some implausibilities and downright violations of the laws of physics, but they are minor and more than made up for by what the film gets right and it's feel of authenticity. It truly seems like these two are in outer space. (Besides, much of what Jason Bourne could pull of with a broken cell phone and candy wrapper stretches notions of possibility, as well, and that doesn't seem to bother us too much.)<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is so much more than hyper-drive spaceships, photon torpedoes and Death Stars. It examines the depths of what it means to human and just where our place in the universe may, or may not, be. In spite of its plot-driven structure, it deserves a place right up there with some of the best, and smartest, outer space films, films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and ""Moon"" Films like these are not science fiction‚Äîthey are human truth, plumbing the human soul rather merely telling a fantastical story. Perhaps it is something about being so far removed from the home where we evolved that causes us to wax existential. The distinction is that whereas those two ask the basic existential question ""who are we,"" on behalf of all humanity; ""Gravity"" is about one person asking herself the question, ""who am I, and do I want to persist in this human life in a world so far beyond human scale?""--and answers it. But perhaps that distinction between the films is not valid‚Äî-maybe they are the same question."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","3","12 October 2013"," Superb cinematic achievement, but emotionally trying to watch
","It is most natural to compare ""Gravity"" to ""2001: a space Odyssey"" (1968) which is entirely appropriate. But on a different plane, there is another rather relevant comparison: ""127 hours"" (2010). Both tell a story (one real, the other fictional) about an individual trapped in a most atrocious situation imaginable (or unimaginable, a better description) ‚Äì a story of survival by sheer force of will power, equally unimaginable. In ""127 hours"" a man experienced in wilderness exploring is trapped in a sunken creek with his hand caught and stuck in the rocks. In ""Gravity"", a woman astronaut is trapped in space where the odds are overwhelmingly in favor of dying a lonely death in complete silence.<br/><br/>By this time, I believe it is not a criminal transgression into spoiler territory by saying that while there appears to be equal billing of the two leads, this is Sandra Bullock's show, perhaps even instrumental to her second Best Acting Oscar. George Clooney provides excellent support that is expected of an actor of his caliber, but support is support, and this one is not even a major support role. Another veteran actor, Ed Harris, supplies the voice of the contact at mission control at Huston. People who are familiar with him would be glad to hear that his voice is very recognizable.<br/><br/>With a staggering ""Metascore"" of 96 reported in IMDb (13 out of 18 giving it a ""100"") little else needs to be said about the excellent visual and sound that, for the first time, truly brings Space to the audience, or brings the audience into Space, whichever way you prefer to put it. And the vote is unanimous that this is one of the rare occasions when 3D makes a real contribution to the film. ""Gravity"" is a 90-minute cinematic experience not to be missed by anyway who is even remotely interested in motion pictures. But as my summary line suggests, this is not an easy ride, particularly during the first moments when the protagonist found herself completely alone, lost in Space. But things start to improve, misfortunes one after another notwithstanding, when determination and courage kick in, culminating in final triumph against all odds."

","When I saw the trailers for Gravity, each of them brilliant, short, panicky glimpses of a desperate situation, I had no idea what to expect from the finished film. ""How is this a movie?"" I thought. ""What happens? How can they just sustain that for 90 minutes?"" All I knew, was that, I was going to see the film as soon as possible. It was a refreshing inner monologue to have because after most film trailers, even for films I am interestedin still seeing, I know, pretty much what is going to happen in the film by the end and what kind of film it is. Gravity was different though. I didn't have a clue.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Alfonso Cuar√≥n's dystopian action drama Children of Men and he's the only man to make a satisfactory Harry Potter film so I knew, with the director, I was in safe and interesting hands. I am also an unabashed George Clooney disciple, believing the man to have pretty impeccable taste in scripts and projects to work on (seriously, listen to my 'When Clooney met the Coens podcast' he's my man crush). Sandra Bullock is a great comedienne and can pretty much raise the standard of any generic rom-com or action-com she takes part in. I haven't seen a lot of her ""serious, worthy"" films and I don't want to but ""an interesting choice"" I thought and a good fit with Clooney. So what was going to happen in this mysterious space film?<br/><br/>Well, I am not going to tell you here. If you're looking for spoilers or plot points then you've come to the wrong place because it's best to go into Gravity fresh and ready for anything. What I can tell you is that it is one of the most breath taking, nerve shredding, tension sustaining, technically advanced and most complex directed film, I think, I have ever seen. I would need to watch it again, not because of any twisty turny story developments but to try and wrap my brain around just the level of organisation and unfathomable skill that went into creating this heart pounding 90 minutes. It is a sublime magic trick of a film because, unlike the cartoonish nonsense of, say, Avatar or Abrams' Star Trek you just, quite reasonably, assume that Clooney, Bullock and Cuar√≥n filmed the whole thing in ACTUAL SPACE. Cuar√≥n realises that to wow and amaze with CGI and modern special effects, you don't need to go hog wild and create insane worlds and multi-headed monsters, just make a seemingly realistic and simple film, set in space. He did the same thing to similar wonderful effect in Children of Men. It's not what you see, it's what you don't realise you've seen. You take everything for granted in a Cuar√≥n film and buy the world completely, it's only later that you stop and think ""Wait?! how on EARTH did they do that?!"" In an age where everyone knows ""oh yeah, they just draw that stuff on a computer, right?"" (you know, like ANYONE could do it effortlessly) it takes real skill to hush those tongues and drag the audience, spellbound and quiet as amazed church mice, into your film. There is a similar trick that the story pulls and that is that, with so few cast members, you know somebody, logically and presumably, is making it to the end of this film alive but that never holds you back from being on the edge of your seat, biting your knuckles or gripping the hand of your loved one next to you, every time peril rears it's ugly head.<br/><br/>The acting, too, is fantastic, with Sandra Bullock, especially, giving, to quote EVERY critic on the planet, the performance of her career. Hell! the performance of anyone's career! For the physical strain, it must have been to make this film, alone she deserves all the Oscars Billy Crystal can quickly polish and shove into the back of a Lexus. That's not to say Clooney's a slouch but it becomes pretty apparent why they cast him after just a few lines of dialogue, in a pleasing, welcome way.<br/><br/>Again, like Children of Men, the film is a mix of genres. It gave me more of a jolt and locked me rigid with tension more than any horror film of recent times, it has enough action in it to please any of John McClane's ardent admirers and it's also an achingly beautiful science fiction film, with critics throwing around 2001: A Space Odyssey comparisons like happy, pretentious puppies with a Kubrick designed squeeze toy. It may just be Clooney, the minimalist cast and an emotional theme of the film but referencing Solaris, in an attempt to seem smart and educated, might be slightly more apt actually.<br/><br/>It is in the emotional, character based thread of the film's narrative, though, that the first tiny, critical comment must be made because the slightly over-egged and obvious motivations of Bullock's character and the emotional journey she undertakes, is not as deep, fleshed out, or as relevant as the film thinks it is. I would argue it's the physical journey, and the mental struggle and dilemma that produces, that is a more satisfying and watchable than her emotional one. However, like all good sci-fi, there's lots of layers to the thing and you can enjoy what you want about it. I just didn't think the script or dialogue was particularly strong when dealing with a certain topic, that will remain unnamed here.<br/><br/>It's a film all about connections though, in more ways than one, and the ultimate connection we must make with our own lives. That being said, it's also, pleasingly, about hair raising stunts and explosions in space. Unusually, if I urge you to go see this film at all, it's for that, latter reason, the sheer, jaw dropping, spectacle of it all."

","After a disastrous storm of debris destroys their shuttle, medical engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) find themselves stranded in space. Finding themselves floating further from safety and Earth, and slowly losing oxygen, the two must rely on each other in order to survive.<br/><br/>Directed by Alfonse Cuaron, Gravity is a very intense drama/thriller that tells a great story about having the will and strength to survive. Clooney and Bullock play off of each other really in a way only two of the most professional actors in Hollywood can. Clooney provides a lot of the humor of the film with his character providing jokes in order to keep himself as well as Bullock's character, and even the audience calm. But it is Bullock who provides the strongest performance. We watch as her character goes through many moments of panic and duress. Not only does she pull this off excellently, she's also able to pull viewers in and onto her level. It is also the moments of weakness and doubt that Bullock gives us her all and by far gives the most powerful performance of her career. Not only do the actors bring us into the film emotionally, but the amazing film-work does this as well. There are many instances where we are put into the POV of the characters and all we hear is the sound their panicking as they as thrown about in space as debris is crashing around them. We also have many breathtaking shots of Earth and sunset that are made even more affecting (as is the whole film) in 3D. Gravity is a powerful, intense, and breathtaking film that takes the viewer on a great adventure with moments where you will find yourselves holding your breath, but also on a roller coaster of emotions.<br/><br/>P.S., See this in 3D while you can!<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","2","11","6 October 2013"," ""Gravity"" Transforms
","""Gravity"" pulls us in and transforms. Sandra Bullock is so powerful in Director Writer Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity"", perhaps the year's best movie. Visually breathtaking to watch‚ÄîI saw it in 3D. Cuaron and Cinematographer Emmauel Lubezki simply awe us with the stunning 15 minute continuous camera shot set 6000 miles above the earth. However, it is Sandra Bullock, who authentically pulls us in Cuaron's journey of loss and the rediscovery of our innate power. There is a stark moment as she gazes at us from the screen with her sad and haunting beauty, saying ""Who will pray for me?"" ""Gravity"" sources its sheer power from its humanity. Bullock's bold vulnerability touches and profoundly inspires. Bullock and George Clooney's captivating chemistry levitates this tale of the human spirit.<br/><br/>At the movie's narrative arc, Clooney's Matthew Kowalski consoles Bullock's Ryan in the throes of despair. His words resonate in a strange twist. Clooney basically in a supporting role, is brilliant balancing Matt's brashness and deep seeded compassion. George is pure partnership in Sandra's tour de force.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" opens with the NASA Shuttle Explorer Mission to repair the Hubble Telescope orbiting above the earth. Bullock with close cropped haircut is bookish Medical Mission Specialist Ryan Stone, on her first space walk. Isolated Ryan, suffers with a family tragedy. Clooney is at his gruff and boastful best as Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski. Old hat and on his last mission, Matt is out to break the space walk record. Suddenly, the routine mission turns deadly as fiery debris from a Russian Spy Satellite collides with Explorer. The unthinkable happens, as Ryan becomes un-tethered and set adrift in deep space. Ryan and Matt now must do the impossible‚Äîfind their way home. In space there is no sound, but we can hear our hearts pound.<br/><br/>Director Cuaron captures the isolation and desolation of space. He leverages this into the haunting human desolation which lands with us. Sandra Bullock's Ryan suffers emotional wounds from the past, not to give away. In her performance she is also virtually alone. Bullock displays awesome physicality as she floats ballet-like on screen. She looks ageless and amazing as she reclaims her power. She lets go of all her defenses and touches our very souls. <br/><br/>Bullock as Ryan pushes through amidst great fear and loss. She has the unique gravitas of moving our souls with a silent glance. In this amazing journey, she is not the same person at the beginning of the story. Neither are we. ""Gravity"" will amaze and touch you."

","""Gravity"" is the most intense and realistic spaceflight movie ever made <br/><br/>(Let that sink in a moment....)<br/><br/>I know that's a very bold statement, with both ""2001"" and ""Apollo 13"" to consider, but it's true. My wife and I had adrenaline coursing through my veins and four pairs of very white knuckles for the entire 90 minutes. It is insane. This one will redefine space movies for decades to come. If it weren't for Sandra Bullock's gripping and very human performance as mission payload specialist astronaut Ryan Stone (this is her ""Cast Away""), it'd almost qualify as a NASA spaceflight simulator more than a motion picture. George Clooney costars as the seasoned shuttle commander Matt Kowalski who initially rescues Stone after a catastrophic collision in low earth orbit at the beginning of the movie obliterates their immediate ticket home (but make NO mistake; this is Bullock's movie and she utterly OWNS it). What could've been a standard issue rescue drama in space is given an entirely new angle due to Cuaron's 'you are there' impossibly personal camera angles and first person perspective given by the actors. <br/><br/>Director/co-writer Alfonso Cuaron is the new James Cameron. He and his son Jonas have succeeded in pulling off the exact PERFECT blend of thrill ride and character drama. The wonderful conceit of the movie is that despite her circumstances, Bullock's Stone is as wonderfully human and vulnerable as they come. But worry not, adventure fans; this is no 'chick flick.' Short of buying a $200,000 ticket from Virgin Galactic? This is as close as most of us will ever get to actual manned space flight. <br/><br/>There were a few things that were dramatized (different international manned space vehicles & communications satellites sharing the exact orbits, etc), but otherwise this is a movie with very little fat on its bones. The hardware, spacecraft and special FX are all meticulously rendered and are breathtaking. The details feel so right they're jaw-dropping. <br/><br/>Don't miss this movie (and preferably see it in IMAX and/or 3D if possible). And if you have a heart condition? Be careful. Very serious on that.<br/><br/>This is a SOLID ten. No ands/ifs/buts about it. <br/><br/>And this is not the usual post-movie buzz of endorphins talking; this one is REALLY that good. After I'm done 'decompressing,' I'd really like to see it again. But right now? I'm still holding my breath a little bit."

"martinmcdonough","4","1","4","13 February 2017"," Ridiculous
","*** There are spoilers in this review so I'm letting you know ahead of time. Thank you. ***<br/><br/>From the moment this movie started, I had my doubts. <br/><br/>First of all, anyone with any rudimentary knowledge of how NASA operates knows that there is no way in the pit of Hades Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) would be allowed to zip around in an MMU like he did. Second, no trained astronaut would do such a thing to begin with. The dramatic SILENCE of space wasn't dramatic at all, and when Ryan Stone's (Sandra Bullock) tether line was broken - in the first 10 minutes of the film - there was no drama to it because you knew she had to be rescued somehow, or there would be no film.<br/><br/>After the debris strike takes out the shuttle, the dead astronauts inside looked more like drowning victims from a bad ""Jaws"" movie than humans suddenly and violently exposed to the harsh vacuum of space. <br/><br/>As the movie dragged on, Ryan's backstory begins to emerge. NASA typically examines their astronaut candidates with a fine toothed comb - both physically and mentally. Again, there is no way NASA would send someone into space who is dealing with the issues she is dealing with (or, in her case, NOT dealing with them). <br/><br/>The ending of the film (the splashdown) had me a bit puzzled. Was she landing in her beloved lake or was this an homage to the beginning splashdown in the 1968 Charlton Heston classic ""Planet of the Apes?"" I wanted to yell ""You maniacs! You stole two hours of my life! Damn you! Damn you all to hell!""<br/><br/>Cinematography and effects awards were deserved as the special effects were first rate. Set design should have won as well for the accuracy of the space stations and capsules. I'd like to say it's a good ""popcorn"" Saturday afternoon movie, but that would be pushing it."

I watched this movie just to see her survive? What about all the hard work she went through? The stories she will tell? Her life on Earth? Also, we don't really know much about any of the characters and I cannot sympathise with them for that reason. To me, it seems like a movie that was just taken in a studio. Where is the message behind the story? What do we learn? What makes the movie unforgettable? That sometimes we need to let go, yeah that's the one thing I've learnt. Nice quote. #Much creativity, #very story, #such quality. Thanks for that and thanks for wasting my time. It's one of those movies that I will forget after I finish watching. It's a movie for the moment, not one of those movies that are unforgettable if that was what you were expecting (like me). I guess I was expecting more due to the amount of positive reviews about this movie. Either way, the ending could have been stronger than just seeing her survive. As a point of reference, Interstellar is an improved version of this movie."

As amazing as they were in this movie there is no way that this should have a meta-score rating of 96 with however many hundreds of awards including 7 Oscars. Fun fact: Pretty well 90% of this movie is animated. I am just in utter confusion as to why people find this amazing. If you want a good space movie about overcoming odds go watch Tom Hanks in Apollo 13. This on the other hand is quite average. With so much focus on the negative people may be wondering why i gave it a 7 out of 10.

The movie shows Clooney zipping around the space station on his MMU (Manned Maneuvering Unit)which would never happen due to safety concerns, losing control and injuring yourself or damaging the space station. <br/><br/>The other flaw that bugged me was showing the astronauts flailing about at the end of the 100 +/- foot long tether. At no time has NASA ever used such long tethers for the obvious reason of becoming entangled around exterior protrusions like antennae. <br/><br/>Since I wasn't able to sit through the entire movie I don't know about other technical inaccuracies, but it's a safe bet there are plenty!"

Space 1999 was more believable than this. Armageddon was more believable than this. Heck, Transformers is about as believable as this. Station jumping in order to find a usable reentry vehicle? Please. Total communications failure? Not. Inept astronauts? I don't think so. Ultra-heroic mission commanders? Uh-uh.

I DO appreciate that using a particular technique or say, a big action flick being filmed for IMAX screens has benefits but it only makes the experience more fun or more engrossing, it doesn't affect the movie in any other way than cosmetically. So when I'm told 'you have to see Gravity in 3D; it's meant to be seen in 3D', that's great but if you take away the 3D there should still be a great cinematic spectacle to experience.<br/><br/>Instead, what you're left with, is Sandy Bullock floating about in space for 70 minutes, seemingly losing her grip on reality.<br/><br/>Maybe this was a cinematic gold for some people, but for me it just left me feeling a little lost as to what all of the fuss and hype was about."

The shuttle is destroyed, and both Kowalski and Stone are running out of oxygen and must get to the International Space station before they run out of oxygen, but what awaits them in the Space Station and beyond? Does the pair make it back to Earth safely?<br/><br/>Gravity is a technical marvel, the question that arises is, how did director Alfonso Cuaron simulate the space sequences so spectacularly? Movies are certainly a visual medium, and this movie has some eye- popping visuals, the view of earth from outer space, the debris hitting the Space Shuttle, the scenes in space on the whole are incredible. <br/><br/>But as visually arresting as Gravity is, the story is not credible, and worst of all predictable. The characters, specifically Stone, goes from disaster to disaster, one step ahead of being blown to smithereens. There is some thin backstory about Stone losing a child, and questioning her own desire to live, but overall, there is very little character development and plot development, and the question that occurred to me about the story was, doesn't anybody maintain their space stations? I'm not going to get into the space flight errors that were made in the story, because I don't know enough about space vehicles to know better, but I read that there were errors. In a movie as visual as this, those kind of errors should be kept to a minimum. But I don't need to be an astrophysicist to know when a movie is boring.<br/><br/>The acting is fair, but the actors aren't given a lot to do, Bullock alternates between gasping for air, or screaming helplessly, or just floating there in space, doing somersaults. Clooney regales Bullock with a series of stories, meant to be amusing but when delivered with Clooney's trademark monotone, deadpan delivery, the stories turn boring. The script tries to make light of Clooney's pretty boy image, but fails. This movie stretches to get to its 90 minute running time, and the story is used as filler for the stunning visuals, and it's not very entertaining filler.<br/><br/>When I think about the fact that there was a lot of buzz about Gravity winning a Best Picture Oscar that is galling. Gravity is one-third of a good movie, it's Cuaron's visual playground, but the effects are not able to sustain a movie, with no story, and actors with very little to say. 12 Years A Slave on the other hand was based on a true story, had outstanding acting and its share of visual resonance. 12 Years a Slave was a complete film.<br/><br/>For more astronomical movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

I was wrong. It takes More then just a few fancy CGI scenes, and some explosions make a movie. So where do I begin. The technical part of this movie is lacking. Its starts off with a scene of astronauts just carelessly floating around outside the ship, along with two just having a nice little conversation in space with no apparent reason to believe they are aware of their surroundings. Warned of impending trouble and they seem to just take their time. One goes floating out into space and the spinning made me feel like I was ill. Disregard the fact that if that had happened the game is over for that crew member. No way another would risk loosing himself to go after that person in all that turmoil. Then comes macho Clooney. They have been up there all that time and they know nothing about each other? OK yeah sure. He is in peril just as much as she is and they just nicely have a conversation while floating back to more trouble. Character development is not there. We have no emotional state in their survival. Beyond the clich√©s and unreal options, the movie falls flat. We got one picking buttons via eenie meenie minnie mo and another who just gives up without a fight after risking it all to rescue someone. I cant tell you anymore suffice to say the films ending isn't much better then what you already see leading up to it. You just are left with a ""That was it? feeling and a wow I wasted that hour of my life. I give 4 stars only cause of the two actors trying to make it work. Otherwise the film is a flop.

The last scene where she climbs out of the mud is a brilliant graphical metaphor for how the first living creatures must have climbed out of the primordial soup. A must watch!"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","1","4","2 June 2014"," 'Gravity' is visually historical and contains beautiful artistic vision.
","Most visual focused films are nothing but visuals that have lame plots. Alfonso Cuaron instead makes you feel like your drifting in space in a historically mesmerizing way. The plot is very simple. Sandra Bullock plays a space engineer who's work goes completely wrong after a solar flare causing her to drift around in space and find her way back to earth. Even though the film isn't realistic, it still is one of the greatest works of art in terms of visual aspects. The visual aspects of film making enforced in 'Gravity' is nothing more than amazing. On top of that you have interesting characters with strong symbols and messages. What's fun about 'Gravity' is that it is entertaining and beautiful. It shows us how cinema has evolved and shows us new ways of film making. The awe I experienced while viewing this motion picture still stays with me and makes me appreciate just how brilliant visual artists can be. Many will say that having a film with just all visuals and no strong themes is pointless. While that can be absolutely true, 'Gravity' is not an example of that kind of film. 'Gravity' instead is a visual work of art that has themes such as persistence, importance, remediation, and sacrifice that audiences can be moved by as well. If your dream is to someday travel to space, don't waste your time, just see this film."

Also in case no one knows yet, superheroes aren't real and cars don't change into robots in real life.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron's signature sustained shots force the viewer to not break away; no film has ever done immersion quite like Gravity before. You hear the word ""awesome"" thrown around a lot nowadays, but Gravity was the first ever film which truly struck awe into my spine. <br/><br/>Yet at the heart of Gravity is a deeply human story about accepting, not only death, but life."

","I feel I am being generous when I give this movie 3/10; and, given the average rating, it seems most would disagree. Do allow me to explain:<br/><br/>I am perfectly fine with entertainment taking a creative license, however, you cannot tax my intelligence by giving us absurd realities while portraying our existing one. If it's the Matrix, and the rules can be bent, sure, go ahead and fly into an agent and destroy him Neo, and I'll go ""ooohhh"" ... but if you don't bring any new rules in, you better play by the ones in place (or release the movie as a comedy and I'll sit quietly)<br/><br/>Gravity is pure eye candy, and it only makes sense if you're watching it in 3D. There is no story to speak of... and if you are going to send a medical officer to work on the hubble space telescope, well, you're telling us not to take you seriously in the first place -- just buckle up and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Okay, let's go (I am pumped) -- but the ride isn't that exciting. In fact, the ride, in 2D, is much much less entertaining than almost any space documentary that explains the universe. There is so much awe and wonder out there, and given how the laws of gravity are responsible for everything that exists, here we have it misrepresented to have no meaning at all.... just that in zero gravity you will float around... that's it. Not your hair of course... or at least not sandra bullock's hair, but everything else. <br/><br/>Fine, let's continue... oh no, it's done. That's it. She has to find her way back, and she will just jump from space station to space station, figuring everything that's need out when she gets there. They try to imply how ""big space is""... how important ""gravity"" is... yet, if you're watching in full HD on a fair sized 2D screen... well, it's a poor showing without much else. <br/><br/>Let me explain how big space is. Voyager 1, launched in 1977, and travelling faster than any human made object, is on the outskirts of our solar system (on the verge of entering interstellar space). It is travelling at 17km/s. If you can somehow manage to travel at the speed of light, starting right now, you will catch it in 17 hours and a few mins. <br/><br/>If you continue to travel at the speed of light, you will come across our closest neighbourhood galaxy, Andromeda, in 2 million years. That's 2 million years, at the speed of light. Andromeda is one of over 400 billion galaxies that we can observe today. That, is how big space is. <br/><br/>Because of gravity, Andromeda will merge with our galaxy, the Milky Way, in 5 billion years, and the super massive black holes at the center of the galaxies will merge. That, is how powerful gravity is. <br/><br/>The reality of our universe is more glorious than we can imagine, more wondrous than any poet can pen, and more complex than our collective knowledge today. Why dumb it down? We can appreciate these things on their own without an American *high 5* style story. You can do so much to enhance these wonders with 3D, and you give us this rubbish. <br/><br/>Or hey, maybe I should have just seen it in 3D."

","I had no real preconceptions when i came to watch the film and ended up watching more by accident than design. I watch a lot of Science Fiction films for a variety of reasons including future speculations and how technology effects our lives either for good or bad, often the latter. Sometimes for fun or something to watch. This film was mostly this, something to watch and marvel at, if you will. Films have characters we relate to (hopefully) and go on the journey of the story etc, with them. The film disappointed because the characters where so thinly portrayed. The central character played by Bullock was kind of abstract and unmoving. She was out to prove something to her self and ultimately some resolution to past tragedies, was all i got from the film.

","This is a very unusual movie. Unusually BAD. Bedtime for Bonzo has this in spades. It starts with Sandra Bullock, (S.B.), doing a space walk repair. While somebody is playing REALLY LOUD Country music so you can barely hear the commentary. She is a medical engineer. Given a command to go inside because an emergency has occurred, she refuses, (for no apparent reason), and has to be ordered. The ship is destroyed by flying particles by accident and she becomes almost catatonic, then hysterical and remains that way through most of the movie. <br/><br/>Everyone is killed except George Clooney, the mission commander, who is calm, confident and knowledgeable in the spacecraft, physics and survival. S.B. has been sent into space after her daughter has accidentally died. S.B. is obviously suffering from PTSD but sent into space ANYWAY. No screening apparently, no psych tests, nothing. Like Obama choosing ambassadors based on their donations instead of EVER having been to a country, speaking the language or having any knowledge of it. She proceeds to do everything wrong and requires constant babysitting . NO ACTING GOING ON HERE. G.C. helps her until he valiantly dies to save her. She Can't fly the craft, always failed in training, and has no self-confidence whatsoever. Catastrophe on top of catastrophe she proves her mental instability, from being catatonic to hysterical to suicidal. <br/><br/>Apparently in Space everything is a couple of miles apart and easily reachable with little spacecraft attached to the shuttle, the International Space Station and the Chinese Space Station. Time after time she experiences disastrous calamities destroying one station after another. At last in the Chinese station she tries to commit suicide. WHY would an ASTRONAUT consider this, EVER? <br/><br/>She has a vision of G.C. who gives her essential information to try to survive, (except he's DEAD). Is this supposed to come from her head? When she clearly has NO practical knowledge or survivor skills? She can't read the Chinese characters and just hits buttons until by luck her module is jettisoned loose and she begins to enter the atmosphere and burn up. Somehow this does not occur and she lands safely in the ocean. Her module then begins to sink and she barely escapes drowning. Clue here - she is not attacked by sharks, whales or jellyfish, nor does she apparently land in Somalia. They probably deleted that part because the movie became too tedious. <br/><br/>S.B. was good in The Net. Here she's not a brilliant anything but a mother almost out of touch with reality because of a recent tragedy. Someone who should be institutionalized rather than sent to space. She's nearly non-functional and after the first ten minutes of the movie SHE'S THE ONLY ONE IN IT! This is an unusual idea of an astronaut...don't train, don't learn, don't be the best most competent at your job and know all the other ones too but instead feel sorry for yourself, cry a lot, become hysterical and even suicidal and everything will work out by sheer LUCK. <br/><br/>The effects were nice but we've seen those improve from 2001 to Oblivion. G.C. was too perfect which contrasted with S.B. to make her look even worse. Waste of money and time and Bullock is going to make over 70 million dollars from this. I hope they don't give her an award for this because it's running against ""Reliving Slavery Again"". The millions in HYPE apparently paid off. Propaganda wins over substance. Guess we'll never see another Casablanca again."

"fraduw","5","1","4","23 February 2014"," Brilliant but not very credible
","The plot assumes that gravity does not apply in deep space, which is fair, unless you find yourself in the proximity of a planet. However, the movie scene is very close to Earth surface, Hubble Telescope being low-orbit. Given that Earth radius is around 6000km, at 600km altitude you should feel around 90% of the gravity on Earth. The movie completely oversees that. Actually, the only way to be gravity free at this altitude is to be inside or hooked onto a Geo-stationary orbiting unit (like a satellite). Withstanding that, you are subject to Earth gravity. Floating around chaotically is not an option, you will be sucked by Earth's gravity field. On the other hand, if you are on a stationary orbit, you will revolve on a fixed position relatively to Earth, so you cannot see Earth spinning like this movie magnificently shows. I find it difficult to make terms with laws of physics being completely skewed. I guess that attention to detail could have been a bit better."
"thimage","3","1","4","18 February 2014"," Typical meaningless Hollywood
","Warning! This movie is bad, really bad. Don't waste your money on it. It is typical nowadays for Hollywood to spend millions in CGI, costumes and enhanced detail only to blow it with the story. Well in this case the story is almost nonexistent, the characters are so shallow that they seem to be made of cardboard, even with some pitiful attempts to let some personal character background to seep onto the screen.<br/><br/>Consider the effort invested into showing realistic Soyuz, Shenzou and ISS backgrounds, only to see them destroyed not once, not twice, but three times from under -so to speak in space- the main character... always seconds after arrival and most of it during spacewalk. Consider braking in space with a fire extinguisher to meet with an orbit decaying space-station. Worth mentioning is that the astronaut using the fire extinguisher to brake had been propelled on trajectory by Soyuz landing retrorockets (the energy gradient comparison is outrageous). Consider another astronaut sacrificing himself, releasing a tether AFTER having stopped his fall.... and more. <br/><br/>What's wrong with not destroying things in a movie for a change? Mission to Mars? Destruction of the ship. Red planet? Destruction of the habitat and serious damage to the ship. Now Gravity? Savage destruction of two main habitats and a space shuttle.

"jakegilday","9","1","4","16 February 2014"," A Brave Film: Visuals Don't Support The Story - The Story Supports The Visuals
","This is my first movie review - I'll make it as UN-SPOILED, and as to-the-point as possible (for now). Story: A deliberately simple and rather common tale. Visuals: The spectacular heart of the film, as all images in film are supposed to do. <br/><br/>OK, here it goes. The Gravity is a 2013 drama/thriller film, set in Outer Space just above the Earth. Sandra Bullock plays our heroine, Dr. Ryan Stone, and George Clooney plays Astronaut Mathew Kowalski in a supporting role. These two characters are part of a job in orbit to fix the Hubble Telescope (I believe that is what they were doing). Then suddenly, they receive a warning from Huston (Ed Harries' voice) that they are in mortal danger. Less than no-time later, a shattered Russian space (station or telescope), blown into a million tiny deadly pieces, hurls itself at them in an orbit of immense disaster. Stone's and Kowalski's space shuttle is destroyed, and they are the soul survivors of the cataclysmic event. The movie details their physical and emotional determination to get back to earth before the debris field circles the earth again and kills them directly. <br/><br/>To put it pretty bluntly, all types of people, of different cultures and genre-tastes, will see this film, at some point, and come away away with varying good and/or bad emotions, evoked... and regarding that, this is my opinion of the film: <br/><br/>The story, while honest and uncynical, is simplistic, and even facile - on the surface. The characters, while endearing, are distant and internal - on the surface as well; Everything a viewer who was bred on over-critiquing of films would say (me). At first, when I saw this film I thought it was kind of like Jurassic Park all over again: A movie where the special effects take center stage because the creative story and characters don't transcend as well on screen. Because I have come to think that a good MOVIE means that the visuals are there to support the story... But I was wrong. <br/><br/>In terms of A film, the visuals are Everything. Without visuals, the story and characters will not resonate. In a worst-success scenario, you can have a dreadful, hopeless story with sadistic characters that is a masterpiece of a film due to the visuals and direction that complement it. Or you could have THIS - Gravity is an example of a director (Alfonso Curon) who makes a movie that has unparalleled visuals: the earth, the stars, astronauts tumbling through space in complete zero-G realism - surrounded by story and characters so simple and bare-bones honest it makes you suspicious of what the main goal of making the film is. A story can be deceitful, as can the characters to - can seduce an audience into thinking about ""messages"" for what their worth. Very rarely do Visuals seduce an audience into thinking the plot presented is their to celebrate the visuals - which are the real Truth in this film. <br/><br/>I realize this is a lot, but movies have no absolute point due to their nature of relying on viewers emotions and opinions. (That's partly why I'll give all films a 9 or lower). Every film is different, and filmmakers have varying degrees of success in conveying emotions. For me, Gravity is a spectacular achievement in visuals effects Art, and the emotionally worthy story of two astronauts adrift in space together (along with great acting from our two main leads) are their to complete the overall Experience of this 90-minute Painting. <br/><br/>You may love it, hate it, be thrilled, or simply bored by GRAVITY. Only if you watch this film with unreasonable expectations will you forget its lasting cinematic worth. I loved it. My football-loving family? Not so much."

"randawells","1","1","4","6 February 2014"," Did I watch the same movie as everybody else?
","I am really confused. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And there are very few movies I hate. Why does everyone every one else love this movie? Horrible script, predictable plot, and very untrue with the science. It missed every piece to be even a decent movie, one of the pieces making me most annoyed was absolutely no character development.<br/><br/>I think the point I decided I officially hated the movie was when they were tethered together and George Clooney for some reason was being pulled away even though there was no gravity and no inertia to keep him from being pulled away. The movie did a great job of following science when it worked for their plot and just being completely void of it when it made what they thought was a more exciting story line. Come on, if you are going to make scifi movie, be true to the science part of it!<br/><br/>I will say I do love Sandra Bullock even after this unfortunate movie."

","So I started watching this movie not really sure what to expect because I'm not much of a Sci-Fi fan. I watched it on the basis that there have been so many good reviews. I have not regretted my decision. It is impossible to put into words how this movie actually makes you feel. It is superb. It is intense. When you consider that there are only 2 actors really in this film and it whittles down essentially to 1, it is mesmerizing that it could be so intense. I am literally unable to move effectively- I have to give myself some time. This movie took me on a journey. I didn't know whether Ryan would die or survive. You empathize with her but then it's almost beyond that...you experience everything she's experiencing without actually experiencing it. The visual effects are awesome and astounding and they take you out of your comfort and bring you along with them. The sound mimics your own internal processes with that wicked heart beat effect. Just brilliant. Brilliant."

","Relying on CGI and breath taking shots doesn't cut it for me. Sorry.

Although the cinematic sequence WERE breath taking I didn't have the pleasure of watching this in 3D or at an IMAX and couldn't help thinking how much I was missing out on visually. That said, visuals aren't the be all and end all to a great movie. <br/><br/>Gravity is one of those films that should rely on facts and reality but was too far fetched to be enjoyed.

Why the film even bothers in taking the time to point out that space is indeed silent is beyond me since there's always some sound playing. It's as if it's afraid to let go and take the viewer seriously, a streak that runs throughout the film.<br/><br/>Above all else I get the sense that Cuar√≤n wanted to make a film that was essentially CAST AWAY IN SPACE WITH SPACE EXPLOSIONS AND CATASTRPHIC RE-ENTRY and for what it's worth all those elements are here and executed effectively. But none of the things any sensible person would expect to see here are present. Why is it for example that the only communication Bullock manages to establish with the surface is with an amateur radio operator? Does Cuar√≥n really believe that NASA relies entirely on satellites to stay in touch with astronauts? Does he really think they would be unable to use ground based means in case of an emergency that renders ALL of their conventional channels inoperable?<br/><br/>The above is however a minor gripe and the same goes for all other ignorance regarding orbital mechanics. What really irks me about this film is the infantile dialogue.<br/><br/>At no point watching this film was I ever convinced the people on screen were astronauts, and that is the paramount failure of Gravity."

","I watched this movie with high expectations, hoping that it wouldn't conform to the standard blockbuster rubbish that tends to be so popular. Unfortunately I was hugely disappointed. After the first 10 minutes, which were pretty good, I was left shaking my head and scoffing throughout the entire movie. The visuals were good, but the script was absolute junk and I was ultimately disappointed that Sandra Bullock wasn't cleaned up by an asteroid or at least eaten by a shark at the end. If you're really into space movies then go and see this - it might be worth it for some of the cinematography - but prepare to sit through some seriously bad stuff in between."

","Have you ever had that dream, you know the one where you are detached from your physical body and you are floating around your room? Well, this film manages to give you that very same feeling, or at least very close. Its an experience, a roller-coaster ride, a chance for you to gaze at the stars far from the city, and an opportunity to see the world from outer space for what it is: Earth is a marble. A beautiful marble. A marble neutralized of aqua-green, turquoise blue, snow-flake white, and a God given glossy touch to its colors. Seeing it in the big screen, and in 3D, is a gift. It is for thy reason why Gravity has been recognized, and appreciated by so many. It deserves all the awards a movie in the making of five years would take. Very few movies have people returning to see a movie. I remember I went to see it a few days before it was supposedly going to be its last show, yet the room was still 3/4 full. People were actually seeing it again, bringing in their colleges. I belief it's because the movie is sort of like a roller-coaster. After you are done with the ride, you want to act as a child and get back in line for another one. The music is very engaging, the heart beat tones and the several sounds of transmitted vibrations all get to you. I didn't want to see the movie because people raved about it, I wanted to see it because I saw a short clip at the Imax website. I actually believed that it was a production from Imax. When the movie was over, and I found out otherwise, I wasn't disappointed but surprised. All the cinematography that is expected from an Imax documentary was present. To me this movie is a first of its kind, and definitely a closer take to a 4D film."

Almost every scene in this movie was breath-taking, from beginning to end. The 3D was also impressive.

Funny that although it's a three-dimensional movie, the orbits of the satellites had to be contrived to be two-dimensional, otherwise the flitting-from-wrecked-satellite-to-wrecked-satellite shtick wouldn't have worked.<br/><br/>But the opening scenes do give you a feeling of what EVA must be like, even if they're not accurate. Gravity does make you feel things you didn't expect, which can't be bad.<br/><br/>But in the end Gravity, however well put together, is not groundbreaking in any way beyond the advanced integration of 3D CGI, which means you should only hire/buy/visit it if you want to be able to say you were there in the early days of 3D CGI integration, like those people who ran away from the steam train back in 1903(?).<br/><br/>10 stars would mean 'perfect', which it isn't. 5 would mean 'average'. which it isn't.

But compare them, Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was a deep profound subtle masterpiece whereas Gravity was dumb thrill ride of no substance. 2001 looked forty, perhaps 100 years into the future, while Gravity reached back eight years at a now dead shuttle program.

","I had been looking forward to seeing this film, but was highly disappointed when I finally got to. But first, the good stuff:<br/><br/>I really did like the special effects. I watched it in IMAX 3D and it was awesome to see. I would have given it a 10 star rating if the SFX were all I was grading it on. And the premise was solid.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were just too many weaknesses. First of all, the movie seemed to start in the middle. Where was the build up? Where was the back story. I'll admit that I don't like movies that are too heavy on character development, but I do need a little. I need to feel as though I know who these people are. I didn't. And the lame attempt to fill in the back story during the long, boring trek from one space station to another didn't do the trick. It was like an afterthought.<br/><br/>And I can live with a little bit of scientific inaccuracy in order to help out a plot line, but this movie didn't seem to research the science at all. A critical point in the film comes when George Clooney's character untethers himself from Sandra Bullock's character in order to save her from flying off into space, as he did after he let go. But what force was there pushing him into space. His initial momentum was stopped when Bullock caught him. At that point, he should have been freely floating adjacent to the space station. The only thing that could have caused him to fly off into space was angular momentum if the space station had been rotating, but it didn't seem to be because the earth was always on the same side. Also, all the spacecraft shown in the film seemed to be in the same orbit. They are not in reality. They would have been orbiting at much different velocities. In addition, the space junk, having come from a different orbit, would have been traveling much faster than the film showed. There's more, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>That, in addition to the whole idea that Bullock's character could actually have been saved in the manner depicted is just too hard to swallow. Bottom line: The film was tedious in places, boring in places, and outright unbelievable in places. I'm surprised the critics didn't pick up on any of that. Maybe they were just all struck by the great special effects and gave it a pass on the other stuff."

There is a scene where she tries to contact Cloney, he is so far away that no longer listen to her, and she stars to talk about a some bearded man that Cloney use to talk about, and all just to see if he answers the call! And in the last scenes where she is falling back to earth, she is talking to Houston, in the middle of an all deadly return to earth, everything is crashing, and she said: ""Houston, I remember a story.. * (crash)*... forget the story!, forget the story!""

Sandra Bullock comes through the film as though she has visited the dry cleaners and not the actual tumble dryer she has been through, with her hair as flat as her performance. George Clooney seemed about to serve cocktails as he moves around on his space walk with the grin of a waiter attempting to get his first break into acting.<br/><br/>Perhaps a Pan-Galatic Gargle Blaster would have been a useful script tool for the two leads and the third astronaut may then have taken on the story alone, as his energy in conversation alone was more energetic and enthusiastic."

I never experienced fear in any movies, and I have watched plenty horror movies and the likes, but the idea of being lost in space and how it was depicted literally gave me the shivers. The pure essence of being alone. <br/><br/>After an amazing start the movie became too repetitive for me though. I felt that astronaut Ryan's odyssey was just a bit overdone after all. Sure, it is a scenario showing a catastrophe in space, but it felt unrealistic that absolutely everything that can go wrong really did. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Ryan hops from space station to space station just to see it explode in a few seconds, just like disappearing platforms in a Super Mario game. When she finds an emergency rescue shuttle, it miraculously has no gas - really? And that she nearly drowns when she finally makes it back to earth just felt annoying to me, all I thought was ""Come on, give her a break now."" Again, I know that it is supposed to be a survival scenario but when it is obvious that she will survive anyways the amount of obstacles thrown in her way could have been reduced and more emphasis could have been put on that feeling of being lost and desperate. <br/><br/>One of the few movies worth watching in 3D I might add, the visuals are fantastic and I think they account for the high rating of the movie so far. <br/><br/>All together I'd give it a solid 7,6!

","Since I watched the trailer I thought would be another bad science fiction movie. Normally Hollywood do not pay attention on science and want do do a blockbuster. After I watched the movie I confirmed my initial opinion. Despite the fact of a civilian with just 6 months of training would be on space doing a space walk, there are many problems with the science: Hubble telescope orbits on much higher orbit than ISS, probably they (Hubble and ISS) are in different speeds and direction, an astronaut that never saw a Chinese capsule would success land it. There are so many problems in the plot that it would be unlikely from the first scene. But... if you not a critic like me and throw away all science knowledge you will find this a very good movie. The special effects are amazing, Avatar level. My daughter ask me if it was filmed on space. The long scenes from different perspectives, some times in first person, like a game are amazing. This is a movie that deserves be seen, it is a little overrated, but It is a good movie."

","Judging by various internet rating sites, Gravity is currently the best movie from 2013. And along with those who adore and praise it, there are many people who have spent all their time, after seeing the movie, discussing it on various forums. The most talked-about issue is physics, which makes sense since Gravity is a sci-fi. But I doubt any recent sci-fi has ever been analysed so much ‚Äì and also hated and loved at the same time. It's obvious that Gravity is a very interesting movie, and it seems to be different from the usual stuff Hollywood gives us, which should be appreciated. Many people have been comparing it to 2001: A Space Odissey which, I think, best explains and summarizes the fame that's been building around Gravity ever since it came out.<br/><br/>The story in Gravity, unfortunately, is not as original as one may think. Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first mission in space, while Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is an astronaut on his last mission. While trying to repair some damage on the Hubble telescope, they are hit by debris from a destroyed satellite which wrecks the space shuttle Explorer, leaving only Stone and Kowalski alive. Kowalski uses his thruster pack to retrieve Stone, who was sent away from the shuttle, and together they make their way to the International Space Station. Here Gravity becomes a survival thriller ‚Äì a very good one, no doubt, but still nothing more than that, which is a shame since the setting alone allows more psychologically challenging developments.<br/><br/>I found the cast selection to be confusing: why Clooney and Bullock? They are not bad actors, but I don't think they fit their roles. Notably, before Bullock was cast there were many other (better) options, and even Robert Downey Jr. (who was also offered the role of Kowalski) would have been better than Clooney playing himself. Still, both our main actors do a good job ‚Äì especially Bullock, who spent months training for her role ‚Äì and even though their characters are not developed enough, it's difficult to notice that since the story keeps you glued to your seat. Gravity's opening scene is particularly amazing: there are no sounds apart from the radio communications among the astronauts and Mission Control, and a very long take, going in circle, shows us Earth, the shuttle and the astronauts up close. I admire Cuar√≥n's decision to acknowledge there is no sound in space, but I'd rather have sounds than a soundtrack that's occasionally exaggeratedly loud and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Furthermore, many people claim Gravity is scientifically inaccurate, but unless you're a physicist or an aerospace engineer, I don't think you will notice/mind many of those mistakes ‚Äì besides, Cuar√≥n himself admits he ""adapted"" the physics to suit the plot. Interestingly, the movie is only 90 minutes long but feels much longer, in a good way. It also has a lower budget than many other epic sci-fi movies, but looks much better. Actually, Gravity is the most beautiful and tense movie I've seen in a while, with some perfectly directed scenes. The tension is mostly built through very long takes and some POV shots. In summary, it all comes down to this: the movie is visually stunning and has loads of potential, but doesn't exploit it fully. The dialogues (and monologues) are mostly clich√©d, some even make you cringe. Had it been a mostly silent movie, had it concentrated on the psychological effect of the fear of imminent death on people, Gravity would have been better. But it would also have seemed like a Space Odissey ripoff, and it definitely wouldn't have been a Hollywood movie. Despite its flaws, I recommend this movie, because it's a unique experience Hollywood probably won't present us again soon.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"

","Essentially an excellent special effects movie. Beautiful to watch and 3D did nothing to add to film. No character development. We don't really know who they are(Clooney/Bullock). Pretty much all dialogue with a helmet on. At the end of the movie I felt deflated because I didn't know the characters and who they were. Just immediately jump into special effects and a lot of heart pounding but that's it. Poster picture for staying on terra firma.<br/><br/>But there needed to be a build up to the accident and a development of the 2 actors in the film so we know have a vested emotional interest. In my theater I became deaf during previews so I may have missed some important dialogue but I doubt it.<br/><br/>Wait for video."

","It is a good story to tell and present and on the big screen well you get your tickets worth. There are even some intense scenes that make one ponder what they would do but that is where it starts to come apart as well. The one thing I could not except was the noisy, meaningless chatter and country music on an important space mission. At some point even Bullocks character asks for the music to be turned off...thank you. If they would have worked on the story more, this could have been a ten. We go from traveling effortless in space, romping around, rescuing people and then come close to running out of fuel and oxygen. Then, no less than three spacecraft are involved like if they were taxi cabs in space. The one you came in, the Russian one and then the Chinese craft all standing by for someone that can float on by and hitch a ride. There are too many episodes of not making sense to list here which would create a too negative post. Back to my opening point. You get entertained for 1.5 hours and leave it at that. Thank you"
"rachel-673-19946","6","1","4","3 October 2013"," Thrilling and accomplished, but not much else
","So: GRAVITY. Acclaimed at Venice and TIFF; praised by critics everywhere; brought to us by visionary director Alfonso Cuar√≥n; and starring two A-Listers who, bizarrely, have never worked together before. Also, while not all that science fiction-y, since most of this is pretty much possible within the bounds of humanity's current level of tech‚Äîwhich is, in itself, pretty amazing‚Äîthe fact that this serendipitous confluence of filmmaker, film royalty and film festival fanfare should fall even remotely within our purview has made this movie, and its probable awesome, a hot topic around Geek Speak headquarters for months.<br/><br/>Which is why I am sorry to report that it's just... it's just not that good.<br/><br/>Oh, it is replete with simply breathtaking special effects, and the cinematography (or whatever passes for cinematography when most of your action takes place on a green screen) is top notch. GRAVITY is also a thrill-ride of fear and dread as our plucky, if annoyingly shrill, heroine (Sandra Bullock) and her only surviving astronaut colleague (George Clooney) are left adrift in space after satellite debris attacks their orbital position and kills anyone who has not won an Oscar. But if you've seen the movie BURIED, the one with Ryan Reynolds trapped in a cave-in on the phone to a calm-voiced company rep (and if you haven't, you should, it's great) then you will get the general gist here, except that BURIED doesn't burden us with pointless and torturously sentimental third act exposition about character backstory for no good reason at all. Everyone hated AFTER EARTH (and hey, I get it; those accents were awful), but it relied a lot on the same conceit. I'm not saying GRAVITY doesn't do it better. I'm just saying, GRAVITY is kind of like AFTER EARTH‚Äîwhich is, I'm guessing, something no one wanted to hear.<br/><br/>The plot is a super simple one; so simple, in fact, that I already gave it to you in less than a sentence in the above paragraph. What remains is pretty much silence, and while that silence can be pulse-thumpingly terrifying and is used to good effect ‚Äì because in space, no one can hear you scream... unless they're on the com ‚Äì its cynical employment throughout is symptomatic of the film as a whole. It is all very effective, but it is not very affective. You will probably be entranced, immersed and enthralled from pretty much the outset (I'll concede, I certainly was), but when all is said and done, GRAVITY is as unrealistic, as clich√© and as forgettable as any other popcorn action- horror flick ‚Äì perhaps even more so. It's basically the cinematic equivalent of a carnival ride; Space Mountain, if it lasted for 90 minutes and got really boring towards the end. I think it's trying to be all metaphorical at its denouement, but honestly, when your subtext is written in such a large font, it goes from pointed allegory to outright laughable stupidity quicker than you can say ""No one ever taught me to pray."" (Not, by the way, the movie's cringe-iest line. There are a lot of contenders for that title ‚Äì maybe it's a lost in translation thing? Like when hit Asian rom coms get Hollywood remakes and all the over-the- top humor is rendered bizarre? Because the overwrought periods of Cuar√≥n Sr. and Jr. might not be out of place in a favorite ¬°telenovela!, but they fit very uncomfortably here.) (Wait. Is that racist?)<br/><br/>If you are planning to see GRAVITY ‚Äì and I still think you should, if for no other reason than that everyone else will ‚Äì then I suggest you do it while it is still in theaters, unless your home is equipped with a 3D projector and at least a twelve foot blank wall. Because this is a movie that is pretty much built for IMAX 3D, and without the additional element of visceral terror that comes from feeling like you, too, are hurtling through the inky black night accompanied only by the panicked (irritating) breathing of a stranded human rapidly losing hope of rescue, then this movie doesn't really have a lot to offer. It's rewatch quotient is pretty much zero, as well, so purchasing it on Blu-ray is simply out of the question, even if you do decide to watch it in your hypothetical kickass home entertainment room that I now totally want.<br/><br/>You know what it is? George Clooney, as genial and handsome and charming as he is (and oh, he is; Bullock is excellent here, too, with way more screen time), should just stay the hell out of space. I won't say he should stay out of our genre, because THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS! FROM DUSK TILL DAWN! Hell, even SPY KIDS! But considering SOLARIS and now this, I think it is time to revoke his off-world privileges, much as his superhero license was surely incinerated after his ill-fated stint as Batman.<br/><br/>And as for Alfonso Cuar√≥n ‚Äì he's a truly great director who should stick to putting other people's big ideas up on the big screen. CHILDREN OF MEN was a triumph of adaptation, a movie that not only had something to say but said it beautifully. Here, the message, if such there be, is lost in the CGI, and all the while the Laws of Physics are treated like they are made of Play-Doh, which is especially ironic, given the title. GRAVITY is lots and lots of style, but not much substance, and once you leave the theater and your pulse rate returns to normal, it's difficult to recall exactly what had you so excited to begin with."

First of all, it's a great survival story. It follows in the footsteps of ""Apollo 13,"" ""Cast Away,"" ""The Grey,"" and many other tales of man (or in this case woman) vs. nature. There are a lot of horrific ways to die and spinning off into space has got to be pretty high up there (no pun intended). ""Gravity"" takes that basic fear of helplessness and uses it to underpin every action scene in this movie. I'm an action movie aficionado and I can't remember the last time a movie made me hold my breath like ""Gravity"" did. And there are few environments as unique, deadly and beautiful as space to set a survival story in. If you're a fan of action or survival dramas, you'll really enjoy this."
"braedenjprice","2","1","5","14 July 2014"," Space movie aimed at very general audience, with little care for detail
","Boy, I am glad I downloaded this movie instead of buying it. After all the hype around it (even on this website, it is currently rated at 8/10 stars), I would have thought it was the best movie of 2013. But as I began to watch the film, I started wondering how on Earth (no pun intended) this movie could have possible been nominated for accolades such as Best Picture and Best Director.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck out to me were the physical impossibilities rampant throughout the film. Ryan, the protagonist, flies off of the space arm and spins off into space, yet somehow a mere ten seconds later, her spin has slowed considerably. Or what about how the parachute opens later in the movie IN SPACE. That is impossible!<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest fault in the movie was simply how unlikely the entire plot was. A chunk of debris is flying around the earth at 6 miles per second? No way can you spot that with your naked eye, and no way EACH AND EVERY satellite and space station orbiting the earth just happens to orbit along the same path. No way Ryan would be able to move from one space station to another. No way.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint with the film was how emotional unstable Ryan was. How did she manage to get selected to go into space with only six months of training and a recently deceased daughter? For the amount of hysterics and silly monologue viewers must endure, one can only come to the conclusion that Ryan is not suitable for being an astronaut and would have never been chosen in the first place.<br/><br/>To end on a positive note, the graphics were quite good, like most other reviews claim. I was impressed with the space stations and the depiction of earth.<br/><br/>In conclusion, do not waste your time on this so-called ""Greatest Space Movie Of All Time""."

","things happened so fast and before I knew it, Ryan Stone was saying ""thank you"" and the credits were rolling. I like movies that come to the point immediately but this one was a little too ""boom, bang, bing."" Aside from that feeling, it was a brilliant albeit not very scientifically accurate film. A group of astronauts are making repairs on a Hubble Space Telescope when they receive an emergency alert from the Houston command centre to abandon their mission and begin re-entry into the earth's atmosphere immediately. Apparently a missile strike to destroy an abandoned Russian satellite is sending speeding debris their way. Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) a medical engineer (on her first mission into space) initially hesitates to abandon her tasks but is given an order by mission commander Matthew Kowalski (George Clooney) a veteran astronaut (on his last mission into space before retirement) and she finally obliges. Stone soon realises the severity of the situation when their colleague, flight engineer Shariff (Phaldut Sharma) is momentarily struck and killed by flying debris before he can detach himself from the equipment he was working on. Soon after they lose contact with Houston mission control, Stone panics and the consequences of her reactions leaves her drifting off into space until she is rescued by Kowalski. Further panic and lack of experience on Stone's part leads to further complications in their escape plan as they proceed to investigate the impact of the damage on their ship, retrieve Shariff's body and plot a mission to reach the damaged International Space Station (ISS) in order to retrieve a shuttle to get them to the Chinese Space Station Tiangong that is slowly falling back to earth. Brilliant acting and emoting by Bullock, she pretty much owned the entire movie, Clooney was more like a supporting actor and just cake walked through his part. Definitely an achievement in cinematography."

","I am also a nerd and I agree with all the nit-picky complaints about irrational features or unscientific details, but they are not enough to ruin the movie if you recall WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE. Please allow me to explain. Would you criticize a Mazda Miata because you can't bring a set of table and chairs home in it? No, it makes a lousy pickup, but it was never intended to be a pickup truck. Judge the movie for what it was INTENDED to be, a fictional account, not a spaceflight documentary. Would you slam a western movie where the sheriff is at full gallop, chasing the outlaws, yet manages to shoot them with a handgun from the back of his speeding horse? Would anyone over the age of 9 years believe that? Why don't we pick of the Harry Potter movies or Lord of the Rings. They are full of mind-stretching details.<br/><br/>I could cut them enough slack on all that if the movie had a real plot, if the screenplay had any believable characters, Unfortunately, it has neither. However, the most annoying feature of all is the thunderous music/soundtrack. Cuaron begins the movie describing the total silence of space, except for radio talk. Floating loose from your ship in dead silence would seem more eerie and frightening. But movies need music and this director and composer have resorted to a cheap trick. You can build movie suspense by hammering the audience with loud, dlscordant music, but then it is the noise that makes us tense and uncomfortable, not the action. I actually had to turn it down during the loudest scenes--I did not want to injure my 2 dogs hearing!<br/><br/>I did get one smile though. When Bullock finally made it into the Soyuz capsule and floated weightlessly while removing her space suit, it reminded me of Barbarella, that AWFUL sci fi spoof from the sixties. This may be the worst sci fi spoof ever made and it doesn't even try for scientific veracity, but the opening scene is justifiably famous. Jane Fonda opens the movie floating weightlessly and removing each part of her space suit just like Bullock, revealing her rather amazing 30-year old birthday suit. No, I am not asking Sandra Bullock to do the same.<br/><br/>Overall, a thin story that is being used to show off their skills at cinematography and computer generated action. Admittedly excellent but the movie is ""all hat and no cattle""."

But it never felt too fictional, putting you right into the ""action"" and drama. Do things happen one after another and might seem rational implausible? Yes they do, but again the experience is too good, to be dismissing it like that.<br/><br/>After the movie ended (and I have to stress out, the vote/rating is for the 3D version of the movie only), I was unable to get up ...

","I see people complaining about how unrealistic this movie is in terms of the science of space travel. But this is not a sci-fi movie, nor an action movie. It's a drama from beginning to end. The whole thing is a metaphor for rebirth. Sandra Bullock's character essentially died when her child was killed. As often happens in real life, God brought her back through trauma. Symbols of God are shown at multiple points in the movie.<br/><br/>When I say the movie is metaphor for rebirth, I don't mean just spiritually. That was the end result for Sandra's character, of course, but from start to finish the movie lays out in symbolic, physical manifestations the different stages of reproduction: <br/><br/>1. Erection - This is the Russian missile that is used to destroy the satellite.<br/><br/>2. Intercourse - This is the missile launching into space.<br/><br/>3. Ejaculation - This is the missile hitting the satellite, causing the explosion of particles that later wreak havoc on the shuttle.<br/><br/>These 3 phases represent the stereotypical male, carelessly spreading his seed around without thinking about the longer term consequences.<br/><br/>4. Conception - This is when the debris from the satellite strikes the shuttle, triggering the rebirth sequence of the hero.<br/><br/>5. Womb - This is space, where the hero floats around like a baby in amniotic fluid.<br/><br/>6. Umbilical cord - This is the space suit, providing life support to the hero going through the re-birthing process.<br/><br/>6. Mother - This is George Clooney's character, protecting and nurturing the hero going through the re-birthing process.<br/><br/>7. Trimesters - These are the 3 different space craft used during the re-birthing process. In once scene the hero even lays there clearly in the fetal position.<br/><br/>8. Water breaking - This is the break-up of the last spacecraft as it prepares to deliver the hero to life on earth.<br/><br/>9. Labor - This is the chaotic descent of the landing module through the atmosphere. There is even this interesting sound effect at the start of the musical track for this scene that symbolizes the mother's scream of pain (it's not a sound a spacecraft would make, and it's timed with the music, not the action).<br/><br/>10. Cutting the cord - This is when the hero takes off her space suit in the water now that it is no longer needed as she prepares to take her first breath back on earth.<br/><br/>And of course at the end Sandra's character very slowly stands back up and starts to walk in a staggered fashion, much like a baby learning to do that for the first time.<br/><br/>Like most great movies this one is not about how things are, but about how things should be. I think you'll like it a lot if you treat it as a drama and not sci-fi/action."

","Gravity, being hailed as a cinematic masterpiece and expected to be the ""Greatest Space Movie of All Time"" ‚Äì quoted directly from the Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. The audience and critic response however was hugely mixed. Although yes, some agree with Cuaron and did completely adore the new space epic, the others were massively disappointed. Unfortunately, I am one of the dissatisfied viewers. <br/><br/>Having seen the trailers and being amongst the massive hype for Gravity, of course I could not wait to see the movie on the big screen. In fact, I actually planned to skip the opening weekend and visit an even bigger screen, London's IMAX. Unfortunately, (for the time) I was gutted to have missed the screening, which resulted in me watching the 2D version. Now, yes I do suggest that I would have written a slightly more positive review if I had indeed watched the film in 3D, considering the new use of technologies won it an astonishing 7 Oscars. However, I did not. And in a way I am pleased, because the experience showed me how little the overestimated film had to offer other than the visuals. <br/><br/>I usually would give a film the benefit of the doubt and suggest that maybe if the enormous hysteria wasn't so enormous, then I wouldn't have had such high expectations and would therefore not be as disappointed. However, I don't believe this. Gravity lacked exciting narrative, character development and emotional involvement. Having enjoyed Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001) due to the deep character development and emotional manipulation, I expected more with Gravity. There was not one moment within the film that made me feel sorry or scared for Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), which is also surprising considering I respect Bullock as an actress. Awkwardly, I did not find myself wanting Stone to get out of any situations or even returning home. Other than one underdeveloped story she reluctantly tells Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) about losing her daughter, there is no reason we would want Stone to return home. Regarding both Bullock and Clooney as remarkable actors, the film and narrative did not do either of them justice. They were boring characters with no need or desire to get home safely. <br/><br/>Plot holes. There are many I could discuss but I will only mention a few. Bullock, for a lot of the screen time, is untethered, spinning and whirling around space. This is highly unlikely as NASA provide an emergency pack, which is programmed to automatically adjust, roll and pitch to stop the astronaut from spinning. It is routine that the jet pack will then be manually taken control of and used to return to the space vehicle. It is also known that there is no sound in space, which the audience is also reminded at the very start of the film. However, we hear the wrench actuating when used by Bullock in the very exposition. <br/><br/>Something that really infuriated me was the resolution. What could be more dissatisfying than seeing Bullock crawl to the surface of what looks like another abandoned land. There is nobody to help her, nothing to make us feel relief or happiness that she is back on Earth. The only positive is that is actually humorous watching Bullock learn how to walk again. Other than that, the ending is nothing but another boring and frustrating scene in a movie full of them. <br/><br/>I can't help but replay the moment where Bullock is barking to a Chinese man from inside her isolated space vessel. Barking. Like a Dog. I understand that Bullock is at the end of her tether and is convinced she is on her deathbed. However I do not think this is a valid enough reason. This is completely embarrassing for Bullock and the director. Alone and scared, Stone finds herself on her space radio and finds herself in contact with a man in China when trying to find help. He doesn't understand a word on English so Stone ends up finding comfort in the mans dog. Strange, I know. Bullock spends the next moments barking to the dog and to make things weirder, we then hear an uncomfortable cry from a baby. Although the majority of the films are completely predictable, this certainly was not. During this scene Bullock also curls up in the foetus-like stance and whirls round and round. This could not be more of an obvious symbolism. <br/><br/>All round, Gravity was predictable and highly overrated (in my opinion of course). Cuaron and his son spent an amazing 6 years paying so much time and effect perfecting the visuals and hiring two insanely famous actors to add bank-ability to their movie. However during this process, they completely forgot about the attention they needed to have been paying to the plot, dialogue and characters. No wonders there are doubts about the 1969 moon landing. Disappointing."

","I was able to watch the entire movie in under 20 mins. I've seen some really bad films in my time that I was able to sit through and occasionally fast forward through. There have even been a few I had to turn off and not watch at all or completely walk out. At least with 2001 Space Odyssey I was able to sit through one viewing, all subsequent viewings have put me to sleep. I can't even sit through one viewing of this crap. I had to fast forward past almost every, so, tripe, dull, boring. Sooze fest. It would have been a much better film if we had seen Clooney's mask come of and watch rapid decompression and sub freezing on him and then burn up in earths atmosphere. That's a movie I'd actually pay to watch. Luckily I didn't have to pay a dime for this movie. My roommate / best friend offered to pay my way to the movies on big screen on this. But like all other movies now a days, nothing is worth paying 20 bucks to go see on big screen anymore. Certainly not this. I was so unimpressed with this film that I waited till he got the Blu-ray / 3D and would only watch it on DVD, which, I will have to re watch some of it on Blu-ray on computer so I can see the level of detail the 3D modelers/atists put into some of the stations. Still Pacific Rim was much better in that aspect. 3D Pacific Rim was phenomenal as well for being post production. Overall I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I think Sandra's greatest achievement yet was The Blind Side. I've always liked her and thought her to be talented and beautiful. But I'm sorry, I couldn't really feel anything for this character in this one."

","I just watched the movie Gravity, its not the kind of movie I would normally watch, but I watched it all the way through, just on the strength of how many Oscar nominations it has. I thought it was a load of rubbish and a waste of 91 minutes of my time. When a movie like The Butler, doesn't get nominated for any Oscars at all and this movie gets 10 Oscar nominations, then in my opinion, it doesn't bode well for the future of movies. I realise that not all genres are suited to everyone, but I can't understand how well this movie rates, through all the different age groups. It makes me very dubious of IMDb ratings, which I had regarded as reliable, until now. In case I haven't written 10 lines, so that this registers, I thought it was RUBBISH. RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH, and more RUBBISH and obviously I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless they have 91 minutes to waste. If it was worthy of ANY Oscar nominations at all, Special Effects is about the only one I reckon it would qualify for. I also object to being told that realise is spelt with a z. In the USA it is, they make up their own language, also spelt is an English word. The dictionary needs updating."

","These reviews seem to all agree on one thing, the visuals were great. Yes, Earth is very beautiful from space, we can stare at it all day I'm sure. But that's about it for the visuals. Earth, every once in awhile, beautifies the movie, over, and over. Other than that the visuals were above average but nothing to gawk at and be mesmerized by. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock, who plays a character that I guess some may be interested in but I found to be weak and lucky. Not worthy of astronaut status. George Clooney plays a robot who enjoys country music. Clich√©d hero indeed. No sense of urgency at all and is very weird. I guess there may be a few psychopaths who may react like that if they were ever up in space and have been found to be imminently doomed, but I doubt they would make it to be an astronaut and would likely be trying to commit some mass genocide instead. Both characters basically suck.<br/><br/>About 30 mins into the movie I pretty much give up on it and all hope for the remaining whatever minutes. Running at about 2% left of oxygen and they need to get to a luckily nearby unmanned space station, instead of saving their breathe they both proceed to have a half hour long conversation about nothing. About how beautiful the earth is. Or the sunrise is from space. As if the movie was made and those lines were made only to reinforce you graphic enthusiasts and would be able to call this the greatest space movie of all time, somehow. <br/><br/>The story is pretty ridiculous overall. I am all in favor of suspending understanding of reality in favor of entertainment, but from what I heard about this movie, I was looking for a realistic depiction of space travel, maybe like Apollo 13, which essentially blows this movie away. While I understand that may be my fault for expecting this, it still doesn't change the fact this movie was pretty stupid for the most part. Sorry I paid $20 for the VUDU download."

","For me , a film is only ever as good as the actors/actresses who hold it together and this film delivers hugely on both. Starring basically George Clooney and Sandra Bullock ,the film centers around an issue with a satellite in space that they are up there to sort out. I won't spoil it for you but at some point debris is sent hurtling towards them and they must rush to get out of its way and survive. While i have seen better films in my life , i have NOT seen anything as good in at least a year. Its basic concept and small cast lead you on an intense journey that should have you on the edge of your seat at times.

Nevertheless the result was poor according to me after watching Gravity. They could have done it better. Even though the beginning of the film is great and promising, the rest of it does not continues at the same way. Scenario is poor, and the act of Sandra really not so good. I think the movie finishes a little sudden and rapid. Very good visual effects. George is great as always but his role could have been better. Nice scenes during the adventure outside the space stations but the existence of a love story was really disturbing."
"theflixerdotcom","8","1","5","8 February 2014"," Great movie, but may not be for everyone
","Gravity was a very decent and suspenseful movie. I have heard some complaints about the 'plausibility' of something like this, but I have to say that made no difference to me. Bullock and Clooney do a very good job as this movie is heavily reliant on their emotions throughout the scenes. There isn't much in the way of supporting cast or special effects to take the focus away from them, hence the reason the movie is up for some many awards.<br/><br/>I couldn't really find a flaw with this movie per se, other than the fact I found it a little slow at times. I chalk that up to being one of those moviegoers that critics hate where I enjoy a fast paced BIG movie. You have to remember going in that this is a movie where the main focus is going to be on two characters and so not much else goes on around them.<br/><br/>Bullock did a great job carrying the movie as she is the true star of the film. She gets the majority of the screen time and does a great job going through the emotional roller coaster that is required for this role. This would have been a very tough film to carry and much of the success is because of the way she portrayed the character and carried the film. She'll likely win many awards for this movie.<br/><br/>Clooney plays the more experienced astronaut and his role is very important as far as motivating Bullock's character. He does a great job, but it felt a little bit like he was just playing himself to me. I didn't really feel he was as in character as Bullock was. Seems like he had some spare time so he decided to jump in.<br/><br/>All in all, Gravity is a great movie, but I think it's one of those movies that will win a bunch of awards and be forgotten in a year. It's not going to appeal to every movie goer as it's more geared to showcase an actor's chops rather than appeal to a large broad audience. It'll be loved by critics, but not necessarily be for everyone."
"sharath-alamuri","9","1","5","8 February 2014"," Spectacular!!
","I love fantasy fiction; the more fantastical the story line, the better. But when it comes to movies I seek verisimilitude. I know that all movies call for varying degrees of suspension of disbelief; my threshold for that, however, is very low. As a result I find myself frequently bemoaning the fact that fewer movies today are grounded in reality. I am bothered by logical inconsistencies, scientific inaccuracies and anachronisms. I find myself obsessing over trivialities and fail to truly enjoy a movie. So, when a movie stays with me for days after watching it, it is one to be treasured.<br/><br/>Watching Gravity in imax 3D was an experience, the likes of which I haven t had in my life. The visuals are breathtakingly spectacular. Awe inspiring vistas, the beauty of which cannot be described by mere words form the backdrop. Yet they do not distract from the story line, in fact they are integral to it. The vastness of Space feels paradoxically confining, stifling. The soundtrack is effectively used; the crescendos adding to the urgency, the silences terrifying, chilling, sinister even.<br/><br/>George Clooney as Lieutenant Matt Kowalski is engaging and effective. His easy manner and joie de vivre are all the more impressive as they stay in place even in the face of imminent and unavoidable death. But the true star of this movie is Sandra Bullock. Her Ryan Stone is her career best performance ( Yes! better than her Oscar winning role in The Blind Side ). I know the odds on favourite for the best actress Oscar is Cate Blanchett. Her work in Blue Jasmine is being lauded and rightly so. But I believe that Sandra Bullock deserves the Oscar. In the space of ninety minutes, she goes through the whole gamut of human emotion - fear, sadness,resignation, determination, joy, anger and victorious exultation in the end. She holds this movie together.<br/><br/>The director's vision must be commended. This is the best use of 3D since Avatar; I contend that this is better than Avatar. There are many themes I could identify in this story. First and foremost, this is a thriller with many of the elements of a shipwreck story. The Space setting underscores both the urgency and the improbability of a rescue. This movie also very subtly, almost subliminally suggests the need for moving past tragedy. The visual of Sandra Bullock floating in the ISS is very reminiscent of a foetus in utero. The final sequence in the film is one that reminds me of birth and evolution. <br/><br/>The four elements Air, Fire, Water and Earth feature prominently in this movie. Religious motifs are presented ever so deftly. The movie also raises the question of divine inspiration very tactfully. That the many themes are neither glaringly obvious and gratuitous nor too subtle to discern is a testament to the skill of the director. There are probably many scientific inaccuracies in this movie. For once, I don't care.<br/><br/>I love this movie because it celebrates the very best of human nature - the will to survive, the resolve to overcome adversity, selflessness, ingenuity and creativity of the human mind.<br/><br/>This was the movie I was waiting to see for a very long time. I just didn't know it."

And then I did get further excited after hearing everyone go gaga about it after the release in October 2013.<br/><br/>Talking about my own experience, well, for the first few minutes it felt like I was watching just another picture of the earth and satellites. But within no time, the feeling changed. Felt like I was myself drifting into outer space. And I'm sure, anyone who has seen this movie in 3D on the big screen will agree, that Gravity is not just another movie, but an experience. I can't recollect any other movie with a cast as small as Gravity's. And that's what the film is all about - George Clooney, Sandra Bullock and the vast expanse we call as outer space. I couldn't agree with James Cameron when I read his words about the film - 'I think it's the best space photography ever done, I think it's the best space film ever done, and it's the movie I've been hungry to see for an awful long time'"

No, a rewrite wasn't necessaryl just sprinkle in a few lines here and there about a baby dying (cause what's more dramatic than a baby dying?)and enjoying the cold, dark, desolate, lonely silence of space (hey, that sounds pretty bleak, amirite?!), and thus a back story was born. Oh and what an effective back story it was because at one point I think (at least I maybe might have thought. possibly.) that Bulluck's character (a horrible or perfect (?!) miscast,as this actress has no emotional depth just like the movie) had no will for survival -- but then again maybe she just was running out of oxygen and just didn't have the energy -- only to realize she wanted to live.

","I was skeptical going in to this movie. I thought it would be boring because it would all take place in space. Another concern was that there were only two characters. I later found out that was not how it failed; the problem was that not much went on overall. I think it would work better if there were more events leading up to were they had to abort there mission. The events were dragged out by introducing new problems frequently. Another main problem is that Koloski is lost early into the movie. I think it would work much better if him and Ryan got separated near the end. The drama was well done but did not have as much of an affect as it would of it wasn't constant. Since this movie fails in plot it excels visually. It was realistic looking and entertaining in that part. I think that this movie is worth watching just because of the entertainment value."

","I guess all the hype about this movie had raised my expectations, which is never a good thing. Nevertheless, I wanted to see the movie in IMAX 3D to get the full effects, which I did. First off, George Clooney sounded more like Danny Ocean than like a real astronaut. This is not to say that astronauts don't make jokes and tell stories but, under the circumstances of the movie, that folksiness was misplaced. But my main problem with this movie is that it was filled with disasters that would have killed the astronauts several times over, but somehow they are survivable in this movie. In truth, that makes it similar to many Hollywood films, like Mission Impossible, for example. But we expect that kind of unbelievability in movies like that whereas we were led to believe that this one was more realistic, and that's why I ultimately felt let down. Most of the situations faced in this movie simply were unbelievable. I also have to say that the ending came way too suddenly, as if the real ending had been cut off. Did the filmmakers not know how to end the movie? It sure seemed that way. Ultimately, I am glad I saw it but felt a little ripped off after having paid $16 for an IMAX ticket. I expected more."

","Years ago I used to work in tourism and visited Houston and Cape Canaveral quite often and never missed the see the IMAX space movie there. This was the main reason why I went to see Gravity because I was hoping to see beautiful images from space again. Unfortunately I made the wrong decision to see the movie not in 3D. Though the images were still quite beautiful but not so spectacular as I remembered them from the NASA films. Every movie I had seen so far in 3D left me always dissatisfied, but after reading the comments it might have been a better idea to see Gravity in 3D and I considered to go and see it again in 3D. On the other hand I could live without seeing the story again and listening to the dialog. Clooney played himself in a space suit and Bullock was hyperventilating most of the time.<br/><br/>Space debris is certainly a very important subject to tackle and the more satellites we are sending into space, the bigger the problem gets. So in this aspect the movie was realistic. I cannot judge how many mistakes were made scientifically, but some of the stuff just did not seem probable. I could not understand why Clooney was drifting off into space....<br/><br/>Obviously the character of Bullock was not sufficiently trained to go on a mission like that and I wondered if that could happen in reality. I was also frustrated that she was not only ill-prepared and panicky, but also howling like a dog and most of the time half-naked. Come on Hollywood,can a female scientist not be competent and dressed? I understand that S. Bullock is considered to be America's sweetheart for some reason, but I have never seen a performance from her which impressed me. I also have to admit that I have seen her only in reruns on TV, I never bought a ticket before to see her in a movie theater. Correction, I just remembered that I saw her in ""Time to kill"" the movie adaption of John Grisham's best novel and I thought that she was completely miscast in that movie. Nothing in her performance brought the Grisham character to life for me. After just seeing Cate Blanchett with an incredible performance in Blue Jasmine, directed by Woody Allen, and carrying the movie with ease, I can only say that S. Bullock was completely and totally miscast in this movie. This movie asked for a real strong actress and that she is certainly not.<br/><br/>So I would recommend the movie for the visuals (obviously in 3D would be better)and not for the story or the acting (Clooney being himself is not really acting). I am a little bit disappointed with the director,Alfonso Cuar√≥n, whose movies I usually love, but nobody delivers every time. And now I am determined to see one the NASA IMAX movies again. images from space are so intoxicating, you certainly do not need a whining, half-naked, hyperventilating Sandra Bullock in the forefront."

","Sorry, Sandra and George, the film is just too incredible to be a good film. It's like making a movie about circus lion tamers and showing the introduction of a new and savagely ferocious feral lion into whose jaws the lion tamer then instantly proceeds to safely put his head and after leaving his head inside the lion's jaws for more than ten minutes pulls away as the jaws snap shut and the crowd roars its approval. Not believable. The reality would be a headless, eaten human corpse and an angry feral lion seeking both its freedom and more victims.<br/><br/>This movie stretched reality so far beyond the breaking point that I could NOT like it. I did like the absolutely gorgeous CGI special effects....very powerfully done, very beautiful.<br/><br/>I did not like the CGI special effects for their absolute breach of credulity.<br/><br/>I usually like the acting of Clooney and even to some degree, although she is far from being a strong actress in my esteem, that of Sandra Bullock. But here I found Clooney a clich√©d version of some of the many characters he's played: insouciant at times, self-absorbed at times, seemingly in control even when all conditions indicate a total lack of control---in essence he was too much Clooney in Space for the horror of what was unfolding for his and Bullock's characters.<br/><br/>I didn't believe in his character.<br/><br/>Bullock is very limited in her ability to convey strong fear---which was necessary here----my primary objection to her role playing in Gravity. Might another actress been better? Sure, but they would have been stuck in the same surreal and incredible CGI imagery as was Bullock. But someone else who could more authentically project emotions would have been better than her.<br/><br/>I do not wish to write a review with spoilers in it, and in this I am not as able to convey most of my criticism of the special effects and the script. . . .but this is where I most dislike the movie. Things such as running out of oxygen and then continuing to breathe and function for five more minutes, or being burnt alive yet being unscathed aren't exactly the stuff of realism----but this entire movie is built on such staggeringly overt bloopers. Is it any wonder I didn't like it?<br/><br/>""Gravity"" watches like a good short story reads. There are enough twists and turns to keep the viewer intrigued and just as there is an intensity in the short story form---a compression of dramatic action that allows the short story to be very powerful and memorable ---so it is with ""Gravity.""<br/><br/>So the movie does have an intensity . . . which is why many people will like it, regardless its awful script shortcomings and errors. But a good short story invites the willing reader to believe in the protagonist's plight . . .and if that belief isn't there, the story suffers as a result.<br/><br/>Such is the case with this movie---it just isn't believable enough to allow me to buy into it. Had they toned down the severity of the near misses, reduced the repeated number of escapes from sure-death scenarios I think it would have been much more believable, and far more powerful a movie.<br/><br/>Color me unconvinced."

I've been a fan of Bullock for a long time and this is one of her better films, I would put it right up there with ""The Blind Side"".<br/><br/>This is what movie making is about, turning a simple story into something visually stunning with scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. 8/10"

","Just watched the much buzzed about ""Gravity"" I must say it's a sprawling space drama of an atmosphere tone. It's not typical science fiction with monsters and creatures still the scenes let a viewer explore the outer world by seeing the scenes of space puts an ever lasting picture in one's mind. The shots and style of camera angles from director Alfonso Cuaron is done in a beautiful way from seeing the two primary characters in orbit to seeing different parts of the space shuttle craft and compartments as they float all thru the picture. Now for a little story background George Clooney plays Matt a veteran astronaut who while up in space has Ryan Stone(Sandra Bullock)a medical engineer on hand who has taken her first voyage into space. And Ryan is a lady that still has a tragic past attached to her as she still remembers her daughter's death. As the film glides thru all of a sudden the space drama gets full when a Russian satellite explodes causing a reaction and showers of debris that comes at the two central characters. Then no ship the two are lost in orbit! Watching the film in 3-D will connect you as the viewer even more adrift thru space, overall ""Gravity"" is a decent space drama of character and survival."

","What really perplexes me is how many people liked this movie. That it is nominated for Best Movie of the year... well, I am stunned, and have lost respect for the people who nominate movies for these awards.<br/><br/>The entire movie is a puerile string of calamities and relies entirely on Sandra Bullock's superb acting skills. The story? There isn't one really. It is a glitzy 3D orgy with a great actress and lame script... nothing more. How do I know the script is so empty, well, watch the movie in 2D and you will get the message pretty quickly. There is no story, it's like a long, boring computer game where one mishap after another besets you, and you have to do your best to survive. <br/><br/>The moments when Sandra B realises she will probably die and she begins hallucinating, are smattered with trite philosophical drivel... absolutely not credible, and seemed to pander to low-brow masses. <br/><br/>I did not see any of the 3D effects, which were probably fantastic. A movie HAS to be a lot more than the quality of the effects it throws at you to cover the lack of depth, plot, anything at all that challenges or reveals something. There was none of that worth watching or hearing. Sadly, this was a disappointing waste of $100m with some fantastic acting on a mediocre script."

","Sandra Bullock is Ryan Stone, an acclaimed medical engineer currently working in space with George Clooney, as veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky. After a disaster strikes she finds herself alone, adrift and spiraling out-of-control.<br/><br/>Films starring Sandra Bullock are usually best avoided but being directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, and all the praise, we put on those ridiculous sunglasses so to not feel left out on some great new cinematic experience. While Sandra Bullock is as unexciting to watch as ever, George Clooney makes the perfect veteran astronaut. As for the state-of-the-art 3D special effects, it doesn't help the story. In fact, it hurts the film. Everything looks so smooth and perfect, it feels like a cartoon. It leaves those of us aware feeling safe and therefore we are unaffected despite what is going on within the story.<br/><br/>As always, and now more than ever, Cuar√≥n masterfully captures entire scenes in long, elaborate takes. However, at this excessive amount, it never lets us into the story. It's just endless clever shot compositions that only keep reminding us we are watching a film because the camera is too busy showing off. The greatest aspect of the film is it's sound design.<br/><br/>Gravity is a great story that's beautiful computer generated images work against it. There is no sense of reality, which leaves no tension and no dread. Just pretty pictures without the ability to suck us in."

I have never seen Bullock look so bad and out of place. Her inane wandering around the space station/ship is so boring I fell asleep. Which is something I never do during movies.

","Gravity will take your breath away. Literally.<br/><br/>This could've been just me, but I was extremely out of breath when I left the theatre. Perhaps, I was holding my breath many times in one of the most exciting and tension-built movie I've seen in a long time. I just thank God Stanley Kubrick wasn't around to direct/write this or we would've been in the theatre twice the merciful 90 minutes and I might have passed out.<br/><br/>Now, I'm no astronaut, never studied or worked at NASA or plan a trip out into space, so I cannot comment on if any of the events in Gravity could ever happen, especially since the many, MANY, obstacles that do happen, happen so simultaneously, all that occurred might as well overlapped each other. Now, that does lead me to believe that most of what happened wouldn't or couldn't happen, but then again, I'm no expert. What I can say, as a layman, dumbed down or written in for the excitement, it was one helluva ride.<br/><br/>In one enormously thin plot, a doctor had previously trained for 6-months at NASA and heads to space to repair a gadget, when the Russians decide then would be a good time to inadvertently, or on purpose, blow up a satellite causing debris to head toward them. Unlike Star Trek, et al, there aren't invisible shields and this causes all-but two astronauts to be stranded in space without the rest of their crew or a ship to get home in.<br/><br/>Luckily ‚Äì though, it may not seem that way when you watch it! ‚Äì there are other options in space to get you home and the rest of the movie is just that: The Voyage Home (to swing back to the Star Trek analogy.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is breathtaking ‚Äì as covered above, the score is decent, the mood nice, I loved the calmness and caring of Clooney's character and Sandra's acting was pretty good. But, the most you'll take from this was the non-stop, science fiction or not, action. Those with heart conditions should literally talk with their doctor before seeing this.<br/><br/>On the downside and on the surface, huh, the movie lacks or was just mediocre in every other category. The dialogue, while not bad, wasn't memorable, but for a couple of lines. The story, again, is really nothing but a tiny bit of background and then just a survival story. And some of the very placed debris, i.e. toys and obvious space references, were more REALLY? moments for me in such a serious picture.<br/><br/>That all said, overall the movie's genre is probably a 50/50 split between suspense and action, and the movie, once the Russian debris hit, never ceases to provide what the core of the movie is: a suspenseful action film.<br/><br/>For moviegoers who like over-the-top tension and fun ‚Äì and I had both, this is a total recommendation. Especially in LIEMAX. The 3D is just for those gimmicky and REALLY? objects to float towards you with minute exceptions to when something does add to the tension, but those were rare.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Yeah, of course, I was thinking of the film, Open Water, throughout this movie. While that ""against all odds, 2-survivors (one male, one female) stranded and adrift in water"" movie felt 10x more realistic, this ""against all odds, 2-survivors (one male, one female) stranded and adrift in space"" film will was certainly a lot more fun¬Öand heart pounding!"

Right from the start, I knew I was going to be challenged by the non-stop, hyperventilating of Sandra. I have a Belgian Malinois that came with a hereditary, hyperventilation defect. She, like Sandra in this movie, pants like she has just ran a marathon, all the time. The difference here being that the dog can't help it. Then there's the action part of the film. There were only two actions. For the whole movie. Get to the space station and get back to earth. So, for an hour and a half, we had to listen to Sandra hyperventilate.

The script is pretty bare, and it is predictable. Some may also question its realistic quality, but this film is of course not without flaws. The meaning of this film is the search for meaning in an a world where we are much more insignificant than we think. Instead of floating away, giving up and dying, she powers through making something of her life. This film is also about Ryan overcoming the loss of her daughter, and not being held back by it.

","Through a first fascinating sequence shot with an elaborate cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki that recreates life in outer space, we witness the crew of the space shuttle on a routine mission, thus Cuar√É¬≥n begins his story from a common event to direct it towards a science fiction story, where he slowly turns the viewer into one more character, seeing, feeling and participating in the fears and emotions of the crew while involving us in the theme and plot of his film. We are enjoying the effects of gravity ""0"" floating, dancing and admiring the spectacular views, when we suddenly have to face an emergency situation that is triggered in a fraction of seconds by an external factor. Then the duality of the meaning of Gravity becomes clear, on the one hand the force of attraction exerted by the planets and also the great risk or ""gravedad"" that exists in a mission of this type. An exciting thriller that transports us to the infinite emotional universe, experiencing despair, anguish, claustrophobia and suffocation, but always leaving a last resource to try without fainting.
Fight until the end.
In addition to the script, written by Alfonso himself and his son Jonas, the production of Gravity took more than 4 years, due to the complexity of shots and sequences in a 0 gravity environment, which forced the creativity and innovation of those responsible of the special effects.
For the selection of the star, 10 of the most recognized names were handled: Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman, Marion Cotillard, etc. but for agenda or various reasons, the responsibility falls on Sandra Bullock who, despite the deviousness of the production, achieves the best role of her career.
There is a director.
The film, in addition to being a worldwide box office success, won 7 Oscars, 233 awards and 182 nominations and, more importantly, positioned Mexican cinema, Alfonso Cuar√É¬≥n and Emmanuel Lubezki as great authors of our time.

Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney). But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness.<br/><br/>The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.<br/><br/>For all its stunning exteriors, it's really concerned with emotional interiors, and it goes about exploring them with simplicity and directness, letting the actors's faces and voices carry the burden of meaning. It's a film about what happens to the psyche as well as the body in the aftermath of catastrophe.<br/><br/>To be astonished, frightened, and entertained all at the same time ... that's the power of Alfonso Cuaron's masterful film.

It's basically six major scenes/set-pieces, all in rapid fire, with Bullock & Clooney playing quite interesting characters, even though we only get a short time to learn about them. It works well as a sci-fi/space film - one of the major selling points is the beautiful shots of Earth from above - but also as a tense survival thriller/drama. How much can go wrong in 90min? You'll find out!<br/><br/>I particularly liked how there's at least some scientific accuracy, such as when they're in space/an airlock, it's virtually silent (yes, ""in space no one can hear you scream"" - thanks 'Alien') and sound only filters back in as the air enters the vacuum. That and the fact that NASA would have a scientist working on the Hubble telescope, rather than a random engineer. 'Gravity' does virtually everything well - the isolation of space, the beauty of Earth, the terror of being trapped, the ""would I still go into space if I had the chance?"" and the emotional investment in the characters survival.

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","1","29 November 2017"," Visually great, technically irreproachable, but the script has serious problems.
","I watched this movie yesterday or the night before last and, frankly, I was a bit divided about it. I expected something more. The script is simple: in the near future, a severe blast causes a chain reaction destroying most orbiting satellites and launching a shower of space debris compromising the survival of a team of American astronauts who were repairing the Hubble Telescope. It's a plot that works but has serious credibility problems based on the great improbability of all our satellites being destroyed at the same time. It also totally ignores some science issues such as the abundance of space junk in Earth's orbit and has a plot hole that rubs the absurd: how the astronauts were able to listen to dogs in China if they were not even able to communicate with the own base in Houston? Sandra Bullock is the main character, in the role of a scientist who was selected for that mission by being an expert on the subject. The actress is good and her quality is unquestionable but I think her character wasn't well thought. Despite being a rookie in space and showing little training, her character is able to decently decouple herself in a ISS shuttle and in a Chinese one, something her training would probably never have prepared her for not being strictly necessary to her mission. There is a latent contradiction here, and it does not to be a physical or a genius to realize that and to detect others in the film. George Clooney is a good supporting actor but sometimes his posture, somewhat childish and relaxed, prevented me from actually feeling any tension, not to mention that the way he dies is absolutely clich√©. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron works reasonably, and I think I realized some scenes that intentionally copy great films of the past in order to to honor them. This is beautiful and symbolic. The end of the film also seems loaded with symbolism.<br/><br/>The technical issue, however, is beyond reproach. CGI is absolutely grand and the images of our planet are breathtaking. I liked cinematography and soundtrack, discrete but competent. The way they put the actors floating weightless also seems incredible and realistic, just like the ships, tools, space suits and even the floating debris. Visually, the film is powerful and realistic but it's not the first time I say this: it's not a CGI storm that makes a good movie. The script has to be good. And the fact is that the script of this film, although it works, has a lot of holes, errors, absurd moments and contradictions. No matter how improbable is the situation the movie shows, the audience has to feel that it's real and it's happening. And I could not feel it here."

","Meh. Okay, I went into this after hearing all the raves as to how realistic this movie was about being in space. Well, special effects are great but they do not make a good movie. Too many plot holes and scientific flaws to really forgive. <br/><br/>On the microscale, the zero gravity stuff is pretty accurate (except of course Bullocks perfect hair ) and the views of earth are stunning, but the basic physics and mechanics of re-entry and the improbable ending on a planet that is 75% water....and dozens more physics flaws (you can read about elsewhere if interested) that taken as a whole make the plot so ludicrous it insults your intelligence. <br/><br/>I mean, it starts from the get go when Stone refuses to stop what she is doing and get to safety---err, ohhtayy, sounds plausible for a well educated but novice astronaut. <br/><br/>And then the ending. And why does every action movie have to have a happy ending. <br/><br/>If you watch it and pretend that after Matt Kowalsky reappears, that Dr Stone is actually dying and hallucinating, then the plot thereafter is tolerable. Otherwise, I would put this in the same category as Avatar. See it once for the effects and check your brain at the door. Oh and Hollywood, please stop hiring actresses who have botoxed themselves so much that they resemble elves from LOTR. The odd somewhat inhuman facial contortions are truly disturbing when viewed on the big screen."

"johnnyboyz","5","0","3","29 July 2017"," Trite and overrated, although not totally lacking merit - Gravity is ultimately disappointing.
","I think ""Gravity"" must be the first ever instance of a screensaver being re-calibrated and re-packaged as a cinematic experience. It's all well and good demonstrating what the latest and greatest in special effects is capable of, but of what use is it without a scrap of substance to back it up? Rebellious though it may sound, films such as ""Gravity"" are neither enhancing nor prolonging cinema, in fact they are killing it and if there is a genuine zeitgeist amongst audiences that this is the future then cinema has very little future to look forward to.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" opens with a blank screen followed by a series of ultimately pointless statistics pertaining to the nature of the space vacuum. Its temperatures, we're told, ""¬Öfluctuate between minus 148 and positive 258"". ""Sound¬Ö"" it says ""¬Öis unable travel"" So what? To what is this any reference? Where is this relevant later on? We then begin with a startling composition of the lower hemisphere of Earth from outer space - our eyes are distracted by the land mass to the left of the frame as it slowly comes to form due to the Earth's rotating, failing to notice the object which sails into our eye-line from the hard right of the screen.<br/><br/>Lo-and-behold, it is the Hubble Telescope, and we meet our characters in the midst of spacewalking their way to upgrading said telescope. One of them is Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney - a Texan stereotype with a brash attitude; a love of old cars, country music and a backstory that saw his ex-wife leave him 20 years ago. His opposite number is Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone, a comparative rookie; a woman who doesn't really belong in space, whose past tragedy is her young daughter's recent death and who seems to be perpetually nervous when compared to Kowalski's bombing around confidently on a jetpack.<br/><br/>Disaster strikes when, out of nowhere, debris from an exploded satellite that has collided with a second satellite sends a glut of space junk the way of our leads. There is some clumsy propaganda about it being the fault of the Russian Federation, but this all acts as the catalyst for Cuar√≥n's feature to turn into a mad dash for the sanctuary of a working spaceship, and then home, as the methodical Kowalski and the unhinged rookie Stone grapple with both one another and the elements.<br/><br/>Understanding why ""Gravity"" has done so well and received a lot of praise is at once both baffling and painstakingly obvious. It is an incredibly simplistic film - people take to it because of its linear nature; easy causality and the not having to follow any kind of narrative. Much in the same way crowds took to James Cameron's ""Avatar"" for similar reasons, the special effects play their role in hooking people in. It is also the case a character you expect to be around by the end is removed from the piece very early on, which I think has stunned people into thinking they've seen something of greater substance because they've not previously seen it happen.<br/><br/>The film essentially consists of a string of action set pieces told from the constrained perspective of those involved as they dodge a series of life threatening near-misses. Some of these are born out of the chance event of the space debris flying their way; others rely on the more convoluted occurrence of an onboard fire. Limited air supply also acts as a rudimentary source of drama. These set pieces might well happen in any order and be of any length of time. There is a heavy reliance on imagery and visuals; a complete lack of story and an all but total lack of complexity.<br/><br/>The film's apparent core strength, that of a strong female lead in Bullock's character, raises further questions. She has short hair; a boy's name (Ryan - something the film bothers to bring to our attention when Kowalski mentions it) and gets to fulfill the role of an astronaut - a job otherwise synonymous with men. She is androgynous in this respect, but it is Alan Evans writing for 'The Guardian' who points out that she needs either chance or other men to rescue her from every situation - rarely does she use her own ingenuity and, indeed, spends most of the film a gibbering wreck. The over-not to mention needless-use of shots of her dressed in her underwear when not in a space-suit is equally perplexing.<br/><br/>I accept, on the one hand, the majesty of the special effects and their ability to bring planet Earth to life as this rotating orb of blue ocean; white cloud cover and green land mass, as we float around in the space vacuum. In terms of characterisation, Cuar√≥n seems to want to tell a story about somebody dealing with grief; discovering that life carries on and coming to want to grab it by the horns again, and this is admirable - but it gets lost. I note with deference as to how small and insignificant the film seems to want to tell us we really are in the grand scheme of things: Earth; Space; the Universe, etc.<br/><br/>And yet, the film is piecemeal and ultimately a little underwhelming - dare I say even dull? People have mistaken well-worn disaster movie genre tropes for top-level art because it had a shiny surface, or because they felt like they were able to reach out and touch it, or something. If enough people get it into their heads that this is the future of film-making or what constitutes a cinematic experience, then there will not be much of a future to look forward to."

","Is it just me? Did I miss something? After all the hype and Oscar wins I finally got around to seeing Gravity three years late and what a disappointment it was. It is beautiful to look at with super special effects but other than that it is a very poor film. The dialogue is poorly written and poorly delivered, Bullock's acting is wooden, the plot is preposterous and, worst of all, the science is non-existent. As far as the film-maker's are concerned Newton was never born; they certainly refuse to accept his 3rd Law of Motion. They almost never get the motion right for space and indeed one major plot point relies on the commander of the mission apparently having no knowledge of physics....when he's at the end of the tether and tells Bullock she has to let him go to survive, he is stationary - there will be no forces acting on him at all, so his tether wouldn't be under tension like he's hanging off a roof; if he just jerks gently on the tether with his arms it will impart enough force to put him in motion back towards Bullock and the space station - he certainly wouldn't start moving away from the tether just by letting go. As for Bullock being able to undock, fly, separate and re-enter both Russian and Chinese craft after 6 months astronaut training as an electronics equipment mission specialist, well.....words are beyond me - she wouldn't have been trained to fly the Shuttle let alone foreign craft. Space debris flying fast enough to orbit the earth in 90 minutes would be lethal down to a millimeter in size - the smallest speck would hole a spacesuit yet all the astronauts are in the middle of clouds of such debris that decimate the Hubble, the shuttle and a space station. The Chinese space station could never be in a stable orbit that would decay enough after 90 minutes or so to burning up on reentry. I can see it would be an exciting and tense film for children and the dim-witted but I'm afraid sentient adults will be gnashing their teeth throughout the film."

","This film is a technical extravaganza. The visual details of the space, the space stations and crafts and certain bits like the water droplet scene, the absolute calamity that happens when the wave of debris strikes each time etc are crafted with an eye to detail. The background music and the clever use of silence at key sequences throughout the movie is appreciable. Sandra Bullock does a fine job as the protagonist, especially in the earth-communication scene. Clooney gives a memorable cameo, and his voice stands out as usual. The story line is something that lets down this scientific treat. It drags quite a lot through the movie, with the emotional aspect of Bullock's character not quite reaching the audience. I also felt that dubbing sounded too artificial at certain points- an example being Ryan's gasps for air. Sound mixing is also not perfect. Efforts taken by the actors, especially Sandra Bullock, for the zero gravity scenes should be specially appreciated.<br/><br/>Overall, a film that is worth watching for the technical beauty it is."

Gravity may simply appear to be two people floating in space for ninety minutes to the casual observer, however it's just one. The highlight of the film Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney dies fifteen minutes in and you're left with the wailing Sandra Bullock, her character persists that every time she has been trained how to fly an escape pod in the simulator she has crashed it.

"AlpenglowMemories","5","0","2","25 January 2017"," Gravity is a technically well-done, but empty and forced experience
","The most impressive thing about Gravity is its visual effects. The spacescape looks nice, very convincingly brought to life. But the visual niceness is hampered by the officiousness of the rest of the production. From the outset, Cuaron's misguided sensibility harms the film. A writing scrawl informs us there is no sound in space, all while a soundtrack and sound effects blare over it. This inability to appreciate silence is frequent in the film. Cuaron will tire you as he constantly pans to images of the earth with the musical score offering up angelic 'aaaahs'. The most ridiculous comes when Sandra Bullock's character, Dr. Stone, tells Clooney she loves the silence of space- as the score swells. It's time like this that I wonder how much thought Cuaron really puts into his storytelling. <br/><br/>It's this hammy approach that has always made me indifferent at best to Cuaron as a film-maker. Gravity attempts to flirt with themes of spirituality and survival, but they lack weight, meaning. It's all just empty pontifications between the next screeching action scene. Gravity has been called an art film by some. Which is really absurd to me; it's an action film, and not a very memorable one at that. Cuaron uses the downtime between his chaotic sequences to try to 'build' characters. His astronauts are incompetent and unprofessional, making it extremely hard to feel much sympathy for them. He adds clich√© upon clich√©, eventually going with the 'dead daughter' route for Dr. Stone. Worse still, Gravity pushes suspension of belief to impossible levels. The script contrives to throw as many terrible things as can possibly be imagined at Dr. Stone, and then contrives just as many absurd things to get her out of those situations. By the half-hour mark I was exhausted, and spent the rest of the film in a state of comatose. <br/><br/>There are pieces of the film that are entertaining, some shots that are nice to look at. But Cuaron heavily cribs the language of other space-films, the most obvious of such being the now overdone 'foetal' symbolism. George Clooney plays Clooney. Bullock is one of the most egregious examples of a damsel-in-distress as I've ever seen: her role is to cry and wail and fail, until Clooney ‚Äì whether his character is real or coming in a vision ‚Äì tells her exactly what to do. Gravity has a bizarrely sexist narrative that seems to have gone unnoticed. <br/><br/>Gravity is uninterested, I think, in finding substance. Cuaron obsesses over long-takes and digitally creating impressive spectacle, but his characters and themes both remain underdeveloped, almost like an afterthought. It's hard to distinguish Gravity from any other run-of-the-mill disaster piece. For me, it's a dry run of a film, with an unfortunately forced sentimentality that put me right off."
"ElMaruecan82","7","0","1","21 December 2016"," Houston, I have a problem...
","Before ""Gravity"" occupies the black screen with the same ominous effect than TV series' title ""Lost"", you have this superposed text about the temperature and pressure in space making life impossible. When I saw this, my immediate reaction was ""duh? really?"", how about telling me something I don't know.<br/><br/>I don't mean to be sarcastic but it doesn't take a scientific degree to be aware that life in space is impossible, that space couldn't carry sound and air. So, I was questioning the inclusion of this disclaimer. Surely, Cuaron trusts enough the intensity of his material not to need to amplify the menace that will pend over the heroine, so why the thought-challenging director of ""Children of Men"" would state the obvious? <br/><br/>Because he treats a very basic premise in the most basic way, taking for granted that just because it is a story of survival, we will relate to it. It just works on a primal level and Sandra Bullock manages to elevate the material to the required emotional level. I was touched by her struggles to get to Earth, but the film didn't make me care for how good she was, it wasn't a 'stranded' performance in the same level than Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"", but it's not Bullock's to blame, but the wrong approach.<br/><br/>Indeed, we understand it's a race around the clock, so how about keeping this in subtext and try to enrich the film a little bit? We have woman stranded alone in the most hostile place and deprived of the most basic aspect of humanity, which is standing and walking, yet still using the one human strength still able to work: intelligence, that was the heart of the film and it worked for the most part. But let's not pretend that the triumph of ""intelligence"" is enough to make a whole film, especially after ""Apollo 13"". Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" dealt with a similar situation but the film spanned a longer amount of time.<br/><br/>You can't make a journey when the run-time is one hour and half, but I guess it was the longest such a thin premise could be sustained: one hour and half rightfully divided into three half-an- hours. First, she still benefits from the advice and company of wisecracking George Clooney, half-an hour of loneliness, and half-an hour of a climax, and some existential and emotional undertones. It works for the most part and again, the performance of Sandra Bullock strikes the right emotional chord, but there are many moments that can only feel as fillers and you know ""Gravity"" only shines through its first and third act, but is rather unsatisfying in the middle. <br/><br/>I feel a bit guilty to criticize the story when there's so much to praise on the special effects, but the effects are just vehicles for the story. In ""Gravity"", you feel like the opposite is happening. And when she gets home, she's triumphant and we're happy for her, but for some reason, I expected that to happen and I wasn't as emotionally overwhelmed as I expected. I didn't know what exactly was lacking in the film, to be honest, so I wondered whether it was one that could only benefit from a big screen viewing, and there's would be no comparison with a TV or DVD experience.<br/><br/>I don't think a film can be so spectacular to lose its entertaining value on smaller screen and actually, it's thanks to the very DVD of the film that I could pinpoint the problem, or let's just say, the wasted opportunity. When I saw the bonus features and the documentary about the Kessler syndrome, I was mesmerized and I enjoyed that half-an-hour more than the film itself. That was something I didn't know. I didn't know space has turned to a real junkyard ever since the conquest of the air by the irresponsibility of men, and the risk of collision between satellites is increasing and might provoke damage of exponentially spectacular effects, each collision creating debris increasing the likelihood of bigger collisions, hence making in the short term, all the satellite useless, and God knows how satellites have became indispensable in our technology-driven era. <br/><br/>Now, that would have made one hell of a disclaimer because this is exactly what takes off the action, and this is something that could scare us more than anything. We relate to Stone as humans, but we all directly relate to the satellite issue. Even more, why the hell did they choose as a cause like a Russian satellite destroyed, how about a collision between satellites to emphasize the tragic randomness of these disasters? ""Gravity"" should have raised this awareness not diminish its impact by choosing an accidental cause. Now, I don't know how the collision case could have been handled within Stone's misadventure but it could have worked nonetheless, since space is such a ""crowded"" place. <br/><br/>Cuaron had a lot of material to work on, but he picked the easy choice and seemed in a rush to conclude the film. Maybe the effects were too big to maintain them for two hours, but still, it didn't give him time to work on some little flaws such as Clooney's performance or the timing of the oxygen level. These moments felt so 'cinematic' in a film that tries to border on realism and the one moment that felt realistic was the communication with that Eskimo father, but then again, it took me the DVD features to understand what was going on. Would have showing the Eskimos ruined the premise of the film? I respect the choice of Cuaron but in the end, the story suffers a bit from a rushed directing.<br/><br/>And what stays in the film is the excellence of the special effects, so the flaws of the story are no 'gravity' case, but the film isn't a masterpiece for all that."

I also felt it was disappointingly short, and this mix of boredom, basic story and being too short was frustrating.<br/><br/>This movie is good don't get me wrong. The visuals are amazing and it is well worth a watch, but after seeing it once I've ended up selling the blu ray. Because for me watching this film once is enough.<br/><br/>Gravity is a work of art but not a masterpiece."

","George Clooney stars such a great guy in this extremely intense and almost depressing film. George reminds me of Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca since both actors leave the women they love in order for them to remain in safe by taking their own risk. In the real life, people tend to be eager to survive instead of trying to help others. The recently wedded George seems like a nice guy in both on screen and off-screen. I really like his attitude towards the media because he seems like he's honest and open towards his fans. However, he isn't a good actor since I always know that it's George! He always looks the same."

","Albeit far from being a landmark to me, I still highly praise Gravity for its stunning CGI effects (stands for computer generated imagery, in case a few or some of you did not know about that), sure-handed direction, masterful special effects, impressive sound mixing and sound editing, unforgettable music, magnificent cinematography, satisfying running time, plot and scientific accuracy, which is enough for me to forgive the movie's flaws. Gravity has a strong opening and strong ending which I also praise. The thing that I found funny about the audience is that on the adult side, most people loved or liked this film, while on the kid side, most or all of them didn't like this film at all. When I realized this, I was haunted to know how come. I wasn't much surprised by this fact though, as I already had a little or slight idea of why this fact was as it was, but still, I wasn't 100 % sure why and I wanted to know the answer for sure. When thinking of all the things I just said, I'm like ""There might be something that kids don't understand from this film, which adults understand, and yes, that's a possible and logical answer to why most adults love or like this film while most kids don't, but if this is it, then what exactly do kids don't get from this movie and why exactly they don't get it?"". That to me still remains a mystery and I am still curious to know the answer to it. How life is mysterious sometimes. My original rating for Gravity is 7.0/10, but because of what I said at the very beginning of my review, I will raise it to a 7.5 rating."

The end didn't seem to 'work' very well. Sports illustrated magazine mixed with Planet of the Apes. Very odd and anti-climatic.

Where did she get her Dr. from and in which subject? medicine? yeah right...which ""mission specialist"" says ""enemene"" when she tries to navigate a space capsule? which ""mission specialist"" has to read an instruction manual for a capsule that she possibly used on a daily basis? Even if not THIS capsule, most of these capsules are probably quite similar to handle. So I really doubt that something like that would give a real ""expert"" that much trouble. I think ""Gravity"" really failed in this regard. The other aspects of it are great...otherwise it's a great movie with a great story worth to see.

The viewers are drawn to feel the characters, it gives you the spirit and feeling of being on outer space yourself. You feel their feeling, because of its precise effects. You put yourself in their shoes, you hold your breath, you feel dying...I personally felt that. And this is something not every movie can achieve. Some movies feel like they really are just movies, made for screen, but Gravity made it feel like reality, like I was there myself. Some scientific aspect are questionable, but again, forgivable. That's the tremendous effect of drawing the viewers within the world Gravity has created, they forget science because the thought of surviving is just all that matters.

","The very beginning of the movie I found to be rather boring, first, with the fact that you can barely hear what they are saying, then it finally gets loud enough to hear. It's just boring until Ryan gets hit and tumbles out into space. <br/><br/>Then once she's been on her own and trying to get to the Chinese station with no luck, I got really sick of the failure, one after the other. But then when she is crashing to earth with the rest of the Chinese station, it's obvious that she barely misses the land, but much of the station does hit land. We see nothing of this, and nothing of her being rescued, or even where she is. As she's coming down, they show part of the land mass but it looks nothing like anywhere on earth. Same with most of the movie, except during one conversation in space, we can see the Red Sea and Sinai Peninsula.<br/><br/>I realize it's specifically meant to be 90 minutes long to be the same as how long it takes for space debris to orbit earth, but they didn't have to do that. They could have at least shown a helicopter coming to get her, and saying the location. That would have made a huge difference in satisfaction at the end of the movie. Unless it was a teaser for a sequel, but this seems like a stand alone movie to me."

","With just 2 characters, 3 if you count Ed Harris's voice in the darkness, ""Gravity"" asks a lot of both the actors and audience to sustain interest in a technically impressive but not dramatically impressive exercise. Basically, 2 astronauts, Clooney at his charming best and Bullock (kind of dowdy in this one), try to find a means of survival after a cascading series of space disasters. That's it as far as story - somewhat reminiscent of Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea"" in terms of minimalist plot. The obvious rigging, digital and blue screen motion capture impress in the same way they impressed in James Cameron's ""Avatar"". However, like the big blue aliens with human boobs, Bullock doesn't have a ton of witty dialog or plot twists to work with and much of her actions consist of twisting knobs, flipping switches and the like. Much of her emotions come down to desperation and exasperation. Much has been made of the technical holes but no talks about Bullock's character's admission that she is still deeply affected by the death of her daughter in a traffic accident. How did that make it past the psychological review before she was sent in space? In short, far more of a technical achievement than a great story."

Maybe I'm just to big a Bullock fan. I think seeing it in 3D would help the film but a bit of help with the lines would really improve this more. Clooneys lines as well.

"Staffenburgen","7","0","2","19 May 2014"," Simple, but Thrilling
","Looking at most of the other reviews on this site, I see most people either giving Gravity an abysmal 1/10 score, and then proceeding to tear apart the film's scientific inaccuracies, or a glowing 10/10 score, proclaiming that the film reinvents modern cinema. Simply put, I think that giving Gravity either of these scores is ridiculous. Rather than conform to these extremities, I will do my best to give the film an honest critique. <br/><br/>Gravity is definitely overrated by film critics. How a film that offers little to no story garnered such critical acclaim is completely beyond me. If you've seen the trailer, you know the whole story; space debris orbiting the Earth at high speed crashes into the Hubble telescope, creating even more debris and a catastrophic situation for our two main characters. Aside from a few fleeting dialogue scenes which provide us with some background information on Ryan Stone, there is nothing else resembling a story. This is my main criticism of the film; it doesn't have any emotional depth for the audience to sink into. As I stated above, many users have also pointed out the scientific inaccuracies of the movie's plot, but that seems pointless to me. Yes, this film was advertised as being (somewhat) realistic, but ultimately movies are made to provide us with an escape from reality. If you demand complete realism, I suggest watching a documentary instead.<br/><br/>Despite the shortcomings of the story, it is tough to deny how brilliant this film looks. From start to finish, the film looks beautiful. I had the pleasure of seeing this in spectacular 3D, and I have never seen it used better. I frequently found myself ducking as pieces of debris flew over my head, or craning my neck to try and see around the corners of the ISS. I particularly enjoyed how the Earth was almost ubiquitous in the background, acting as a symbol for both hope and despair; it is always so close, yet so far away.<br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned, I thought Sandra Bullock did a great job. For the most part, she is the only actor on screen. With almost no dialogue to work with, she effectively carries the film, which I'd say is pretty impressive. George Clooney gives a decent performance as well, but this is a role that we have seen him in countless times before, and it sometimes seemed like he was ""going through the motions"" whenever he was on screen. All in all though, the performances are strong throughout the film. <br/><br/>To summarize, Gravity is almost exactly like a roller coaster ride. It's definitely a thrilling, immersive, and enjoyable experience, but it won't leave a lasting impression. I honestly believe that the reason so many people disliked Gravity is because of their impossibly high expectations. The blame lies with film critics, and as I said before, I really do not understand the universal acclaim that was given to this movie. The lack of a meaningful story significantly detracted from the film, and that should have been reflected in these critic's reviews.<br/><br/>Gravity is a good movie. It isn't great, and it certainly isn't awful, but it will engage you completely if you watch it. Despite an overly simple story, it is definitely a thrilling experience. <br/><br/>RATING: 7/10"

","This film is preposterous. But you tend to overlook its absurd plot, scientific inaccuracies and impossible scenario and become totally entranced in the exceptional effects. They're probably better than those in 2001 and that may be due to the huge advances in computer graphics since that classic was made. After stating in the titles that there is no sound in space, the film proceeds to present a cacophony of bangs, clangs and clumps. How does an American trained astronaut know how to operate both Russian and Chinese vehicles with all the controls marked in those languages. Likewise the handy instruction manuals on both the Russian and the Chinese vehicles. How is it possible for a space capsule to descend to earth without being tracked and without rescuers standing by. Without guidance from the ground, how do you ensure that the space vehicle doesn't land in the middle of the ocean or, conversely, in the middle of Times Square. Great as the remarkable scenes may be, this film merely reinforces my long standing conviction that there never has been a really great sci-fi movie.Even 2001 was preachy and ponderous"

I was going to change my mind when I saw Clooney open the door and enter the capsule without the poor Sandra exploded for decompression, but I must say that I immediately changed my mind and that the situation has become immediately plausible. The actors is that they are my least favorite as acting, because the beauty of Bullock there's nothing to say, but in this context fared very well. Clooney has fallen perfectly into the character who usually plays arrogant and that he is so good.

","Space. It's a bit mental innit? This should be the strap-line for Alfonso Cuar√≥n's multi-award winning SFX- sci-fi extravaganza. Sandra Bullock plays Ryan Stone a medical engineer who's lucked out and landed a plum job as an astronaut inserting her non-specific machine into the Hubble Telescope. Gorgeous George meanwhile plays Matt Kowalski, the grizzled George Clooneyesque veteran astronaut who is looking after her and overseeing her work. However, all's not well in space - things go wrong. Very, very wrong. Indeed. A lot. There. That's the whole 12 minute plot set-up for you.<br/><br/>But what a twelve minutes. One continuous rolling jaw-dropping shot of space, Shuttle, Hubble and insignificant specks of humanity orbiting the Earth. Gravity sets its stall out early. Stunning visuals, combined with superb sound-design and a stripped down b-movie running time make it a thoroughly entertaining experience. Indeed, regarding the much touted visuals you'll spend much of the time saying, ""How the f**k did they do that?"" Unfortunately, if you think too hard about it you'll also spend much of the time saying, ""why the f**k did they do that?"" Let's just say the plot is thin to thread-bare. Yes, there are underlying themes of isolation/ loneliness/ rebirth/ survival/ redemption. Yes, there are some nods to other sci-fi epics such as 2001 but ultimately you'll be too busy going, ""Wooaaah! to actually care. But, that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>You see, here's the point. Cuar√≥n may try and dress this 90 minutes SFX orgasm up as a metaphysical journey of self-discovery but don't be fooled. If you take Gravity for what it is - an elongated Twilight Zone episode on a cutting-edge technology budget - it's an absolute blast. Be wowed as our heroes repeatedly bounce off satellite debris. Swoon at Gorgeous George's Buzz Light-year impersonation. Marvel as Bullock puffs, gasp, wheezes and ""No, no, no, noes"" her way from cosmic catastrophe after cosmic calamity. It's all good. Expect more and you'll be disappointed. Top pop-corn actioner of the year."

"joshbaileynch","7","0","1","13 March 2014"," Technically a masterpiece but ultimately a trite story
","'Gravity; scores 7 out of 10 purely because cinematically it is such an extraordinary experience. Cuaron and the SFX houses that created the film fully deserve the enormous praise that has been heaped upon them and the slew of awards the film has received are generally well-deserved. It is also worth pointing out that as a 3D experience this film must rank as one of the most successful - I cannot think of an example of a film that has gained more from the use of 3D effects. All this being said, the narrative itself is ultimately a great disappointment. The central plot line about characters trying to survive in apparently impossible circumstances is fine in itself and the action is all very gripping and at times pretty terrifying. The real problems begin to emerge in the last third of the film. Once again we are landed with a wave of Hollywood clich√©s in terms of character motivation and narrative resolution. Bullock's character is ultimately defined through her role as a grieving mother and as such becomes yet one more example of mainstream cinema's inability to understand women outside traditional domestic and maternal roles. The 'lost child' subplot also leads to the film veering into an only too familiar mawkishness in its final stages - when we should be dealing with interesting themes and action instead we begin to wallow in sentimental clich√©s that never develop into anything meaningful. This is especially frustrating given that up to this point the film feels like it is beginning to develop a really interesting discussion about death and how we choose to confront our own mortality and insignificance. Sadly the film ultimately does not have the courage of its convictions and we end with a cop-out happy ending in which our bereaved astronaut makes it back to earth, emerging from her womblike spacecraft a woman reborn, shot in low angle and backlit by the sun like some reimagined scene from 'Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman'. In a moment everything that seemed interesting about the film is lost in ludicrously over-played and clich√©d imagery and the audience is left with a bad taste in its mouth. Frankly it would have been far better if the film had killed off the character and really confronted death as an inevitable and universal human experience. All this set aside, this is still a film I would strongly recommend - the first two thirds are breathtaking in visual terms - just don't expect much gravity (sorry)."

","Astronauts are left stranded in space when debris hits their shuttle, with a limited air supply they are left fighting for survival.<br/><br/>Director Alfonso Cuaron offers an interesting, intense tour-de-force that will leave most viewers with sweaty palms and a lump in their throat. Sandra Bullock is above her usual form as Stone, while Matt Kowalski's cock sure character played by George Clooney's is as exceptional as the first rate special effects on display. Considering the small cast the pace is fast with never a dull moment as it moves from one spacewalk to the next.<br/><br/>The film feels very much based in reality, the first person perspective shots are used sparingly and effectively, they add to the claustrophobic feeling in contrast to sweeping views and emptiness of space which adds to the tension.

The graphics appeared realistic to a certain extent, kind of like what you see on public TV space programs. There are excellent moments in the film where the characters show real human emotions, and a bit of a surprise at one point. I think the ending was excellent, but lacking a bit. (No spoilers here). It gives you great pauses to the intensity of the space explorers and scientists, and shows a side that is not always seen. I was not happy with the sound track as I had to turn the volume way up to get a clear soundtrack. Sandra Bullock shows a new side to her acting dimension.

Themes of sacrifice, loss, loneliness and belonging with even a couple hints at religion are certainly there, but if this same story happened in any other environment, you would see how average and dull it is. If you manage to suspend your hatred for shoehorned emotional elements and dialogue, they might spice up the experience and give enough emotional weight to what this movie really is - a simple survival film. A ride.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is decent. Some people bring up the word ""Oscar"" concerning her performance, but that's nonsense. She's just okay. It's hard to portray loneliness in space with little or no communication. I would've wanted the movie to totally nail this element. It didn't. Sometimes the script takes the easy route and makes our heroine talk to herself, spouting somewhat mediocre lines. Bullock is certainly decent, but doesn't deliver like Sam Rockwell did in ""Moon"". That's my gripe, and although not a small one, it's my only gripe. Luckily, Bullock didn't have to carry the movie alone. I'm not even talking about George Clooney (who is decent as well), but the environment. The view.<br/><br/>Earth. I didn't even watch this in 3D at a theater (regular 2D blu-ray), but the view was stunning. It was immensely beautiful in a way that you can't help but to respect and admire. I almost felt like I was there myself. It didn't matter if it was an impressive camera drive in the middle of a hectic scene or just a calm, more still shot - our majestic planet and the surrounding vastness of space took my breath away. ""Gravity"" uses this setting so well that it becomes its own character. I'm running out of compliments about the visual goods.<br/><br/>The sound department. One thing I liked about ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was how it managed to deliver powerful scenes without adding ridiculous sound effects to scenes that happen in space. There are no pew-pews, booms or bangs here either. The things we hear the most are silence, a character talking through a radio and music. There is quite a lot of music in this film. I feared it might take away from the atmosphere, but I found myself enjoying the powerful score.<br/><br/>Special effects, as everyone probably already knows, are top-notch. From technical standpoint, everything is pure quality. This might be the best-looking movie I own, and it might be that for a long time to come.<br/><br/>One more thing that I liked: ""Gravity"" ends exactly like it starts. No unnecessary setting up nor aftermath, nothing to distract from the ride itself. The movie starts when the ride starts, and it ends when the ride ends. Just the essentials, nothing more. We don't get that enough nowadays.<br/><br/>If you get bored very easily or if you have to have engaging or clever story lines, this movie might not be for you. Granted, I wanted a little more story, more natural characters and possibly some sci-fi elements myself too, but I have to judge this movie as it is - a simple but visually exhilarating survival flick. If you feel like watching an impressive ride in a majestic environment, then I can whole-heartedly recommend ""Gravity"" for you.<br/><br/>Not a masterpiece, but for a film with such a simple core, It's more than enough."

Cuar√≥n's direction (he also co-wrote, co-produced and co-edited the film) is near faultless; everything in the movie is pared down to the essential - two characters, four locations (if you count space) and a plot which takes place almost in real time. This makes for an incredibly intense experience which never lets go - there is no time to relax until the movie is over. A huge part of the film is the visual effects element, supervised by Tim Webber, which is brilliant in that it is so utterly convincing you soon don't notice it. It's just Sandra Bullock in outer space, and you forget that after about five minutes through the combination of the effects work, the sublime mixing of different elements together (CGI, wire work, props, sound) and her fabulous low-key performance. Some space movies simply don't convince - for example, Clint Eastwood's Space Cowboys is a good film and an interesting story but doesn't work for me technically - whilst this approaches the absolute pinnacle of the genre, Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Mexican cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's photography is particularly strong, focusing one minute on a tiny floating teardrop, the next on some vast interplanetary distance, but always showing us what we need to see, moving seamlessly, documenting an environment most of us can only ever know from cinema with incisive accuracy and depth. This, combined with the smooth unhurried editing, creates a truly atmospheric experience of the wonders (and terrors) of life outside Earth's atmosphere. Given all this brilliant creativity, does the movie have any liabilities ? I guess there is one, which just tarnishes it slightly for me, in relation to comparable films like 2010 or Moon. The character drama is very small; we want Dr Stone to live, and we want her to want to live despite the tragedy in her past, but with nobody to react against and no time for anything other than survival, where is the emotional gravitas of the title ? Bullock is wonderful nonetheless, not least for taking what must have been a painful and thankless acting job and turning it into a truly modern icon of sci-fi cinema. My nerdy adolescent fanboy heart will always belong to Warrant Officer Ripley in Alien, but Dr Stone will grow on me. Amazingly, this was a recent seven-time Oscar winner (Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing) - wow, what happened there ? A science-fiction movie gaining artistic recognition ? What's next - a remake of Dark Star for Best Picture ? My cynicism aside however, this a tour-de-force for gifted Mexican director Cuar√≥n and an absolute must-see for all fans of genre cinema. Trivia - did you recognise the voice of the inimitable Ed Harris (from Apollo 13) as the mission controller ?"

If you are more like me, more for movies where there are many things happening, more than Sandra Bullok's worried face and ""oh no, we are lost"" for 90 minutes, then you may find this movie very well acted and quite boring."

"eric_leidner","6","0","3","5 March 2014"," Entertaining but could've been a lot better
","I wasn't expecting all too much from this Picture to begin with. Therefore i was surprised how entertaining this movie actually is. The Visuals are Stunning and they deserve all Credit they've gotten. The Story is Original, at least i cant remember of a Movie with a Story similar to this. Two Astronauts, alone in the Space without backup or help from mission Control, trying to get back home. The Movie is trying to be extreme Realistic and sometimes it seems to be realistic, but we get way too many ""What-the-fuck-just-happend"" Moments. It didn't need to be this way, many of these unrealistic Scenes could be fixed with one or two additional Scenes, but no they let it that way. The most unrealistic scene is at the end of the movie. I disliked the Ending itself.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS BEHIND THIS LINE<br/><br/>There were a Lot of unnecessary Scenes in this movie. For example: in one scene Dr. Stone gets to the ISS, to contact Mission Control and to use one of the Sojus Capsules to get to a Chinese Space Station. But she then finds herself in a immense Fire later. She rushes to the Sojus and gets away. Since the ISS is destroyed by the Space-Garbage shortly after this incident, this was just a pointless action scene. She needed to get to the Sojus anyway. Which brings me to the Ending. She barely makes it to the Chinese Space Station. Only to find out that it is about to enter the Earths Atmosphere and slowly Starts to burn. So instead of undock an re-enter in a save way, she just stays while everything around is getting destroyed. OK I'm not an Engineer or a Physicist, but i still doubt that she would survive a re-entry like it's shown in the movie. In the End Dr. Stone makes it back to the Earth, she stands at some nameless Beach somewhere and we fade to black. The End. Did she got rescued ? Never shown! Did she accidentally land on a lonely Island in the middle of the Ocean? Never explained!<br/><br/>OK, maybe i seem to be a little unfair to this movie, but i seriously liked it, with all of it's weird moments. It was Entertaining, it looked stunning and it's finally a new original Sci-Fi Story. I really liked it."

Bullock does a very good job with a somewhat limiting script/dialogue, but creates tension & terror when needed.<br/><br/>Clooney is Clooney. A charmer, surface deep, wise-cracking character.<br/><br/>There are images that make you think of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, 2001 Space Oddessy and the very end scene which really was bad.<br/><br/>***Spoiler alert*** Bullock emerges from a pond and crawls to the beach - really? Hit the audience on the head with that allusion of rebirth and a second chance.<br/><br/>There are ""liberties"" taken with the physics involved, to a purist that would be bothersome, but for the average viewer such as me, I can deal with that.

"macblackslair","7","0","2","5 March 2014"," Great looks, story a mess.
","""Gravity"" is something for the eye, and for the ear as well. This movie looks spectacular. Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) can view our beloved planet from above, and what kind of view is that! I enjoy the view as well, sitting in front of the screen. It is amazing. The sound, sometimes completely gone, adds well to the look of ""Gravity"". <br/><br/>BUT movies are not only about visuals. While I love the look and atmosphere of this movie, I just cannot accept the story. Stone does things I cannot explain. She has been trained for this mission, alright, but HOW can she do what she does? <br/><br/>I am not going into detail. Watch it yourselves and decide whether you believe the story or not. I know that it is fiction only, but compared to Apollo 13 it surely does lack logic. <br/><br/>Besides, although all these fine visuals and sounds unfold spectacularly, I cannot feel any compassion for anything that happens on screen. Sandra Bullock does a fine job, actually, but she never touches me. I am not moved by her performance but by the soundtrack that accompanies the more emotional scenes.<br/><br/>After all, ""Gravity"" is not in the least a bad movie. It is worth being watched. But if you are looking for bright scripting and impressive performances, this may not be the best choice."

","It took me a very long time too watch Gravity. I didn't see it in the cinema but watched it on a 42"" television. Let's just say it lost everything, in the cinema it could have been a great movie, it would have actually made you feel like you were there.<br/><br/>I only gave it 8 because it felt like they only just managed to reach 85 minutes. They were struggling to add things, maybe they could have added like the shuttle takeoff, or a scene at mission control, or even the Russians blowing up there own satellite. Sandra Bullock however gave a great performance, and so did George Clooney. Very very good special effects, most of this film is CGI. I think Alfonso Cuaron did a great job directing and writing with his brother Jonas Cuaron. <br/><br/>Overall Gravity I think is overrated, but was OK. Not one of my favorite films and found it hard to watch, but defiantly not the worst film I've seen, good job Alfonso."
"doug_park2001","6","0","3","3 March 2014"," ""You should see the Sun on the Ganges!""
","GRAVITY is fine if you just take it for what it is: A sci-fi thriller that is watchably compelling, with a number of twists and turnabouts, but without a lot of plot depth, character development, or any of that sort of thing. It has a few stretches and improbabilities, but it's awfully hard to make a film of this sort without some of those. Comparisons have been made with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, but GRAVITY does not begin to hold the slightest nubbin of a candle to a classic of that stature. All the same, good performances by Bullock (Dr. Ryan Stone) and Clooney (""veteran astronaut"" Matt Kowalski), who are the only living characters we actually see here. Though the Earth below looks rather artificial, some nice use of gadgetry and special effects.<br/><br/>I put off watching GRAVITY because it looked fairly predictable. It does, however, go in some unexpected directions. Yet, the story starts a bit too late: More on the nature of the shuttle mission and the relationships between Stone, Kowalski, and the rest of the crew before the disasters strike would have added something even if it would also have complicated things. Purely a matter of taste, but I think the middle portions would have benefited from more on the angst and strange thoughts that arise while trapped alone in space and less of the constant thriller-diller stuff we have here."

It just isn't that kind of movie. I think the effects covered over the cracks of a very mediocre film.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the good things about Gravity. It is well acted. This film really did depend on two main roles. Clooney and Bullock portrayed their characters very effectively. In my opinion, one of the most likable characters Clooney has ever portrayed! <br/><br/>The special effects are outstanding! I went to see this in cinema and yes, sometimes you would forget you are on planet earth! The lighting, sound, cinematography and the design was sharp! I liked the tone Alfonso Cuar√≥n sets but I do think the story dropped off in a few places. I can see why some found it a bit dull and boring. <br/><br/>It is a good sci-fi flick however the script was a real let down because it could have been so much better!

"p-jonsson","6","0","2","2 March 2014"," Visually nice movie with mediocre story
","There is no doubt that this is a very pleasing movie from a purely visual point of view. This is probably a movie that would benefit from being watched in a good theater with its grandiose scenery.<br/><br/>However, I have to say that I found the rest of the movie somewhat mediocre. The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish first being real slow in obeying the order to evacuate and then floating around huffing and puffing, talking a lot when she should really conserve oxygen. Did they not give her the basic course before letting her up in space? I also found it soooo Hollywood that she was able to get onto the Chinese space station and seconds later it starts to descend into the atmosphere. In general I felt that the script writer was not really very technically knowledgeable.<br/><br/>Overlooking these, unfortunately all too often occurring issues, the movie is fairly okay as a whole. Obviously I cannot agree with the glowing all-star ratings that some people have been giving it but it is far from the single star trashing that other people have been giving it. Technically it was very good with nice special effects. Bullock performed as well as can be expected with the script she was given. Clooney felt a bit out-of-place as a skilled astronaut to me but then he was not really in the movie that much.<br/><br/>To me it was a fairly enjoyable popcorn movie."

","Gravity<br/><br/>I just watched this on my computer. It was, in fact, my first ever downloaded movie from the Internet. I guess this is now the wave of the future, what with Blockbuster being out of business, though I will still miss going to the video store and browsing through thousands of movie selections, often not having a clue in advance as to what movie I was going to rent. <br/><br/>Anyway, on to the movie. Visually, it's great, and probably its best feature by far. The effects are so good you don't even notice they're effects, it looks like they actually shot this movie in real outer space. <br/><br/>As for the rest? The best I can say is the story is competent. For those who don't know, it's about two people stranded in space after debris from several exploded satellites has taken out their space shuttle (didn't the filmmakers know the Shuttle is now retired?). They are literally marooned with just their space suits for protection. The question then is: can they get to a nearby space station (in this case, Chinese) in order to find a capsule that can take them safely back to Earth? <br/><br/>The plot makes some technical errors, but you can mostly ignore those and just enjoy the drama and the great visuals. There's no need to spoil the plot, since there isn't much of one. Either they get back to Earth or they don't. Sandra Bullock does, I think, a pretty decent job, although she really doesn't come across as a real astronaut but more like a Damsel in Distress set in space. Although she's competent enough when she has to be, she's much too emotional most of the time to look like someone who's gone through the rigorous training and psychological screening given to real astronauts. And Clooney isn't really acting at all, he's just playing himself (wise cracking, obviously thinks he's God's gift to all women, etc.) only he's doing it in a space suit.<br/><br/>This has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Will it win? Should it win? On the first, I doubt it, since space/Sci-Fi movies almost never win Best Picture. Stanley Kubrick's 2001 didn't (and it's much better than this film) nor did any of the Star Wars flicks. Should it win? Probably not. The amazingly lifelike visuals (again, they really look like they're in space, but then, so did most of 2001 and that was filmed in 1968) simply can't make up for a pedestrian plot. <br/><br/>7/10 mainly for the amazing visual effects."

However, there's a lot to be said with a simple, straight forward situation. Things also went forward at a perfect pace. This director knows how to utilize time to the greatest effect, never allowing meaningless space or motion.<br/><br/>The special effects were the alpha and the omega, for me, definitely the star of the film. Fantastic and superior, to the point that you felt you needed to ""duck"" as lethal objects split and hurled toward you. The deadly situation of trying to save yourself and move, without GRAVITY, was terrifyingly real."

","I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this movie, I hadn't heard a thing about it. But I thought generally Bullock produces solid acting, think ""The Blind Side,"" where she single handedly carried the show. Here with George Clooney as support it's a can't miss situation. The story line is very basic, trapped in space, and ""I wanna go home,"" not exactly rocket science story line, still it works. Clooney is the veteran style cowboy astronaut and Bullock is the tentative scientist apparently lured out to space to do a specialist job, when the mission goes wrong and they need to return to earth. The good stuff: excellent score, decent script, solid special effects and top notch acting. The script is basically all time deadline based which creates many suspenseful scenes with even a little comic relief thrown in. It's not - 2001 - but it's worth watching.

","After all the hype surrounding this film, I finally found it in my local video store. From the get go, I had this one thing irritating me repeatedly: the way Clooney's character reacted to everything that was happening. I mean, they were making a big effort in order to keep alive, and he acted calmly and jerky, like it wasn't a serious matter. If fighting for your life isn't a serious matter, I don't know what is. However, I forgive Kowalski's jerk behavior, considering it's just a blockbuster made for mainstream. Other than that, ""Gravity"" proves to be professional in almost all the way through; there are great special effects and many tense moments. The difficulties both characters had to face were due to the very application of Murphy's Law: anything that could go wrong, went REALLY wrong. The spaceship and its accessories were breaking for all the time, and I asked myself if director/writer wasn't trying too hard to build some trouble, in order to compensate the lack of material. I ended up not knowing if it was a good or bad thing, but either way, the movie still managed to be tense, agonizing and thrilling, delivering a happy ending that we all wanted to see. Maybe I don't agree with many people that labeled it as 2013's best movie, but I surely recognize its production values, reason why I give it a rating of 7."

It's a shame, because this movie could be so much better if the makers had took some time to improve the above points.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie only to the people that want to enjoy the good visuals. For an intelligent science-fiction you should be searching elsewhere."

","Wow, was I disappointed. I had heard all the hype about how awesome this movie was, so maybe I was expecting ... an awesome movie. What I got was a totally unbelievable tale of space gymnastics and dislocations. The coolest thing about the movie was trying to figure out how they got all that stuff to float around. That was fun, the story, eh, not so much.<br/><br/>I mean, give me a break. The surface area of the ISS orbit is about 225 million sq miles. Does Hollywood really expect me to believe that the Space Shuttle, the ISS and the Chinese station are floating around in that 225 million sq miles close enough that Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski can zip around between them with a tiny little space suit jet pack, a busted up Russian space vehicle and a fire extinguisher. If these things are within a thousand miles of each other, panic sets in on earth. Now throw in the difference in altitude, orbital speed, orbital inclination, orbital direction, etc. and, well, sit back and enjoy the graphics and Bullocks talent because the story just became bizarre. And she really, really knows how to hold her breath while disrobing. Wow.<br/><br/>One huge disappointment. :((("

","Gravity<br/><br/>Such a Marmite film, you either love it or hate it, but either way its hard to not appreciate the beauty of the film from a directional perspective. Alfonso Cuaron has made a masterpiece of a film in the way that is a first of its kind. Id go as far as to say the best 3d film yet and the start of a different age for films. Its epic and beautiful and you really do feel like your their with the characters in space. What the film lacks is depth to the story line, having just two characters makes the film slightly boring in my view and I do not think bullock can carry a film on her own. At times boring and at times magnificent. I really don't want it to win the Oscar for best picture but I feel it deserves the award for Director as Alfonso Cuaron.<br/><br/>Its a good watch and probably better seen on the big screen so you can witness the 3D brilliance.<br/><br/>http://raroe.wordpress.com/"

","$100,000,000 budget and yet not enough money for a decent script. Outside of the action scenes and the amazing (yes, I give credit where credit is due) special effects, the movie was quite boring and predictable. The acting wasn't bad, but didn't blow me away. The details seemed authentic...i.e. inside and outside the ships, the suits, the zero gravity effects of space (though, admittedly I'm no expert). But overall, it was like watching a guitar virtuoso who can't play a song, but can play notes really really fast. All technique and no soul. I can understand how this movie was nominated for awards (SFX, art direction, sound) but I don't see how it could be nominated for best picture. Were the movies that came out last year really that bad? On a list of space movies, this one would be at the bottom for me."

","It seems that the reviewers of this movie either hate it or love it. In my case I neither hated or loved it, merely liked it.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is one of my favourite actresses but this in my opinion is not the best movie she has ever made.<br/><br/>SPOILER BEGINS <br/><br/>The movie takes place entirely in orbit around the Earth and begins outside the space shuttle which has been sent to repair the Hubble telescope.<br/><br/>After a missile strikes a satellite belonging to the Russians the debris makes a beeline for the shuttle, taking out other satellites en route.<br/><br/>It is never explained how this satellite was somehow hit by a missile.<br/><br/>Mission control orders the shuttle crew to abort their mission immediately and return to Earth. Unfortunately the crew does not have time to do this before the debris strikes and all but destroys the shuttle.<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDS <br/><br/>There are basically only two in the cast of this movie. Sandra Bullock, who plays Ryan Stone, an electronics expert whose task is to repair Hubble and George Clooney who plays Matt Kowalski and is the Shuttle Commander.<br/><br/>SPOILER BEGINS <br/><br/>There are other crew members but although you see the figures floating around in space you never really see their faces or who they are. When the satellite debris hits the Shuttle these other crew members are killed.<br/><br/>George Clooney (Kowalski) does not survive either as his tether breaks and he ends up floating away from the shuttle and his body presumably spends eternity travelling in the vast expanse of the universe. He does return to the shuttle for a couple of minutes either as a ghost or in Stone's mind.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is taken up with Stone somehow managing to get firstly to the Russian Space Station and when that too gets destroyed she manages to get to the Chinese station.<br/><br/>Although there are a few 'edge of the seat' moments the movie I am afraid was a little too far fetched as I consider it virtually impossible for Stone to be able to get from one Space Station and then to another, especially being able to get to the second station by using only a fire extinguisher as a propellant<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDS <br/><br/>I watched this movie twice over a couple of days and I admit that the second time around I did enjoy it more, possibly because at the second viewing I watched it in 3D.<br/><br/>Ed Harris played the Mission Controller but he was never seen on screen, only his voice could be heard.<br/><br/>A great redeeming feature of this movie was the camera work, editing, the special effects and CGIs although I do not anticipate the script, acting or costumes will win any awards I do feel that the excellent camera work, special effects experts and editors are deserving.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's acting was up to her usual excellent standards and I feel that it was a very difficult and tiring movie to make for her. George Clooney's acting was also excellent even though he only appeared for a short time.<br/><br/>I have rated this movie seven mainly for the acting of Bullock and for the special effects. It is much better in 3D and I would be happy to recommend this movie, provided it is viewed 'tongue in cheek'."

","With the recent Oscar nomination march on, I watched ""Gravity"" with a high expectation. And after watching it thought, it would have been better had I watched it in 3D. What happens when you are adrift in the outer space without gravity is what the film's plot is about. And with the space suits on, Sandra Bullock as a medical engineer and George Clooney as a veteran astronaut take us to the journey outside the space which highlights the technical brilliance in movie making. You get stunned, and Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as usual enlivens the film through their screen presence. But beyond that the film appears a bit empty lacking the emotional depth or depth in characters. In the aspect, I liked 'Apollo 13"" which documented an important event form the space history. In ""Gravity"" the story somehow resembles the adrift journey of ""Wall-E."" You would surely be mesmerized by its sheer expertise in the visuals but in terms of story and characters, the film ends inadequate; and to me ""The Life of Pi"" was better. Overall, the film ends pretty well technically but I highly doubt about its probability for getting through Oscars in the popular awards.<br/><br/>Rating: 2 stars out of 4"

"tuomo_karvonen","6","0","1","25 January 2014"," Gravity does not pull emotions
","About Gravity I heard it had ""great visuals"" and it does look good. I don't go into that in more detail because many movies can look good but seems like that is all for so many of the expensive movies these days. Money is spent on flying stuff on the screen.<br/><br/>I also heard that Gravity would be ""slower paced"" movie. And to that I say bullsh*t. I have heard comparisons to 2001 Space Odyssey but this movie does not come close. Problems with the Gravity are characters all three that we see (and even the ones that only hear!) and the action. I do not get why in earth does so many movies have to be full of destruction and explosions happening all the time. Every action scene (if you can call them that) is happening right on the clock. When character gets to safety instantly everything goes BOOM second after. It is not exciting at all.<br/><br/>And next is my nitpicking marathon: From the start I was annoyed by the ridiculous dialogue and stuff that the astronauts were doing. Clooney was wasting his jetpack all over like he was freaking BORED IN THE SPACE! Okay no matter what but that experience would be so amazing I bet you could not be bored even if you worked there for years. It is totally different world to be out there I don't think that character was born in space did he? Or did hes family move in the space while he was a kid and he was always wanting to be somewhere else on an adventure! WTH! Seriously. I don't buy it.<br/><br/>And then there is some pointless Indian accented character which acts like a total retard: ""-Hey watch this! Yeiii"", screaming while bouncing around in his safety harness. I was thinking: ""that thing will snap but anyway it is so retard thing that he is doing it does not matter since he is going to die and I would not care less for that guy"". And would you guess he was hit by debris through his face! Oh but I should feel sad since he had a family on earth :'( at least he was the only one enjoying it! In that world only the idiots really enjoy being in space¬Ö<br/><br/>Then is this chick who is doing something but it doesn't work and she needs to fix some other things to make it work. Then she must open this hatch which is bolted on with regular bolts so when she screws the bolts loose they will fly all over the place. Okay, it is an exterior of a space telescope. Well who idiot designed that thing! Even me an average Joe can think that it is pretty inconvenient to have those bolts flying around in space! There is million ways to prevent that and this movie tells they have not come up with a solution for it.<br/><br/>That perhaps seems like a minor thing. But no. That short moment is an important detail about the space this movie is creating and it is in the beginning of the movie so everyone's focus at that point is still fixed on the screen. That kind of small details really make it or fail it. And Bullock even says she is sorry and is used that the bolts will fall into the garage floor, like ""Whoops! I forgot I was in SPACE and not my GARAGE! Well that happens!"" Yeah, I can totally understand floating in zero gravity is very unnoticeable and you can forget it anytime. Being in space is so booooriiiing!<br/><br/>So I like Sandra Bullock's looks in this movie and it was pleasure to watch. But the great visuals are ruined by the fast movement and moving camera. The movie can be about moving from place to another but the camera can still be still sometimes! The special effects are once again wasted on such haste. Everything is moving and exploding and destruction and death and screams and breathing and AAAR=?#)(!""#21?!""#/(!""&#?)!/)?%RGH! But it is not moving. Emotionally.<br/><br/>The movie lacks tension because it does not build it up and everything is just happening too fast. After all I still enjoyed watching the movie but I am disappointed that the true potential was wasted."

So, good points: visually stunning, believable for the most part and nice use of sound/sans sound. Bad points: No real story, just a collection of repeated scenes, feotus floating? Life emerging from the sea? George Clooney being George Clooney.

"jackasstrange","7","0","1","10 January 2014"," The 'cast away' in the space
","Well I just came here to tell that Gravity is not that great as an 'overall film' at all. I mean, it is flawless, but it is way too simple and unoriginal. It's basically another film of people trapped in somewhere. In fact, it looks perfectly like 'Apollo 13'(Ron Howard,1996). It's another 'mission impossible' kind of film, and that's really reaching the limit of the overusing. It has an existential conflict(I guess?) going on during a part of the film, a small part in fact, but it's perhaps serving to excuse for apologists to defend the lack of any depth or whats ever in the film, with arguments like 'well there is some philosophy on here'. <br/><br/>Personally,I think there's no problem in being unoriginal at all, even because it's really hard to be 100%original nowadays, but, there is a problem in being 'a lot' unoriginal. It's the 'boring' factor. I mean, a great screenwriter once said ""If you are doing a predictable film, a film that will make audiences thinking in all the end possibilities, you already failed"" well, I think it's a extreme line, but in part, it's completely true. It was obvious that she was going to 'survive' in the end or die in a tragic way, so no surprise at all anyways. Perhaps, there are always distractions in the film trying to make you think that the film is going to another way when in the reality, it's not. Most visually distractions, and admittedly it did catch me a few times, mesmerized by some stunning scenes an by the allegory presented. But it didn't worked always, pretty much the opposite. All the dramatic situations came way too forced. Survive after all the chaos looked even inevitably after all, in fact. In this aspect it look alike 'Cast Away', yeah that's right, the film with Tom Hanks, that can't escape from the island due to the chaos that always hit him, but you somehow knows that he was going to escape in the end. It's in that way Gravity follows.<br/><br/>Technically, it's a strong film. Cinematography it's top notch, the editing is a great contender for wins, I mean, I loved the balance of the slowly paced scenes with the fast paced ones. Thought the editors did a very good job indeed. The sound editing also fantastic¬Ö again, it's a great film in these technical aspects.<br/><br/>The acting? Meh. Very average. All Sandra Bullock did was yelling during the most intense scenes, and making nervous faces. It was without any kind of intensity. I don't think I need to mention Clooney, because he did even less than Bullock. Maybe a bit more of emotion and intensity could've improved a lot my impression about this film. Well, that's my review, and my rating it's 7.2/10. Fair."

","Alfonso Cuar√≥n has an impressive body of work including (arguably) the best Harry Potter film (""Prisoner of Azkaban"") and the dystopian ""Children of Men"", but unfortunately ""Gravity"" doesn't match the same level of cinema as these films.<br/><br/>""Gravity"" is visually spectacular, make no mistake about it but it fails as a human story. The characters are so poorly developed, especially Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone, that you find it hard to connect or even believe the clich√©d dialogue about loss and homesickness.<br/><br/>But, perhaps the worst culprit is the premise which involves Russians taking out their own spy satellite, whose debris annihilates not just the American shuttle, but also the international and Chinese space stations. I mean, come on! This is ineptitude of incredible proportions. Also, in my limited knowledge of space exploration, the ease with which the astronauts jump from shuttles/pods to hurtling space stations and the reentry - all seem highly improbable given the mind-boggling levels of precision required.<br/><br/>If you overlook these glaring flaws, you end up with a reasonably entertaining film which gives the viewers a spectacular look into space exploration, albeit one constructed on shaky scientific grounds. If you're the nitpicking sort, you're better off renting ""Apollo 13"" 6.5/10"

","OK so this movie should quite rightly sweep all the awards in the special effects and cinematography categories in the forthcoming awards season. However, it falls flat on its face when it comes to plausibility, but it needn't have. They make a point of letting us know that Sandra Bullock's character is not am astronaut as such and is up there to repair a satellite. She even admits to crashing the shuttle every time whilst doing some brief training in a flight simulator back on earth. Without wishing to give too much away Bullock has to board not one but two foreign space vehicles to get home, one Russian one Chinese. Considering she was incompetent in piloting a more familiar vehicle in a simulator we are expected to believe that she is capable of doing this under stress. Adding insult to injury she achieved all of this without any help from NASA people on earth due to the communications being down. At one point she actually says 'Eeny meeny miny moe' to select what button to press in a foreign space craft. When she splashes down on earth it has conveniently landed in a small lake allowing her to get to shore relatively easily. <br/><br/>If Bullock had been a highly qualified shuttle pilot this would have been more plausible but I guess plausibility is not good box office.<br/><br/>Chewing gum for the brain."

","Some decent visuals and sound effects make the first 30 minutes enjoyable if you watch it on the big screen but after that it occasionally becomes a bit tedious and repetitive. In fact, after about the first 30 minutes there's barely any reason for it to be in 3D and, contrary to popular opinion, it doesn't make the best use of 3D. I've now seen two 3D films and have decided that once you've seen one you've seen them all. It is an unnecessary element and not worth paying the extra ¬£¬£¬£'s for.<br/><br/>In terms of story, Bullock's character development and the whole dead daughter sub plot is contrived, uninteresting and is a cheap trick to dupe the most naive and docile of film-watchers who will accept such tired and clich√©d elements as 'emotional' . Overall, a so-so film that had its on and off moments. While it does have some decent visuals and hold-your-breath moments, it is completely over-rated in my opinion. It's not bad, it's just over-rated.

","First of all, special effects are first rate, acting pretty good, and decent suspense. It's a likable movie that deals in scientific realities and events that ""could"" happen. Like so many films that are of this genre, we have to look at the likelihood of a single person being able to accomplish what she does. Just the punishment she takes would be enough to squash most mortals. She is smashed against bulkheads, caught in webs of detritus, oxygen starved, burned and frozen, but never into submission. I guess I can't criticize her surviving since in the story she does. There is also her ability to adapt to a setting (a Russian space ship) where she seems to know an awful lot. Granted, she is an astronaut, but her ability to adapt is beyond the pale. All that said, it's a thrill-a-minute science fiction thriller with two charismatic actors (a bit of the supernatural as well).

","I have mixed feelings about this film. When I watched it, I thought the cinematography was beautiful and the 3D effects were excellent. However, I also felt that it was a bit of a 'space geek' kind of film and was not much more than a prolonged survival drama. The film was only about 90 minutes long but it became tiresome quite quickly. About an hour into the film, I was hoping that a piece of space debris would come crashing into Dr Ryan Stone's vessel to put her out of her misery and me out of mine as well. But having reflected on the film, I think it is a better film than I initially thought. There are some profound themes in there. The setting of the film- outer space- is serene and beautiful. One could say that it is a God-like creation. There are acts which hint at a benevolent God-like nature in human beings, such as Kowalski calmly sending himself to certain death in order to give Dr Stone a chance to live. The final scene was beautifully done, as Dr Stone returned to Earth and gradually emerged from the water, which seemed to be a nod to the beginning of human life itself. So we had the beauty of space, the beauty of Earth, the beauty of people and human creation all together in one film. That is quite unusual and makes this film one that is worth seeing."

","Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney). While on a routine space mission, an unforeseen danger falls upon them. Their shuttle is destroyed; their crew is dead. Completely alone and with limited resources, Stone and Kowalsky must try and get back to Earth before it's too late. <br/><br/>Gravity is quite possibly the best looking film you'll see all year. It's possibly the best looking film you've seen in the last five years, too. The technical marvels on full display in this film are revolutionary. Gravity takes an environment we are all fairly familiar with and shows it to use in a way that has never been done so well before. It's at times terrifying, exhilarating, and then, just, flat.<br/><br/>The best elements in the film take place in the first 40 minutes. Stone works on the shuttle that will not transfer data back to Houston. Kowalsky floats around her and the shuttle telling old stories from his past. It's peaceful. Houston calls in an abort mission due to Russian satellite debris and that's when everything becomes a whirlwind. The shuttle is hit, Stone becomes loose in space, and it's absolutely horrifying. All of this, the first 20 minutes, is done in one shot. There are probably cuts, but it is done in a way to mask it from the audience and it is a sight to see. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n has the best cinematography on full display in this sequence, and with such a powerful hook, the film tries hard in re-creating that the rest of its runtime.<br/><br/>Like Stone's oxygen levels, the film begins to fall exceedingly fast as the narrative goes on. Gravity tries to express many themes, the key one being about isolation. As much as we are alone with her, the audience never gets to ""know"" Stone that well. After becoming the sole survivor of the shuttle, the film does not let up in throwing any possible hurdle at her to make her survive. Because of this, there is rarely time to reflect on what makes her a compelling character, and there is only so much you can take watching someone float around space if there isn't an emotional pull.<br/><br/>Even the scenes that play to tug on sentiment do not work because we barely have any idea who we are watching. Why should we care if she survives? There were many times that tried to break down the wall of her character (""Learn to let go,"" Kowalsky yells to her; a striking image of her in the fetal position of an escape pod is shown, etc.) but in the end, Gravity chose action over development, which hurt it quite a bit.<br/><br/>There is no denying that Cuar√≥n's film is a stunning example of today's effects creating a masterful portrait. Every shot is flawless from beginning to end. Gravity creates a beautiful landscape that, much like space itself, ends up feeling empty."
"graupepillard","7","0","2","31 December 2013"," Lost in the mysterious beauty of space
","GRAVITY directed by the Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron from a script by Cuaron in collaboration with his son Jonas Cuaron, is a luminous film with fine performances by Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone, a Bio-Medical Engineer on her first outing into outer space, accompanied by George Clooney as the veteran, wisecracking Astronaut, Matt Kowalski who is her guide on this mission working outside the shuttle Explorer trying to fix the Hubble Telescope. Soon the idyllic beauty and silence of the deep blackness, which was only punctuated by soft far-off sounds of the other crew members is threatened by debris rushing at them from a Russian Satellite test gone awry. Suddenly the ""heavenly"" environment has changed from peaceful quietude to thundering menace.<br/><br/>What happens to these two protagonists when they are stranded ‚Äì two specks in the vast universe, separated from any contact with Mission Control, contributes to the intensity and apprehension that we feel witnessing their dilemma. Cuaron's spectacular visuals heighten our awareness of the isolation of Stone and Kowalksi drifting in the infinite sublimity and mystery of outer space, tethering it to the existential detachment and solitariness that we experience as mortals.<br/><br/>Through the breathtaking cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki we view images of the Earth as seen from a Space station, the rising of the sun, the topography of lands and water masses that become abstract faraway places of light and texture. The special effects in this movie are astonishing. From the balletic, slow spinning dance of the two actors, choreographed so that the weightless movement of objects float around them in continuous motion, dizzying, but slowed down enough so we can observe without getting dizzy ourselves, to the interior of the intricate space modules with gadgetry that is continually buzzing and flashing incomprehensible flickering flares reinforcing our sense of dread.<br/><br/>I loved the cinematic moments when there was an absence of sound, periodically interspersed with Steven Price's music. I wished there had been less dialogue, which was often inane and flippant, piercing the delicacy of the mood. Dr. Ryan Stone loves the ""silence"" but regrettably we do get the talky, joking Matt Kowalski - the ""regular guy"" with a sacrificial heart of gold - chattering away bringing us out of our reverie and back down to earth. Perhaps that was the intent of Alfonso Cuaron ‚Äì as life both in the cosmos and on terra firma are a mix of the transcendent and the commonplace."
"alexdelliott","7","0","2","31 December 2013"," major spoiler in second half of review
","The most significant point anyone can make about Gravity is that it is the most beautiful looking film of 2013. and for this reason alone I urge everyone to see it. The scenery all looks stunning, and the director has successfully captured the lifeless black void of space and juxtaposed it with the stunning view of Earth and all its vibrant colours. This is done through the use of camera angles and sound (or lack of sound) to create an atmosphere which is both peaceful and unsettling.<br/><br/>Our two main characters (or only real characters) are acted surprisingly well by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I was surprised to see them taking on these roles but I cannot fault the acting of these two. However, they weren't really given that much to work with and my main flaw is probably the writing. Since there are only two characters in the film I would have liked to have seen them more fleshed out. Instead they end up being very one-dimensional with Clooney providing moments of comic relief to Bullock's rather clich√©d damsel in distress. It would have been nice to see developments in these two characters but this is not a character driven film so this can be forgiven. However, this problem is not just with the characters but with the story as a whole, especially in its second half:<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>I will explain what I mean. The first half of this movie successfully builds up the tension which had me on the edge of my seat. The moment when Clooney's character drifted off really set in my sense of dread and hopelessness. Better writing could have taken this and made a very emotional film as we see our hero slowly lose hope as she realises that she will never return home again. But the movie seemed to lack to guts to go in this direction and instead falls back on the clich√© of the main character having a sudden eureka moment in the last 10 minutes and everything suddenly working out perfectly for her. This took me right out of the experience as this film had previously been very realistic as far as I could tell and hence the ending lacked the punch I was expecting and hoping for.<br/><br/>END SPOILERS<br/><br/>This ending is why this film will never be remembered by me as a great film, rather than simply a stunning one. See this film if you are in the mood for stunning visuals and brilliant direction. It is certainly worth the extra money for the 3D effect and I cannot praise this enough. However, it is a shame that the writing was simply not on par with this, leading to a film that, while beautiful, is easily forgettable."

","""Gravity"". The films title was well chosen by the director Alfonso Cuar√≥n, although gravity itself is not the main theme throughout the storyline. It's, of course, more about the non-attendance of gravity and how it is shown in a cinematographic way. But in the end, that is the only aspect for whom ""Gravity"" can be seen as ground-breaking.<br/><br/>If you are going to watch gravity, because you are excited about an innovative storyline with great dialogues/monologues and a beautiful screen along the way, you'll be disappointed. It's going to get much less than that. There is not even one conversation that holds you in tension or feels profound in any way. Therefore the acting is OK. But, as far as George Clooney's character is concerned, it's just ridiculous and completely out of place. The audience gets stupid gags, small talk and only few moments where the seriousness of the situation and the fear of death comes to light. As a result of partly emotionless acting,flat character sketches and, in my opinion, an average screenplay, the film deserves critical consideration.<br/><br/>On the other hand the camera-work is astounding. The weightlessness feels almost real from every perspective you get. That is the one aspect that can be seen as superb. Of course the effects and visualizations of space were great too, but let's face it: that's not an achievement that can justify a rating like that...<br/><br/>All in all I think it can be said, that ""Gravity"" can be seen as a great movie for everyone, who does not expect more from an innovative idea. For everyone, who does not want extraordinary, thought provoking dialogues. For everyone, who sees the cinema as a place, where he can get great effects and a little bit excitement in his daily routine. In my opinion it should be more..."

The EV suits, the Hubble telescope, other satellite components, the space-shuttle, space-stations, and re-entry vehicles. All are rendered with care and loving attention. If you watched this movie 100 times, you probably still wouldn't notice all the tiny parts and pieces. Space-flight does not happen by magic, and the film-makers really want us to see how much ingenuity and craft has gone into letting us float above our world. <br/><br/>When some of these parts and pieces get away from us, though, that's when things get dangerous. And there's no deadlier place for this than the airless frozen void of space. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that I've never seen destruction that felt so close and immediately threatening.

","Every other blogger has written about it, now its my turn. I have to say I really liked Gravity. I believe it is my personal favourite film of the year so far. Cuaron and his team create a magnificent but also horrifying image of space. That on one hand gives space a very tranquil and beautiful feeling. It is all the space you could ever need with no humans getting in your way. A world that is a million miles away from the crowded morning commute for most people. Not only that but it is filled with beautiful scenes of the Earth, the Sun and other distant stars, all floating around however they choose not needing the laws of gravity to hold them back. On the other hand we witness one of the scariest places we could ever imagine to find ourselves, filled with such a dark empty coldness that it is unrecognisable to us humans. Gravity shows how space can be both of these things at once. In a way it is good to have some ""space"" from other human beings, but too much of it can lead to emptiness and extreme loneliness once you float off on your own. <br/><br/>I will start with the bad news, of which there is very little. Ultimately what will happen sometimes with a film such as Gravity, is that character and story development will be disregarded in place of technical amazement. This did not happen so much with Gravity but I must admit that in some important character moments of the film I found myself more interested in how great the visuals would be when big moments happened rather than whether the characters were in danger. There are some smart attempts to introduce personal back stories which I did appreciate. However when it really matters I do not think these attempts stick so well. That being said, the characters are interesting and developed enough to want to go on this journey with them and see it through till the end.<br/><br/>As far as what I enjoyed about the film, the main thing was obviously its photography. Never before have I felt like floating off into the air in a cinema screening, but the photography work in Gravity is so convincing and free flowing that it is very hard not to feel dizzy at the sight of its imagery. There is no up or down, no high or low, only space, and a lot of it. One of the background commentaries that I felt while watching Gravity (and not a lot of people have brought this up) is the way us humans need the earth and are only possible because of it. In Gravity the earth is always there, shining like a huge ball of hope in an otherwise dead and cold infinity. We begin to see how life and evolution would just not be possible without it. There would be no heat, no food, no breathing, but as well no control of our own bodies. Ironically space could be seen as a freeing from the frustrations of human life, when in reality (like the films characters) floating with no control of even your body is one of the least freeing things we could imagine.<br/><br/>Gravity is more gripping in its narrative than most critics are giving it credit for. There is a human story and some genuine personal emotion, but in the end I believe Gravity is more about space itself and how humans can and are reacting with it. I also think Gravity has much to say about our animalistic need for the earth and all it provides for us. We truly could not live without it, not out there in that empty mass of nothingness anyway."

","The set-up is simplicity itself, you probably know what it's about, so let's not waste time with that.<br/><br/>On the positive side it's gripping, fast-paced and involving. Visually, it is superb, one of the best‚Äìlooking, best designed movies you're ever likely to see. Overall, an intense little thriller with some well-sustained edge-of-the-seat moments and a neat, quite brave twist as the one half of this superstar two-hander bows out half way through the running time. In some respects, the most interesting and charismatic of the two as it happens.<br/><br/>On the downside, the dialogue is mostly doggerel ‚Äì trite, manufactured and clunky. The hackneyed and stage-managed life-affirming epiphany bestowed on Bullock's insular grief-stricken character is both heavy-handed and monumentally unsubtle. And a bit gag-inducing to boot. I can do without references to a child's missing red shoe and knotted hair and conversations in the afterlife and all that phony corn-syrup coating.<br/><br/>The two leads do relatively well with their cardboard cut-out roles. Clooney is his usual practised mix of macho smarm and sophisticated swagger. Bullock whinges and hyperventilates effectively all over the place whilst her frozen face is now surgically incapacitated beyond the remotest chance of projecting convincing emotional expressions.<br/><br/>There are some great touches which could have delivered much more emotional impact. For instance, Bullock's tears floating in zero gravity. Now if only her face could have looked as if she were actually distressed and crying that would have been an amazing scene, rather than one that merely strikes as a very imaginative creative idea.<br/><br/>Cuaron directs with confidence and style and he conveys a stunning atmosphere of outer-space realism with a convincing use of physics and dizzying camera-work. He makes it easy to believe in the on-screen environment he has created. Sadly, I found it a lot harder to believe in the characters. It's strange but true, little things like bad dialogue and blank facial expressions that don't fit dramatic situations can jolt you out of a carefully constructed and immersive cinematic environment, diminishing the experience somewhat.<br/><br/>Bottom line, a solid, well-made, sci-fi flick with an ingenious narrative. Shame that shoddy characterisation and dialogue along with some self-imposed physical restrictions on the part of the lead-actress let it down. Could have been great, but wasn't. However, remains very good viewing despite the wasted potential.<br/><br/>Ah, wasted potential. Always the worst cinematic crime."

","Spoiler Alert: Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. <br/><br/>Nobody expects to see total realism in these kind of movies because total realism is mostly boring. However, with minimal cast and lots of special effects writer, producer, director Alfonso Cuaron made a mark for himself. For an adventure movie using space as a backdrop, it marginally works. As the story of a woman facing fears inside of herself, it marginally works and as a metaphor for human exploration: From water to earth to crawling to walking to space flight, it is so heavy handed that one is almost embarrassed at such a high-budget, sophomoric effort. <br/><br/>If this movie gets any Oscar or Golden Globe attention, it should be paid to Tim Webber because his work as Visual Effects Supervisor so far exceeds the rest of the movie that acting and directing have little place or importance. This movie is a visual feast if you like space stuff and the NASA channel. Forget the inaccuracies, it's a visual feast. <br/><br/>But it's ""Perils of Pauline"" in a shiny new wrapper with major messages. <br/><br/>1, We are all gonna die so live to the fullest and get over your petty fears.<br/><br/>2. Bad stuff happens in life but you must go on. <br/><br/>3. We came out of water, crawled on earth and took our first feeble steps to the stars -- or at least the upper atmosphere. <br/><br/>Why do these movies have to be so obviously message heavy? ""Space Cowboys"" dealt with tragedy in space and was more entertaining. 2001 dealt with tragedy in space and was more entertaining and thought provoking. ""Mission to Mars"" dealt with tragedy in space and was less entertaining. <br/><br/>Here, the movie/message baloney gets in the way of this move being entertaining and thoughtful. And do you think the situations could be any more set up than they were? <br/><br/>George Clooney is dead but miraculously comes back to life with sage advice for Sandra so that her life is saved but it is all an oxygen deprived dream. She is distraught over the premature death of her daughter and constantly thinks about her. So she's dying and who does she think about? Her fellow astronaut who sacrificed himself in a manner similar to De Palma's ""Mission to Mars"" which was even less entertaining and more message than ""Gravity"" if such a thing is possible. <br/><br/>M5 for visual effects only. Acting/directing is minimal but visually this is a stunner."
"mikeymcdo","7","0","1","10 December 2013"," Good film but why is the hype OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!
","A visual marvel depicting space as a place of great beauty yet great danger. The stunning camera work flows majestically and is bound to win some sort of Oscar it really takes your mind away from the simple narrative of hopping from one space station to another with the films grand visual beauty. <br/><br/>The small cast heightens the sense of isolation and leaves you engaged throughout the movie for the most part. The casting decisions for me are hit and miss, it is understandable that this movie needed the biggest stars possible to draw in audiences and keep them engaged, but on the other hand it is distracting seeing Bullock and Clooney two of the most recognisable actors in Hollywood playing astronauts so perhaps undiscovered talent would have been better off. I hate ripping into a film that looks aesthetically pleasing but in the script department it is rather underwhelming, why did George Clooney have to crack a joke about 10 million people losing their Facebook? Lucky for Bullock half of her dialogue consists of grunts and groans, must have been easy to learn those lines. <br/><br/>The 3D is also hit or miss sometimes it enhances the scene other times it just feels obnoxious such as the 3D tears coming towards your face. <br/><br/>The films most memorable scenes occur at the end I won't give away much but their are a few really great moments that provide genuine character depth more of this would have made it worthy of the hype this film has achieved. <br/><br/>Overall the film is extremely pretty much like Avatar it exceeds in visuals but provides little depth in characters and narrative, making it a must see one off viewing at the cinema, people are seriously missing out if they wait for the DVD or Blu-ray because the film will lose much of it's majesty on the small screen. The whole film kind off reminds me of a promotional demonstration for Imax cinemas which would showcase the great sound and visuals for Imax theatres."

","I gave Gravity a 6, mainly for the visuals. Other than that, there isn't much of anything here. Gravity is a nail-biter for sure. The problem is, that's all it is. It's 90 minutes of edge-of-your- seat moments strung together.<br/><br/>We learn next to nothing about the only two characters in the movie, so there is no emotional investment whatsoever. I honestly didn't care much whether the characters lived or died.<br/><br/>There's no story either. It's basically 3 real-time hours of space survival crammed into 90 minutes. And by 'space survival,' I mean floating around trying to grab onto things while watching for space debris. There's your movie.<br/><br/>Gravity makes a mild attempt at being philosophical and falls short. And the message it tries to convey is one we've all heard before, particularly in Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>No story, no character development, just 90 minutes of stressful, nail-biting moments. Yes, it's a beautiful looking movie. The visuals are amazing. But amazing visuals don't make a movie amazing.<br/><br/>If you're a sci-fi geek or just in the mood for an intense, edge-of-your-seat movie, give Gravity a go.

The movie has a good amount of suspense and thrills, and you really root for Ryan Stone (played by Sandra Bullock) as she struggles through the obstacles.<br/><br/>Even with a cast list of that few people, director Alfonso Cuar√≥n did an amazing job with ""Gravity"".<br/><br/>And also it should be pointed out that the musical score for ""Gravity"" was off the charts.

There are very tense scenes which don't really last too long and then you spend the rest of the film watching the visuals. <br/><br/>*******************SPOILER ALERT****************** A Scene where Sandra Bullock is crying, but amazingly her face shows no emotion, that's gotta be an acting skill right? ******************SPOILER OVER*******************<br/><br/>OK, so Bullock plays lead Ryan Stone, yes I know a blokes name. I always knew there was something mannish about her... George Clooney plays the cavalier Matt Kowalski and then that's about it for cast, which is probably a good thing cos I swear the $100 million dollars the film cost to make probably went on the visuals.<br/><br/>Which are well done. Although there was a point where you could blatantly see the CGI, which wasn't a big issue, but slightly detracted from the effect of the scene. I had a few issues with stuff like the colour of the sun. In Space it's white, not yellow like we know it to be on Earth, this is because of the atmosphere changing it's colour, you still reading? Sorry went into Geek mode. Anyhoo, if you aren't an avid reader of #NewScientist, you'll probably be quite happy with the resulting visuals that are provided.<br/><br/>Script is well done. Matt Kowalski: ""Half of North America just lost their Facebook."" or Dr. Ryan Stone: My name's not ""May Day."" Nice little one liners that got the audience tittering. Is that what you really want from a film like this? 25% of the script is well thought out.<br/><br/>Music composed and provided by British composer Steven Price. It really is amazing the why it hits all the right spots throughout the film.<br/><br/>7/10 for the biggest space film to date, apparently.

What we ended up with was Smurf Pocahontas in Space. A film with two dimensional characters and a very bland script which is extremely forgettable.<br/><br/>Gravity offers a much more stripped down, easy to follow and dare I say it, 'realistic' story line. The characters are easier to relate to and fairly likable. Any film that is predominantly designed to showcase new technology/cinematic techniques is going to need a decent plot to go with it. Gravity gets this just right.<br/><br/>Some of the best CGI work i've ever seen. The seamless blend of CGI and real elements is impressive to say the least. Bullock holds the screen well, not many actors/actresses out there are capable of holding down such roles. The performance doesn't quite portray the loneliness and isolation of being in space as well as Sam Rockwell does in Moon but it's a decent effort.<br/><br/>A film that NEEDS to be seen in 3D on the big screen."

"rubenm","7","0","1","24 November 2013"," Technically breathtaking, but a bit melodramatic
","Technically, this film is a breathtaking example of 21st century cinema. It is a showcase of modern day cinematographic technology. The seamless combination of flesh-and-blood actors with computer generated images is perfect. I was amazed when the camera moved closer and closer to the visor of an astronaut's helmet, even seemed to move into the helmet, showing the face in extreme close-up, and then turned, showing the audience what the astronaut sees when she looks out into space. <br/><br/>Although making the film has undoubtedly been a tour-de-force, it never feels that way. The story comes first, and the technology is used to make the story possible. It's not the other way round, as is sometimes the case in other films. As a technological achievement, this film is a masterpiece. <br/><br/>But it is not an unforgettable film. When you don't take into account the amazing technology, you're left with a rather mainstream story with an irritatingly moralizing message about never giving up and keeping hope against all odds. <br/><br/>Essentially, this is a classic adventure film. A group of brave astronauts is hit by bad luck. Their space station is destroyed, most of them are killed, but one woman survives. After countless adventures, each of which could have killed her, she succeeds in returning safely to earth. The problem is not the scientific accuracy of these adventures. After all, this is film. And film is about the suspension of disbelief. The problem is that the story sometimes tends to be too melodramatic. When the surviving astronaut tells her colleague, who is presumed dead, to give a message to her deceased daughter ('tell her I found her red shoe'), you know this is Hollywood. <br/><br/>As an adventure film, 'Gravity' works quite well. The action is fast-paced, going from one life- threatening situation to the other. In combination with the superb computer generated images, this is a very enjoyable movie. At least, if you're prepared to cope with some Hollywood moralizing and a predictable happy end."

","Despite the hype - for me 'Gravity' crashes to earth with a dull thud.<br/><br/>The opening sequence to this film (widely regarded as the trailer) is actually rather good.<br/><br/>It's good if you cover your ears to avoid the TERRIBLE dialogue that begins almost immediately with George Clooney nattering with his old pub mates back down at ground control, while Sandra Bullock struggles to fix a computer board or re-initiate a boot drive system or something or ANYTHING that gives the writers a reason to put these people in harm's way in space.<br/><br/>Add to this a piece of appalling casting by making the token non-American crew member arse about in the background (on a supposedly serious government funded space mission?!) and do a Macarena in space, and THEN try and make you feel sorry for him NOT because he just got his face knocked off by space junk BUT because he had a picture of his FAMILY... Seriously Hollywood - people WITHOUT families are STILL people!!!!!<br/><br/>Aaaagh.<br/><br/>Nuff of the caps. Gravity has enough problems in the first five minutes that when they begin to unravel it sets off a chain reaction with bits of badly developed plot smashing into desperately under-developed characters and resulting in a tide of unrealistic science and clich√©s which encircle the earth, and every 90 seconds make unwelcome returns to the screen.<br/><br/>WHY OH WHY put Sandra Bolluck in the driving seat. At least in Speed we were led to understand she hadn't driven a bus before. Instead here we are forced to believe she's undergone an entire SPACE TRAINING programme.<br/><br/>Even as a doctor back on earth she admits she kept dropping stuff - so why let her use a MASSIVE DRILL - in SPACE?<br/><br/>The science is incorrect but despite this I was looking forward to the development of the idea of an out of control chain reaction of destroyed satellites causing a kind of space tsunami of debris... It would have satisfied my hype gland sufficiently. Visually it would have been exciting, and it's a novel plot idea.<br/><br/>...But NO. We can't have that. You can't kill Sandra Bullock in space. There are LAWS against it.<br/><br/>The writers of Gravity were too scared to take a step into the void and instead turned the remainder of their film into a heroic survival tale, replete with courageous hoots and patriotic speeches (albeit the sort of ones one makes to oneself in moments of crisis in burning up space pods).<br/><br/>Then the film ends and I go looking for the vodka I stashed somewhere in the car.

"Scene13","7","0","1","22 November 2013"," A Feast for the Eyes
","Gravity (2013) is a feast for the eyes. I was filled with a feeling of wonder and amazement by the many views of the earth, the sun rises and the rest of the universe. It was, for a while, rather tranquil and I enjoyed watching it much like I would an astronomy based documentary. Whilst the visual effects of this film were in a league with Prometheus (2012) and Elysium (2013) the story was more in line with Buried (2010) by Rodrigo Cort√©s. Essentially gravity is Buried in space; small cast, monologuing lead characters and of course the life or death situation. That being said I don't want it to sound like gravity is unoriginal although it has similarities with Buried it takes a lot of imagination to adapt the idea for Sci-fi setting .I think that Alfonso Cuar√≥n should be applauded for not only trying to bring something new to the Sci-Fi genre, but succeeding in making a film that was on the most part very very good. <br/><br/>The Positive Points <br/><br/>Cinematography: As I said in the introduction this film is visually stunning. The special effects seemed to be top notch throughout. I couldn't fault it. I watched the 2D version and could see some scenes would have been really good in 3D. As well as some scenes where they may have used the 3D in a more gimmicky way, which isn't really my cup of tea but each to their own. <br/><br/>Atmosphere: I felt the feel and the atmosphere of this film was really well done. For example after the opening (SPOILER START) when the camera is just looking at space and there is no sound, you really felt the loneliness of space and the fact that the characters you are about to meet really are fish out of water.(SPOILER END) I felt these moments were really well thought out, and help the viewer relate to the way space must feel, sound, and appear.<br/><br/>Main Plot: The main plot (SPOILER START) this being astronauts in space, disaster strikes, who will survive, will anyone make it home etc. (SPOILER END) was fairly strong. I felt it was all very believable (but I do not have an in depth understanding of space or physics) and I could even look passed a few of the little plot holes as they weren't hugely serious. This main plot line was exciting, fast paced, and left on its own would have made a great film. <br/><br/>Acting: The acting in this film was great. I thought that both George Clooney( Matt Kowalski )and Sandra Bullock (Dr Ryan Stone) played their respective character well with the strong performances we have come to expect from them, especially in serious roles like these. That's all that really needs to be said here; Good Acting.<br/><br/>The Negative Point<br/><br/>Sub Plot & Character Development: Just to be clear (SPOILER START) when I say Sub Plot & Character Development I am only talking about the tragic passed of Dr Ryan Stone. (END SPOILER) This is the area of the film that I really disliked. I felt the revelation that (SPOILER START) Ryan's daughter had died a few years earlier to the events in this film and therefore she had no one on Earth to miss her, due to the fact she now just drives her car in a never ending depression (SPOILER END), was a cheap/ weak way of forcing depth to a character. On top of this I didn't feel it worked at all. In fact, the fact that I felt like they were trying too hard and pushing a sad tale down my throat really distracted me from the film. Essentially this failed for two reasons. 1) They hit me with this hugely emotional back story before I was emotionally invested in the characters and therefore it had little effect on me the first time, and just annoyed me when it turned up later on in the film, and 2)They chose something that not many can relate too. Seriously, I have no idea why this back story was chosen. In fact it would have made more sense to have had (SPOILER START) the daughter still alive on Earth, as we could probably all relate to being apart from a loved or being concerned about how they would be if we were unable to return home. (SPOILER END) 3) finally I just felt it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film, I still felt that the characters were 1 dimensional. All I can think is that it was cheap shot at character development that if the script had been worked on a bit more this could have been done in other ways. Going back to Buried (2010) I do not remember Ryan Reynolds character being 1 dimensional and he was the only actor in the film. So the small cast is no excuse! OK sorry about that but I feel more and more that with films at the moment they try forcing you to feel sorry for a character as a cheap way of satisfying character development on their check list for the script. Rant Over.<br/><br/>Alas this review comes to an end. Overall I think this film was good, unique and I am glad that Alfonso Cuar√≥n brought this to the table. I think directors/writers should always be rewarded for attempting something new. After all it would be boring if all films were the same. This film was on the whole very very good but had they re-looked at the character development then they could have had something amazing."
"ViktorDrake","6","0","1","21 November 2013"," An OK movie hidden beneath layers Hollywood hype
","I saw Gravity last night in 3D and I'm still not exactly sure what to make of it. I enjoyed it as a piece of fluff, but at no point did I feel I was watching greatness.<br/><br/>For a start, I think the *ahem* ""professional"" film critics must either be a) on the studio's payroll, or b) so highly trained in the film reviewing art that they're seeing something in this film that I'm not, or c) they're so totally caught up in the Hollywood hype and nonsense themselves that they completely overlook the many failings. I personally believe it's the latter.<br/><br/>Lots of people have complained about the simplistic plot - personally I'm absolutely fine with that as not every movie needs to have layers and layers of complexity. It's a simple story covering a couple of hours of the lives two space technicians who's mission goes belly-up. Fine.<br/><br/>What's far LESS fine, are the blatantly stupid things that are in place. For example, Bullock's character (Stone) having had a mere 6 months training before being sent off to fix the Hubble. Stone not being remotely mentally up to the task due to a family trauma that is still clearly affecting her. Stone being allowed into space despite (apparently) crashing her simulator EVERY SINGLE TIME. Stone being able to operate not only American space vessels, but also (rather handily) Russian and Chinese ones too : apparently while she was crashing her American sim all the time, she was also doing crash-courses in foreign space tech too.<br/><br/>Then there's Clooney's character, Kowalski. A typical (for the movies anyway) wise-cracking (yet stoic in the face of danger) all-American heroic-type, with either a cheeky chat-up line for the girls, or a tension-breaking one-liner, who is always calm and controlled in the face of certain death. ""My god, that's beautiful - the sun on the Ganges"" says Kowalski as he slowly drifts off to death by suffocation. Also there is no way on Earth Kowalski would fly round and round the shuttle and the Hubble with his jetpack like he does for the first 15 mins of the movie. There is no way he'd waste the fuel, or risk a collision like that. No way. Same goes for the other astronaut leaping up off the shuttle to be stopped by his tether just for a laugh. Space is the most hostile place mankind has ever been, so clowning around to that extent just wouldn't happen.<br/><br/>Then there is all the nonsense of the space debris being visible coming towards them, even though it's moving ""faster than a bullet"". OK, so it's just done for dramatic effect, but in a movie supposedly being a realistic depiction of space, it's a little annoying.<br/><br/>Then there's the issue of the fact that despite being in space, everything is in apparently in the same plane and incredible close to each other - the ISS, the CSS, the shuttle, the debris field - all on the one plane and within a couple of hundred miles for each other. Useful to the story no doubt, but implausible in the extreme.<br/><br/>Then there's the re-entry sequence. Why does the rest of the CSS burn up (as it would), whilst Stone's re-entry pod somehow manages to orientate itself (despite being effectively blown off the disintegrating space station) so that it's heat shield is at the correct angle? And then the landing in the water where she nearly drowns, nearly gets stuck in some kelp (people were actually laughing in the cinema at that point!), before emerging helpfully close to land, and helpfully in a warm climate considering she's only wearing hot pants and a vest.<br/><br/>The CGI was OK - not sure where all the rave review are coming from about that to be honest. There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn't strike me as truly ground-breaking either.<br/><br/>That said, (and I realise this review has seemed overly negative), I didn't dislike it is as a piece of entertainment. It's simple, reasonably well executed and with the right amount of tension to be worth an hour and a half of your time. For the movie alone I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, but I'm knocking a point or two off for the idiotically sycophantic ""professional"" critic's reviews. 5 overall."

","The movie ""Gravity"" kept me glued to my seat. My attention was firmly focused on the adventures of ""Sandra & George"", which is what the movie was really about anyway. Oh, granted, the special effects attempted to project a feeling of being in ""outer space"" which worked somewhat (I didn't see it in 3-D). There was something missing. The thing that was missing was the ""awe and mystery"" (I'm paraphrasing the opening description of the old sci-fi series ""The Outer Limits"") of outer space. I wasn't really transported anywhere, which is what you want in a sci-fi movie. It felt more like a thriller to me that just happened to be in outer space. ""Gravity"" was more about the ""Perils of Sandra Bullock"" than any kind of science fiction. A roller coaster ride without any inspiration, just a ride.

The exceptional ambiance of the film is constantly fighting against bad dialogue, sultry family dramas, nationalism and the heroic choir soundtrack. It really is interesting to realize that the only poor reviews talk about 'unrealistic scenario' science and physics wise, while no one mentions the obvious pseudo-heroic cocktail of epanaleptic, superfluous, easy Hollywood blockbuster doses. Watch it in 3D though as it is meant to be watched, a delight for your senses, but please don give me crap about any depth whatsoever. Yes, James Cameron loved it. I also love his films, it's true entertainment (not at all pretentious as in the case of Gravity) and I do not seek any deeper meanings. Mr Cuar√≥n here, would have loved to take his movie a bit further, but some things are just not allowed in Hollywood."

Overall watch Gravity because its one best outer space movies you have seen till date and its a visual experience like never before!!!"

","I know the producers wanted everyone to have the ""reality"" of space delivered to them via this film. But the overall effect was marred by the type of jump cuts and camera motions apparently to convey the danger of space and the velocity of objects in orbit. Fine. But after 10 minutes the whole approach became well, it wore out its welcome for me and my family. It was worth the trip to the theater even though we all ended up with slight headaches from watching the fast impact style of filming. The film also did not resolve a basic central question none of these movies take up. How is it that the astros aren't FRIED by the level of basic radiation present in absolute gobs at that alt. The space suits would have to be like 8000 lbs to properly protect against the rads in orbit or deep space. These film's in reality are in the business of convincing thatergoers that they were given a glimpse of life in space. Well, not exactly....."

","I was thoroughly looking forward to this film seeing 10 out of 10 everywhere so was perhaps letting myself in for a fall. Let's not get away from it, just as so many other space films this was visually stunning, probably as mind blowing as Jurassic park at the time. These effects give the movie such a believable and realistic feel that you are gripping your feet to the floor and hands to the seats in fear you fly into outer space. A movie is not great because of special effects though and this movie is a let down for a number of reasons. <br/><br/>The main reason is bullock, she was not the correct actress for this and does not hold the attention of the audience in gripping scenes. If you want the character to fail Something ain't right. Bad acting or direction either way she didn't fit the film. Clooney on the other hand was great and believable and carried the film.<br/><br/>Also For such a believable movie visually the storyline needs to be just as believable which it was not. So I stopped believing and was only amerced in the action scenes. The last 40 min was just an uncomfortable wait for the inevitable. Not really caring which way the story line will go. <br/><br/>In having said all of that it is still a visually stunning and in parts thrilling film.

"gary-444","3","0","2","16 November 2013"," Vacuous in a vaccum
","Don't believe the hype.<br/><br/>I went to see this film wanting to enjoy it. I like space movies, think it is an underrepresented genre currently, and thought that a big budget with Clooney and Bullock would guarantee a worthwhile film. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, astronauts working in orbit are threatened by a debris field, catastrophically compromising their mission, and the race is on to come home.<br/><br/>Visually the film is sumptuous, the special effects are tremendous, but the dialogue is as vacuous as space itself, and, bereft, of any big idea, the story becomes a little tedious. Much of the film is monologue. If you are either Shakespeare with a gift for soliloquy, or have a challenging proposition as in Duncan Jones' ""Moon"" then you can overcome that, but Director and writers Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Jon√°s Cuar√≥n, are neither.<br/><br/>The characters are desperately underwritten. There are a few knowing jokes about Clooney's looks, Bullock is both a top scientist and a dimwit. Yet there is none of the courage of Apollo 13, no wonder of 2001 a Space Odyssey, no intrigue of Moon. This is Hollywood at its worst. Lack of characterisation also results in the scriptwriters' nightmare, we are not that bothered about the fate of the protagonists. Compound that with a lack of jeopardy, and it all becomes a little flat.<br/><br/>Some points simply irritate. Many of the spectacular views of earth are unidentifiable, save for a nice shot of the Nile Delta, how a super intelligent scientist fails to realise that opening the hatch door in water will result in a sinking is risible, and the anonymous identity of the landing site is a missed opportunity to build on the international dimension of the story. The 3D effects are perfunctory and lame, a hand coming out of the screen, floating debris, and that is about it.<br/><br/>I suspect that there may be a generational aspect to the acclaim this film has received. If you are too young to have seen the great space films of the past, then this rebooting with fine effects may be enough. For the rest of us it is not."

I found Sandra Bullock's performance good value for money and she portrayed her emotions impressively when faced with jeopardy after jeopardy.<br/><br/>One scene showed a dead astronauts head popping out of a spacecraft which was a cheap 'Jaws' ripoff.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is not to give up no matter what predicament you are in.

The story was lazy at times and I felt the director was trying to build up false sense of suspense only to lead to cheap jumpscares. Although it was to be expected, i found the trailer very misleading, I came into the film expecting to see quite a lot more about the struggles she found herself in BUT she spent almost a third of the film doing nothing and a great length of time with very feint audio and watching a POV of space, although this does build suspense, too much of it made me lose interest and did not really make great cinema.

But I don't agree with the acclaim the critics have given it. Once you strip away the cgi this is a plain disaster movie like 'Tower Inferno', 'Airport' or 'the Poseidon Adventure'. But it only centres on two characters so you don't get the wide array of personalities or the fodder to fall foul of the environment.<br/><br/>Clooney and Bullock are great, but even in zero gravity Bullock is weighed down by the baggage of her previous movies. There wasn't really enough time for me to get to know the characters so I didn't really engage with them.<br/><br/>There is some rather hammy symbolism regarding rebirth and the characters are blessed and cursed luck wise, everything that can go wrong does, but often they manage to grab that fortuitous root sticking out the side of the cliff that saves them from falling.<br/><br/>Watching this film in 3d strengthened by existing distain for the format, and as there is no sound in space I didn't feel like the cinema's Dolby added anything and I would have been happy to wait for DVD.<br/><br/>In short, I greatly enjoyed it but fail to see what all the fuss is about."

","It is, of course, impossible to review this title as one would a 'normal' film if only because it is highly unlikely that the two actors were ever on the same set at the same time - rather like the 'Duets' recordings Sinatra made with several other vocalists in different studios and/or countries. Clearly without cgi there would be no movie and if we accept that going in then yes, we can admire the technology and 3D effects but that is not the same as admiring fine acting whether it be John Gielgud in Shakespeare or Bette Davis in All About Eve, and this is why, to my mind at least, it is totally ludicrous to speak about Oscar-worthy performances for either of the two actors, in fact it is extremely doubtful whether audience interest could have been sustained (I almost said 'milked') for much longer than the 91 minutes running time.

"Therut","8","0","2","12 November 2013"," I recommend seeing this in the theatre in 3D
","Gravity tells a story about survival in space afer an accident has taken place. That story is not very profound nor original in itself but it is executed in a fantastic way, enough so for me to recommend seeing the film. If you have seen the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous film Children of Men then you might have some idea about how absorbing it can get.<br/><br/>The intense action is what really makes the film great but there are also some scenes of sheer beauty and calmness that balance the action. The acting by Sandra Bullock really helps to become abosrbed in the experience and Geroge Clooney does a fine job as well. The music is perhaps the weakest point of the action sequences: not bad but not memorable either, just a bit bland. In certain emotional scenes the composer Steven Price fares very well.<br/><br/>If you intend on seeing this film, I definitely recommend seeing it in a movie theatre in 3D. I'm not generally a fan of 3D but here it is definitely a positive factor that builds up the immersion instead of creating distraction."

Why did this happen in a dream? Why did Stone need help from a dead guy in a dream?<br/><br/>I don't usually like suggesting that films become radically different just to become more progressive or more politically correct. In this case, a slight change *would* make for a more interesting movie. Remove the deus ex machina dream sequence. Dr. Stone instead should have got over her problems on her own, without a knight in shining armor to rescue her."

This film definitely has that, but only as a minor driving force to push the story forward. This is one film, in my opininon, that is one perfect ride experience. The film doesn't even get into the tecnicalities of the tasks assigned to astronauts, but what it would be like if you were in space, and obviously something went wrong.

It has tremendous cinematography, and definitely has a bit of a different 'feel' then most space-based films. I've read that the director revolutionized how this type of movie was shot, and i can't disagree. <br/><br/>And despite any complaints, this movie is never boring.<br/><br/>It is, however, pretty ridiculous. As a kid growing up the space program was something that grabbed my attention and i absolutely drank up anything i could find on it. For someone who does their homework even on the most basic level, it's hard to take pretty much anything that happens in this movie seriously. <br/><br/>And it all starts with the main character of Ryan Stone. I find it so hard to believe that someone like this would have passed the testing required to BE an astronaut. Yet, after we see all her deficiencies in plain view, we are then asked to believe that she could pull off stuff that even the best of the best would struggle with? <br/><br/>Yikes. No, beautiful film, but i think it's REALLY overrated by the critics.

We are talking about 95% of movie critics giving it a positive review, people calling it a ""movie of the year candidate""? I've seen porn movies with more captivating dialogue and more coherence. Many of my friends and film lovers tried to show me that there is something symbolic and subtle in this film, but I simply can't see it. There isn't. It is a short, impossible, cheesy and (at moments) hilarious action flick which I have seen many times.

As IMDb requires me to have 10 lines in my post, the following is simply filler to fulfill this requirement: Does space debris travel that much faster than other orbiting objects? I was wondering where Sandra landed. The satellite image of earth, at re-entry, reminded me of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico but the imagery, for some reason, had the look and feels Southeast Asia. Does anyone have a theory for how communications with Houston were restored upon re-entry when we were led to believe that most, if not all of the communications satellites were taken out by the orbiting debris?"

A much hyped sci-fi tale of stranded astronauts in space.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n directs after a 7 year gap since his masterpiece Children of Men, resulting in a great deal of attention from the industry as to what he would produce next.<br/><br/>The story revolves around two astronauts, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who are carrying out routine repairs above the earth's atmosphere.<br/><br/>A freak accident suddenly causes a vast amount of satellite debris to be knocked into their path resulting in Stone being detached from the crew and fighting for her life.<br/><br/>To say any more about the plot would spoil the experience, but what is important is to focus on the breathtaking visuals in the film.<br/><br/>This is a film that is all about the audience experiencing a thrilling 3 dimensional ride.<br/><br/>As soon as the film begins we are presented with a silent beautiful view of earth from above. We then begin to see the shuttle and Clooney drifting into shot where we continue in one take and witness the crew go about their repairs.<br/><br/>The fluid one take shots are outstanding, the camera never staying still and drifting with the crew as they communicate with each other and with NASA. I've no doubt this is as close as you will get to experiencing what these brave individuals go through from the comfort of a chair.<br/><br/>Sound design and score have been carefully crafted with moments of deathly silence only to be jolted from your seat with the booming sound and sights of space debris.<br/><br/>The film does however have some issues with pacing and also character development.<br/><br/>The focus is very much on Sandra Bullocks' character, a novice astronaut with a tragic past. However it is Clooneys' character that needed more development. His wisecracks and charisma work early on in the film but later on when the situation turns even darker, his reaction to the situation simply didn't ring true for me.<br/><br/>The film is saved however by the final act, a truly nerve shredding and emotional finale that sees Bullocks' character fighting for her life.<br/><br/>Visually the film has certainly done something that I have never seen before and to an extent has restored some faith in 3D filmmaking. However, the hype machine is simply not justified and that comes down to the script which needed to go through a few more drafts to develop the characters more.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuar√≥n is a masterful director no question, but I do hope he doesn't focus too much energy on pushing the technology in his future work and lose the human touch that he has displayed in his previous films.<br/><br/>Reviewed By: Daryn Castle<br/><br/>Join the debate on our Facebook Group (www.facebook.com/groups/Filmsploitation) or on our website (www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk)"

","The title is telling. Set in orbit around the Earth, there is virtually no gravity here but, thanks to a freak accident, very soon the gravity of the situation becomes terrifying. Gravity and oxygen are not the only things in short supply in this film: there are only two characters (played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney) and in consequence not a lot of dialogue but, if there is a paucity of words, there is almost an excess of wonder and drama in this terrific movie from Mexican director Alfonso Cuardon (""Pan's Labyrinth"").<br/><br/>Although years in the making, Cuardon - who also co-wrote the script with his son - does not waste time with scene-setting or character exposition on Earth. Immediately we are suspended in space, marvelling at the silence and gloriousness of it all. At the other end of the story, Cuardon does not bother with Hollywood-style codas to lighten the mood - ""Gravity"" ends exactly when it should. In between, there is never a moment when you are not captivated by what is happening on screen. And, for once, a blockbuster does not overrun its time, coming in at just an hour and a half.<br/><br/>Bullock and Clooney are excellent in portrayal of very different characters who will live or die by the other's decisions. She is Ryan Stone, the mission specialist with no previous time in space who becomes fear personified. He is Matt Kowalski, the space veteran on his last mission who never loses his charm or cool. The crisis they face is so predictable - if, hopefully, unlikely - that it has a name in the scientific community community (the Kessler syndrome).<br/><br/>For movie fan like me, there are so many allusions to earlier films: the floating majesty of the opening scene recalls the first view of space in ""2001""; when the astronauts are warned by Houston mission control of the impending danger, the voice is that of Ed Harris from ""Apollo 13""; when Bullock takes off her bulky space suit, we are inevitably reminded of Sigourney Weaver at the end of ""Alien"".<br/><br/>I saw ""Gravity"" at London's newest multiplex - Cineworld at Wembly's London Designer Outlet - and I opted to view in 3D (which i normally avoid) and D-BOX (which I have never experienced before). I can't say that the tilting seat added that much to the enjoyment of the movie, but the 3D was terrific. Not since ""Avatar"" have I felt that the extra dimension worked so well. I really felt as if I was in space and there is an especially moving moment involving a single tear. Some of the science may be suspect, but the brilliant special effects made it all too real for me."

I would not be surprised if she will double her prize for 'The Blind Side'.<br/><br/>Talking about the film, one of the best moments is in the final, when Cuaron has the brilliant idea to represent the evolution: first Sandra Bullock swim in the sea (according to many scientist first cellular forms lived in the water), then she goes out having a quadrupedal position and finally she stands erect like modern man.<br/><br/>My rating, for a film that could be a big protagonist at the Oscars, is 8/10."
"mel_protoss","8","0","1","4 November 2013"," Amazing cinematography, but a little headache-inducing.
","Undoubtedly, the film's cinematography is amazing. If a film's purpose is to transport its audience to another world, then Gravity has wildly succeeded. The palpable silence as space debris zoom past the astronauts at bullet-speeds leaves viewers gripping their seats in apprehension. At the other end of the spectrum, the long shots of the sun creeping behind the Earth are nothing short of breathtaking.<br/><br/>Yet, for all the film's brilliance, I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped to. The panning and the spinning (shots taken from the astronaut's perspective) gave me a mild headache during the film. I half-expected it, and when it came, I was wary of it escalating , and could no longer immerse myself in the film. Which is a real waste. Because ultimately, Gravity succeeds by engulfing its audience in an experience ‚Äì the freedom, the beauty, the terror ‚Äì of what it feels like to be in space."
"Juja1","3","0","4","3 November 2013"," Huh?
","I was not impressed. The technology behind the movie may be impressive, but I can only rate my subjective enjoyment of viewing, coming down to 3 points. Here is why: - Absence of character-based drama: I had been much intrigued by the idea of a character-based drama with a space setting. But with the number of characters quickly reduced to one, it actually had minimal interplay of characters. Also there was practically no character development. This was simplified to the main character having lost a child, and overcoming this trauma in a rather cheesy ""angel"" scene. I did not like Children of Men either, and wonder what it is with Cuaron and the mother-and-child theme. It was hard to emotionally relate to characters with hardly any backstory about them. - The movie was not very suspenseful, probably because the plot is an event-driven one-way success story. The main character successfully reacts to a straight-forward series of catastrophic events (board space station: check, overcome trauma: check,¬Ö). Each try takes her one step further to a new physical location, but without any character related setbacks or emotional to-and-fro that could create suspense. - The movie felt rather ""Hollywood"" and clich√©d. For me, possible suspense and emotion was instantly killed by the bombastic musical score, a major cause of cheesiness. I react badly to musical scores that tell me I should be feeling moved NOW. I feel that the movie might have been much more captivating with a reduced score, focusing on only those sounds that can really be heard in the loneliness of space. - Although I like the idea of exploring personal ""rebirth"" in the movie, I think that the spiritual element was not woven into the story in a consequential and layered manner involving resonance on many levels of storytelling, but rather bluntly included through a few key scenes (fetal position; evolution scene in the end of the movie etc.). Especially with the lack of character definition, these scenes thus came over as cheesy and out of context. I'd say, if you want to go metaphorical, go all the way. - To me, another movie where ""pathetisch"" (grand) comes over as ""pathetic"". I give it a 3, but I can understand reviewers who gave only 1 point for the same reasons."

","It is spectacular. I cannot think of another film that so brilliantly depicts what it might feel like to be in space. It feels surreal, beautiful and terrifying. It is such an imperious joy to watch, especially in the first 30 - 45 mins that it feels gut wrenching when you're exposed to the final 2/3rds of the movie where endless ""will she? won't she?"" survival moments end with last ditch escapes. I think it becomes a sort of hyperbolic, mad parody of itself: which is either incredibly brave of the filmmakers or incredibly lazy. <br/><br/>I am yet to come to terms with the juddering, jarring discordance between first and second half but I do think everyone should see this movie.

"janeblevins","7","0","1","27 October 2013"," Unbelievable visuals but not much of a storyline
","This movie was riveting in many ways: the visuals are truly unbelievable. Your stomach churns right along with the title characters and you might find your hands reaching up from the darkness of the theater to grab hold of all those bars and hatches Bullock and Clooney spend a lot of time trying to grab as they spin wildly through space. <br/><br/>But let's face it, the script is really weak. If it weren't in 3D and we weren't 200 miles above the Earth, there'd be absolutely no reason to take the slightest interest in these people. Only one question drives the entire film: will they or won't they make it? And since they're pretty much random people (albeit really bad-ass pilots and expert grabbers of things flying through space it turns out) the only way to produce the slightest spectator interest is to stage the space equivalent of ""the car chase"": (debris fly by at rip-you-to-bits speeds and tethers snap off at the worst possible moment). <br/><br/>It makes for a roller coaster evening, and for a linear, one track impressively visual film with lots of little ""gotcha's!"" but no real surprises. If that's what you're looking for, it's a great great film. It's very entertaining. It'll take your mind off work and make you wonder if a couple of things are scientifically possible. If you're wanting a three dimensional fictional universe instead of 3D images, see Moon (2009) on netflix."
"ysamat","7","0","1","27 October 2013"," Great but not the greatest!
","Maybe its the hype that accompanied it... i expected more. Gravity turned out to be a great film but not out there with the greatest. Here's why.<br/><br/>The plot is too contrived. The links between the various stages of the film too tenuous. C'mon, its implausible for anyone to slip into another satellite and chaperone it back to Earth using a manual written in another language. And this is all before there is another satellite used to get there in the first place. Anyway, lets suspend our disbelief... its only a movie. <br/><br/>The other problem is George Clooney. He was outstanding in ""The Descendants."" His tentative nature showed his vulnerability there. Here, he is simply smug, even through crisis. Implausible again. Thankfully his role is smaller than Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>Now, to the good parts. The film shines in its cinematography. Full justice to the locale ;-). Made Earth look as beautiful as it probably is from outer space. Then, the musical score. Truly outstanding. Considering space has no sound, full justice. Finally the special effects. Getting a film done to show zero gravity is tough. That seemed to happen effortlessly. 3D? Well, parts seem to need it but for most, it wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>And Sandra Bullock. Full credit to her. Looks like she's really worked on her role for a long time. Her performance is accomplished despite weak dialogues in parts.<br/><br/>One last thing. Sandra Bullock looks is the hottest thing in outer space since Sigourney Weaver in ""The Alien"" back in the late 80's. If nothing else, go and see the film for her."
"dfle3","8","0","2","24 October 2013"," The dark side of the moon...77.5%
","This is a highly unusual film to come out of America and be on mainstream release. It's pretty much what a bad day at the office would like for astronauts...and of course, it's pretty bleak. Hollywood 'names' George Clooney and Sandra Bullock star as astronauts orbiting Earth on a space shuttle. Disaster strikes. Who will live? Who will die? Will anyone survive?<br/><br/>Bullock looks very unglamorous in this movie...until she gets most of her gear off and then...man, is her next role as a world class athlete or gymnast or something? Don't tell me that she went all 'method' to play the part of an astronaut! Um, astronauts don't look so fit! Not sure if I actually saw her bum...could have sworn she had an anvil where her buttocks should be.<br/><br/>In favour of this movie is genuine tension as both the astronauts and their means of escape become endangered. I watched this in 3D and I actually blinked a few times as debris hurtled towards me. Bullock's character has the most fleshed out backstory (unlike her buttocks) which adds to the existential angst of the situation that they face and her will to survive.<br/><br/>One minor gripe I had about this film was during one scene where time is of the essence and Clooney's character is just very chatty with Bullock's character...despite mentioning to her the urgency of time. All the time he was talking to her and she wasn't actually heading where she should be going I kept thinking ""Seriously? Come on! MOVE IT!"".<br/><br/>There was an old scientific theory which posited that all of space was filled with ""aether"" (maybe last year I browsed a scientific magazine which had some speculative science that something akin to the concept may be revived...in ""Scientific American""? I don't remember) and I just mention this to note the heavy use of symbolism in this movie. The astronauts floating about in the aether look rather like foetuses floating in amniotic fluid with an umbilical cord. There is an even more marked (yet subtle) image of Sandra's character floating inside a space station in a foetal position. These kinds of images suggest that there is some kind of deeper parallel being made by the film. Can't say that I put my finger on what it was - if it does indeed exist - I did wonder if maybe this was some kind of origin story for humanity...implying that our species had its origins in outer space and came to colonise Earth...which is actually a current hypothesis in physics, I believe...people like Pr. Paul Davies, I think, believing that the 'seeds of life' are present everywhere across the universe and so life may form wherever there is fertile ground to land on.<br/><br/>But then again, maybe the symbolism in the movie is just nice imagery without such speculation going on. Must also note how excellent the simulation of weightlessness in this movie is...it looks real."
"jongleur","7","0","2","24 October 2013"," Wrong Stars
","Overall, I thought this was a pretty good movie, but I found myself far more engaged by the character portrayal and acting performance given by George Clooney as Matt Kowalski than I was by Sandra Bullock's performance as Ryan Stone. Some of this is due to some lame-brained thinking by the writers, the rest is Sandra's fault.<br/><br/>**Spoiler Follows** To start with, 'Ryan Stone' is unprepared for her mission. Back in my day, I was a member of an aircrew, and Emergency Procedures were drilled into us to the point where you could have wakened one of us from a sound sleep and we would have recited the right thing to do from rote, and when something really happened during a flight we didn't hesitate in our responses. Ryan questions, then delays acting on the clear instructions from Mission Control and from her team-mates aboard the Space Station. While one could quibble as to what the effects of those delayed actions might have in the way the emergency played out, no one who ever went thorough that sort of training would question that someone who exhibited the attitude that she did would have washed out in training, well before ever going aboard the ISS.<br/><br/>Beyond that, Sandra's performance was stiff and generally not conducive to encouraging me to feel sympathetic to her plight.<br/><br/>On the other hand, George Clooney as Matt Kowalski was great. If you listen to and watch old footage of the conversations between Mission Control and the astronauts that they had to deal with, Matt's/George's 'voice' rings true. The combination of relaxed professionalism, humor and 'the drawl' that so many of them learned, is perfectly captured by George Clooney, and I found it easy to fall into the belief that he had trained right alongside the likes of Chuck Yeager, Wally Schirra and John Glenn.<br/><br/>The technical effects were superb, I saw the film in 3D and the debris flying into my face made me flinch more than a few times. The spectacle of the Earth slowly gliding beneath the camera, along with the effort to convey the silence you'd encounter when atmosphere is absent also added to the atmosphere, making it easy for me to believe that I was right there with the action. <br/><br/>I was somewhat disappointed in the bad science that allowed them to move from station to station, pretty much completely violating all the laws of orbital physics, but I'll chalk that one up to artistic license. Without that license, the movie would have been nothing more than a rewrite of Tom Godwin's great SciFi short story ""The Cold Equations"". <br/><br/>**Spoiler Follows** My one thought as I left the theater was ""Really? You HAD to kill off the one character I believed in, and let the other live?"""
"dcoggins2","5","0","2","23 October 2013"," Visually impressive but very slow
","I can honestly say I've probably seen Cast Away with Tom Hanks over 5 times and loved each occasion. So I can definitely appreciate a slow film. Gravity will take you to the brink of slowness and leave you not enjoying it in the end. Sandra does an OK job and Clooney is an absentee pretty much but his parts were good. Gravity' focal point lies with a woman's struggle healing with the death of her daughter. The problem falls in the fact that her character development isn't there, you'll find yourself not really caring if she makes it or not. Possibly caused by the shortness of the film, but none the less no emotion is created from her character. Like what you feel in Slumdog Millionaire, emotional ties to every character. I'm just shocked to see how highly rated this film is on IMDb, considering I respect the ratings immensely. Sub par in my opinion"

","one thing for sure, this movie should take all the ""geeky"" awards of 2013. lets start by talking about the directing. Alfonso Cuar√≥n did an amazing job, i don't know what should i feel in space but i certainly felt it. the sound design was so accurate (there was no sound of the crashes but you only feel the bangs ). also the camera shots was so creative and interesting (there is a shot where the camera reaches slowly to Sandra Bullock's face until it gets through her helmet to her face in one shot !! genius)<br/><br/>the acting was excellent, Sandra Bullock carried out the whole movie and nailed it, an Oscar worthy performance. George Clooney, being as charming, added the ""fun"" factor to such an intense movie.<br/><br/>my only criticism would be that i didn't like George Clooney's end !! i didn't feel it nor buy it!! i kept waiting for him until the end to appear again and have a stronger role!! he had one important role which is save Sandra at the beginning but later on he gave up very quickly and very easily !! i think they could have made his death more dramatic and emotional. also, i felt that ""scientifically"" the movie was too easy. im no Astro-scientist but i can see where all the scientific criticism come from, it was too easy for such a catastrophic condition. the writing was very good from literature point of view but not the scientific point of view. for example, the scene where Sandra was talking to the Chinese man and his dogs and his baby, the scene was emotional and represented how much we need communication and interaction with others, any thing that would remind us of a normal happy life. but again !! how did she get a hold on this man !! and why was he playing with his baby while hes talking to her !!! or was she hallucinating !!! in Chinese !!<br/><br/>my favorite scene would be the scene where Sandra gave up on her life and reduced the oxygen level in order for her to die and started hallucinating about Cloony then snapped out of her surrendering mode and started surviving. it shows the real survival instinct in humans. how we cant give up easily on our lives no matter how much we hate it and have nothing to live for, and perhaps this is why i hated Cloony's end. he gave up easily.<br/><br/>survival stories are one of my favorite genre (The Shawshank Redemption, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, cast away...etc) but this movie did not make it to the list."

","At last, Hollywood gives us a very good space movie, since a long time ago. <br/><br/>I won't extend on the movie visuals, which almost every other review describe, I'll just say they are excellent and the changes of perspective that the cinematographer do (from the outside of the suit to the inside, from the astronaut view) are amazing, nothing short of masterful. The first long sequence at the beginning is also a technical marvel.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock delivers and carries the movie all by herself.<br/><br/>My problems with the movie, hence, 2 stars less, are more because I'm a space program lover, of USA and Russia, and know a lot about it. I know that a mission specialist (Bullock's character) does not receive any training on flying spaceships (let alone a Soyuz craft), that almost killed the story for me. And the physics, when Kowalsky releases himself from Stone, his relative velocity is zero, so Stone just had to pull him normally and he would not be lost in space. I know this two points are in the movie for the drama, but for me, it keeps it from being a total masterpiece. Cuaron's other sci-fi flick, Children of Men, it's a masterpiece and still his best movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I'm glad there's still people with the vision to do a movie like this, innovative and fresh, like in Hollywood glory days. Surely, Gravity stands apart from all the garbage films and forgettable summer blockbusters with mediocre and uncreative writing out there, a movie that has its name in history firmly assured.

","I wasn't very eager to see Gravity. Boredom was a guaranteed companion, coupled with the annoyance of donning the bulky plastic 3D glasses over my prescription ones did not sweeten the deal. Nevertheless, the film was playing at a near by theater and I had a free Sunday afternoon to spare.<br/><br/>I sat through the previews, both 3D and flat, with deflated enthusiasm and I braced myself for the onset of nausea promised by most of the reviews I read prior. I am happy to report that Gravity was a 90 minute nausea free affair for me. Since I suffer from frequent bouts of motion sickness and always get dizzy at planetariums, I am led to believe the nausea rumors were merely a Hollywood ploy in an attempt to authenticate the outer space experience of the movie. As a nausea expert, I find it hard to believe that Dr. Ryan could have performed her duties while disposed. Moreover, the lack of perspiration and heavy breathing are counter to my motion sickness experiences. With these first few scenes my conviction dimensioned even further.<br/><br/>I understand that gravity is a movie about outer space and in that respect the cosmic imagery is truly amazing. I was transported and thoroughly moved upon the site of George Clooney and Sandara Bullock aimlessly floating with earth in the background centered on the illuminated outlines of the Red Sea and river Nile as George asked, ""Where's home?"" (I'm from Egypt). There were a couple of head jerking moment successfully employing 3D gimmickry. Yet, had Gravity stayed true to it's original purpose as a movie about space, I wouldn't have deplored it as much. However the invisible intrusion of Hollywood is blatantly apparent with the film's feeble attempts to create a plot and characters that defy reason and stretch the realms of physical possibility.<br/><br/>I must say that the best thing about Gravity is it's brevity. I believe the film makers would have been better off in keeping the story simple about astronauts doing what astronauts do. So if you want to gaze into outer space, then by all means see Gravity (preferably in imax). If you are looking for adventure I believe you'd be better off with Prisoners or Captain Philips."

For this one, for me, they simply were not believable. The plot was predictable, the dialogue lame. I was vastly disappointed with the writing....even with Bollock's soliloquy moments, they just didn't ring true. They weren't believable. Nor was she. I kept waiting to be swept away, to be caught up in the whole drama, but it never happened. And I'm the type of person who lives in the movies I see. I become part of them. Not this one. Those of us who went to see this picture all came out with the same feeling. The visual effects were stunning. Fantastic. That part was not only gripping but frighteningly realistic. In fact, I'm sure there's an Oscar involved there. But not for Bollock or Clooney. In fact, if they are even nominated for this one, I'm going to think something's radically wrong with the whole process. Not that this is a bad movie, it isn't. Or that they were really bad. They just weren't...how to explain it? They weren't enough. They weren't sufficient for the idea, the moment. Just not as spectacular as I had expected or been led to believe.
