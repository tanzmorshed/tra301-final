"dottyjyoung","9","230","337","16 December 2011"," What a relief! The trailers lied--it was awesome. :)
","We just got back from the earliest showing we could get a sitter for. I can say with confidence that my fears about this movie were totally unfounded, and I now hold Guy Ritchie and these writers in the highest regard. Without going into spoilers, here are the three concerns that were put entirely to rest: 1) After seeing the trailer, my biggest worry was the use of ""bullet-time"" type photography during a Victorian-era movie. I thought it would be completely anachronistic and pointless. However, they'd already established in this movie and the previous one that Holmes is hyper-aware of his surroundings. The bullet-time was used to convey how traumatic a couple of scenes were to someone with that type of awareness, and it worked beautifully.<br/><br/>2) Jared Harris looked so vanilla and soft in the promo pics and trailers that I couldn't imagine him as a fearsome adversary for Holmes. However, his Moriarty is so devious and cunning, and at one time downright sadistic, that I don't think they could have made a better choice. A couple of times I felt like he was channeling his father (the outstanding Richard Harris) without the warmth and empathy that the late actor conveyed. Can you imagine Richard Harris as a cunning, calculating perfectionist that's totally devoid of concern for human life? You won't have to after watching his son. It's freaky. And he sings.<br/><br/>3) Holmes' relationship with Watson (and in a small way, Irene Adler) is fantastically developed. Saying any more than that would be too spoilery.<br/><br/>So, watching this w/ my husband(who is a die-hard Sherlock fan, and used to read Sherlock Holmes aloud to me every rainy night, complete w/ voices) was a fabulous experience. We can't wait to see it again, and own it."

","Professor Moriarty: Are you sure you want to play this game? Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.<br/><br/>In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, my mind turns two ways: The first half is guns, gunpowder, and gymnastics. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) contend with the salvation of civilization mostly through athletics, aided by director Guy Ritchie's considerable skill with the camera and graphics.<br/><br/>But in the second half, when the duo moves swiftly but intellectually to confront the arch villain Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), my mind is at equilibrium, renewing my love of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original brainy, eccentric sleuth. The chess game is a marvel of strategy, replete with revenge, intrigue, and just plain ingenuity. Director Guy Ritchie's visuals include delightful Downey disguises and lively speed ramping in a forest bombarded by bullets. Hans Zimmer's music leans heavily on the fiddle to lighten the load of a difficult plot.<br/><br/>Watson's marriage, rather than taking away from the bromance, adds unexpected color and creativity. So Ritchie has ramped up the intellectual content and at least balanced it with the athletic, which was a strength of his 2009 version, Sherlock Holmes. With Inspector Lastrade just a memory and Holmes's love, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), appearing briefly, we are left to enjoy not so much the interaction of Holmes and Watson but the explosiveness of Holmes and Moriarty.<br/><br/>After a first half of explosions, the second half satisfies traditionalists like me for the chess game of life and death—and that's the suspenseful fate of the world in those pieces. Director Guy Ritchie has improved on his 2009 version."
"remedy305","8","22","28","29 January 2012"," Sherlock at the movies
","Doesn't matter how you look at it, this movie is darn good fun. I loved it from opening credits to the close. So what if the acting is a bit over the top, so what if there are probably too many explosions and bullets and bombs. The end result is a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours at the movies with popcorn and Pearl and Dean ads. Moriarty is sufficiently creepy and played with restraint, Holmes is completely over the top but for me if its Robert Downey Jr there are no complaints. The story keeps moving and the action is terrific. The story is loosely based on the last book of the Conan Doyle's first series of Holmes stories ending with the famous Reisenbach Falls in Switzerland. It also gives a great image of early 20th century on the brink of the first world war. If you want to enjoy a good story with great imagery and costume then you will enjoy this, if you are looking for Sherlock ( wonderfully called Shirley by Mycroft ) as Conan Doyle intended then you may be disappointed."
"picklechann","9","272","446","16 December 2011"," Better than the first one
","This movie was absolutely fantastic. I have been waiting for it for what feels like forever now and it truly did not disappoint. The storyline was clever, the dynamic between Watson and Holmes was charming and beautiful, and the effects were incredible. Honestly, as much of a fan I am of the first movie, its sequel surpassed it and my overall expectation. Some the effects were unnecessary at times, but I really enjoy the style in which these movies are edited. It can be slightly confusing periodically, another reason to rewatch, still pay attention closely. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr.'s chemistry was compelling and the supporting actors were on par. I laughed, I nearly screamed, and I even cried. Game of Shadows is gripping, exciting, hilarious,and even draws tears. You'll be cheering throughout and satisfied with the end. Too be honest, it is absolutely one of the best movies of this year."
"aakinz","10","156","254","23 December 2011"," NO disappointment in this sequel
","Talking about sequels, more often than not, they are disappointment compared to the original. But this team has done again. They brought back the sequel with quality. I enjoyed this film as much as I did in the first part. The action, thrill, intelligence, all are placed perfectly in this film. The screenplay and making pattern is pretty much same as the first part and story moving in good pace. The main characters did a fantastic job once again. Holmes and Watson chemistry is perfect and delivered a great performance. Here I really like the way how the hero and villain play their games, both are very clever and the equality was very interesting. Simply, if you liked the first part, just go for this one. This is perfect entertainment and No disappointments."
"aaronjbong","8","117","188","24 December 2011"," Honeymoon in Brighton? Not today.
","So what's been happening lately?<br/><br/>There has been a series of bombings and assassinations across Europe and if these activities continue, war will erupt and Europe will become a field of casualties and devastation. And our favorite detective Sherlock Holmes suspects Professor James Moriarty as the mastermind behind all these events. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, amidst the bombings and destruction which are ravaging Europe, Sherlock Holmes's partner, Dr. John Watson is finally getting married with his fiancée Mary. After being engaged in the first film, they are finally getting married and a short funny wedding scene has been reserved in the film. They're even going for a honeymoon in Brighton. Or they were supposed to go for a honeymoon. <br/><br/>The train the couple boarded was filled with Moriarty's henchmen and a loud, explosive battle ensues eliminating any hopes of an upcoming honeymoon. Even though Watson had been planning to retire from adventuring with Holmes after his wedding, he reluctantly becomes Holmes's partner one more time while his wife is taken care of by Holmes's brother, Mycroft. And the duo will receive an additional member to form a trio: the mysterious gypsy Madam Simza. Together, they try to stop Moriarty from continuing his cruel schemes and Holmes learns about Moriarty's plan to start a war in which he will personally benefit from.<br/><br/>There are lots of action scenes that keep the film exciting and keep the film running in a constant, fast pace. The action sequences are louder, much more explosive, and much more energetic than the ones present in the predecessor. They are very loud, operatic, and exuberant. But some of the battle sequences are surprisingly quiet, such as a simple chess game held between Holmes and Moriarty. While you think a chess game would be boring, Guy Ritchie filmed it as if it was a grand battle. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the dialog adds another layer of tension and makes the chess game scene more atmospheric.<br/><br/>Not only the action scenes, but the humor here is outstanding. Most of the jokes and humor come from the titular character himself. His bizarre behavior, regardless of his intelligence add a layer of comedy to the film. His trademark hobby, disguising into several unexpected people is just purely entertaining. If it weren't for Robert Downey Jr., the humor here would have collapsed and become a disaster.<br/><br/>And of course, the acting and performances by the cast were brilliant and outstanding. Robert Downey Jr. is just brilliant in portraying the titular detective. He is admirable and he is really a man of talent. Don't worry, Jude Law also plays the role of Dr. John Watson perfectly. Together, they form an excellent chemistry. Also worth mentioning is Noomi Rapace as the mysterious gypsy Madam Simza, who not too long ago played the role of Lisbeth Salander in the original version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"". Stephen Fry plays the role of Mycroft Holmes to perfection.<br/><br/>I'd like to take some time discussing the character of Professor James Moriarty. He is a very compelling villain. His professional life as a criminal mastermind is hidden beneath his profession as a professor in the University of Cambridge. He is much more intelligent, much more cunning, and much deadlier than Lord Blackwood of the previous film. While Holmes seems to be a detective that can do no wrong in the previous film, here, he will make mistakes. Here, he will feel pain. Moriarty is just a very powerful villain and a very suitable opponent for Holmes. (And remember the slow-motion scenes where Holmes elaborates his fighting strategies in his mind, Moriarty can do it too.) And to further compliment this is the performance of Jared Harris. While he may not look suitable as an antagonist, he actually makes a perfect choice. <br/><br/>However, the film uses too much slow-mo effects. This is largely noticeable in one particular scene which has an extensive use of slow-motion. I know the effect is mainly used to make it look more stylish but there is certainly too much of them. Running at a duration of 129 minutes, it could have been shortened if some of the slow-mo effects have been removed. <br/><br/>Not only the slow-mo effects, but this film seems to have lost its trademark element of mystery that is present in the first film. Even though there are some mystery present here, they are not as mind- boggling as the ones present in the first film. In the first film, there are just so many questions that popped up and Holmes really has something to work on. But here, it's not mysterious. You know the full details immediately. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""A Game of Shadows"" is a pleasant experience and a whole lot more fun than the original film. Its operatic action scenes will entertain the audience and its comedic scenes will add a layer of laughter. With powerful performances from the cast, this film is one not to be missed in this movie season.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""A Game of Shadows"" is a stylish, fast-paced, yet comedic adventure which improves upon its predecessor in several aspects, and surely a highly recommended film.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 <br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review on ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"". I do hope this review is useful."
"jdkraus","9","143","246","16 December 2011"," A more action-packed Holmes
","""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow"" picks up where the prequel left off; Holmes is tracking down Professor Moriarty, a man he believes is responsible for a series of bombings and mysterious deaths around world. With the help of his pal Watson (off to be married soon), and a gang of gypsies, which includes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Noomi Rapace, set out on a game of cat-and-mouse to find the schemes of the sinister Professor.<br/><br/>Though there is an element of mystery in this film, it is not as in-depth as the first film. Rather the focus is on the action sequences and clever humor. This is not necessarily a bad thing though; in fact it helps move the plot along. The first film suffered because the story was slow. In this Holmes though, there is not one second that drags. The story itself is not special, but its pace is what counts. Walking out of the theater, I felt refreshed and glad that I saw this movie. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are once again a true treat to watch as Holmes and Watson. Their chemistry and interactions are perfect; it's easy to tell that both had fun with the script and with each other. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty gives a solid performance, as a cold, manipulative, power hungry villain. Unlike Mark Strong in the first film, he is a believable antagonist. Noomi Rapace is a nice flavor as Madam Sim. <br/><br/>The set and costume designs are exquisite, bringing to life of what Europe was like in the late 1800s. I smell Oscar for these departments. The sound and editing is crisply done, and the music is top-notched—Hans, you're truly the best. The visual effects are mostly good, but some scenes were a bit over the top and borderline ridiculous. One of many examples include a woman being thrown from a fast moving train into a river, without sustaining injury or even dying. This is impossible. Then again, it's Hollywood. The filmmakers aren't doing their job if a sense of the ridiculous is not thrown into an action flick from time to time. <br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow"" delivers as a great, action-packed, and a rather humorous, popcorn loving flick. Note: the dog dies again."
"aharmas","5","80","140","18 December 2011"," Style vs Substance
","Guy Ritchie has proved himself quite a stylish director. He has given us ""Rock'n'Rolla"" and the first of the Sherlock series before. Somehow, he has lost control of the material recently, and this is most obvious in the latest entry Holmes entry.<br/><br/>The film is a visual stunner, easily with ""The Tree of Life"" and ""HP VII/ Part II"", one of the best looking movies ever filmed. This film truly transports us back to the early days of the XX Century and makes us feel like we are really in the middle of the very polluted capitals of Europe, the exquisite photography immersing us in the world of shadows which was part of that society day and night. The film allows us to almost feel the torture of the upholstery, the lush velvet of the costumes, and the sumptuous decadence of the wealthy classes. Every aspect of the art direction should be recognized as the best of the best, and I wish the story would be allowed to reach those levels.<br/><br/>Doyle's Holmes and Watson are truly two of the most intelligent and fascinating characters in literature; as a pair, they might have no match, and Moriarty is the perfect villain, but the way these films treat the development of the story and the characters themselves is a shame, for Ritchie prefers to have slow motion takes to show bullets or flash editing to detract from the impact of a good action scene. He does redeem himself twice in the scenes with Moriarty and Holmes, but that is what makes the whole two hours truly frustrating because one yearns for more of what could have made the films great, and we get a lot of beautiful shots of violence and mayhem, but little of what truly matters.<br/><br/>This film takes us through the philosophical studies of what man's self destructive nature, and how evil geniuses profit from man's tragic disposition. As I mentioned before because of the film's truncated style, it is hard to truly appreciate the battle of the minds. It is a cat and mouse chase through some lovely scenery and it ends with the ultimate solution, the final solution, a chess move so diabolical, the audiences gasp, and in what could have an amazing cliffhanger, with a true open end, or not, depending on how carefully you have reviewed the clues along the way, Ritchie goes the easy away. Can we hear the audience papers results being read? Downey and Law do very well. Rapace is truly wasted, and it is hard to believe she gave the best performance of the year in 2010. In this film, we are in for easy laughs, little is explained as to why Holmes want to blend into the background or dress as a cheap slut. His mind is best asset but you couldn't tell from this film. You'll have a better time reading the short stories or checking out the old films. Now that would make sense."
"micksutton-1","2","104","186","28 December 2011"," Very Disappointing
","I lapped up Arthur Conan Doyle's works in my younger years and had recently begun re- reading them. However that is not to say that I am a Sherlock purist, far from it. I thoroughly enjoyed the BBC's recent take on Sherlock and am anxiously awaiting the beginning of the new series. Much the same can be said for Guy Ritchie's first exploit. I rated it as the best film of that year, enjoying the mix of the occult, to the back beat of Victorian London. Mark Strong portrayed a master villain who death and unease followed. There was then the balancing act that was Holmes and Watson. Jude Laws character being more than a blundering side kick and in some ways equal to Robert Downey Junior's Holmes. <br/><br/>Fast forward to two years later to this afternoon when I sat down in the cinema to watch A Game Of Shadows, full of hope, awaiting two hours of sterling entertainment, sadly I left somewhat disappointed to say the least.<br/><br/>All the negative reviews that I have read so far echo what I am about to write. If you are a small child looking for a film with multiple explosions and slow motion ""bullet time"" effects then you are in luck. However, if you are looking for a sequel that continues in the vein of the first film, regarding the worlds foremost detective, then you, like me, will be sadly disappointed. Gone is the ingenious Holmes analytical deduction, with a rich multi layered plot, only to be replaced with overly long fights sequences, more akin to Steven Seagal or John Claude Van Damme. The irony being that I am a keen martial artist and I was extremely impressed with the sequences in the first film. However, in the first film they were used sparingly, adding to the characters arsenal of brains and brawn, thus keeping the integrity of the film intact. Unfortunately this is not the case in this sequel. Holmes relying more upon his fighting prowess, as opposed to the art of deduction. <br/><br/>Characters on the periphery of the plot, such as Simza's Anarchist brother and the Anarchist leader are not seized upon and examined, leaving a thin plot, anorexic. But leads the way for a special effects 'fest' following our heroes through the forest, pursued by Moriaty's forces. <br/><br/>The only scene I did enjoy was the 'mano-a-mano' scene between Holmes and Moriarty towards the conclusion, however at the same time I found this frustrating as it was an insight into what A Game Of Shadows could (should.!) have been.<br/><br/>From the opening credits it was clear that this was going to be darker than its predecessor, especially when one the previous main characters is killed off. Although I liked the character, I was impressed by the bold move of the writers and was waiting for the emerging of a bold new character in Noomi Rapace's Simza. Unfortunately Simza is a one-dimensional character, who was easily forgotten and need not have even been there, save for the penultimate 'brother' scene in the film. <br/><br/>In Sherlock Holmes, Mark Strong gave a stellar performance as Lord Blackwood, the lead villain. However the seedling of Moriaty's character was always in the background, in some ways waiting to eclipse Blackwood as the ""villain of all villains"". Unfortunately Jared Harris's Moriaty fails to deliver on all counts. There is no presence and no conviction. A poor choice, with poor delivery. Another irony being the Mark Strong would have been one of the ideal candidates to play the character of Moriarty.<br/><br/>The domestic relationship between Holmes and Watson added to the charm of the first instalment and in my opinion Jude Law elevated Watson's character, however in this sequel, as some have already commented, it is bordering on homo erotic and as such the definition of the characters is lost. Doyle's original creation was fond of donning disguises to aid him in his investigations, however this is 'dialled up to eleven"" in the sequel, resulting in the cringe worthy 'seat' disguise at the conclusion of the film.<br/><br/>All in all an extremely disappointing sequel to one of the best films I have seen in the last five years."
"DonFishies","8","114","206","15 December 2011"," Entertaining and a lot more fun than the original outing
","As much as I loved the character interactions and insane chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, I was very much let down by Sherlock Holmes when I first saw it a few years ago. It was a really stylish and well-made film, but the storyline bored me to tears. I came in incredibly excited to see it, and left wishing it had ended sooner. With the obvious sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows upon us, I figured I would go in with much lower expectations and brace for something along the same lines.<br/><br/>Europe is at the brink of war, with many little seemingly unconnected events occurring across the nations. Sherlock Holmes (Downey Jr.) believes it to be the work of the brilliant Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris). He enlists the help of his sidekick, Watson (Law), to help him uncover the truth, before it is too late.<br/><br/>With less of a focus on the occult, a stronger plot and a significantly more interesting villain, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows outdoes its predecessor in many respects. It ups the thrills and the action, continues the fun, and delivers one of the better sequel going experiences this year.<br/><br/>Even though the story is a bit wonky in certain respects (more on that in a moment), I feel A Game of Shadows manages to feel a lot more grounded than the original. There is a clear storyline, and an even clearer path of where the film wants to go. It stalls here and there, as I imagined it would, but it never lingers like the original did. The art direction is just as incredible as it was, and the special effects seem to have been improved greatly. Where the first film flopped around, this film picks up the slack. <br/><br/>While Downey Jr. and Law are just as impeccable and well matched as they were the first time round, the film benefits greatly from the addition of Harris as Moriarty. The character's presence was felt throughout the first film, but the film noticeable lost its edge by simply referring to him in passing and hinting at what a sequel could have had in store. Bringing him into the fold, he immediately is tenfold better than Mark Strong ever could have hoped to be. Watching Harris match wits with Downey is simply astounding, and makes for the most wildly enjoyable parts of the film. There is never a dull moment when he is around, and instead of making the film drone on, he invigorates it with an immense amount of energy. Harris knows exactly how to look deceptive, even with a wide grin and dialogue that does not even hint at ulterior motives. His looks are downright terrifying in a lot of instances. This is his first major film role, and I can only hope filmmakers continue using his dastardly skills for antiheroes and villains alike. <br/><br/>I think the film's biggest hurtle, and the one that hurts it the most, is that there are simply too many characters and too many of them did not need to appear in the first place. Rapace's character is nothing more than a plot device, used to connect certain sections together and forgotten almost entirely all too often. The practically blink-and-you- will-miss them moments for Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan feel more like Richie peddling to the fans, as opposed to actually serving a real point to the film. It is fun seeing them show up again, but considering they have little to no effect on the plot, they could have easily just never showed up at all. But the far worst offender of not serving any purpose is Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes. He brings a ridiculous amount of humour to the film, and he is a welcome addition on the onset. But as the film progresses, it becomes clear he is merely there simply to make the film even more ludicrous and silly than Downey Jr. makes it. When the inevitable third film drops, I hope they actually use him effectively, instead of making his appearance feel like a mere tease.<br/><br/>What also hurts the film is Richie's incessant need to use slow motion in every action sequence. While it works insanely and surprisingly well for the film's centrepiece involving a foot chase through a forest, it feels like overkill in almost every other instance. We understand from the first film that Holmes likes to evaluate the moves of both his adversaries and himself before he makes them, but watching him plot it out helps drag the film out longer than it needs to be. It is fun and worthwhile when it is used sparingly, or used to draw attention to something specific. But when Richie is one-upping Zack Snyder in the worst possible way, it begs the question of whether he learned any mistakes from the first film or not. At just under 130 minutes, I feel like a good fifteen minutes of slow motion could have been sped up, and would have looked just as great. Hell, Richie potentially could have shown off a bit of his own style too, instead of just what he cribbed from everyone else.<br/><br/>While the film still has its problems, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is an enjoyable ride from start to finish. It maintained my interest, where the first film had me counting the excruciating minutes before it would end. Richie still has a lot to learn about as a filmmaker (and even more as a man who creates his own style instead of Tarantino-ing from others), he does know how to make a crafty film. Now if he can stop hinting at future installments and just give us a film that sticks to being about the story at hand, then maybe we might just get the perfect rendition of this legendary detective.<br/><br/>8/10."
"edrogers-272-34286","3","76","137","22 January 2012"," Typically ruined by Hollywood
","I will say all the good things first, then I can rant. This film was visually stunning. It was also pretty well acted especially by Jude Law, although he is obviously too young to be Watson. Robert Downey Jr. is also pretty good and his natural charm makes me want to like his character. I also quite enjoyed Stephen Fry's part as Mycroft, it was a nice surprise. I'm a little dubious about the casting of Moriarty, but he wasn't awful I guess. In fact I feel that the same actors with a different director and script would have made this film top-class.<br/><br/>OK now the bad bits. It is trying to be FAR too cool for it's own good. And you know what happens when people try to be cool - they come off as posers and losers. I'm all for a bit of action, and yet this film just ruins Holmes by making him a martial artist, super slow mo, extra cool, thug. Holmes could box and he was a cane fighter. Why not just put that in??? It would have been great.<br/><br/>Another major gripe is the complete lack of any real deduction, questioning or intelligence. I know, let's just make him dress in about 4 different silly outfits and every now and then he can jump to some conclusions! Then the final nail in the coffin was the over-the-top story which reminded me of the absurdity of 'the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. I'm all for suspending belief in a plot line, but there is a limit and I reached it about half way through this film.<br/><br/>If you want a decent modern take on Sherlock Holmes I highly recommend 'Sherlock' the BBC series. The setting is modern, but the acting and characterisation are just the right temperament to transcend the classic stories into a modern setting. It depends how much of a Holmes puritan you are! For many, Jeremy Brett IS Holmes simple as that."
"a-ozornin","6","31","51","5 January 2012"," The sequel that forgot about what made the original so good
","This is the second installment of the Sherlock Holmes franchise starring Robert Downey Jr. as the great detective. The first installment, which I saw exactly two years ago, was very impressing. That was a completely new take on Sir Conan Doyle's never dying detective story, full of style, fascinating action, humorous dialogs and amazing soundtrack. Robert Downey Jr. reinvented Sherlock; his Holmes is arrogant, sociopath but nevertheless absolutely lovable. The movie was peppered with something called ""flash-forward"" – which is how Sherlock planned his fights. Overall, the movie was easy to watch, the storyline kept attention and visually it was very organic. <br/><br/>No doubt,after the success of the first part producers had to start working on the sequel. Lucky for them, the arch-enemy was mentioned only briefly and hence there was the storyline left unexplored. Clearly, there was pressure to deliver the same kind of Holmes, but more of it. And this is where, I think, the whole myth broke down. <br/><br/>In the race to give us more action and more humorous dialogs, something essential to the good detective story was lost – consistent and interesting storyline. I cannot even consider the Game of Shadows as detective story – it is not classical whodunit, the thrill is added absolutely unnaturally, there are a lot of logical holes in the plot (spoiler alert. The red book story was a shame. Do they really think that criminal mastermind checks his balances once a month?). Guy Ritchie forgot about the storyline and instead started to play with camera and decided to add some new, bigger guns, more action, more fights. Holmes' deduction is not capable of stopping bullets, and hence he looks like an outright loser, outdated but smart man. <br/><br/>Because of this underlying flaw, the first part of the movie is outright boring. We know whodunit, and we absolutely don't care what he is going to do next. The pale try to add some drama to the story makes it all look even feebler because of the main characters. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. don't look natural – they look like two clowns from Chaplin-era movies, trying to play out some ""funny"" dialogs.(spoiler alert. The whole story about Ms. Adler is weird. I know they wanted to show how smart and cruel Moriarty is. But there are hundreds of ways to do so without needlessly killing lovable character on the 10th minute of the show. Holmes' reaction was weird too. Throw away the handkerchief? And that's it? Ms. Adler looked like child unloved by screenwriters.) The jokes keep repeating themselves; it is difficult to believe in the drama part – the whole plot fails to keep attention. <br/><br/>The second part is more interesting, mainly because authors decided to insert some action. I have to say – the episode in the woods is amazing. That was the moment when I recognized old stylish Sherlock Holmes from the first part – dynamic, breathtaking and spectacular. It was the moment that was worth waiting for an hour. After that movie gains some pace – but the battle for the hearts is lost already. The movie looks more like high profile video to the music of Hans Zimmer, falling apart into disconnected pieces if you start to look at it closer. Apart from chase in the woods scene, there were few great moments. I would like to draw your attention to Stephen Fry's Mycroft and his servant. They managed to fill the movie with festive attitude that attracted people to the first part and so obviously absent from the second part, but other than that <br/><br/>VERDICT: In the race to give people more of Sherlock Holmes, authors decided to play a bit more serious and lost. Storyline does not hold attention and is not logically flawless. Dialogues are not particularly funny, characters do not surprise and amaze as they did in the first part. WATCH if you have seen the first part many times and want a bit more. Also you may want to watch the Game of Shadows just for the sake of Mr. Fry's performance and the scene of chase in woods.<br/><br/>P.S. The movie looks even worse if you compare it with Sherlock played by Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC's Sherlock series, but that is the story for the next time<br/><br/>m-picturegoer.blogspot.com/"

How Kelly Reilly kept her composure I have no idea, but I would expect it was easy to look away.<br/><br/>The best part for me was the verbal war of wits between Moriarty and Holmes especially.Clever writing and acting.

Noomi Rapace is The biggest blunder. She was great in The Swedish Girl Who... Trilogy, but here no. She is weak, pale, blunt, shallow and gray. The only part we remember of her? Her eating some food near The Eiffel Tower. Pity that there is no so much Rachel McAdamas this time, she was great then and good here What else can I say? The movie is well cut and shot, it is dark and ominous, as intended, and some scenes are pure Matrix-quality. But then, there are so many goofs and funny anachronisms that make the whole movie a bit unserious. My opinion? it was OK, and fun. A bit too prolonged at times."

","I went to this movie with high hopes. As it turns out, this movie was nothing more than pure drivel. It was simply drivel. Everybody says that this was the best of the two movies but I found myself frequently looking at my watch! Professor James Moriarty was very much a bore. When he was hidden in the room and talking from behind a curtain, Professor James Moriarty was a hopeful as an evil doer. Then he pulls the curtain back and he's simply a professor. I was hoping that he would at least have a scar or something. But there is nothing sinister about Professor James Moriarty. Now let's talk about Sherlock. For whatever reason, he is unable to be defeated in any kind of a fight. He has a ""disorder"" in which he can predict the outcome by observing things. Professor James Moriarty was just smart and good at chess. But Sherlock has this weird sense of humor in which he feels compelled to crack a joke every time he opens his pipe filled mouth. He even jokes around between punches in a fight. When he talks to Dr. Watson he jokes around and poor Watson is a cheap imitation of the strait man from the Three Stooges. Yes, you read that right - he's a strait man. As for Professor James Moriarty and his plot to take over the world by killing somebody in the mansion overlooking the water fall in the mountain, I have no idea. This plot was far to complicated. As let's not even talk about the gypsy people and their role. Oh, and what is the deal with how Sherlock blow coffee beans into that large brute's eye? Can you say RANDOM? Anyway, Professor James Moriarty is nowhere near as evil as I was hoping. I give this movie TWO PIPES DOWN!"
"ma-cortes","7","12","19","22 September 2013"," Amusing and funny sequel in which Holmes and Watson take on the greatest villain , Doctor Moriarty
","Enjoyable second part as good and amusing as the first . Lavish production packed with action , intrigue , suspense and amusement . It's a nice film inspired on splendid novels about Sherlock Holmes character written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , including a first-range nasty with malignant aims incarnated by the Napoleon of Crime Doctor Moriarty . This time , Sherlock Holmes , Robert Downey Jr , his sidekick Dr. Watson , Jude Law , and a gypsy named Simza , Noomi Rapace , with the help of Holmes' older brother Mycroft Holmes , Stephen Fry , all of them join forces to outwit and bring down their fiercest adversary, Professor Moriarty . Furthermore , one woman , Irene Adler , again played by Rachel McAdams , as a suspicious young with mysterious purports . Together, the team find themselves involved in a risked international conspiracy in which the fate of all of Europe hangs in the balance .<br/><br/>In the flick appears the usual of the Arthur Conan Doyle's novels : Dr.Moriarty , Mistress Hudson performed by Geraldine James , Inspector Lestrade acted by Eddie Marsan, and of course Doctor Watson , the perfect counterpart to Holmes . Holmes along Watson will solve unanswered mysteries and Sherlock undergoes some risked experiences to resolve the cases using even his habitual disguise . It's a nice Holmes film with gripping London and sensational setting . A genuine ripping yarn very intriguing and entertaining . The movie blends suspense , thriller , detective action , cloak and dagger , mystery and is pretty interesting . It packs an exciting amount of surprises with great lots of fun . This is a classy and effective romp with a strongly casting . Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation is magnificent , he's a Sherlock for modern times , of course very different to Basil Rathbone considered the best Holmes in the cinema , along with Peter Cushing and Jeremy Brett in television. Robert Downey as Holmes plays in a clever , broody and impetuous manner , as whimsical detective is top notch , he's in cracking form acting as a two-fisted fighter . He makes an unique perspective on his life revealing a complex personality . He's finely matched in battle of wits with Doctor Moriarty/Jared Harris , though Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Penn and Javier Bardem were considered to play Moriarty . The star Downey/Holmes has a splendid fight towards the beginning , middle and end , plus he tries to battle against his arch-enemy Moriarty but with an amazing final surprise . Although Basil Rathbone will be forever identified as Holmes , however Sherlock is also played by Robert Downey as an intelligent , cunning , broody and impetuous sleuth . Dr. Watson here isn't a bumbling and botcher pal generally represented by Nigel Bruce but an clever and astute partner perfectly incarnated by Jude Law . <br/><br/>The movie is inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle novels , taking parts here and there , as it is primarily based on the short story ""The Final Problem"" , but also shows aspects from other Sherlock Holmes stories: ""The Sign of Four"" ; ""The Greek Interpreter"" ; ""Valley of Fear"" ; ""The Speckled Band""; ""The Dying Detective""; ""Bruce Partington Plans""; and ""The Second Stain"" and when Sherlock defeats Moriarty by pulling him over Reichenbach Falls, with both of them falling to their apparent deaths; being based on the story ""The Final Problem"" in which Holmes defeats Moriarty in the same way, by falling over a waterfall to the apparent death of both. The film has a colorful atmosphere , it's in glowing images with lights and shades that originate strange setting . Set design is of first rate , the movie is very atmospheric , the crowed streets , shady and dirty slums of London , trains , buildings are very well designed but with excessive use of computer generator images . Screenwriter Michael Johnson provides the original plot , creating the basis for this particularly storyline . The film boasts a beautifully cinematography by Philippe Rousselot and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer , both of whom also worked in the former part . This big budgeted production by Joel Silver sparkles with polish and wit and the ending is as exciting as moving and being well directed by Guy Ritchie . Due to Warner Bros.' fast-tracking of this sequel, director Guy Ritchie was forced to drop out of Lobo, while Robert Downey Jr. was forced to drop out of Cowboys & Aliens."

","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) is investigating terrorist attacks in London alone since his old partner Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) will get married a few days later with Mary (Kelly Reilly). His investigations point to Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) as the responsible for the explosions.<br/><br/>When Dr. Watson and Mary are attacked in the train while traveling for their honeymoon in Brighton, Sherlock Holmes delivers Mary to the protection of his brother Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry). Sooner Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson disclose that Professor Moriarty has bought arms and ammunition factories and is trying to start a war in Europe killing political leaders and politicians. Now Sherlock and Watson have to stop Moriarty and his dangerous associate, the skilled former Colonel Sebastian Moran (Paul Anderson) to avoid the imminent war. <br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a boring, dull and overrated film by Guy Ritchie. The story is silly and annoying, and Sherlock Holmes prefers to play chess with Professor Moriarty instead of eliminating him while people are murdered in his terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>The scenes of Mycroft Holmes coming naked to talk to Mary Watson and Sherlock Holmes dancing with Dr. Watson are among the most ridiculous ones that I have recently seen. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Sherlock Holmes: O Jogo de Sombras"" (""Sherlock Holmes: The Game of Shadows"")"
"gary-444","5","41","82","24 December 2011"," A Shadow of What It Should Have Been
","I thoroughly enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes and approached this sequel with optimistic anticipation- only to be very disappointed. A budget that had doubled, multiple locations, and the confidence of a well received first instalment should have proved a solid platform for further success. Sadly, Director Guy Ritchie lost his way.<br/><br/>As a pairing, Holmes, played by Robert Downey Jnr ,and Watson, by Jude Law, worked first time around. This time , Jude Law saves the pairing from disaster. I can run with Holmes as a cocaine snorting eccentric, but his eccentricities are so overwrought in this outing that his credibility as a formidable intelligence becomes unconvincing. Although I am happy to see historic capabilities rewritten and reinterpreted, his ability and acumen at street-fighting place an emphasis on the visceral, rather than cerebral which takes the character, for my tastes, far too close to Jean Claude Van Damme and Vin Diesel territory. Those thoughtful deductive powers eschewed in favour of occasional machine-gun analysis.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams role is reduced to a bit part, and is a peripheral figure. Noomi Rapace instead supplies the glamour in a tentative performance as Gypsy Madam Heron which doesn't convince. The Villain, Prof Moriarty, is played , uneasily, by Jared Harris whose visual likeness to Richard Stilgoe does not help the cause. Yet all is not lost. Stephen fry is excellent as Sherlock's brother, Geraldine James has pitifully little screen time as housekeeper Mrs Hudson yet delights whenever she appears, and Kelly Reilly does well in an underwritten role as Dr Watson's new wife.<br/><br/>The plot is a noisy mess, and is largely threadbare. Swooping camera shots, fast editing and slow motion have their place but quickly the action becomes all, and the law of diminishing returns quickly comes into play. Which is a shame, because when Ritchie gets it right, it can be very good. This time an escape from an arms and munitions works shines as an ever escalating armoury of weapons is employed against them. Indeed it is such a good scene that the final reel, an attempted assassination, becomes an anti-climax.<br/><br/>In summary, the familiar Director's curse of too much money, too weak a script/story, and indiscipline, with no-one around to say ""Guy, No!,"" strikes, which is a shame. Ritchie can write good, funny dialogue (see ""Lock Stock, etc"")but it is not much in evidence here, he can also handle a good action scene (the dry dock fight in the first film). But here he tries to reinvent the Holmes legend again, but only succeeds in losing the good bits and failing to improve with what he attempts in its place."
"ferguson-6","7","39","78","16 December 2011"," Careful what you Fish for
","Greetings again from the darkness. Normally if a sequel shows up a mere two years after the original, we would have good reason for low expectations. However, director Guy Ritchie is back and just as importantly, Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law reprise their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Sticking to the successful template provided by the original, the team delivers one that is sure to keep the fans happy.<br/><br/>The reason so many Sir Arthur Conan Doyle loyalists dismissed the first film is that the frenetic pace and towering action sequences seem to go against what made the original stories so great. So what does Mr. Ritchie do? He goes BIGGER and FASTER! There are three extended action sequences that are mind-boggling to watch. They work because the plot is so elementary, my dear. Professor Moriarty is out to cause a war from which he can personally profit. His plan involves guns, bombs and assassinations. Only our heroes can possibly stop him.<br/><br/>Much of the odd-ball bromance from the first movie has been toned down here, and we get not only the return of Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), Watson's wife (Kelly Reilly), but also the introduction of third female character - a gypsy fortune teller, Madame Simza (played by the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Noomi Rapace). Of course, McAdams character doesn't last long, Reilly gets tossed from a moving train, and Rapace is given only a few running scenes. There may be more women, but this is still a man's world.<br/><br/>The vision for this franchise is an updated version that encourages discovery of Holmes by a new generation. And while Downey is excellent, it's difficult not to notice the similarities to Captain Jack Sparrow. Also, Professor Moriarty is very much a Bond-type villain. None of that matters too much as the rapid-fire dialogue between Holmes and Watson, and the crackling chemistry between Downey and Law, make this a fun time at a huge holiday movie.<br/><br/>It seems odd that the release date for this one is so close to that of the new Mission:Impossible, but they both deliver what the fans want and hopefully find their audience. Even if you aren't a fan, the fabulous sets and various world filming locations will keep you interested, even as you dodge giant explosions."

","This Hollywood movie is a disgrace to the intelligent, wise, intuitive detective ""Sherlock Holmes"" character. Instead of being focused on his detective skills, it focuses on special effects and violence so much that his character and the shallow plot are minimized. Therefore, if you enjoy Hollywood movies with special effects and violence more than plot, then I recommend it. However, if that is what you want, then why see ""Sherlock Holmes""? There are hundreds of movies with that emphasis, and with even better special effects. If you enjoy a good Sherlock Holmes detective film with an engaging, suspenseful plot, then you will be tremendously disappointed!"

","Bad movies are inevitable. Some can be loved for camp quality, others endured or even forgiven due to accidental missteps. But this title cannot be forgiven as its sins are, apparently, intentional.<br/><br/>The over-the-top optics and emphasis of action over narrative or character led me to ask whether I was watching Sherlock Holmes or Spider Man. Whatever happened to good old storytelling? Is this what iPhone and Google have wrought?<br/><br/>In full disclosure: I'm a traditionalist. It's hard for me to imagine a more faithful version than Granada's Jeremy Brett. I can't believe the only way for ""modern"" audiences to know Conan Doyle's detective is a Victorian veneer and visual vomit. At least BBC's latest incarnation with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman preserves author's intent but is placed in a contemporary setting. It doesn't mock the originals.<br/><br/>There are a few bright spots - thanks chiefly to Jude Law, Jared Harris, and Stephen Fry. The rest of the troupe could benefit from a Stanislavski house call.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a superhero film, this site will give you plenty of excellent titles to choose from (i.e. ""The Dark Knight""). Otherwise, just watch the Brett series on DVD. Lastly, If anyone reading this is a doctor, kindly prescribe Mr. Ritchie a strong dose of Adderall before he strikes again."

","This movie was the most disappointing movie I have seen in recent memory. Not because it was horrible, it wasn't. Rather because the first movie was one my favorite movies of the last decade. I loved the occult/mystery angle, Mark Strong's absolutely delicious turn as the arch-villain, Rachel McAdams turn as the decidedly sexy and ambivalent heroine/villainess, Robert Downey's descent in drug induced madness to catch the villain, the Holmes/Watson dysfunctional co-dependency, it all worked wonderfully and was incredibly fresh in my opinion. This movie had none of that. It was, rather, a steampunk version of a James Bond movie. Holmes' analytical violence was rendered silly as he is now endowed with such superhuman strength and speed as there really was no point to thinking about his opponents moves. Rachel McAdams makes only a cameo, and is replaced Noomi Rapace's character who seems to be their only to check off a box regarding a female demographic. The latent Holmes/Watson homoeroticism is cranked up to ten. There is no mystery angle, as Jared Harris' Moriarty is reduced to a SPECTRE conspiracy mastermind. I literally found myself nodding off around the 1:45 mark. If you're up for a steampunk James Bond movie, I guess this is OK.

Firstly Both Sherlock and Mycroft are reduced to being clowns at times in the hope of funny lines which just fall flat.The movie is just a buddy cop movie from 1800s and not even a great one at that!Watson played by the directors buddy curiously seems to have more to do than Shelly(yes,that's what his brother Mycroft calls him in the movie!)himself. Whats wrong with British Directors and their obsession with homosexuality! Here there are numerous double entendres and references to gay time with Holmes and Watson! A particularly ugly scene is one where Watson falls between Holmes's legs and they banter!Holmes doesn't wear masks but looks more like a Tranny with his ladies attire with lipstick all over his face.Sadly all these don't even raise a smile which I could have accepted if that was the reason behind everything.The idea that Holmes was a cerebral sleuth is long left behind with the director Guy Ritchie's obsession of slow-motion action scenes. The point is Guy Ritchie had one of the best characters, scripts,etc and didn't need to reduce it to just plain rubbish British crime caper.If the names weren't Sherlock Holmes and Watson, I could have accepted it as a pretty ordinary buddy action movie with some good scenes.This is pathetic!"

This time, they are facing Professor Moriarty. What the movie is really about is hard to say, however, as the script was so weak, it kept getting lost in the line of fiery explosions, effects and Downey Jr. in drag.<br/><br/>Were the special effects good? Sure...but we saw similar ones in the first one which were not really improved upon, and the fact that there was more story, less effects last time made them all the more impressive. This time around, you are beaten over the head with them and left wondering what they were trying to get across in the first place.<br/><br/>Yes, Holmes has a misfire. With Downey's acting wasted on a second-rate script (if you could call it that), the two-year wait for this dismal sequel was a waste.

But put them all together and you have one of the worst movies ever made.

","Sometimes one watches a movie and weeps because the story is so strong and compelling that it evokes a cathartic experience. And then there are movies that cause the eyelids to grow heavy and the mind to wander off to slumber land. This movie is in the latter category. Sherlock Holmes is not a cartoon character, yet this movie not only transforms Mr. Holmes into a cartoon character, he is a cross between Daffy Duck and James Bond. Not surprisingly, the movie provokes some unintended (or maybe intended) laughter, but with a ridiculous story that brings new meaning to the word contrived, there is little that can save this movie from DVD land where it belongs. Robert Downey and Jude Law give it a try, but their efforts are for naught. Sometimees the current is just too strong. The story is simply too implausible and the special effects too gratuitous.

","I would guess that Sherlock is one of the characters that would interest the more intelligent film enthusiast. I also have seen the much more intelligent written series from the BBC(of which I am awaiting the next season), and they clearly mist it by a big one with this poor excuse of a Sherlock Holmes. <br/><br/>Aside to this, I think it's quite annoying to see a film that has not done it's research properly. For instance: The time in what this movie plays is around 1891, the luger pistol that they use wasn't invented until 1897. Germany wasn't really there yet as we see them talking about the whole time. The side that was near the border with France was Prussia. There is a moment they talk about coloured contact lenses, These did exist but covered your complete eye. Not very hard to detect I guess.<br/><br/>And how the hell can they shoot with artillery on them, when there is no one giving the coordinates?

Apart from Jared Harris the acting was universally atrocious. Even the normally reliable Robert Downey Jr was bad. For once I agree with the newspaper reviews. This was definitely NOT Sherlock Holmes. The relationship between Holmes and Watson was played mainly for laughs and was strained to breaking point. If you're going to make a film a Holmes you should make sure the characters are true to the original source. Conan Doyle's Holmes and Watson were three-dimensional characters, so much so that some Americans think they were actually real people - the characters in this film were one-dimensional at best. The set pieces were overlong and boring. I was so bored I actually fell asleep for a few minutes (the only other film I fell asleep in was Attack of the Clones). If you want to watch a much more thoughtful and superior version try watching the second series of the BBCs Sherlock (which covers some of the same ground).

In fact, for this one I had high hopes especially since we were finally dealing with Moriarty.<br/><br/>This film severely disappointed me. The story was disjointed, and there was no clear direction of that story until the very end. They used their iconic cinematography, wild action scenes, and silly humour to carry the film nowhere to the point that both my friend and I were actually bored of it. And that, unfortunately killed the ending for us during which we did not care at all for the characters nor for what kind of ending the film carried. I never read any original Sherlock stories, but I found that Robert's portrayal, though well acted, was excessively ""OCD"" and ""insane"" - far more than the first film.<br/><br/>I'll be honest - I far more enjoyed Brent Spiner and his co-star portraying these characters on Star Trek the Next Generation than this film."

"billygoat1071","7","23","47","8 January 2012"," Bigger Action Holmes
","The thing about Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is it's designed more as an action film than a mystery. The first film shows many strange new things to Sherlock Holmes. Making him a fighter with a brilliant mind. It's a great innovation to the character. In this new film, things just got bigger, louder, and more action packed than ever. The film still has the brains but the plot is discombobulated by the non-stop action scenes. The action is really good but it loses the focus to the plot. Though, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are still fun to watch together and the filmmaking is solid. It's probably enjoyable enough as a blockbuster film.<br/><br/>The first film already introduced Moriarty. We get to know more of him in this sequel. It shows how threatening and menacing he is. The story is quite clever to show all of his schemes. Just like in the first film, Holmes does his thing. Disguising, predicting his fighting, and other stuff. Interesting thing here is his defiance between him and Moriarty. The action is impressively exciting but it makes the plot somewhat plodding. The best moments goes to the relationship of Holmes and Watson. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have a fascinating chemistry which lightens film.<br/><br/>The action is bigger here than the first one. It's more than just martial arts fighting. The film has larger scale and louder explosions. Guy Ritchie did a clever move to these scenes. Giving plenty of momentum and thrills. The performances are good as always. Like what I said, Downey Jr. and Law are both fun together. Stephen Fry is delightful. Jared Harris works better as Moriarty than the one from the first film. The problem of the first Moriarty was he sounded like Mark Strong which made it feel like he is another Blackwood. Harris gives a sly menace to the role. Makes it fascinating. The rest of the filmmaking, the production design is decent and Hans Zimmer's music still nails all the scenes and really fits perfectly to the series.<br/><br/>I don't know what will Sir Arthur Conan Doyle think about these movies. He will might remain perplexed by what the filmmakers has done to his works. It's never a bad thing but it feels extraneous to the character. It's still enjoyable and clever. We still enjoy Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes. This is the new Holmes now. It has loud explosions and loud excitement. But it could have used more better mystery which it lacks in these films. Then again, this is just a blockbuster that wants to make things louder and smarter."
"opszanski","3","17","33","15 December 2011"," Another Sherlock Holmes film and Another Missed Opportunity
","Yes, it is time for another Holmes film. I'll speak in general terms as to why I still don't like this series so you don't have to worry about spoilers.<br/><br/>If there's one thing I hate it's uninspired movie making. While people can say there was large deal of inspiration in this film it was not situated on the topic I consider to be essential when making a Sherlock Holmes movie. When you put a title like Sherlock Holmes on a movie, Your talking about a famed literary character. Someone who solves crimes with a passion. The same way many of us might focus our attention on a common hobby Holmes focuses his attention tenfold on one objective: solving problems. His one goal is to collect every bit of possible evidence from a crime scene and then use his powerful deductive skills to ascertain the particulars in his investigation.<br/><br/>The fascination comes from his exactness. His focus and concentration on the precision of his conclusions makes him more of a computer than a man. ""A calculating machine"" as Watson put it, donating his whole life to putting pieces of evidence together and see what the finished product shows. An yet, through the cold nature of his personality you see a glimpses of humanity. His friendship with Watson that strikes much deeper than it appears, his love of music that shows how human he is in the presence of genuine art, and his zeal for a dramatic conclusion of triumph that was his form of art. When you look deep enough you realize his work isn't that of a computer, but that of an artist.<br/><br/>In the context of this perspective this movie misses on a level not seen in sometime. I understand this is just an opinion and that my opinion is worth as much as the other thousands of reviews on this website, but I truly think this movie fails to capture the spirit of the books. When Holmes and Watson communicate to each other, it resembles that of a bitter couple then that of two people who genuinely respect each other. Needlessly arguing over trivial problems that never existed in the stories and you can only find their style of arguing from a modern day bromance. Holmes is very logical, but it seems superficial and meant to be more of a hero advantage than an authentic skill of an individual. I understand there is a need for action and that Holmes was a fighter in the books, but fighting was only present when necessity called for it. Holmes's physical ability was like any other skill in his repertoire; there for the purpose of furthering progress in an investigation. In this movie, fighting takes place for the sole purpose of the excitement of a fight scene. This seems to be a reoccurring error that is present at every turn in this movie. For example, in the stories Holmes would be careless and say hurtful things because they were required to overcome an obstacle in his investigation whether listening to non-essential facts or the threat of having his plans disarranged. In this movie he was a jerk for the sake of entertainment. In the stories Holmes was cold natured because emotions corrupt his judgement and lead to illogical conclusions, I don't even need to explain how much this wasn't the case in this film.<br/><br/>A person I found very disappointing was Moriarty. In the short story ""The Final Problem"", Moriarty was supposed to be the great obstacle Holmes would overcome at the cost of his life. Doyle at the time intended this to be the last challenge for his detective and intended to be the ultimate class of intellects. Holmes in the story realizes after a series of cat and mouse mental confrontations that he must make the supreme sacrifice to rid the world of Professor Moriarty and he decides to follow through with it (or so he was meant to). The Movie completely failed at capturing a sense of this. The substance and development in this film was lacking to such a great degree it was depressing. You would think you were watching a video game storyline with the amount of effort they put into the development of the Holmes/Moriarty rivalry. We start out towards the end of their feud, this is not a problem since the story too took place towards the end showing that this isn't a fatal error. The error comes in when you consider that their rivalry is not interesting nor engaging. There is no depth to their personalities and is ultimately as engaging as two opposites confronting one another in a reality TV show. The is no authenticity to their mental struggle.<br/><br/>I understand I'm asking a lot for a movie to meet my specific expectations, but I believe my view is the core of many Sherlockian fans. It's not like these have to be specifically exact, but there is a need for a ""ballparkish"" attempt at recreating the spirit of the stories. The BBC series ""Sherlock"" does a decent job of this. This movie, on the other hand, seems to be a 19th century based spy movie with elements of a Michael Bay film sprinkled on top. Without the crucial character development that made the stories great, this is simply a superficial action movie with ""Sherlock Holmes"" as the title."
"SimonJack","6","2","2","11 August 2019"," Slow action and Holmes' martial arts become tiring after a while
","""A Game of Shadows"" is the sequel to the modern first film, ""Sherlock Homes"" of 2009. It continues with the slow-motion, pre-descriptive dialog of various scenes - especially those involving fighting. While I found the first of the fast-action fictional and comic book character films entertaining, the almost non-stop action began to wear thin after a few years.<br/><br/>The real Holmes off Arthur Conan Doyle's creation solved crimes by his cunning and brain. That's apparently not enough for modern Hollywood firms and/or audiences. Now, they must have a Holmes who is a master in martial arts, fisticuffs, and brawling mayhem.<br/><br/>So, this film soon became tiring, even though I stayed with it to the end. The one line I found quite clever and funny was by Holmes when he says, ""It's so overt it's covert. As with the previous film, the CGI work with this film makes the London streets and various scenes seem unreal - made up."
"StonedMagician","5","2","2","27 July 2019"," Average: 5.5
","The 2009 Sherlock Holmes was a relatively slow-paced, more actiony take on the world's greatest detective (sorry, Batman). Though there were a bit too many punches thrown and not enough clues analyzed, it was definitely a good time, held up by the considerable talents of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. While this pair's chemistry is back and as strong as ever this time around, most the fun is conspicuously absent. The film's first hour or so is actually too fast. The overall plot is easy enough to follow, but the individual scenes are not. The action is edited in such a way that I actually had to work hard to follow what I was watching. Nothing memorable really happens, leaving a pretty bad first impression. One minute, a bar fight. Two later, a wedding. The transition was jarring enough that for a split second I actually asked myself how Holmes and Watson got to where they were. That's a bad sign if I ever saw one. The villain, Professor Moriarty, is trying to preemptively start World War I by bombing and supplying various European countries with war materiel. Holmes repeats throughout the film that Moriarty is too careful to leave any clues behind. This leaves Holmes to deduce what he can from the various locales. Since a significant amount of this deduction happens at scenes of Moriarty's crimes, the villain really does feel one step ahead of Holmes, creating a more tense atmosphere than that in the first film. The suspense keeps the movie together to the same degree that the pair of leads' acting does. Despite tripping over its own feet in the first half, the film finds its pace in the second half. The action is coherent, the story starts to come to a head, and the film stops trying to make me laugh every three minutes. Holmes starts moving in on Moriarty, and things get more deliberate. The film catches its breath. Suddenly, one can focus on little details that might or might not carry meaning, just like Holmes does, bringing you into the film in some very clever ways. The final twenty-or-so minutes of the movie are easily the best of it, with a very good mix of detective work and action that make every prior scene look amateur by comparison. However, this is certainly not enough to make up for the criminally lackluster beginning and middle. In addition, one thing that fans of the original will definitely notice is that the soundtrack is simply not at the same level of quality as the first movie's. Especially at the title sequence, the music is a bit too overpowering, which would be fine if it was not so aggravating. Though not a bad film by any means, A Game of Shadows is a classic example of a sequel that, despite its best efforts, simply cannot live up to its predecessor's legacy."

And even though I wanted to give this film a ""Very Good"" on theVade Review Bar, an alright first half and a very good second half just don't add up to be a ""Very Good"" in the end. So with that being said, I decided to give Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10.

","So they've ""updated"" Sherlock Holmes by turning him into a Victorian version of ""James Bond""? I guess that's one way to avoid paying royalties to Ian Fleming's heirs, or Arthur Conan Doyle's for that matter, whose copyrights mostly expired in 2000. Before you can say ""cheap ripoff,"" however, I will admit that this sequel accomplished the rare feat of surpassing the first, although given the caliber of Ritchie's earlier film, that couldn't have been difficult to accomplish. Nevertheless, I don't enjoy watching Robert Downey Jr fight in those wretched ""Iron Man"" and ""Avengers"" movies and I don't relish watching him fight in this movie either, so turning Sherlock Holmes into an ""action hero"" is a major turnoff for me. (I much prefer the updated BBC TV series starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a socially inept, sexually ambiguous Holmes.) Admittedly I am not a fan of Downey and his trademark deadpan one-liners, although they weren't as bad as usual this time around. I'd much rather watch handsome Jude Law, and it is an injustice that as Watson he has to play second fiddle to Downey. But I gave this film a not-dishonorable ""7"" because Downey and Law get to dance together, and share a few other vaguely, enjoyably homoerotic moments, otherwise I would have ranked the film lower."

The chemistry between Downey Jr. and Jude Law are also further developed from the first movie.

Yes they are both detectives and they solve crime, but thats about it. Many characters in this movie doesn't exist in the original book, a lot of the main story of the film don't exist in the book and Sherlock Holmes don't act like the Sherlock Holmes in the book would have done. The creator of this movie has not given Sherlock Holmes the credit that he deserves. This movie doses not deserve to be called Sherlock Holmes.

"chaz-28","6","10","18","28 December 2011"," Holmes vs. Moriarty exchanges are captivating; the same cannot be said for Holmes & Watson
","Even though there are now two films in Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes, I am still getting accustomed to the athletic, street fighting Holmes as opposed to the merely cerebral genius who used to chase suspects by horse and buggy rather than bash their brains out in back alleys. In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the villain is more formidable, the action consumes more screen time, and the jokes are more cringe inducing. Sherlock (Robert Downey Jr.) has noticeably upped his drug habit with side references to cocaine and routinely drinks embalming fluid rather than boring old brandy.<br/><br/>Why the sudden surge for uppers? First, Sherlock is matching wits with Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). Moriarty appears to match Holmes man to man intellectually; however, he has follows no moral code or displays any hint of empathy whatsoever. This makes his the most dangerous man in Europe. I will not divulge any plot points concerning his evil deeds because that is half the fun of a Sherlock story, following the trail as he discovers clues which lead him to the next location. Second, Dr. Watson (Jude Law) insists on going through with his marriage, a prospect Sherlock frequently reminds him will destroy his manhood and shatter his well-being.<br/><br/>Sherlock's interactions with these two characters, Moriarty and Watson, define the high and low ends of this film. When Sherlock and Moriarty share the same room, real tension emanates from the screen. Their verbal sword play is a credit to the writing and the actors who joust for tactical advantage just by using metaphors. Two scenes between these men jump to mind. Early on, Sherlock analyzes Moriarty's handwriting while Moriarty warns Sherlock of the dangerous path he is following. I will not describe a later scene between the two gentlemen, but it is the most effective in the film as they mentally assail one another.<br/><br/>The low and tedious end is Sherlock's interactions with Watson. The relentless double entendres about their 'relationship' lead the audience to question whether or not Sherlock is homosexual. For a wisecrack or two, this would provide levity and amusement. Unfortunately, the script persistently wails against this dead horse of a joke. A homoerotic double meaning pops up about every 30 seconds when Sherlock and Watson share the screen. It soon grows dreary and began to test my patience, especially during an extended sequence with Sherlock in drag.<br/><br/>What always ends up bringing the script back on track is what Sherlock is known for, his fascinating method of deductive reasoning. Before he makes a move, the script may flash forward as he meticulously plans his next position in a street brawl or it may flash a few minutes back in time to show the audience just how he set up the bad guys to fail. Sherlock is always one step behind Moriarty who regularly seems to be the smarter of the two; however, if you are the individual planning the executing the scheme, those following you will always appear to be lagging behind you.<br/><br/>I slightly recommend this new Sherlock mainly for the enjoyment of the Sherlock vs. Moriarty moments and the fascinating moments when Sherlock pauses to explain the situation to someone (usually the audience) as to what and why he is taking a particular course of action. I hesitate to strongly recommend this film because of the awful dialogue between Sherlock and Watson and because of the standard Guy Ritchie cinematography style. Guy Ritchie is known for inventive and momentum shifting action scenes. Sometimes bullets fly faster than the speed of light and then shift to 'Matrix' time so<br/><br/>the audience can watch it pierce someone's clothing. Shifting between fast and slow motion in action sequences is helpful to determine the placement of good and bad guys, but after a particular amount of time, these shifts become significantly noticeable where instead they should be only slightly perceptible. When the third or fourth action sequence began, I was prepared and expected the momentum shifts which instead of drawing me into the scene actually had the opposite effect and took me out of it.<br/><br/>There are certain expectations and pitfalls a second film in a series runs into. Will it have the same mood and presence as the first film? Is it just there to take up space to make it a trilogy? In A Game of Shadows, Sherlock's character is a bit more interesting because of the drug habit and especially because of the villain; however, Watson is beginning to draw eye rolls instead of applause as the sidekick."

RDJ's Holmes looks like he has not only shaved in days but he hasn't bathed in days, either. Jude Law's Dr. Watson looks equally scruffy. Didn't anyone shave in the 1890s? There's a lot of bantering between Holmes and Watson which is entertaining but very little of the deductive reasoning that was the core of every Holmes story. And yes, in the books Holmes did know some sort of Asian martial arts but these new movies make him into a martial arts expert an a par with Bruce Lee. It's so incongruous to the rest of the story and the setting as to be very distracting."

So, when I suddenly read many positive reviews from fellow moviegoers on IMDb I made a grave error: I took them for real. And bought the DVD. I should have known, that reviewers, that rave for one movie (but have, according to their history, never seen another) are most likely plants: pr-agencies, marketing- and one-review-industrial-accounts.<br/><br/>I paid dearly.<br/><br/>What's good about this movie?

The story arc is incoherent. Worst of all: It is plain boring. I could have switched off anywhere in the movie and would not have missed a thing. Alas: the dog fell asleep on the remote.<br/><br/>It's a shame, that by now almost every new movie get's a terrific rating on IMDb instantly. Sure: it's an Amazon company and Amazon want's to sell. But is it really necessary to hype such trash? Can't we keep at least some decency? Myself, I have started to regard a good rating on IMDb more as a threat rather than a recommendation..."

","Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows follows the pattern of the first movie with Sherlock & Dr. Watson facing off against an evil villain. In this second going around, the great chemistry and interaction of Sherlock & Dr. Watson take the movie to a whole new level of fun and laughs.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the director's style in the movie, though many people will not. The director uses many unique views and lots of slow motion and stop action to highlight the realism of the film. In addition, the director's goes both back in time to highlight how Sherlock unravels specific mysteries and forward in time to visually walkthrough Sherlock's anlaysis of a situation. The style is unique and dynamic.<br/><br/>While Robert Downey Jr. has the central role as Sherlock, Jude Law steals the movie with his portrayal of Dr. Watson. Throughout the movie, the pair have great interactions, and their back-and-forth dialogue generates lots of funny moments. Robert Downey Jr. carries off the eccentricities of Sherlock with great enthusiasm, but Dr. Watson's expanded role adds to the depth of their relationship.<br/><br/>A pleasant surprise in the film was the introduction of Sherlock Holmes' brother, who added some charm and comedy to the film in his small role. On the other hand, I was somewhat disappointed in Sherlock's nemesis Dr. Moriarty. The actor did a competent job, but the role didn't live up to the hype of Sherlock's ultimate foe.<br/><br/>Overall, Game of Shadows was enjoyable with an interesting story line, lots of action, and plenty of laughs. However, many will be put off my the director's unique, in-your-face style, which I enjoyed."

","The character sometimes talks like Sherlock, but fights like a damn Bruce Lee, shoots like freaking Rambo and has a lot of Jack Sparrow in his humoristic backbone. Absurdly nothing like what's in the books. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle must be weeping in his grave by now. If you have a contrary view, then follow up your disagreement by first reading ONE of the books.The director seems to have it confused with Batman; I would not be surprised if he actually had some sort of Sherlock-Belt along with a baseball bat. The detective role he should play in this movie is replaced by a vicious brawler breaking bones and performing dazzling acrobatic moves. It's fun, it's well edited, but it is NOT Sherlock Holmes."
"gregsrants","1","50","121","12 December 2011"," Terrible Waste of Time
","In December of 2009, director Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Rocknrolla) brought us Sherlock Holmes – an action/adventure period piece starring Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role as the fictional detective created by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br/><br/>The film was released when a small flick named Avatar was reaping in gazillion's of dollars, but it held it's own and Sherlock was able to rake in half a billion dollars in worldwide box office receipts. With such a response at the box office, we didn't need Sherlock Holmes to uncover Hollywood's plan to bring a sequel to our big screens faster than a Watson quip.<br/><br/>The result is Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows which opens December 16, 2011. The main components were all back for the second offering. Downey again would play Holmes, the master of disguise with keen problem solving abilities and he would be joined again by Jude Law as his trusty partner Watson, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler and Ritchie who would again find himself behind the camera.<br/><br/>Picking up on an open ended sub plot at the conclusion of the first film, Holmes and Dr. Watson team up again in an attempt to bring down their adversary, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). They will be aided by a gypsy, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace – The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Holmes' brother Mycroft (played wonderfully by Stephen Fry).<br/><br/>The plot involves Moriarty's attempt to start a World War and then profit greatly with his armoury of available weapons. Standing in his way will be Holmes, who seems kookier than he did in the first film, but far less believable. Holmes' addictions are still diverse (we catch him drinking embalming fluid) and it will take all of Watson's attention (taking him away from his honeymoon) to keep Holmes from getting himself killed while the two piece together a fairly routine and uninspired plot.<br/><br/>With little story to grip or engross, the entertainment value is going to come from the action sequences and Game of Shadows paints its scenes with a sloppy wide brush. Sequences are stopped, slowed down, sped up and shot with quick zooms which all make for exciting viewing for the first 20 seconds then becomes distracting and overly stylish for a movie meant for the masses. Artillery shells blow away trees and rapid gunfire cuts through a train, but we doubt that either scene will have audiences on the edge of their seats or leaving the theatre in absorbed conversation over the action.<br/><br/>Robert Downey does his best (I suppose) but he has very very little to work with. Law is again a worthy partner, but McAdams and Rapace are wasted in their efforts (particularly McAdams who has so little to do with A Game of Shadows we wonder why she came back at all).<br/><br/>Billed as an action/comedy it is important then too to address the comedic moments of the film. Very little, if any, of the humor worked on a mass scale. The packed house at the sneak preview did present a few chuckles here and there, but hardly a full laugh. The biggest laugh came when a hungover Watson was awakened by bagpipes. Yeah. We know. Hilarious stuff.<br/><br/>With failure in the script writing, the action, the comedy and the wasted efforts of the talent attached all make for a very disappointing film. In fact, we could easily stand on our English soapbox and declare that not only does A Game of Shadows not live up to the fairly mediocre bar set by its predecessor, but it is also easily one of the worst films of the year."
"winner55","1","8","14","4 March 2014"," Defines bad movie in the post-modern era
","A Game of Shadows: In an era when our most popular films are really little more than roller-coaster rides through comic book worlds, can anyone actually make a bad film, with standards so low. Well - you can make this film, I guess. ""A Game of Shadows"" is truly awful. I admit I even watched it twice, because the first time through I couldn't get any sense of what the story was all about. The second time around, a number of narrative threads did seems to run through the film, eventually tied together (rather arbitrarily) at the end. But I realized that the story (or stories) here merely form a kind of scarecrow on which director Ritchie could hang set-piece action sequences, camera tricks and CGI wizardry, while the actors mugged like children in a bad school play about someone or other they called ""Sherlock Holmes,"" for no other reason than they had heard the name while running around a TV set with an old movie playing on it.<br/><br/>Childishly campy, visually ugly (that mind-numbing slo-mo - stop it!), badly written, and horribly over-acted; of course it made millions. That doesn't stop it from being a bad film. <br/><br/>Note: There are currently four series of films attempting to revise the canon of Conan Doyle's brilliant Victorian detective for the 21st Century. One from the UK (Sherlock, for TV), one from the US (Elementary, for TV), one from Russia (Sherlock Homes, for TV), and the internationally produced films of Guy Ritchie, starring Robert Downey. Notably, each involves a radical re-envisioning of the character and his place in the world. We may have reached a point in history when filmmakers simply cannot give us the Great Detective as he was imagined by Doyle and played (with variations) throughout the 20th Century. Rating the 4 series: Sherlock Holmes (Russia): 9 of 10, with strong stories and a believably proletarian nerd Holmes. Sherlock (UK): 6 of 10; excellent first season has been betrayed by Steven Moffat's flashy showmanship until the stories are incoherent now (Season 3), the characters no longer likable, the focus almost completely lost. Elementary (US): 4 of 10; the redefined Holmes, a nervous, unsympathetic recovering drug addict, is not without interest, and any show with Lucy Liu in it gets the benefit of her quiet but charismatic presence and talent. But basically, this is just a routine American police procedural with a gimmick. I doubt that Hollywood can do anything else. Sherlock Holmes (Ritchie/Downey): 1 of 10. This series lacks any coherence in its stories or continuity. It's just a series of set-pieces with running around, fist fights, explosions, and campy jokes."
"kingerz55","2","8","14","1 May 2012"," Facile pap
","I wrote my university thesis on Sherlock Holmes. This is a crock of rubbish. Hollywood-ized, exaggerated, unbearable trash. It seems to expect us to believe that Holmes is a Matrix-era Neo with super-hero-styled martial arts abilities. Downey could hardly overact more without this film being deemed sheer comedy. Indeed, that would be what this is, were it not so woefully bad. 'Suspension of Disbelief', anyone""? Aye...not even worth a free download. One wonders why anyone would pass this script or agree to act in it. It must just be a cynical hope that some money can be made. The first film had, at least, a slight nod to the brilliant restrained excellence of a TV actor such as Jeremy Brett, in his utterly British, ironic and subtle acting of the detective icon. Downey and whoever acts Holmes (he's too 2D for me to care who he is)simply dissolve into a pap of loud SFX and rushed stereotypical trash. All that is sloppy with modern Hollywood distilled. I give two stars for the waterfall finale with Holmes and Moiraty: that was poignant....sadly undone by a facile ending."
"bob-rutzel-1","2","7","12","13 June 2012"," Disappointing
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) again battle wits with arch enemy Professor James Moriarty. <br/><br/>There is wrong-doing afoot. Our entertainment history is being rewritten to such a point we will no longer know or remember what came first. What we have now is a Sherlock Holmes as an Action Hero, something Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never contemplated. Now the Green Lantern is gay. Spiderman once had a dark suit. Snow White will now be remembered for her troubles with an evil Queen and not for those happy-go-lucky dwarfs (except for Grumpy, of course). <br/><br/>Where will it all end? Will Anne of Green Gables become the new Laura Croft? Will Nancy Drew become a hit-manum woman? Will the Hardy Boys become the new Batman and Robin? And, those poor three little pigs, what will they become? And, will we ever hear that we are glad those superheroes are on our side or hear the last line in the fairytale that ""they lived happily ever after?"" Point made? Maybe. <br/><br/>I feel many of us would have liked Robert Downey Jr to become another Action Hero (yes, other than Iron Man) with another name and not Sherlock Holmes. And, he still could have a sidekick as, perhaps, a Watson with another name too. Put Sherlock Holmes back where he belongs. Downey is not even close to being a Sherlock Holmes. But, it is what it is and we have what we have and there doesn't seem to be much any of us can do about it. Well, that is, unless I become king. Then it will change back to what it all was. Pity that it cannot happen. I would be a good king. <br/><br/>As for this event, you will see a lot of very good CGI, a very fast talking Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr ) because -- remember: he doesn't have a British accent and his talking at light speed will cover that up. So what we have here are fiction, and fantasy where only the names remain the same as written by Sir Arthur, who at this point must be spinning in his grave at warp speed. <br/><br/>The first half of this movie is a complete mess. Nothing flowed where one could understand what was going on; hence nothing was going on. When characters talk in darkened scenes with clipped English, it is difficult to follow anything. What we heard was something about Watson's marriage, mind games with Moriarty that came to nothing, and protecting a gypsy fortune teller (Noomi Rapace as Madam Heron) whose brother is missing. The second half was more in tune with what the movie should have been all along, but still there was no caring about anything except to have this over with. And, it was much too long. <br/><br/>Downey's Holmes overacts all the way thru and this is most annoying. He is too causal and too flippant. The comedic banter between Holmes and Watson was lame, not funny and most of the time unintelligible. Jude Law's Watson tries to be serious but is often taken in by Sherlock's prankish behavior. Wasted in here was Rachael McAdams as Irene Adler. The only serious persons in here are Moriarty (Jared Harris) and Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan) who together wished there was not so much action and a better script with the old Sherlock back. <br/><br/>If you have no idea who the real Sherlock Holmes is, then never mind. Enjoy this mindless Action Hero story and have a nice day. But, for the record, as an Action Hero movie with CGI trappings, let us hope that we have seen the last of this fraudulent Sherlock Holmes. Also, for the record, Robert Downey Jr is a good actor, but not when he pretends to be Sherlock Holmes. And, although I did not like the first Sherlock movie with Downey, I must admit, it was much better than this one. Had the scenes been slower and easier to follow, this may have been okay, but not the way it is now. The Editor must have been on a scene time limit schedule. <br/><br/>Whenever old fairy tales or once admired Action Heroes that existed in our past come alive again and have involvement with the dark side or do things we are not familiar with Hollywood calls it ""rebooting"" and we will be truly lost. Look what they did to the new Star Trek story. That, folks, is where we are headed. Yes, there is wrong-doing afoot. Can't you see it? Did I mention that I would be a good king?<br/><br/>Violence; Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"haosstoposto","1","7","12","8 May 2012"," Elementary, dear Watson
","I rate this movie with 1 because I expected better movie than its prequel which was a very solid viewing but that is not a reason for this review. I only wanted to point out that it was a serious mistake for Holmes to send Dr.Watson to find (or deduce!) the assassin in the final moments of the movie. He is trying to find a killer with complicated methods but he only had to consider this: - Madame Simsa's brother Rene (as she is of course) is French. - The easiest person for him to imitate is also French. - It is not easy for him to imitate British or German person because the languages are too different. - So only logical deduction would be - French ambassador. Probably something Holmes would have discovered in no-time. Or maybe not. Too bad that director has tried to make this movie interesting with kung-fu skills and slow/stop motion instead with cerebral powers of the world's greatest detective."

","The original movie created an excellent formula that should have been taken and used successfully in this sequel. Unfortunately this movie sells out to an American ""Hollywood"" audience, and as a result alienates fans of the Sherlock Holmes genre.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are very entertaining, however Rachel McAdams is painful and brings little to the movie other than the usual fluttering of her eye lashes and cliché promiscuity.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie seems to be a one trick pony. His directorial techniques have changed little in the 15 years since his 1997 hit Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Obviously, the main difference being the seizable Warner Bros budget now at his disposal."
"leprutz13-1","4","7","12","24 January 2012"," Just one sequence is worth it.
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) The certainly most famous detective of all times returns in an action packed adventure of lies and treachery. Holmes and his side kick Watson are trying to assemble bits and pieces of a puzzle to find out the identity of the person who is behind terrorist attacks, that took place in Europe, and foil his evil plans.<br/><br/>After watching over half an hour, trying to find out where all this was going, I found myself closing my eyes (unwillingly) for a couple of minutes, because of boredom, simply bad slapstick comedy and more then horrendous storytelling. The Screenplay is predictable, yet ununderstandable, trying to hard on creating a suspenseful script a la Robert Ludlum. Nevertheless, after an hour we get to know where the screenwriter wants to take us, but the beginning is just messy.<br/><br/>The Direction and the photography (technically speaking) have pros and contras - I appreciated a lot the use of tripods and other technical devices like travelling or steady cam to get some clean still shots at the actors and make the action more comprehensible. Specially nowadays, that most Hollywood action movies are shot with shaky cam. Simply embarrassing. - Less appreciated, was the fact of non innovative narrating, everything is as we expect it to be. The fighting sequences are rather slow, using multiple slow motions, way over used and sometimes repeating the same action too often which kills the surprise effect<br/><br/>The editing is likable in most non violent sequences. During the fights, it is flashy and unbearable at most. Already seen jump cuts in the time motion makes the action anything else then fluid. The rhythm of the whole narration is rather deceiving, boring and maybe too distracting sometimes.<br/><br/>The actors did quite well. But I wouldn't throw flowers on the stage either.<br/><br/>I am not wise in special effects but they are mostly well done and I must admit that I was quite impressed in the forest bombing sequence. The Time Motion jump cut was rather pleasant, I would even say needed if not, actually impressive in that sequence.<br/><br/>Anyway, Guy Ritchie has proved to me once more, that he is a very talented director who lost it all after Snatch. Not even with a Blockbuster, bearing the name of one of the most respected Man on earth ever, was he capable of returning to his magnificence of filmmaking. For me, Guy is a one hit wonder and will always be. 4 out of 10 for an unmemorable movie, but a plus for one impressive sequence."
"ijozic","3","7","12","16 January 2012"," A total disappointment (and I liked the first movie)
","While the first movie was a bit unorthodox regarding its portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, it functioned because of the good performance of the main actors, a very convincing villain and a good plot which had more than a necessary amount of mystery for an SH plot, made even stronger by toying with the elements of the occult. Occasional action scenes, though sometimes overdone, were rather original and few and far between to annoy.<br/><br/>The sequel though seems to be written by a different set of writers. There is no plot whatsoever above the basic premise which can be told in a sentence or two. The only mystery present was what actually connects all too many random and overly long action sequences and dispensable characters together. And though the main actors might still be pushing hard, their lines rarely work, being written poorly as they are. To accommodate for the weak script, Robert Downey character's eccentricity seems to be simply pushed much too far this time that it becomes annoying rather than fun. Jude Law repeats the first role as much as possible with the lines he's been given and is a rare memento to what worked well in the first movie. Rachel McAdams was a rare miss in the first movie, so the fact she doesn't play a larger role in this one can only be a plus. I'm still puzzled by the gypsy woman character's purpose in the movie, but it only underlines the weak script as this character is actually one of the main ones. And the villain himself leaves an impression of a low-level local gangster given to play with higher stakes (selling weapons to opposing countries, rather than illegal liquor) which, unfortunately for the script writers, doesn't automatically create a character of a top criminal mastermind. As there was no secrecy about him or his plan or his ulterior motives even, the ""game of shadows"" being played between him and the SH is reduced to running around the Europe at seemingly random locations, fighting (in the most direct sense of the word) the forgettable villains alone while trying to save the world. And if that might sound more like a James Bond script to you (as mentioned in some other review), you would not be mistaken.<br/><br/>Just avoid it. It made for a very tedious experience and the only thing I cared about while watching was that it finishes as soon as possible so I can forget about it."

"Boba_Fett1138","7","10","19","23 December 2011"," Very typical for a sequel.
","This movie is very typical for a sequel, which is of course not necessarily a good thing to say. It means that the movie is trying to surpass its original, by trying to be bigger and better in about every way imaginable. But because most sequels try hard, they also fail at this, which is unfortunately also the case for this movie.<br/><br/>No, it's not a bad movie. It's still quite entertaining and well made of course but the movie tries to do things differently from the first movie. The first movie was a bit of a surprise to me. I liked it way more than I could ever had imagined, so I also was quite looking forward to this sequel. And even though it's far from bad, it still disappoint me.<br/><br/>First of all, thing that makes this movie a bit different from the first one is because Guy Ritchie is being more Guy Ritchie this time around. I have always liked Guy Ritchie and his movies (well, most of them) but one of the reasons why ""Sherlock Holmes"" came as such a surprise for me, was that it was being quite different from Ritchie's normal style. For this movie he however seemed to have gone back more to his old style of film-making, so that means its characters go far more over-the-top, as does its humor and visual style of film-making (weird camera angels and editing, the slow-motion, etcetera). It doesn't really suite a movie set in the late 19th century.<br/><br/>But the movie is also needlessly trying to be different in other ways. It changes settings for instance. I just don't get why you would ever want a Sherlock Holmes movie to take place outside of England. Sherlock Holmes and England go together like fine wine and cheese but above all, I also feel they should be together. The movie however decided it was a good idea to let Sherlock Holmes travel Europe. It's just not the same atmosphere and settings you would expect and want from a Sherlock Holmes movie, in my opinion but perhaps I'm just nitpicking.<br/><br/>But another adjustment that just doesn't much to the movie at all, is the addition of a couple of new characters. Sherlock's brother Mycroft is in this but why exactly? And was Noomi Rapace really necessary? It are all little things that the movie did not needed to have in it at all.<br/><br/>But what it could had used was a better villain, or perhaps a more charismatic actor playing him. This is professor James Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes' arch-nemesis. His Lex Luthor so to speak! Yet the movie really hardly features Moriarty at all and I really missed the cat and mouse type of play between the Holmes and Moriarty. They are both equally brilliant, with as a difference that Holmes is one the good side of the law (well, most of the time). They constantly try to outsmart each other and be one step ahead of the other, all the time. This is at least the way it all should had been but the movie just doesn't do any of this really.<br/><br/>And its story...well, it seems to become a trend but half of the time I had no idea what was going on in the story or what the point- and all of the character's motivations were. It was a bit of a messy told movie at times but if you simply surrender yourself to it, which should be easy to do, you'll still have a good time watching.<br/><br/>It's still a real quality made movie, with a great, unique visual style to it. It's obvious this was not a cheap movie to make but it all pays off. The movie is featuring some great action in it, which is perhaps not something you would expect from a Sherlock Holmes movie. But it's really something that adds to the high quality and entertainment value of this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is still fun and entertaining, also thanks to its characters (the ones that aren't redundant for the movie) and actors playing them. Robert Downey Jr. gives the movie so much and I honestly couldn't imaging any other actor playing the role of Holmes so great, fun and charismatically as he does.<br/><br/>Definitely an inferior sequel but still fun, good and entertaining enough all!<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The best Holmes being Jeremy Brett. Holmes didn't like women so he wouldn't be following one around like a dog. He would have never let his good friend Dr. Watson down, nor would he have harmed his wife in anyway. Mycroft would never have paraded around his home nude in front of a guest... the list goes on. I had to get up and leave the theater, it was so bad. Why is it when American's make a Holmes movie it is nothing like the story. Just follow Conan Doyle's books they are a hit on their own. I will never watch another American made Holmes movie again. Awful, Awful, Awful!!!!!"
"Pencho15","5","5","8","16 January 2013"," Worst than the first part.
","To start I must say I had absolutely no interest in watching the first Sherlock Holmes film starring Robert Downey Jr., judging by the trailers the film appeared to be simply another Hollywood blockbuster that would fill the screen with action scenes and visual effects with no other goal than making money. Visiting the theater with my family I couldn't avoid finally watching it and I was surprised and satisfied, indeed it was a movie made only to have a good time, but it turned out to be quite entertaining and a nice homage to the original character.<br/><br/>With this in mind I went to see Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows expecting an equally good entertainment, but this time I was disappointed: the action scenes happen to often and are way to exaggerated, there are too many of the slow motion scenes present in many Guy Ritchie films, and the supporting characters did not arouse my interest.<br/><br/>This last point is were the movie disappointed me the most, Noomi Rapace character seemed completely failed to me, she had no chemistry with Robert Downey and I never had a reason to care for her, if she had been killed or disappeared at any time I wouldn't have cared at all. This is an absolute contrast with the Irene Adler of the first film, a very nice character played by Rachel McAdams, her love/rivalry relationship with Holmes was one of the best things in the first part, it was a real shame to see Irene die in the first scene and with her that well developed sometimes kinky, sometimes comical and sometimes romantic relationship thrown away; Noomi Rapace was great as a tough woman in the Millennium trilogy, but she should look for a different character and avoid doing the same every time, here she didn't do it very well.<br/><br/>Regarding the action scenes, both the part were the bad guys try to kill Watson in a train, and the chase and shooting in the German forest were waaay too much, and in the last case it was even tiresome; I was just wishing they would get over with the slow movement that led nowhere, but it just kept going and going, there's no need to abuse a cinematographic resource.<br/><br/>One final complaint I have has to do with the final scene, while Holmes is playing a chess game with Moriarty, Dr. Watson and the Gypsy (Rapace) are trying to find a hidden secret agent who will commit a murder that will start a war, the problem here is that in the same room they are joined by Mycroft Homes, and as any Sherlock fan knows he is one of the most brilliant minds there are, eclipsing even his brother. It is simply inexplicable that he would simply wait for other to catch the agent when his observation skills would have solved everything quicker and with more certainty than Watson, it is natural that Jude Law and Rapace, as two of the main characters, should be the ones to play that important role, but the writers should have find a way to keep Mycroft out of the room in order to avoid the nonsense of his passive waiting.<br/><br/>After this complaints it's time to mention the good points of the movie, first the relationship between Holmes and Watson works as well as in the first film and both Downey and Law give good performances, also I'd like to notice the work of Kelly Reilly, she plays Watson's wife and, in the absence of a good female character in the lead, she becomes the one that gives the relationship between the two main characters its best moments.<br/><br/>Another good part is the ending of the movie where Holmes and Moriarty fall down a waterfall to their apparent death. Those who know the character not only through movies, but also from the books will know that Conan Doyle killed Holmes that way because he was fed up with writing his adventures; however years later he was forced to bring him back due to the constant and never ending fan mail demanding him to continue the stories. In a genius nod to that fact, at the end of this picture Holmes appears alive and avoiding detection he writes a question mark after the words ""the end"" just typed by Watson in his memoirs, this way we are made to understand that, if their fans ask for it just as hundreds of readers did with Conan Doyle this Sherlock Holmes will also return. It is a very clever detail in the script, but I'm afraid (and I hope I'm wrong) that the people that will enjoy this film the most will not notice this smart reference at all.<br/><br/>This good things must be mentioned and recognized, but in my opinion none of them is enough to save a film that left me with no desire to see a third part: If you enjoy any blockbuster Hollywood releases or if you are absolute fans of Guy Ritchie you will enjoy this, but if you are looking for good cinema and something more meaningful avoid it. For me this Holmes can finish his days falling down that waterfall."

On the surface, this movie has all the requisite elements of good movie: nice sets with detail, mood, cast, sharp dialog, surprise death, action, fight scenes, etc...<br/><br/>So how did it go wrong??? <br/><br/>Here's how I felt - like I knew what was coming; but even though I did not it still seemed contrived and stale. I felt somewhat mocked by this movie, like the original was such a success that there was no need to put forth real effort to make it special. it was a boring string of events in a patent formula...............witty remark, somber condescending look, conflict, clever overreaching resolution, pepper with fisticuffs, witty remark, pretend self-destructive narcissistic behavior is cute. Then lather rinse and repeat throughout movie.<br/><br/>kudos for the early death of Amy McAdams. She's decent but that opening scene with the package was beat. It was like watching two lovebirds on the phone going, ""you hang up....no you hang up,no you hang up.....OK I'm gonna hang up, I know you didn't hang up...you hang up"" ad nauseam.......... heavy on the nauseam.<br/><br/>We get it already, Sherlock is so clever that he knows what everyone does before they do it. Oh wait, he actually admits that he made a mistake....hey viewers see his flaw, doesn't that make him more human and relatable???? Nope.<br/><br/>Of course we know he did not die at the end - why? Because he's too clever for dying.<br/><br/>PS - Watson's wife is a bore."
"cherold","5","5","8","1 May 2012"," Dull Retread
","I liked Guy Ritchie's first Sherlock Holmes movie, even though it had so little to do with Sherlock Holmes that one suspects the writer learned everything about the original from half-listening to a friend describe a story he'd read 20 years ago. But if you took it as a movie about characters that just happen to have names like Holmes and Watson but are otherwise their own thing, it was pretty decent.<br/><br/>That cannot, alas, be said for the sequel, which is just plain dull. The movie lacks, for the most part, the intriguing flirtation between Holmes and Irene Adler, instead bringing in some strikingly bland characters to populate its muddled story. The direction seems unnecessarily gimmicky even compared to other Ritchie films, and while I wouldn't describe the movie as a *huge* waste of two hours, it is certainly two hours I could have spent in a better fashion."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","5","8","4 January 2012"," Not as good as the first, but very entertaining
","I, as a fan of Sherlock Holmes and of the portrayals given by Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett, personally loved the first Sherlock Holmes, it was fun, stylish and clever, with impeccably matched leads and a good villain, even with moments of annoying slow-motion, things getting convoluted and draggy in the second hour and Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>Although the trailers suggested otherwise, I very much enjoyed this sequel. While there are a few improvements to the first film, it is overall not as good. My problems with the film come from the eventually annoying slow-motion in every fight sequence, it was fine at first but after a while it was overkill. I also felt there were too many characters some of whom don't have much time to develop, and instead are either come and go or blink and you'll miss. Lastly, the last forty-five minutes or so felt-like the first-rather sluggish in the pacing.<br/><br/>However, the film still looks wonderful, with the sets especially absolutely spectacular and a lot of effort is done into making the atmosphere evocative. The cinematography and lighting are also very good, with the lighting in particular giving some scenes a suitably haunting look. The music score is rousing, Guy Ritchie's direction is more efficient this time around, the first hour and a quarter or so goes at a cracking pace and more than makes up for the rather duller half and the dialogue especially with Holmes crackles.<br/><br/>Despite some of my criticisms, there were a couple of improvements. One was Noomi Rapace, whose appearance and style is much more suited to the period, McAdams as Irene gave it her all in the first but I sometimes found her hair and the way the character dressed jarring. Two is that apart from the draggy last act the story this time around is much more involving and contains much more going on to compel the viewer, the first was generally a great idea and was fun but got a little confusing by the end. Lastly, Jared Harris as Moriaty, Mark Strong was good but Moriaty as a whole is a more interesting villain, and I loved how cunning yet smooth Harris' performance was.<br/><br/>Not to mention Stephen Fry as Mycroft, a wonderful and very thoughtful performance in my view, and he even gets his own nude scene. In fact all the cast bring a lot of gusto to the roles even the sidelined(personally I found this a wise move) McAdams. I do wish though there was more of Eddie Marsan as Lestrade, his ineptness is such a great contrast to Holmes' more clever and inquisitive approach and I would have loved to have seen that come through more. Robert Downey Jnr once again is a very charismatic Holmes, and Jude Law as the more authoritative and composed character of Watson is also perfect. Again they are impeccably matched and work wonderfully together.<br/><br/>All in all, I found it very entertaining. Although there are a few things I preferred here, I did prefer the original, but this sequel compared to the film the trailers made it look is equally worthy. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"mm-39","7","5","8","2 January 2012"," Not as good as the first one!
","I believe the first Sherlock Holmes was much closer to the books formula of mystery solved by Holmes logic. The second installment is more like an action film. There is more action in this movie, but the movie still goes back the original formula when Holmes locks his wits/logic against the evil professor. The movie is a good mix of humor and action while the storyline keeps the viewer interested. Guy Richie directs the slow motion action excellently, which Richie is famously known for. The movie is worth seeing in the theater. It was a good New Years eve date. I give Sherlock Holmes A game of Shadows a seven out of ten."
"rmax304823","5","3","4","2 March 2013"," Holmes: Killed in Action Movie.
","On the plus side, the acting isn't bad. Downey's Sherlock Holmes is adequate, including his accent. From certain angles he's beginning to look like Dustin Hoffman as he aged. Jude Law, likewise, delivers as a more than usually active Dr. Watson. Sebastian Moran I dismiss, but Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty is quite good, especially considering that he doesn't look the part as it was described in the canon. Best of all, though, is Steven Frey as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother. His flabby geniality and hooded eyes suggest a wry dispassion. I think he may have been Oscar Wilde in another film. If he wasn't, he should have been.<br/><br/>An avalanche of plot twists almost buries some of the clever lines in the script. Offered a horse to ride, instead of a carriage, Holmes remarks, ""The animals are dangerous at both ends and devious in the middle."" There are some other good one liners but I forget them at the moment.<br/><br/>You know the Sherlock Holmes series from Universal Studios -- the ones with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce? They were cheap, simple, spooky, and bloodless. Well, this is everything that series was not.<br/><br/>It rushes headlong through its narrative -- something to do with Moriarty wanting to start a World War because he's acquiring the rights to all the weaponry. And this movie has weaponry enough to satisfy weaponry fans, and sometimes described in loving detail. One of them appears to be an assault rifle that cycle at about the same rate as a Tommy gun. This is the 1890s and there is a Gatling gun too, but forget that one. It doesn't shoot enough bullets fast enough. The dynamic duo undergo all sorts of travails that I won't bother to spell out. I will, though, mention that the action scenes are edited at a lightning pace except when they are reduced to near-absolute minimum motion. Not slow motion, but hardly any motion at all. Things explode in fireballs several times. Computer-generated images abound. And almost every scene takes place in an eerie and unworldly murk, as if shot underwater in the Harlem River.<br/><br/>Does Sherlock Holmes ever exercise his deductive powers? Indeed he does. But he never quite explains them in any detail. Instead, the movie borrows from Law and Order: Crime Scene Unit or whatever it's called. The explanation is zipped through with such alacrity that the viewer is left gaping at the flashing images.<br/><br/>It's full of action, adventure, and mystery. I thought it was a travesty."
"JoeB131","5","4","6","16 July 2012"," Actually better than the last one...
","Although that would be damning with faint praise.<br/><br/>Clearly, the screenwriters this time had actually READ something by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, so I give them credit for getting characters right to a degree.<br/><br/>And we have Noomi Rapace, who is in everything nowadays. Hope she's a fad which wears off soon.<br/><br/>It was better than the last one, absolutely. They had a few pointless action scenes, and some telegraphing, like Holmes giving Watson that adrenal shot, you knew that would be used later.<br/><br/>Downey was better as Holmes this time and Law was more believable as Watson, but frankly, there was only just enough characterization to hand the action scenes on, which were forgettable."

","Missing all the intrigue and light hearted fun of its predecessor, Game of Shadows is quite a mess. While fun at times with plenty of jokes and little things to like here and there, it never seems a cohesive whole. More importantly, it never seems like a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br/><br/>From the start (actually, before the start) we know who our nemesis is: Professor James Moriarty. A fiendish name accompanied by a wonderfully devilish performance by Jared Harris. That's no problem. What is the problem is that his duel with Holmes seems geared more towards action scenes than a well paced mystery. Holmes fights in slow mo, dodges cannon shells in a forest, is skewered by a large industrial fish hook, and survives a flurry of machine gun fire in a train. This movie is a victim of sequelitis: it knows it has to be bigger and badder, but doesn't know how to do it while keeping the core content the same.<br/><br/>Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/ to read the complete review!"
"ariella1972","1","6","11","30 July 2012"," Did people who gave 10 stars actually watch this?
","I LOVED the first Sherlock with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. They had such chemistry and fun with suspense and mystery that I was dying to see the sequel.<br/><br/>As great as they were in the first, they were that bad in the second. It was like watching two amateur actors. Of course, the writing wasn't much to work with. One would think, being a Sherlock Holmes story, there would be mystery or suspense. Even at times an amazing observation out of Holmes. But none of that occurred. The best they did was Holmes imagining a sequence of events before they occurred. And when it actually happened, he was usually wrong.<br/><br/>Also, I would like it explained to me how a man subsisting on cocaine and formaldehyde can beat up four goons in an alley? Really, maybe he was doing meth and had some sort of crazy energy. Or perhaps the makers of the movie thought that they could infuse a bit of Iron Man here. No wait, even Iron Man needs some sort of mechanical help to achieve these results.<br/><br/>The story line is non-existent and leaked in spurts to the audience through explanation rather than involving us in the discovery of twists and turns. We know in the first 15 minutes or so that Moriarty is behind everything. And what is he behind? Arms acquisition and making money off of it. Again the same theme of several modern day super hero movies and action films.<br/><br/>The whole thing left me thinking, have these people ever actually picked up Arthur Conan Doyle's work. If you were involved in the production of this film, you may not know this, but he made Sherlock Holmes up. I am happy to say I have his entire collection unabridged of Sherlock mysteries upstairs. I checked it out of the library today because I feel so dirty after watching this horrible use of Sherlock that I need to be infused with the real Sherlock or life just won't be balanced correctly.<br/><br/>By the way, I thought I'd let my kids watch it, because, after all it was, I thought, a lot of action. They turned it off after half an hour with these comments: ""It was boring"", ""I didn't understand what it was about"", and ""Could Sherlock Holmes see the future?"" LOL.<br/><br/>Rent it if you are a die hard fan and just have to see it for yourself, but don't expect much and get ready to dust off your library card."

","I give the movie a 3 because I like Downey and Law, but the plot is so garbaged up with political and social agendas that I couldn't enjoy the movie. Just more gay-ism being shoved on the public. Downey should refuse to do another sequel unless another director takes over. Its obvious Guy (Gay) Ritchie, the director is using his movies to push his gay lifestyle agenda. I believe that the Sherlock Holmes franchise could be like the Mission Impossible franchise, but instead of trying to put together good movies they use a good movie to push their social beliefs on the rest of us. I say boycott Ritchie and the producers. It was a waste of good acting. Downey is a great actor and should take his talents elsewhere."

","When the first Sherlock Holmes came onto the big screen, I couldn't have been more excited. I love Sherlock Holmes and missed the old mystery movies, so I naturally saw that movie on opening night and was so disappointed. The pacing wasn't good and the characters were pretty lame besides Holmes and Watson. When I saw the trailer to Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows I looked at my fiancé and commented on how the first film wasn't exciting and did it really need a sequel? But much to my surprise Sherlock Holmes made number one over the weekend and stayed at number one for two weeks. When I went to work, people who saw the film said they absolutely loved it and it was a really good movie. So I gave in deciding that maybe the sequel listened to the complaints of the first movie and fixed them and over all it worked a lot better the second time around, thankfully they got rid of Rachel McAdams' character so we don't have to deal with her annoyance. But our favorite duo Holmes and Watson are back working the cases with a few new faces.<br/><br/>Irene Adler delivers a package to Dr. Hoffmanstahl, Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a hidden bomb which is prevented from detonating by the intervention of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes takes the letter and disposes of the bomb while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. Holmes later finds Hoffmanstahl assassinated. Some time later, Dr. Watson where Holmes discloses that he is investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks, and business acquisitions, that he has connected to Moriarty. Holmes meets with the gypsy Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he had taken from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can interrogate her. Now Watson and Holmes must find the next series of bombs and prevent another assassination from happening.<br/><br/>I have two complaints, one being that the plot is a little complicated at times. Why not make it a little kid friendly as I loved these stories when I was a child, so why not have a new generation introduced to one of literature's greatest characters? Also that while Downey is certainly having a lot more fun with playing Holmes, he's getting a little irritating as he just won't cut Watson any slack on his honeymoon. But the special effects I must say were astonishing and the running in the woods while being shot in scene was visually a treat. The acting is very good and it was fun seeing how Holmes liked to play games with Watson. I would say this film was a lot better than the first Sherlock Holmes, this had a lot more tension and was much more better paced. It could've been a little shorter and simpler, but things that I'm willing to look past very quickly. I would recommend this movie, the first one was a bore, this one won't disappoint. There are great laughs, fun action and a tricky plot that never lets you go and keeps you guessing as well as a terrific ending that I won't give away, you'll just have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Having become a bit of a cinematic icon, the world's greatest detective returns in this epic sequel and movie adaptation of the classic books. Now, shall we proceed in this most fascinating entry of the detective saga.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes has been on the trail of his archenemy Professor James Moriarty and, as expected, Watson is once again been dragged into Sherlock's manhunt. Tensions between countries are rising and Moriarty is up to something terrible. Employing his usual tactics and coming up with new strategies, Sherlock sets out to put a halt to his enemy's plans once and for all.<br/><br/>The old charm is back and so is the great comedy as well as the intense action. The action scenes are a real spectacle, again employing great camera work and slow-motion that intensifies the battles. Once again, we have a mystery that really messes with your head and, as Sherlock once put it, even the smallest detail has a good value of information. Moriarty proves to be Sherlock's intellectual equal, which further raises the challenge for our dear detective.<br/><br/>This ingenious endeavor proves to be as great as the first film. It's recommended that you sit back, relax, and watch as Sherlock Holmes delves into this deadly Game of Shadows."

","Another film where: stuff happens; stuff happens with people being cool happens; people run about and it sort of looks a bit cool while stuff happens; some guy knows something better than some other guy knows something - but I didn't quite get what it was what he knew better than the other guy who didn't know it - and because he knows it a bit better something blows up and then the guy who knew more stuff looks way cool and; after an hour in I have absolutely no clue what the plot is; and after an hour in I have absolutely no idea what the plot is and I don't care and; after an hour I switch off the film because I've been watching for an hour and if I don't know what the plot is I probably won't actually find out and I've got the sneaking suspicion that what plot there was - presumably at some stage there was actually some story that someone had written and was readable in some form as a narrative that had a beginning, a middle and an end and there were some characters in there who had some sort of motive for doing stuff and that stuff got done - got completely negotiated out by a big team of screen writers who are paid a very large amount of money to massage every drop of story out of the script before it makes it to the shoot so that all that remains is people running about while cool stuff happens and Sherlock Holmes spends about 10 minutes with his top off in make-up then meets a gypsy in France who he had just met in London (I'm just guessing at the cities)...<br/><br/>Aside from the gypsy this describes about 97% of the action films that I watch today and I'm totally sick of it. The first one was good. Really it was. It had a decent story, it built up slowly, it developed the characters, it had some good action scenes and then ended with a climax. I was looking forward to this; I'd held off watching it for over a week until I could guarantee a free two hours... and after I'd seen 5 minutes I knew it was Batman The Dark Night all over again. I walked out of the cinema on that one and I vowed never to go back. I haven't.<br/><br/>I totally understand why people give these diabolical films good marks - they watch them, don't really have any idea what is going on, kind of enjoy the stuff that happens while people do cool stuff and run around and then think that the plot was actually really subtle and sophisticated. Ergo it must have been good. NO. You want a subtle and sophisticated plot go read the Magus. Humanity is doomed. Bring on the rapture :)"

I don't want you bore you by listing all the ways this movie is terrible but immediately you will feel like you have no idea what is going on, who these people are and what this movie ""is playing at"" (to quote from the movie). It puts the ""Flash"" in flashback. I have never seen 1/4 second flashback scene cuts until now. If you don't have slow motion, just forget it. There is no explanation, just a bunch of cuts of stuff happening and good luck keeping it all in your brain. It is proved that these kind of cuts push each image out of memory as the next one comes along so you will feel really left out on this one.<br/><br/>The acting it so self-conscious as to be tedious. It is classic R. Downey, Jr. He has always been so full of himself and it just flows out all over the place here. It is embarrassing to watch. J.Law does not help here, either. I was hoping he could save this morass but his character is almost as bad as Downey.<br/><br/>In short (too late for that?), don't waste your time unless you really need more from R.Downey's drug induced bad acting.

","Has anyone noticed how LOUD motion pictures have become? Ear-splitting special effects always signify empty Hollywood pot boilers, and this installment is certainly no different. As fantastic an actor as Robert Downey is, I feel that the biggest flaw in this film is the casting. He's so short, so dark, and so grungy that he reminds me of a young Al Pacino in ""Panic in Needle Park"" playing the heroin addict. Comparing him to the Sherlock Holmes versions of the past (like the incomparable Basil Rathbone) made me cringe. And paring him with Jude Law only added to the enormous mismatch (that same sex dance scene at the ball made him look like Downey's gay lover -- I can't believe that in Victorian England that this little stunt didn't even raise an eyebrow!! In those times, he would have been sent to prison at hard labor for the rest of his life). Then, all of those life saving measures that ""Doctor"" Law administered on Holmes hadn't even been INVENTED for another hundred years!!! Chest compressions with a direct shot of adrenalin into the heart? Not. It reminded me a rewrite of ""ER,"" as out of sync as dinosaurs walking down Madison Avenue, a suspension of disbelief that I was simply unable to make.

"bob the moo","Null","4","7","26 December 2011"," Really too silly for its own good but fun and occasionally has good spark to it
","I quite enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes films, for all its limitations and irreverence it was pretty fun, so I was always going to return for the inevitable sequel. The good news is that the sequel sees everyone from the first film returning (albeit some of them only for a short time before being used as plot device), so I was hoping that the film would retain the strengths of the first, manage the slightly silly edge better and bring in Moriarty well. It doesn't quite manage to pull all of this off but it does have a decent enough stab at it, although it is unfortunate that the volume and the silliness appears to have been turned up from the first film.<br/><br/>The silliness is the thing that bugged me the most here because there is a fine line between having a sense of comedic fun that enhances the story and action, and a sense of silly daftness that negatively affects the same. The first film got the balance pretty good and made for an entertaining romp, this sequel overdoes it a little bit and at times the comedy is too silly for too long to avoid doing damage to the sense of fun. The same happens with the slow-motion ""bullet time"" effects – they are very nice touch but when they are used excessively they become less effective and a little bit part of the problem. Fortunately the majority of the film gets the sense of fun just right. The action is noisy but exciting and the lack of any sense of real danger or consequence is balanced out by the enjoyment of it all.<br/><br/>The addition of Moriarty is handled pretty well. OK in a blockbuster such as this there was never going to be a real clash of minds but there is a sense of intellectual game-playing between them that works. In particular I thought Harris was very well cast and got his performance just right throughout. The same can't quite be said for Downey. I enjoyed him again here but he overplays too often and gets dangerously close to spilling over into ""Captain Jack"" excess at times; not his fault totally perhaps but at times he is part of the ""silliness"" setting in. Law isn't as good as in the first film, mainly because the material doesn't focus on the comic interplay between the two characters as much – it still happens, but it happens within bigger events rather than being something of its own. The loss of this detracted from the film to a certain extent. In terms of supporting cast I thought McAdams got a rather rough deal – not only used as a plot device but a plot device that wasn't required! The addition of Rapace is good although she maybe takes it a bit too seriously at times. Good to see the series keeping a link to the character of Lestrade as well, even though he is in it for seconds and no more. Watson's wife I could have done without while Stephen Fry was a good gag done too often.<br/><br/>Overall then A Game of Shadows is perhaps too silly for its own good but it mostly manages to replicate the sense of fun that the first film had. The additions are mostly good and I will return for the third film (there almost certainly will be I imagine) but I do hope that they can prevent this series becoming Pirates of the Caribbean and instead focus on the core strengths that it has and play to those."

The gimmickry present reminds one of how the works of Arthur Conan Doyle should *not* be turned into CSI, Batman, or James Bond. And sadly other recent works within the ""Sherlock franchise"" fall prey to this evil temptation (eg: the BBC's recent Sherlock series). Save your brain. Save your money. Keep your lunch in your stomach. Avoid this film. Instead seek out works with Jeremy Brett. Other portrayals by Robert Downey Jr., even by Benedict Cumbersplatch / Smebersmoch / Hoobersmich / Cumberbatch, are rather akin to shallow harlotry in my view. Mostly unconvinced. Forced. Contrived.

"kunalkhandwala","9","5","10","19 December 2011"," Back to Conan Doyle's time....
","When Guy Ritchie introduced us to his version of the greatest detective, his slick, stylized action, Victorian theme and intelligent story were distinctive impressions he left along with Robert Downey Jr.'s entertaining depiction of the protagonist. As much as everyone enjoyed the convoluted plot, the transformational landscape of London, the chemistry between actors and their case solving skills, it was frightening to imagine the prospect of a chance encounter between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty that the film left us hanging on to. Guy Ritchie did set great expectations riding on a duel between Holmes and the Professor. However, this 'Game of Shadows' turns out to be a stellar sequel that has successfully engrained the greatness of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works. What makes it even better is of course, Robert Downey Jr. <br/><br/>Dr. Watson moves on with real life as his wedding draws closer while Holmes delves deeper into his investigation linking international terrorism acts with Prof. Moriarty. Holmes is still experimenting with chemicals, drugs, botany and camouflage costumes to aid his skills but with such a nemesis, he will require much more than just that. At Watson's stag party, Holmes encounters the fortune telling gypsy Sim (Noomi Rapace) whose brother wrote a note. Holmes' acute observation reveals the lurking danger of an assassin whose acrobatic skills provide a thrilling action sequence at the venue. The following day, after Watson's wedding, Holmes is invited for a tete-a-tete with the Professor where they initiate the game to overcome each other. The first phase would thus involve saving Watson's life aboard his honeymoon train where a cross-dressed Holmes wreaks havoc. Thereafter, it is in Paris that they find Sim, who offers clues to a band of revolutionaries that turned extreme. They are assisting Moriarty's sinister plans of igniting war among European nations. In a subsequent investigation at an arms factory, Holmes is captured by Moriarty, who reveals his plans till Watson gets the better of his gun-man after blasting a light-house. After the most visually dazzling escape and recovery, Holmes deduces that the upcoming peace summit would be Moriarty's ultimate opportunity to spark war. Over the Reichenbach Falls at the Peace summit, the ultimate showdown involved the unravelling of the undercover assassin in the ballroom whereas outside, Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty sat down for an ultimate game of chess in the shadows of mystery. <br/><br/>The highlight of this film is undoubtedly the cloak and dagger rivalry between the two masterminds who play their bishops and knights throughout the movie on a game board that is Europe. Make no mistake that Professor Moriarty is the most formidable criminal mind and the grandfather of most villains. But when Sherlock Holmes unravels each mystery with his deductions based on acute observation of things around him, he tends to make you feel smarter till the very moment when he explains it. Thus introducing the dawn moment upon you. Aided by his able accomplice who helps navigate his own darkness and idiosyncrasy, Holmes builds a much stronger bond with Watson as they wage higher stakes in this game. Their trust and dependence on each other creates more than just chemistry between the characters. Their 'partnership' is tantamount to their individual talents. One, a mastermind at unravelling mysteries and another who can balance the madness of Sherlock Holmes. <br/><br/>Jude Law feels no aura of great characters around him. He stands comfortably in familiar shoes, doing his best to support or counter the eccentricities of Holmes. However, he has managed to depict the rougher edges of Dr. Watson who can now dodge bullets, fire mortars and deduce observations as well. <br/><br/>There couldn't have been a better match for Professor Moriarty than Jared Harris (Mad Men). Not only does he have the suave, grace, aura and sophistication of the great criminal mastermind but he can also portray the coldness of a sinister villain. Just as Conan Doyle had described in his books, Moriarty carries with himself, an authority that is based on intellect, power and wealth but always walks across as a shadow. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is a fabulous Sherlock Holmes. Not only did he improvise on his first act, he has now made himself a mandatory attachment to the franchise. Conan Doyle's Sherlock was always the composed mastermind detective but RDJ makes Sherlock a whole lot of fun while maintaining the essence of the character. As the other Holmes, Stephen Fry provides more comic relief in the battle of masterminds.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer yet again delivers an exemplary soundtrack while the cinematography by Philippe Rousselot captures the detailed art direction of 19th century Europe, the slow motion action sequences: especially the escape from the arms factory.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie had some great writing to enable his nimble directorial abilities. Partly inspired by Conan Doyle's 'The Last Chapter', 'Game of Shadows' is still an invention in intelligent story-telling. As Ritchie departs from the original Sherlock Holmes we grew up watching, he manages to revive Conan Doyle's remarkable story-telling with a focus on powerful characterization. Then, by picking up the best of today's technology and setting it in the 19th century, he also succeeds in creating magical sequences. His take on Reichenbach falls is stupendous even though we know what is coming. The intriguing plot has a lot of witty humor that at times will be hard for Americans to follow but will be adored by those on the other side. Robert Downey Jr. adds spontaneity to it all and draws applause from the audience which is still bemused by an actor who can play both Ironman and Sherlock Holmes equally well.<br/><br/>Sometimes, sequels stand on their own without the need to draw comparisons. Such is the case with 'A Game of Shadows'. With its action, intriguing plot and witty dialogues, this one is a complete entertainer and that, is an elementary deduction my dear Watson.<br/><br/>8.89 on a scale of 1-10."
"tedg","Null","7","16","17 December 2011"," Intermediaries
","This is a new genre, I think. You go to it not so much for what it is, but what it points to, and what filters have been applied. Perhaps the genre was cemented with the Depp Pirate movies which had noise and story, but both were presented through a filter of ironic humor. That's what we went for.<br/><br/>There was nothing new about that, except that they added this bit about the acting. Depp's pirate is delivered to us, not as a traditional actor would, nor even a comic. (Think about how Monty Python did pirates.) The innovation with Depp was that he delivered the character by going around the barn and filtering it through multiple culturally-rooted references. That business about Keith Richard was just a way of naming this prismatic presentation style.<br/><br/>The only other male actor capable of this is Downey. He has another franchise where he plays things the ordinary way, the Bruce-Willis-winking way. Here, he can out-Depp Depp. It is because Depp's sponsors have commercial intent outside of the film, in amusement parks and associated merchandise. Downey's sponsors keep it all in the film; they just want as many viewer dollars as possible.<br/><br/>So they can leverage three other properties of the film by this overt filter method. Of these three, one has appeared before, probably best identified with the Bond franchise: the extreme situations. These are not effects like those of 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Avatar,' which enhance the glory of the world we see. They are stage shows, more like a Penn and Teller Las Vegas act, where they become characters whose presentation is distorted for our amusement.<br/><br/>But they combine it with a specific notion of the camera, an explicit awareness that the camera is there and that it has been spliced onto your mind. We first saw this a very long time ago, and I suppose we have Sacha Vierny, then Chris Doyle and then the incubator of Hong Kong films before it became a staple in 'The Matrix.' Here, we have close examination of the details of the chaos around our characters. We even have Downey running through strategic events before a fight. These are not happenings in a fight as much as they are our anticipated visions.<br/><br/>Lots of films have these three intermediary type folds these days. But this franchise has something the others do not: a well understood, almost archetypal story foundation. This isn't just a character to play with, like Ledger's Joker, it is a whole story about storytelling, our first and still strongest. So Downey can honk around within a larger honk-structure that the filmmaker is managing. He had this in 'Tropic Thunder' but that drew on thinner, more comedic foundations. It never referenced war, rather starting with intermediary: war movies<br/><br/>The Holmes foundation gives us access to the idea of understanding and stating the logic behind why things happen and what moves people. That's gold in this business of building layers to look at the layers that look at things, especially when our on-screen surrogate is so deeply embedded in the story.<br/><br/>An example of how this pays off: throughout the film, our Sherlock works out all the moves of the fight to come, and is therefore victorious. Midway through the film, his predictions are cut short when Rapace's character surprises us and him by unexpected intercession, so that sets us up to read these predictions and predict how they will play out.<br/><br/>At the end, we have a battle of minds between Holmes and Moriarty where what we see is not the fight itself, but their shared anticipation (dare I say a game of shadows?) of what will happen and how each will outwit the other. The fistfight is there of course. So is a chess game. So is a similar game of war involving monarchs and their strutting ambassadors. So is a deeper game being played involving finance, power and influence. And - later - we learn so is a game to con Watson (and thereby us) into thinking Holmes dies.<br/><br/>(There are touchstones in the original Holmes stories for each of these.)<br/><br/>That all four of these filtering processes have the same, coherent style, even down to the film-page metaphor of the credits and the comically heavy score. But notice that final detail: there is no reason in the story for our seeing Holmes' strategy and not seeing the whole thing (with the oxygen mask). Nothing in the story, no strategy in the game, would be changed if Watson knew.<br/><br/>But that would defy the overarching fold, which no modern film can ignore: noir. Watson has been captured and manipulated (on his wedding night!) for our amusement. So if we are playing a game, then the film has to keep from him and us a key element.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

"dtucker86","Null","3","5","26 December 2011"," Watson as he should be portrayed
","This may shock a lot of people but I actually liked Watson in this movie better then I liked Holmes. Jude Law does an awesome job and I think that he captured Watson the way that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wanted him to be portrayed. Most people think of Nigel Bruce as Watson from the early Holmes films with Basil Rathbone. He was portrayed simply as a bumbling old fool, the comic relief. Doctor Watson was portrayed in the stories as a loyal friend, a skilled doctor and a brave man in a crisis. Robert Downey's interpretation of Holmes may offend some purists but it passed muster with me (one small quibble, Holmes always has to wear at least one disguise in his movies and in this case I thought he made an ugly woman!). I don't think that I have ever seen a Holmes movie where he kicked as much ass as he does in this one, its like Rambo is playing Sherlock Holmes. We don't get to see Holmes really utilize his intellectual gifts until almost the end of the movie. SPOILER ALERT This movie follows Doyle's original story The Final Problem where Holmes and Moriarty fight at the waterfall and both apparently fall to their death."
"Reel_starz","6","3","5","24 December 2011"," Tedious, my dear Watson
","The world's favorite detective has gotten a makeover. Gone is Arthur Conan Doyle's intelligent, resourceful, eccentric creation, and in his place, we have gotten a swashbuckling, wisecracking, (still) eccentric action hero in the vein of Jack Sparrow. This is Sherlock Holmes for a 21st century audience, complete with all the explosions, gunfights and hand-to-hand combat you've always wanted from the 19th century British investigator but have never before gotten. At least that seems to be the train of thought taken by Guy Ritchie, who first introduced audiences to this updated Sherlock in 2009 in a film that was fairly successful, particularly considering it went head-to-head with James Cameron's Avatar juggernaut. Certainly, Ritchie's take is a breath of fresh air after so many decades of deerskin caps and frock coats, and in fact, many consider it to be more faithful in spirit to Doyle's original intentions, yet there is something missing from this sequel , which follows Sherlock and the ever-faithful Dr. John Watson as they tackles one of their most famed nemeses, Dr. Moriarty, played with devilish charm by Jared Harris. Hijinks, naturally, ensue.<br/><br/>Ritchie sets their adventures, which takes them from London to Paris, Germany and, ultimately, Switzerland, against a perpetually but appropriately grimy, dour backdrop that reeks of the industrialism of the mid-to-late 1800s. Though this tale takes place in an entirely different era from his usual works, it is still distinctly a Guy Ritchie movie, bloated with his regular stylizations and love of slow-motion. These flourishes sometimes work, as in segments that show Sherlock utilizing his almost superhuman powers of observation; other times, like in a massive action set piece in a forest, it feels like something lifted out of a Zack Snyder movie, which is not a compliment. Still, most of the action scenes strive for some level of originality, boosted significantly by a gleefully ominous and dissonant score from Hans Zimmer. However, beneath all the visual bravura, the movie feels oddly soulless, treating its characters like pieces in a game of chess. Despite a clever ending that features a couple of nice throwbacks to earlier moments in the film, the plot is cluttered, and it often seems as though the writers were making things up as they went along.<br/><br/>The cast features several impressive names, but with the exception of Jared Harris, who, interestingly enough, is the least well-known of all the major performers, none of them are particularly engaging. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Sherlock and Watson, respectively. They have a pleasant, natural chemistry with each other, but the script never really allows their dynamic to progress beyond the exasperated but reluctantly loyal sidekick babysitting a mad, erratic genius. Downey Jr. has plenty of charisma, as he displayed so gloriously in his ""comeback"" role as Tony Stark in Iron Man three years ago, but one wonders when he might explore roles that stretch his range and acting chops more, as Stark and Sherlock both feel like two sides of the same sarcastic narcissist coin. However, most disappointing is Noomi Rapace, who is wasted in the role of Madam Simza Heron, a gypsy who is supposed to help the main duo in their quest to foil Moriarty's dastardly plan and who possesses all the personality and depth of a plot device. Deservedly rocketing to fame after her excellent performance as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy, she is much too talented to spend an entire movie (her first Hollywood blockbuster, no less) essentially standing around and taking orders while everyone else gets to actually partake in the action.<br/><br/>One of the main attractions of Sherlock Holmes has always been his relationship with Watson, which is often depicted with some degree of a homoerotic subtext, and Guy Ritchie's version is no different. In fact, the movie seems to care so much about this relationship, to the detriment of all others, including the one between Watson and his wife, that at some point during the film, I began to abstractly wonder what it might be like if the film-makers just defied convention, took a risk and let them go beyond bromance and into romance, even a closeted one, given the time period. Roll your eyes and scoff if you will, but I would've accepted anything that might have livened up this humdrum affair."
"MosHr","4","32","104","14 December 2011"," A trainwreck. Movie about buffoonery, not Sherlock Holmes. Should have called it buffoonic Captain Britannica
","There is an uneasy vibe one gets from the trailer of the new Sherlock Holmes movie, a vibe that the movie might suck and dear god does it suck and suck hard. Where do I start? The awful grating British accent of Downey which falls apart in that sped up, manic tone that Sherlock Holmes has throughout the movie or the super-hero Sherlock Holmes that can do the entire Jackie Chan routine in his head or that the entire plot is dumb as a rock, especially for a movie with the words Sherlock Holmes in its title.<br/><br/>The movie does feel high budget. There are expensive looking shots and special effects that litter the movie as the Europe-trotting duo go on their adventure. However, the main theme of the movie is costumed buffoonery - Holmes disguises himself as a woman (for some weak plot points), Watson has a bachelor party, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson squabble like an old couple while we get bombarded with a bevy of unlikable buffoons like Holmes' brother and a squawky Prof Moriatry. All of this buffoonery going on in a paper thin plot, a plot that feels like its been lifted from Captain America; Germans and weapons. Captain American Britannica would be a more accurate title than Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>There are bombings because it seems like they had a budget for a bomb exploding and wanted some costumed bomb explosions. The plot doesn't tell a story but more like puts all the set-pieces into a time line. This is a movie to avoid unless you can forget all the annoying problems with movie and go watch it for the explosions."

","What a great movie, kept me entertained. It was a smart, clever, action-packed, suspenseful film with unpredictable twists. Typical of critics to give it low reviews, my advice to them, go back to your boring, crying, dramatic, senseless movies i.e. Young Adult and leave these movies to us.<br/><br/>As a Film major it surprises me how many good films are badly reviewed. Just because the story doesn't have someone crying intensely or it's not really realistic they give it a bad review. If I remember correctly, movies are made to ""entertain"" people, not bore them to death. Last week, we went to see Young Adult and I swear it was probably the grayest most mind numbing movie I've seen this year.<br/><br/>What critics should start listening to is the audiences.

"musanna-ahmed","8","4","8","21 December 2011"," Oh, how we've missed you Holmes.
","Sherlock Holmes is back; this time he is pit into a game of shadows against Professor Moriarty, admirably underplayed by Jared Harris. En route to locating Moriarty, Holmes and Watson are launched into a number of dangerous missions, from fighting Moriarty's men on a train to tracking the factory in Germany from which Moriarty had bought a large number of shares. All of the missions come complete with thrilling set pieces done the Guy Ritchie way – camera-work putting his effective overcranking and high speed photography on display with the bonus comic moments (the outfits Holmes has on, especially the one in the train fight sequence) as well as humorous dialogue. In a way, the comparison between this and the first film is similar to a comparison between Ritchie's earlier films Lock Stock and Snatch – because it worked the first time, Ritchie follows the same formula but the second time he attempts to give more of the humour and the action to the audience. That perfectly works in Sherlock Holmes 2, this is seriously good entertainment. I have read a lot of comments over the web where people are complaining that Ritchie's hasn't made something faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic work. Yes. A more faithful adaptation for Doyle fans is the BBC series Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch. That should be seen for the die-hard fans of the great English detective, but for anyone looking for entertainment, which is the real purpose of this film, Sherlock Holmes 2 is one to watch."

"jadepietro","5","5","11","20 December 2011"," Nothing Up My Sleeve ( Or In My Head ), Dear Watson!
","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>Those crazy cut-ups are back! Yes, in the tradition of Laurel & Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and Martin & Lewis comes Holmes and Watson, once again in a rip-roaring comedy adventure romp that brings thrills and action to the forefront while leaving reason and logic in its dust. This sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, continues the revisionist mode that made the first film so very popular. While it's not to my personal purist taste, the film is mildly diverting but elementarily unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Yes, it's more of the same formula as the last installment: a mystery is afoot, solved not so much by the powers of reason and deduction. Instead, it's the explosions, gunfire, disguises, comic shenanigans, and some minor sleuthing on the side with a decidedly modern twist for today's younger audiences that embodies this Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as the resourceful Sherlock and his doctor friend and their gimmicky misadventures ensue.<br/><br/>The plot this time around concerns the evil Professor Moriarty ( a formidable Jared Harris ) who wants to profit from the war any illegal way he can. It's not that deep or though- provoking. In fact, it's simplistic, obvious, and not the least bit involving. The script has its creative limits, with its anachronistic joking and puns. Previously the first film introduced elements of the the occult which made that film hackneyed and tired. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows leaves those elements behind and now it tries to wisely plays up the political drama and intrigue on a more realistic scale. Unfortunately, this sequel is even more simplistic, obvious, and less interesting than its predecessor. <br/><br/>Of course, it's still up to Holmes and Watson to stop the villainous professor. Of course, it's still the exquisitely detailed sets and high octane set pieces that are the series' trademarks to success. Of course, it's still the frenzied editing of the film that invigorates the mystery. But the film, though technically adept, is a muddled mess in the script department. The true culprit is not Moriarty, it's screenwriters Michele and Kieran Mulroney who are to blame for their less than stellar contribution to this series.<br/><br/>All of the expert direction is by Guy Ritchie, who again helms this franchise. But he cannot disguise the gaping holes of logic and inconclusive storytelling. Ritchie knows how to keep the action flowing with his stylish kinetic movement and stop action techniques ( which become far too repetitive and overstay their welcome ). Nothing ever lulls. This is robust filmmaking and there's no time to think about any loopholes with the script or its characters. It's ADHD time, fast, loose, and impulsive. Keep it moving by all means possible. <br/><br/>Perhaps one sequence, a beautifully choreographed montage of still images and action shots, provides a clue to the film's visceral adrenaline rush and its lack of emotional connection and build-up. The high point of the film comes as our heroes try to escape an attack in the forest, bullets ricochet off the trees in an almost slo-mo ballet of sorts as the figures weave and dance around the exploding shards of wood. The fragmenting in this woodland environ is exquisitely photographed by Philippe Rousselot and enhanced by the Hans Zimmer's musical score. One can admire the imagery in this scene and many others. Yet this overall effect continually undercuts any tension or suspense and distances the moviegoer from any real integration to the non-stop action on the screen. <br/><br/>The actors seem to be relishing their roles and hoping the moviegoers like the film's tongue- in-cheek humor and daredevil stunts. Their ""bromance"" continues in the capable hands of pros like Downey and Law. Their chemistry remains palpable and their comic timing cannot be faulted. While there are some weaknesses with some of the other cast members, particularly an underused Noomi Rapace and overindulgent Stephen Fry as mere comic relief, they really never advance the plot but they don't interfere with the escapist mood of the film either. <br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a game of deception, but not of shadows as its title may suggest. Instead, the film plays a game of smoke and mirrors with the audience, trying to grab their attention although it really has no substance or clear vision in its empty head. Its sleight-of-hand may manipulate some critics or moviegoers with its cheap thrills, but its visual tricks are slight indeed.

","After the surprise hit that was Sherlock Holmes in 2009 Warner Brothers quickly commissioned a sequel. And like most sequels A Game of Shadows follows the rule of do everything the works in the first film and do it bigger. So has Warner Brothers got a new Batman or Harry Potter series or is it going to sink? In 1891 France and Germany have been suffering from a series of bombings and about to go war with each other because of it. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) is investigating Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), a mathematics professor, a friend of the British Prime Minister and the centre of a international conspiracy which involves bombings, assassinations and business takeovers. Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) is about to marry his fiancé Mary (Kelly Reilly) but after Moriarty tries to kill him both Sherlock and Watson have to go to Europe to stop Moriarty and the continent going to war with the help of Gypsy psychic Sim (Noomi Rapace).<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie can be a visually impressive director and seems to have joined Warner Brothers list of go to directors, along with Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder. But Ritchie is a director who needs to be kept on a tight leash because he can over stylise and over complicate films. That's what happened with Revolver and even with Rocknrolla which a less is more approach was more appropriate. He has fallen into that trap again with his Sherlock Holmes sequel, the film that did save his career. The plot should have been simple, Moriarty is buying up a range of industries could he could profit from a world war. But Ritchie and his screenwriters seem to ignore this, only providing the audience necessary information until the very last minute and this was a film that needed to be more torter. Many elements could have been shaved and made the film trim action comedy in the 1 hour 45 minute to 1 hour 50 minute range. The action scenes are still impressive but it seems that Ritchie had to make everything bigger, such as the sequence in the forest where artillery is being fired at our heroes. A scene I personally really liked was the final fight. The whole plan itself is even bigger then Sherlock Holmes which was a mystery. This time Sherlock has to stop a war that could engulf the world.<br/><br/>Downey and Law are still a strong double act and their banter is funny and natural. They continue as Downey being the ecstatic and Law the straight and it was believable that they worked together for years with their love hate relationship. I personally like how Watson is made even more confident and capable as both a fighter and investigator. He is almost like a protégé for Holmes. The homoerotism between the two not even hidden or subtle and they as well sleep together: its what they really want. But in the film Sherlock does get something wrong, and seeing that he is a man who never gets anything wrong that should have played on his conscience and cause self-doubt. But that's just me.<br/><br/>Rapace is a very talented actress and it was a coup for the production to get someone like her, made famous from the Swedish Millennium Trilogy. But the picture the producer saying, 'we got that really talented Swedish actress to be in Sherlock Holmes 2' 'but what's she going to do?' 'ehh We'll think of something'. Despite a fun scene where she throws knives at an assassin she does not do much to help the blokes, she is just there to be a token female character. Her part could have been written out and it would not have made a different to the plot and despite Rapace's best efforts she was wasted.<br/><br/>A number of big actors were linked to role of Moriarty, Daniel Day Lewis, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt and Javier Bardam being some of them. It was a plum role for the relevantly unknown Harris to get and he does a good job throughout as the villain. His particular highlights was a dark scene when he tortures Sherlock and the final clash of minds between the two characters during a chess game. I wished the filmmakers played more of the idea that Moriarty is both Sherlock's intellectual equal and also an anti-Sherlock, someone willing to use his intelligence to commit crimes. He should have been a dark Sherlock, willing to kill and torture and do anything to achieve his goals.<br/><br/>Overall Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is entertaining enough and a deeply faulted film. I wish it was a bit more of a mystery, a complex case Sherlock and Watson have to solve then an action adventure comedy.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10"
"educallejero","7","2","3","18 February 2020"," Slightly worse than the original... but good
","Even more full of action sequences that scream ""big Hollywood production"", this is not as good.
The actors are as efficient in their roles, even with the small changes the story has (Watson is about to get married and with that the duo adventures).
The plot takes us outside Great Britain at some point, and the movie takes a hit visually when we part ways with the Victorian period. Besides, more characters are presented (all ""meh"") and the scale of the story gets continental, which makes it a bit forced.<br/><br/>But all of this is in service of the villain of this story, the Professor Moriarty, and here is the biggest difference with the original. In the other, the villains were ok. But here, the superb Jared Harris gives his character a malicious presence that matches only his genius level intelligence, making the perfect Sherlock adversary. And yes, the plot gets too big and forced, but also ultra epic, and still perfectly told by Ritchie. Again with an amazing conclusion, it makes every 'boring' second in the other acts count. Also, visually and in dialogue, gets to an incredible level (with insightful but cynic words about the inevitability of War, and the conclusion of the battle of the minds between the two geniuses).<br/><br/>The especially bad of this movie was the sexist and criminal role for Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, and the pathetic cast of Stephen Fry as Sherlock's brother, failing miserably in his ""comic relief"" role."
"Offworld_Colony","6","2","3","10 February 2020"," I always like the bastard child in a film series;
","A Game of Shadows is the more OCD, less consistent, more creative, brisker and also somehow more protracted, more exciting and bolder entry. It's more flawed but more rewatchable, it's more confusing but it's far less boring.
It does bizzare things, like killing McAdams' character so early, and in such a way that is intentionally obfuscated, and it's a deeply messy movie with Ritchie's signature excess, to pave over the cracks in his ability.
But RDJ is clearly loving his role and Jared Harris' Moriarty is a fun, if inept, part. The chess match ending sequence(s) rivals anything the British TV show thinks is clever, with a nice nod to the books, and the action has a charged wit and an energy.
These films are well tooled machines and I have to say I'd be excited for the cheeky retro-modern escapades in a third entry."
"josephrygaard","7","2","3","2 December 2019"," Before Watching: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)
","""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" (2011) is the second Sherlock Holmes-movie, and quite extravagant. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows takes up its plot from where the prequel left off but is also somewhat independent. The major benefit from watching the previous instalment is the character relationships, not so much the underlying plot, which is explained thoroughly within the movie. Depending on the taste of the viewer, this added depth could be both trivial and the whole difference, but it would be subjectively recommended.<br/><br/>In terms of contest, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows takes a slightly different approach than what the first movie established. Here, the mystery is slightly changed into a cat and mouse thriller, even though the characteristic clue hunting remains. The stakes are higher and feel more real, and the action is elevated to a substantially new level. The antagonist is well written and more menacing, the scenery is dynamic, and the relationship between Holmes and Watson continues to blossom for added highs and lows. There is also a noticeable growth in the character developments, especially in Holmes, which is very refreshing and touching.<br/><br/>That is not to say this movie is without flaws. Depending on one's taste and interest, the beginning can feel quite slow with a stag party, wedding, and conversations around those events. Now, things surely happen, but it is still delaying the beginning of the real conflict. There is also a certain escape scene which is very stylized and can certainly be perceived as over the top.<br/><br/>All in all, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is thrilling, exciting, and very well done. It is a great sequel which flows straight of its predecessor, and ends in a climactic yet poignant crescendo.<br/><br/>My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

","Sherlock Holmes is back along with the original cast. While there's much to enjoy about this film, it wasn't as good as the original. It felt as if they were trying too hard to equal or better the first film. The film features even more witty dialogue than its predecessor, and more frequent as well. (Wow, that's a LOT of dialogue!). A significant amount of time is wasted on trivial moments, hence the film feels much longer than the already long running time.<br/><br/>Guy Richie is back in the director's chair, yet the film is not nearly as visually stunning as the original. Nor is is nearly as masterful either. And not as interesting a plot either with conveniences left, right and center that diminishes all credibility. The humor at times felt forced and unnecessary. It even felt as if the actors had a difficult time reprising their roles.<br/><br/>The scene at around the halfway mark where the characters escape is INCREDIBLE!!! This scene features some of the most amazing photography and visuals I've seen in a long time. Its a pity Richie did not utilize this style and effects throughout the movie. Its as if he put all his time and effort into this one scene and it was indeed truly awesome!<br/><br/>As for the film itself, yes, it is a well made film, but I'd much rather watch the first film a few times over than give this one a second viewing.

","There are way too many negative reviews so I want to add my piece. This film is GREAT. It has fantastic acting, awesome style, great lines, entertainment, intelligence, and action. It kept going and kept me riveted and I finished it with a smile; the ending was very satisfying. <br/><br/>Of course Downey and Law are the stars here but the other actors were fantastic too. It was nice having McAdams back but also nice that they let her character go- Sherlock Holmes is not a romance. I like the way they gave the story and the characters true evolution and loved the new character, Simza. She was so well played. The gypsies added a fun, new touch and meeting Holmes's brother expanded the world we're meeting. <br/><br/>I loved the period sets and innnovations - from the arms to the oxygen puffer. Labs, Holmes's newly redecorated flat and ""office"", opera, weapons warehouse, horse riding through the woods and sneaking across borders, references to the political situation (accurately showing a world on the brink of WWI, of the modern era) - these all made a well-rounded adventure.<br/><br/>I'm happy to own this movie and shall rewatch it soon."
"tomgillespie2002","4","2","3","17 February 2016"," Bloated sequel
","In 2009 Sherlock Holmes was re-imagined by Guy Ritchie as an ass- kicking and mentally unstable private investigator with a weakness for a variety of mind-altering substances. Played by Robert Downey Jr., Holmes was Iron Man without the vast fortune, super-suit and fashionable beard, but with the same genius-level intellect, capable of predicting the exact outcome of a fight with a foe before the first punch is thrown. Though heavily compromised by Ritchie's sledgehammer subtlety and love for annoying Cockney geezers, it was still an entertaining take on an extremely familiar character, with Downey Jr. at his twitchy best and demonstrating a convincing English accent.<br/><br/>A Game of Shadows, the bloated sequel rushed into production after the international success of its predecessor, turns the doctor from idiosyncratic eccentric to a babbling pantomime. When we meet Holmes, he is rescuing his flame Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) from a bomb intended for somebody else. The package was given to her by the scheming Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), and after her next meeting with him, she disappears. On the eve of his wedding, Dr. Watson (Jude Law) arrives at Baker Street to find Holmes deep into investigating a splurge of seemingly unrelated murders and business acquisitions linked to Moriarty, and at Watson's bachelor party, the two encounter a gypsy woman named Simza (Noomi Rapace), the intended recipient of the letter that accompanied the bomb.<br/><br/>Without any sign of the storytelling flair of the books, A Game of Shadows becomes little more than a series of punch-ups, shoot-outs and inane exchanges between Holmes and his trusted Watson. At one point, the heroes are fired at by an increasingly ridiculous arsenal of machine guns as trees shatter and fireballs explode around them in ultra slo-mo. Any resemblance to one of literatures most beloved characters is lost, and it feels instead like you're watching a movie about The Transporter's British granddad, albeit with a touch more style. Mad Men's Harris is impressive as Holmes's most challenging foe, but Rapace's character is so redundant that she is reduced to just a pretty face for the poster. Shockingly, the main problem is Downey Jr., whose hyperactive shtick is as tiresome as the plot he is caught up in."

","Sherlock Holmes A Game Of Shadows was a great sequel that had great slow motion scenes and awesome fight scenes.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson did a very good job of saving the world from an evil professor named James Moriarty. Stephen Fry who played ""Mycroft Holmes"" Sherlock's brother was funny character that talks very English and he was strange sometimes. I thought that Noomi Repace who played ""Madam Simza heron"" did great job playing that character. And Jared Harris who played ""Professor James Moriarty"" was just as smart as Sherlock Holmes. And I thought the last fight scene in this movie was interesting. Sherlock and Moriaty could think different attacks on each other, that scene was intense.<br/><br/>The train scene was awesome,Sherlock disguised as a girl was funny.

Even the story is compressed for this modernization and is confusing. <br/><br/>There is also that ""new"" look of steel blue, gray, and shine that one can only believe is somehow a subconscious feel for the cold and soulless 21st century. What happened to Technicolor? Isn't anything lush anymore? Is this what the Movie goers of today really want to see on a big screen and in 3D no less?

But, that wasn't a big issue as that was overshadowed by brilliant acting from Jude Law and Jared Harris. I particularly liked Jared Harris as Pro.

It also makes no sense that all that a woman who outsmarted Holmes TWICE be tricked so easily by Moriarty whom Holmes is eventually able to outsmart as well. One could say she did it not cos she was so smart but because of her feminine charms but that would hold true for anyone but Holmes, that's just not who he is. A person with a perceptiveness of a high autistic person can't possibly shut it off over a skirt's as**.<br/><br/>The brilliantly put lines from the last one were also missing, like say ""it's a question of professional integrity! what woman would want to marry a doctor who can't even tell id a man is dead or not"".<br/><br/>well, In the end, I can't say I didn't like the movie.

","I actually liked this one better than the first one, but the word that I think describes this movie best is ""flashy"". It was very entertaining, but I feel like he could have used any name for the characters, because it just doesn't feel like Sherlock Holmes to me. I'm not worrying about tiny details or anything like that, because adaptations should have their freedoms, but while Guy Ritchie's Holmes and Watson share some common traits with ACD's, they just don't feel anything like the original characters. Holmes is some happy-go-lucky ""detective"" who likes to get into brawls and to dress up in strange costumes and obviously has a thing for his friend Watson. His original brilliance looks more like cheap tricks (and they fail a few times, I'm thinking of two of his imagined fights here). Watson just doesn't have enough of the sidekick feel to me, he just does too well with using Holmes' methods. I have to say I absolutely love the soundtrack of both movies, and my favorite part was the ending credits, I greatly admire them. To sum things up, this was a very entertaining movie, though a bit too fond of slow motion and with a blatant disregard for the characters and history (just look at the amount of goofs)."

","After the first movie ended it was crystal clear that a sequel would appear. The story continues almost exactly where the first movie ended and it's quite necessary that one knows the story and characters (or at least reminds oneself of what happened and who is who). Everyone liked the first Holmes because he was different, he was more human, he was fun, he was played by Robert Downey Jr. etc. Now, a question posses itself: how is it possible that a movie with the same cast, with the same director is not as good as it's predecessor? And the answer is simple - THE ATMOSPHERE. This movie lacks atmosphere. It's not dark, it's not mystic, there are no big twists and plots to reveal. It's open from start to finish so the actual movie is about ""how the game is played."" An interesting concept that could have been more explored and given more power. A darker tone, a slower paste would have made this movie even better than the first one. Do not get me wrong, the movie is fun, interesting, dynamic, with great directing, spectacular shots, superb music and a cast in which one doesn't know who is better. All that lacks is a little more atmosphere and the paste of the movie is a bit fast. The only real problem are the supporting characters! They run through them as if they were popcorn. But I'll contribute that to the paste of the movie. So, all in all. Extremely fun, a great ending, interesting, but not as good as the first one. Watch this with your friend or family on a Sunday evening and you will not regret + Downey Jr. is simply superb!"

","I could not understand much of Robert Downey's dialog. His fake English accent seems garbled at times. He lowers his voice and mumbles the words, presumably to give the impression of fluency. It is too bad that such an elaborate production was marred by an unintelligible protagonist. This was a problem in the first film that was carried over to the second. Surprisingly, no one caught it. For some of us that still identify Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone, the principal actors seemed a bit too silly and glib. It gives the impression that the main characters are simply having fun with the movie instead of taking the acting seriously and making the production believable. Depending on amazing special effects and not emphasizing good acting in films is all too common today. Directors should direct and actors should act. There is such a thing as allowing top actors too much freedom to improvise."

The accents were so apparent and you could understand the characters better. I seemed to like the characters more in this one too. While I was shocked Rachel McAdams' character was killed off right away in the beginning, I was happy with bringing Noomi Rapace in. I think she was very good and I look forward to seeing her in other films. I found Watson more enjoyable to, though I can't understand for the life of me why he wouldn't be more upset by the two faked deaths of Sherlock Holmes. I mean, Watson thought he was dead those two times and he didn't seem that upset. If that was my friend, I would be devastated. Which reminds me, I was kind of let down that Watson's dog wasn't in it more. I think he is so adorable! Then again I'm a dog person so I think about every dog is adorable. I also liked the villain more. He seemed like he was out to destroy the world. I also liked how the movie went to different cities instead of just staying in boring old London. Because, let's admit it, staying in just one city can sometimes be boring. Overall, this movie scored eight out of ten stars for me simply because while I really did enjoy it, it's not one of my favorites and it was just your average action movie.

","I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan. I read the abridged adaptation of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" as a kid and was immediately addicted.

Unlike many Sherlockians, I had no problem with Robert Downey Jr. playing the character. I thoroughly enjoyed his unique, physically fit, and active exploits in Guy Ritchie's first ""Sherlock Holmes"" film. <br/><br/>Sequels can go south very quick. I was happy this wasn't the case here. That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws.The only real issue is the beginning of the film, where it feels like Ritchie is trying to front-load it a bit too much. The rest of the movie moves along at a good pace and keeps viewers riveted. Don't try watching this in a noisy room or while doing something else because it's way too complex and you won't be able to keep up."
"Al_The_Strange","8","1","1","28 April 2012"," ""People have an innate desire for conflict.""
","This film is pretty much more of the same. Those who enjoyed the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" will likely enjoy this as well, with its wild visual flair, its explosive action scenes, and its amusing chemistry between the two leading characters (plus, some added chemistry with the villain). Those who didn't like all this probably won't like this sequel either.<br/><br/>You can definitely expect action in this film; there are plenty of fight scenes, some wild gunfighting, and a lot of stylish slow-motion scenes. I think it's all pretty darn cool, but chances are that all this emphasis on style and action will be off-putting for many folks.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it's a little disappointing to see that it's very linear, with none of the mystery or intrigue that went into the first film (and all the classic stories). It works as a straightforward actioner, but not so much as a mystery. In fact, it reminds me a lot of ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" Fortunately, the story continues to put the emphasis on the characters; Sherlock Holmes is as manic and ingenious as before, if not moreso, while Watson continues to serve as a quality foil character. What will really make this story worthwhile will be the revealing and exploration of Moriarty, whose intellect matches Sherlock's, and causes the two to become entangled in a form of intellectual mortal combat (which takes on a literal interpretation in the film). It's generally fun and satisfying, but still leaves a lot of room for further exploration (I'm assuming a third film will come along and form this into a cohesive trilogy).<br/><br/>Cinematically, it has much the same style as the first film. It's very stylish with lots of interesting camera angles and trickery, and interesting editing. Acting is still very strong, with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law reprising their roles impeccably. Jared Harris plays Moriarty like a classic megalomaniac villain (which is good). I rather enjoyed watching Noomi Rapace in her role. Writing is about as strong as the first film. This production has an insane amount of quality sets, props, and costumes, with quality special effects. Music is still very folky (and it's good that way).<br/><br/>Recommended only if you liked the first film.<br/><br/>4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 3.5/5, film: 4.5/5)"
"dalelawson-1","6","1","1","12 January 2012"," Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows Review
","Sherlock Holmes (Dir. Guy Ritchie, 2009) was one of the movies that I most enjoyed in 2009 and I had been eagerly awaiting its sequel. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (Dir. Guy Ritchie, 2011) was however not the sequel I had anticipated. <br/><br/>A Hollywood film needs action scenes but Sherlock Holmes cleverly integrated narration and slow motion before a very fast paced fight scene so as to show Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) thinking before a fight, like Arthur Conan Doyle had written. However, the first action scene had no commentary. I was then filled with a sense of dread that there may be no narrated fight scenes at all; thankfully this was not the case. One of the best scenes in the film was the shared slow motion fight, between Holmes and Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris). This scene is narrated by both characters as they think out their fight before it actually happens, this scene is one of the only reasons people should see this film. <br/><br/>Yet another annoyance I had with the film was when Holmes and Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) were on screen. Their relationship in the first film was enjoyable and quirky to watch as they would often back chat and argue with one another in a comical way. In this film however they ""comically argue"" too many times to count. It soon became tedious to watch with the knowledge that when they next met each other there would be another round of quick fire remarks between the pair of them. <br/><br/>Unfortunately for Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows it is forced to contend with Sherlock (BBC,Writ. Mark Gatiss & Steven Moffat). The characters of Holmes and Watson, played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman in the TV series, are far superior to Downey Jr. and Law's creations. This could be part of the reason I didn't enjoy the film as much as I might have, as I now have Sherlock to compare Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows to. <br/><br/>One of the biggest surprises I had when watching Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was the appearance of British icon and celebrity Stephen Fry as Holmes' brother, Mycroft. Although he doesn't resemble Downey Jr. in the slightest, Fry was still a pleasant surprise and provided a lot of comical relief and enjoyment in an otherwise dull first half. <br/><br/>The film did pick up in the second half, however, as Holmes and Watson left England for France, Germany and Switzerland. Noomi Rapace's character also featured a lot more in this half of the film. Rapace, who is most known for her performance in Män som hatar kvinnor (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Dir. Niels Arden Oplev, 2009), was disappointingly mediocre in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Her screen presence was so weak; her character might as well have not even been in the film. It seemed that she was solely there to appease complaints from female critics over the lack of female ""heroes"" within the film. <br/><br/>But even with the feeble character of, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace), the second half still propels the film forward with new locations and epic challenges for Holmes and Watson. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first film then this one is worth a watch, if only to see Sherlock and Moriarty compete. If, however, you haven't seen either I recommend checking out the first film before Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows."
"lasttimeisaw","6","1","1","10 January 2012"," Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows
","My very first cinema encounter in 2012 is the sequel of a reverberating bromance action flick of Sherlock Holmes and his lover Dr. Watson, two years after the triumph of the unorthodox trio - Guy Ritchie, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law - of rebooting the household name into a bankable cash inflows, this time, at the same Christmas/New Year season, the threesome orgy revels in a more unrestrained burlesque, while all the detective-related mind-trickery is watered down in spite of Prof. Moriaty's existence (an underrated Jared Harris).<br/><br/>The film has some self-consciously insipid moments during its 129 minutes running time, for the hefty action sequences, either those slow-motion or pre-mind fighting is overly abused, which functions eloquently in the first episode, nevertheless, the same question here, do we really need Holmes to be an action star like Bruce Lee? (anyway, it could not be worse than WITHOUT A CLUE 1988, a slapstick farce of a swapped identity.) In the face of that the old trick fails to avail for the second time, the ace is that a gay-implied two-player eclipses all the rest of the film (I cannot bring to my mind what's the scheme of Moriaty in a crystal clear detail), and the bickering between these two lovebirds is the thing in its own favor. <br/><br/>Against all odds, it's a relief that Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma persists although barely enough to satisfy his loyal audience, and a dramatically emotional twist also propels the film to an overall mediocre level near the very end, Jude Law also has no need to curb his ""innocent- looking"" acting skills, which may be a stretch for him after turning 40. What is totally in dismay is the female characters, apart from Rachel McAdams' opening cameo, The original rising star from THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, Noomi Rapace's Hollywood debut is awkwardly plain, an insignificant and tawdry Gypsy girl, to be sidelined without any glamor, god bless her in the upcoming PROMETHEUS 2012."

","I liked the first Sherlock Holmes a lot: the pace was good, the acting too and the chemistry between Holmes and Watson excellent. Quite an arbitrary reinvention of the character, but an enjoyable one: I appreciated that psychopathic facet of Holmes taken to paradox and the injection of fun and action. Yet it was still Sherlock Holmes, the genial detective, whose logic skills are beyond human. In the second movie one can find all the good ingredients of the first, but Sherlock Holmes: now that he has found his match and his nemesis, one would expect the main game to be played on the court of cleverness, one would want to assist a titanic chess game between the genius of investigation and the genius of crime, a sequence of formidable moves and counter-moves leading to plot twists one after the other. In truth, there is nothing of this: lots of speaking of cat and mouse games, but no cats, no mice and no game. It's not even worth to post spoilers... everything is so predictable."

While the special effects, the costumes and the reproduction of late 19nth century social world are superb, the scenario is very weak in my opinion.<br/><br/>On the enmity between Holmes and Professor Moriarty, the origins of which are never explained, a whole diplomatico-military intrigue is based, the satanic sinews of which are masterminded by the sinister genius of the Professor. The well attested fact that a rivalry existed between France and Germany in the end of the 19nth century is almost attributed to the machinations of Moriarty who tried to foment war between nations for his own purposes as if deeply ingrained national antagonisms were the work of a single criminal intelligence.<br/><br/>Also the dialogues between Holmes and Moriarty which are supposed to be the pinnacles of sophistication and wit and concern a battle of wits as well as ponderous reflections on good and evil, war and peace- were in my opinion naive, obfuscating, adolescent and desperately trying to sound intelligent while they were not.<br/><br/>The eccentricities of Holmes and the genius of Moriarty, verified by his Cambridge lectureship were the silliest effort I have met with, to pass a certain form of eccentric Britishness as a mark of special qualities.<br/><br/>While I admired the costumes and the dynamism of the movie, I could not stop thinking how silly its whole premises were."

","First, let me start by saying that I am a huge Sherlock Holmes fan. I have read all of the stories and novels, and seen many different TV shows and movies about the infamous character. I am here to tell you that even though this movie (along with the first movie) does not follow the traditional idea of Sherlock Holmes, you can be a Holmes fan and still love this movie! <br/><br/>With Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, you will surely be entertained. Honestly, there was not a dull moment throughout the film, and though some may complain that the movie was too silly, I would care to disagree. It was a very well executed movie, and I think the constant jokes and humorous action between the individuals, gives us more insight and helps to make us feel more connected to the movie and the characters in general. In my opinion, it was better than the first.<br/><br/>People are expecting the exact plot from what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first wrote. Please let me tell you: those movies and TV shows have already been created. I applaud Guy Ritchie for giving us a twist on the stories. Yes, Holmes and Watson are definitely a bit crazier than the what we read, but that is what makes the movie exciting and different from the many other Sherlock Holmes movies. The point is, that Guy Ritchie's movies were not meant to be the exact same plots as what we have seen before. If he didn't put his own twists into the stories, we would be watching the same movies over and over again. He has given us a fresh look into Sherlock Holmes that we have read about, which I think keeps the stories and ideas of Holmes alive.<br/><br/>Along with his excellent fresh ideas and overall movie making, Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law give great performances once again. They have the BEST chemistry I have seen between a Holmes and Watson character, which is one reason why this movie is so great.<br/><br/>Also, I think that the villain, Prof. Moriarty, provides for a fantastic extra thrill. Holmes finally comes up against someone who is the perfect match for his intellect. The movie is 2 hours and 9 minutes, but honestly it does not seem that long because it is so fast movie and thrilling! I highly recommend going to see the film, it is worth your time."
"Troy_Campbell","8","5","12","6 January 2012"," Superior to its predecessor.
","After the first entry earned mega bucks at the box office, it was a no brainer for Warner Bros to green light a sequel for Robert Downey Jr's pipe-smoking, wise-cracking sleuth and his dependable aide Dr Watson (Jude Law – spot-on once again). What is surprising is that Shadows doesn't suffer from the law of diminishing returns, in fact it is marginally superior to its predecessor. The supernatural tone has been replaced by an atmosphere more grounded in reality and the thriller elements have been traded out for a simpler 'saving-the-world' premise, although it's the upgrade in villain that really distinguishes the two. With the murder of an established character in the opening act, Holmes' arch-enemy Moriarty (played with fantastic intelligence and sinister intent by Jared Harris) makes an immediate and ruthless impression; something sorely absent in Mark Strong's Lord Blackwell. The flashily filmed slow-motion fisticuffs and gunfights – complete with explosions – are tremendously entertaining as well."

","I went to this film with high expectations, I don't necessarily agree with the Tony Stark-Holmes, but enjoyed the first film regardless.<br/><br/>Holmes - is the thinker and the fighter; Watson - the apprentice and conscience; Mycroft - comedy relief after a promising first scene; Gypsy girl/Gypsies - irrelevant; Politicking - non-existent/superfluous; Moriarty - promising, strong performance, but killed off in one film?<br/><br/>This may all seem a little derisory. I did enjoy the action, the big guns, the scenery etc. Though that slow mo stuff/pre-planning actions thought process had a very short shelf life and is now distinctly whiffy.<br/><br/>Essentially, this needed to be 2 films, not one, to allow character and plot to develop to an appreciable degree.<br/><br/>poor show really."

"Chalice_Of_Evil","9","3","6","5 January 2012"," The bromance continues...
","A Game of Shadows proves to be a sequel that almost matches the original film. It starts off quite literally with a bang. Don't expect Irene Adler to stick around for long. While I'm sure some will be pleased with her apparent departure from the film, I for one enjoyed Rachel McAdams in the role/her more substantial screen time in the last film, and felt she was given short shrift this time around. Her exit is written in such a way that, should the writers decide to bring her back in the future, it's not entirely out of the realm of possibility (although it is unlikely).<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. continues to own the role of Sherlock Holmes, making it his own. His unique interpretation of the classic character has it all - brains, fighting skills (though the gloomily-lit fight scenes could have been a bit better lit/easier to follow) and, most importantly, heart. He's not without heart (even if it might seem like he is at times). That isn't to say he can't be frustratingly inconsiderate. The way he treats Watson, Waton's new wife Mary and even Watson's dog makes you wonder how Watson puts up with such an insufferable presence as Holmes. But at the core, these films are all about Holmes and Watson and how they care about each other, no matter what is said and done between the two. I was glad, however, to see Watson sock Holmes in the jaw a few times, going off at him (and rightly so) for tossing Mary off a speeding train into the water below...even if he was doing it for her own 'safety'. Sometimes Holmes just needs a good punching/throttling.<br/><br/>Jude Law further proves the perfect on screen partner for Downey. His Watson is far from the useless bumbling sidekick in previous incarnations, and is more than able to handle himself. He's also picked up a thing or two from Holmes, using his own keen powers of observation at certain points. They fight together, bicker and share many a homo-erotic moment (though these moments tend to be somewhat more in-your-face than they were in the previous film). This time around we're treated to Holmes cross-dressing (looking like The Joker at one point), among his many other disguises, Holmes and Watson share an intimate moment on the floor of a train and they even dance together...though it's not all just played for laughs. More often than not, these moments serve a *purpose*. The chemistry between the two actors is clearly evident. They make for a great duo.<br/><br/>Joining them on their journey this time is a gypsy named Madam Simza Heron (played by the awesome Noomi Rapace - the one and only TRUE Lisbeth Salander from the Millennium trilogy of films. Accept no substitutes!). She proves an interesting new addition, who's quite good in a fight and helps the boys out. Sadly, she's a little underutilized, disappearing at different points. I wish there'd been more of her, as Noomi rocks in the role and brings a breath of fresh air to proceedings. Among other things, she's pretty handy with knives, looks good in a hat, tends to eat and drink a lot, and she even dances with Watson (quite a memorable, if sadly all too brief scene. Why, Guy Ritchie, why?! I KNOW there was more to that scene than what was shown! Noomi said as much in an interview).<br/><br/>Proving that a memorable/effective villain need not be a poor man's version of The Master from Doctor Who, and doesn't require a silly voice (yes, I'm looking at you, TV's Sherlock), Mad Men's Jared Harris gives a nicely creepy performance as Holmes's arch-enemy, Professor Moriarty (he's certainly a better villain than Blackwood was in the previous movie). The two play a twisted game of cat and mouse throughout the film, matched in every way, which comes to a head with one hell of a chess match above a waterfall. <br/><br/>Stephen Fry provides some humour as Sherlock's brother, Mycroft. Esepcially in a scene with Watson's poor wife, Mary (the excellent Kelly Reilly - in, thankfully, a more substantial role than last time. She even gets a couple of moments of awesomeness, and is not merely the damsel in distress). You have to feel for her character, she and Watson never get a moment's peace/time to just be *happy* - what with Holmes butting in all the time and ruining things. I also feel for Gladstone, the dog, who still remains the guinea pig for Holmes's experiments.<br/><br/>The movie has a good dose of humour, plenty of action (of particular note is an explosive chase through the woods, making one of the more impressive uses of slow-mo I've seen of late, as things splinter everywhere), a bit of torture, a couple of moments involving Holmes in camouflage, Holmes doing his voice-over thing (where we see his next moves he's plotting slowed down/explained, then see them put into effect. Even Moriarty gets in on the voice-over action), and many a powers of deduction on display. And I'm still loving the use of Hans Zimmer's theme music for the Sherlock Holmes movies, not to mention the drawings of cast members that play over the end credits.<br/><br/>While I still like the first film a bit more and would rank it as the superior of the two, this one is a pretty decent follow-up. Here's hoping for an equally good, if not better third film - as the ending leaves things open for one in the most sly way possible."
"kdorsey321","10","3","6","26 December 2011"," Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows
","Saw the movie ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows,"" starring Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, and Jared Harris. Honestly, my very first thoughts, when I saw the trailer for the first time, was this doesn't look like its going to top the first one...It looks alright...I needed a little more to go on. But honestly that is what I thought about the first Sherlock Holmes movie and I ended up loving it. I ended up loving this one too. Matter of fact, I can't wait to go see it again. What I believe people want to see, even more than the action, is the battle of wits between Sherlock Holmes and Professor James Moriarty. This movie provides that throughly. To me that was the main ingredient the movie needed! You will witness these two battle it out and out smart each other to the very end of the movie! The action in this movie was very fitting for the kind of movie this is. Guy Ritchie(director) does a great job once again of providing the action necessary to complement this movie. He also does the slow motion movements that we all loved in the first movie. I'm glad Robert Downey Jr. is back! He is starting to become one of my favorite actors. He does a great job playing Sherlock Holmes and Jared Harris does an excellent job bring Professor Moriarty to life. The big question is, is the Sherlock Holmes 2 better than the first one? I say its better! Only by a hair though, because the first won was excellent! When this movie comes out on DVD and people have had enough time to take a look at it. I will give you a specific breakdown of both movies and what parts/things of each movie is better than the other. Overall, I think this is a great movie! Great acting, solid battle of wits, action is satisfactory...I'm going to give ""Sherlock Holmes 2"" a 10 out of 10."

","This movie was worth every penny I spent on it. I watched it immediately when it was released on the pre-premiere on the 16-th of December 2011. 2 hours and nine minutes just flew by. I couldn't believe it. But whatever. The plot was really well constructed and situations intertwined really smoothly, with no rough, unnecessary scenes and plot deviations. The humour - very thin, light and naughty. Full of hilarious and in the same time horrifying deeds of Sherlock. The characters fill their positions amazingly well. Actually this is the second movie after The Devil's Rejects, which is actually better then the First Part. I don't want to give details in order not to spoil it.

The relationships are built strongly, especially that between Holmes and Watson is fascinating. Mycroft Holmes did not have a total screen time of more than 5-6 minutes but all the sides of the characters was soo beautifully projected . <br/><br/>Critics might say Sherlock was never about bangs and blasts and bombs , yes I agree (having read almost all the stories and loved it) but this is cinema and it does not look out of the place . <br/><br/>The movie will let your imagination go free, will make you think , will make you roar with laughter and will make you fall in love with the characters . <br/><br/>And ya it will make you wait for the next Holmes movie ."

","That Movie..man I'm lost for words. I'm currently 21 years olds I went for the premiere back in 2011 when I was like 12 years old. And I liked it back then I remember.
But since they've added it on Netflix I've decided to rewatch both parts.
And oh my god. I had no idea how good of a movie it is .
Ofc every movie has its flaws and and nothing is perfect.
But Robert Downey jr is playing his part excellent being super smart a bit crazy, sometimes cocky yet remaining British with British humor :D. The plot is good imo not many moments when the action slows down so you're always entertained. I wasn't bored for one second watching it.
Adding the music which has a nice rhythm and happy jingles of those times makes you really immersed into the action.
But the technical aspect of this movie BLEW MY MIND. The slow motion in this movie is the best I've seen in the industry. And I'm watching this movie in 2020!!
Not gonna spoil anything but the scene in the woods BLEW MY MIND. Like crazy.
I definitely recommend watching it, I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

Moriarty and Holmes fighting at the falls was stolen directly from the Doyle, but in this case it felt forced and out of context. Not nearly as solid as the original, I'm hopeful that any future movies in this series return to the 'true' Sherlock Holmes roots.<br/><br/>Overall, very disappointed."
"jboothmillard","5","2","4","19 December 2012"," Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows
","The first film was alright, whether critics have changed their minds and given it a higher rating is up to them, I think three out of five stars was fair, I expected there to be a sequel, and sure enough there was, directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch.). Basically Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) is soon to be married to his sweetheart Mary (Eden Lake's Kelly Reilly) and will therefore end his partnership with the famous detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.), who is trying to get his assistance in the investigation of arch nemesis Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris). It turns out however that the Watsons will be part of the scheme after all when Moriarty sees them as a threat and targets them, but Sherlock saves them with his mastery of disguise and intelligence to think and conclude something before it happens. After getting married John does agree to join Sherlock in one last case, and to help them they are joined by gypsy Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace) and get some help from Sherlock's older brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry), it is Heron's brother Rene (Laurence Possa) who may be the key to the whole investigation. It turns out there is a big international conspiracy with the Napoleon of Crime where Moriarty is leading an assassination attempt, and the trio have to try and catch the unknown man before he can take his shot, or Europe will go to chaos. The villain in the end is defeated when he and Sherlock plunge from a balcony to the rocky abyss below, so it is assumed that Holmes died in the fall as well, of course the story will surely continue as his disguise skill is proved again watching his friend Watson talking about how he misses him. Also starring Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Paul Anderson as Colonel Sebastian Moran, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade, Geraldine James as Mrs. Hudson, Wolf Kahler as Doctor Hoffmanstahl and Clive Russell as Captain Tanner. As with the first film Downey Jr. proves a witty and eccentric choice for the more sophisticated non deerstalker hat and pipe smoking detective, and Law continues to be cynical and easy to irritate with his partner's rambling and over-explanations, the story is slightly difficult to understand at times, but the action sequences keep you happy enough, it is a fun period mystery thriller. Worth watching!"

","Director Guy Ritchie tries to give a new avtar to Sherlock Holmes as befitting the modern era---and totally fails !!<br/><br/>No , the time Sherlock Holmes lives in is still the 1890s , but his personality is tried to be changed by the director .<br/><br/>Instead of the cool Sherlock Holmes who seemed to be unruffled by any situation and lived a life of calm detachment , we get to see a comedian who is not averse to disguise himself in women's clothes with lipstick and mascara and all---oh i forgot....the situation demanded it..... But why does the director have to invent such a situation at all ??<br/><br/>And when the time comes to deal with the villains , this Sherlock Holmes transforms into a action machine that would put a Rambo to shame..... He does somersaults and what not---and the cameraman adds special effects straight from the matrix movie to enhance the action .<br/><br/>In fact , all tricks in the book are used to try to make the movie work- --in fact , too many tricks , and what we get too see is a movie where too many things happen too fast . Indeed , the pace of the movie is breathless .<br/><br/>But the movie has no seriousness and mocks itself as it moves along , with the caricature of Holmes behaving in a silly manner trying to crack stupid jokes .<br/><br/>Only the villain , Holmes' old enemy Professor James Moriarty is dead serious in his acting , and also in his aims . And he aims to start a world war by creating an incident which would put France and Germany at loggerheads with each other . He hopes to reap enormous profits by selling weapons and ammunition to both sides in the conflict . <br/><br/>But Holmes , the ever prescient detective , smells the scent of his plan and decides to stop him .<br/><br/>But before all that Moriarty tries to kill Holmes friend Watson on his honeymoon ---something that Holmes prevents by singlehandedly fighting the horde of assassins in an superactionpacked sequence. Shades of Arnold Shwarzneggar in Commando ?? Or Sylvestor Stallone in Rambo ?? Naah..... In fact the action is all second rate , and unconvincing .<br/><br/>So does Holmes manage to stop a world war from happening ??<br/><br/>Don't bother to watch the movie for that..... It isn't worth it .<br/><br/>Go and read about world war one and world war two instead . Yeah , those wars did happen anyway . I guess Holmes was either too old or dead by that time and couldn't prevent them.....<br/><br/>Verdict---not good."
"FilmStallion","3","2","4","6 September 2012"," Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows...1.5 out of 4 Skittles
","The sequel, like 2009's original, is average at best. Michele and Kieran Mulroney, best known for writing and directing the bizarre movie Paper Man in 2009, find a way to produce a screenplay that makes the literary legend of Sherlock Holmes boring. Heavy descriptive dialogue scenes make every conversation feel very forced, and makes you pray for the next action sequence to hurry up and come.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, even the action couldn't save the movie from drifting off into snooze-ville. Guy Ritchie's directing style worked well in his past films Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but comes across as very jarring here. His endless quick cuts and slow-mo action shots stripped the film of any excitement and give it an endless snail pace.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. and Law deliver a few laughs together, and their chemistry attempts to give this movie some semblance of entertainment value, but in the end the it has too many strikes against it for them to overcome. This movie does a disservice to the legend of Sherlock Holmes, and made me wish I would have just stayed home and read about one of his adventures in a book instead.<br/><br/>For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"
"masterjk2","4","2","4","8 July 2012"," Hook line and sinker
","The first ""Holmes"" was well made and hooked us into this travesty. I realize that movie makers think that they have to cater to 14 year olds. We're many times that age and we don't need, fancy special effects to make the movie enjoyable. The first half was merely a video game with the depth of a trout pond. The second actually came alive with some real dialogue and even a dash of substance, like Die Forelle, classical music which madmen have been happy to obsess about since talkies came into being. Then the added Don Giovanni, beautifully staged for more musical color. Not there is anything wrong with Hans Zimmer's score. That was the highlight of this movie. To have such well tuned actors as Law and Downey acting more like Bugs Bunny and Mr Magoo than the real talents they are is sad. And it will probably only get worse. Those of us who enjoy fine acting and a credible plot will simply stop going, leaving the audience to an ever attenuating adolescence which is happy with lots of booms and little brilliant dialogue. Sad."

","In this dumbed-down society we live in where people seem to thrive on films brimming with explosions and car chases I can see why this film appeals to so many. However, to those of us who actually expected (perhaps naively) to see a Sherlock Holmes film with some good story telling, strong characters and something to actually stimulate our brains, it fails to deliver. In fact, on numerous occasions, I was battling to stay awake.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with Robert Downey Jr or Jude Law as actors, but in this film they weren't at all believable. In fact, if I had walked in through the middle of this film without knowing what it was and without hearing familiar names, I'd have had no idea that it was supposed to be a Holmes story at all. Overall the film is daft, shallow and boring, feebly attempting to rely on the cheap thrills of action over plot and with, at times, all-over-the-place camera action to make even those with the strongest stomach feel somewhat dizzy and queasy. And why all the humour? Is the film supposed to be a mickey-take or a parody? I think not, so why inject all the humour? It's totally unnecessary and only serves to pull severely away from the Holmes stories and characters. If you're going to make a Sherlock Holmes film then you may as well do it properly or not at all.<br/><br/>In summary, perhaps if you go into it imagining that somehow James Bond has been transported back in time and is pretending to be Sherlock Holmes, then it might be almost palatable. Otherwise it's a complete let down, a shambolic excuse for a film."

The only person standing in his way is Sherlock Holmes. Moriarty challenges Holmes and his partner Watson , who must watch closely each and every deadly step of Moriarty and prevent his misdeeds to wage a war.

Hats off to him for making this film as entertaining as the first one. The screenplay is so tight that you would not feel bored even for some seconds. The art direction is just fabulous showcasing the picturesque location of Europe. The visual effects are so enthralling that was you would love to watch it again and again. The chase scene in the forest is outstanding and handled effectively. Cinematography is fantabulous. Hans Zimmer's background score provide the exact touch to this high- fi gripping drama. Coming to the performances, could you ever think of anyone apart from Robert Downey Jr who can play the character of Sherlock Holmes so effectively. The supremely talented actor is so convincing that he fits this role to T. He is humorous , quick-witted , efficient and acts naturally. Jude Law supports Downey Jr. efficiently . He plays the part of Dr.Watson with amazing charm. Rest of the star cast do justice to their part. Overall , An amazing , intellectual thriller that is sure to keep you on the edge.

However, the cinematography is excellent, the effects are stunning, and the music score is brilliant. Overall, Game of Shadows is a great action movie and pure entertainment.

","""Elementary my dear Ritchie"",as Sherlock Holmes would say!!!The best thing about the 2nd installment of the Sherlock Holmes flicks from the Guy Ritchie stable is that director sticks and remains true to Holmes as we know him from the novels(read the awe inspiring deduction prowess of Holmes); besides invigorating the film with awe inspiring CGI effects and power packed action sequences to take to it dizzying heights of awesomeness.Set in the mystical environs of the Victorian era(I'm a bit partial towards flicks set in that era)the characters,their actions as concocted by Ritchie are far cry from the ones originally depicted in Sir Arthur's novels.Our new age Holmes & Watson,punch,they kick,dodge bullets in uber cool,jaw dropping slo-mo action scenes,but its hard not to fall in love with this adrenaline joyride of a movie.What else can you expect wen Ironman himself is playing the protagonist.Surely Conan Doyle will be jumping out from his seat in heaven,cant say the same about the Sherly purists though.In the most intriguing of scenes, Holmes and Moriarty lock horns over a game of chess ;we also have Watson dancing with gypsies, his wife thrown off a train, Holmes in various disguises (as a chair,as a woman,lol) and yes we have a naked Stephen Fry hitting on Watson's wife.Very Richtiesque and stamp of the director of Snatch,RocknRolla written all over it.Only the director of Guy's caliber nd finesse cud have pulled this off.The dual b/w Holmes nd his arch enemy,Prof Moriarty and the mesmerizing chemistry between Law and Downey Jr. who hit off like a house on fire,are well and truly the high points of the movie.Just the right mix of a shrewd script,subtlety,mind boggling action sequences,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows goes one step above its celebrated predecessor and transcends into an exhilarating joyride that packs quite a punch and how..End your year on a high,Go for it!!!!"

","This film is about Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson trying to outsmart the horrifying plot of Professor Moriarty.<br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is what a blockbuster should be. It is visually attractive, an adrenaline inducing plot mixing action and humour. The visual representation of Sherlock Holmes' power of observation was interesting, and the bullets in the woods were also visually stimulating. And the castle on the cliff at the end is so beautiful and stunning what made me go wow. The plot is intelligent in a sense, but it tells you everything so clearly, that viewers do not have to solve the puzzle themselves. Either way, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is entertaining and fun to watch. I am already looking forward to a sequel!"

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","0","23 May 2020"," Boring and unable to hold my attention.
","If the first film was relatively pleasant and positively entertaining, this film is a complete disappointment. Boring from start to finish, it brings no intriguing mystery and merely turns the most famous English detective into a relatively eccentric action figure.<br/><br/>If one of the biggest problems of the first film, for me, was the anachronism of the characters, too 21st century in their behaving for the Victorian era, the problem of this film is different, although the weight of anachronism is also felt. For me, the biggest problem here is a poorly written script, without an intriguing mystery to solve in which we can follow the protagonists. In fact, the film explains everything right from the beginning, and everything that comes after is a kind of search for evidence, where Holmes tries everything to prove Moriarty's culpability in the bombings and his intention of provoking a war. That is not enough for me.<br/><br/>The cast is generally good. Again, Robert Downey Jr. is the star and does his job well, despite the degree of eccentricity and unlikelihood of his character. Here, if flaws existed, they were due to the material he received and not to his work. On the positive side, I highlight Jude Law, very good in a more discreet and naturally British character; Noomi Rapace was a good addition also, and looks gypsy enough to look credible; Jared Harris is an excellent Moriarty, as cold, cultured and brilliant as required by the character. Stephen Fry and Kelly Reilly are average: they made good performances but their characters, despite the important support given, seem very limited and appear only in specific moments. Besides, they both had problems: Reilly looked bad in that costume and Fry was pompous to the point of being annoying. On the negative side, I highlight Rachel McAdams' very expendable cameo, Paul Anderson's little relevance and Eddie Marsan's marginalization, with the actor being demoted to the role of an extra.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is excellent and has very high production values and a lot of money clearly invested. Cinematography is very pleasant, although there are moments when the use of slow motion was unnecessary. Good colors, good filming work and a pleasant look, together with sets and costumes usually according to the time and the environment, deserve a very positive note of attention and contribute to making this film palatable and visually elegant. There is a lot of imagination in all and credibility is a problem that could be felt. The pace is good, even better than in the first film, but the soundtrack, despite being good enough, is not that good nor does it bring news, seeming to have been entirely recycled from the first film.<br/><br/>Personally, I expected more. Despite being a little far-fetched, with some anachronistic characters and other small problems, what really displeased me was the lack of a good plot that would hold my attention."

","I'm glad that I'm not the only one who thinks that this second movie didn't as good as the first one.. From the performance, Robert Downey Jr. has did it again with his character as Sherlock Holmes, even Dr. John Watson's performance by Jude Law really got a lot of improvement too.. But their performance didn't help a lot as the story of this movie got the audiences a little confusing even though I know it's quite brilliant to make some twist like that.. The other disappointment is Noomi Rapace's performance which is for me just like a sweetener because of the death of Irene Adler, but she's nowhere for replacing Irene Adler.. Overall, for me this sequel is a little disappointment but I must appreciate Guy Ritchie's work since he did his best in here so this rating is the best that I can give to this movie.."
"willcundallreview","7","0","0","29 November 2015"," A step up from the first of them
","The first film of this series was for me of average quality, the kind of movie that felt like a generic Hollywood action adventure movie labelled as Sherlock Holmes. A Game of Shadows is however in my opinion a level up from the first instalment and a movie that is just generally funnier, better done action wise and all in all just generally much more thrilling. It isn't necessarily massively new and refreshing and can at times be pretty basic but take nothing away from this, this is a blockbuster done well. It again of course stars Robert Downey, Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Dr. Watson of which both are on the trail of that most famous of Holmes villains, Moriarty. <br/><br/>It excels in most part at getting the fighting done in a way which at least at times can feel pretty nice, nice in a way where it feels real of course. The slow motion used in certain scenes is fantastic, an addition that not only just makes parts of the movie more exciting but also it shows Guy Ritchie can do action very well indeed. As for Ritchie well he directs this kind of similar to the first one in the way it's paced but brings more out of the actors and characters they play, as mentioned it feels funnier and more thrilling and that is really down to Ritchie knowing what was needed to be done.<br/><br/>Additions to the cast like Stephen Fry, Jared Harris and Noomi Rapace do little to take away the staring role Downey, Jr. has but nevertheless I think they are good additions and make up a cast that is well put together. RDJ even sounds better in this one, I felt with the first he quite often mumbled and his lines came out at a frantic pace but in this he although can be a little too fast, still makes a better go of it. Jude Law as Watson is better as well and although neither is brilliant here they are good enough to not ruin this movie or rob it of any of its credibility. <br/><br/>The film can drag just a tiny bit toward the end and they do a decent job of not letting your attention drop, it does start to get more basic toward the end plot wise but by the end I felt satisfied enough. The score of Hans Zimmer + Lorne Balfe makes the action not only more pumped up but just generally sounds good, you can always count on both but especially Zimmer to create something pretty nice. The film can actually think itself pretty smart at times especially with the thought process Holmes goes to when just about to fight, of course if you see the first movie you are used to it but it still feels a little gimmicky how it is done and played out afterwards.<br/><br/>So overall Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is one movie that is good and I think an improvement over the first one that felt so mediocre. Guy Ritchie hones in on his craft and truly makes something that although of course is big and can be typically blockbuster, is still a fun adventure and one that I think most can just about partly enjoy at the very least. Oh and the cinematography, it is really well done actually and the movie is also pretty well edited, the story flows very nicely and the way it looks especially in more fast moving or fighting scenes is one that is very good especially."

","""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is not as good as the first film in the series, but it does benefit from an interesting villain. Don't underestimate how important that is to this kind of movie; when you have a hero that's as smart as ol' Holmes, you better have someone that he can match wits with or the whole thing will be a snooze-fest as you wait for this lamo to get trounced by the world's greatest detective. If anything, I was disappointed that these adversaries didn't get to share more screen time. The second half is interesting and well crafted enough to keep the audience entertained though, so it more than redeems itself for me. It's unfortunate that the detective work and mystery play second fiddle to some of the action scenes and humor sequences, and I felt that some of the revelations and plot twists were way over the top, but overall it's enjoyable. I actually feel like I'm being way too harsh on it, I just happened to have really high hopes considering how fresh and intelligent the first installment was.

","Once again, I'm sure Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was rolling over in his grave when this film came out.

I would have preferred that they just created all new characters, rather than stealing his.<br/><br/>This film has a lot going for it -- lush sets (many computer generated), fine photography, and clever and snappy dialog.<br/><br/>But on the negative side, some of the fight scenes are so fantastic as to not be believable. There's a fine line between generating excitement and making the audience feel it's just to fantastic to be at all realistic. This film, as with many coming out of Hollywood nowadays, crosses that line.<br/><br/>It's quite fun watching the interplay between Downey as Holmes and Law as Watson. They're a great team. Although it does get very camp.<br/><br/>It is a film where you have to pay attention to catch the nuances and some of the ""background"" that sets up later parts of the film.<br/><br/>Is it a good film or not?

","I need to get something off my chest really fast and then we can get to the good stuff, or my positive critique: I hated the forest battle scene in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. I loathe slo-mo scenes in movies without explanation, as much as I hate CGI that takes center stage in films (i.e. Transformers.) And for 90% of this particular sequel, they craftily explained slo-mo, like the original Matrix did, so I was cool until Director Guy Ritchie took an unexpected, unexplained and unoriginal turn with showing a slowed down bombs-away scene amongst trees.<br/><br/>WhewI'm glad I got that out of the way, because for the rest of the experience, I had a blast. A LOT more than Robert Downey Jr.'s first turn as the famous genius detective in 2009 remake: Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Holmes (Downey, Jr.) and newlywed Dr. Watson (Jude Law) work together to solve the alleged crimes of famed Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) as bombs, murders and nations against nations take place in good ole 1891. Much like Dr. House and Dr. Wilson – which took from Sherlock's M.O., there's the typical reluctance, yet joy in their relationship.<br/><br/>That's all incidental to an extremely fun adventure, great and believable cinematography, a smart and often hilarious script and another fantastic performance from Robert Downey, Jr. I love seeing him in ""the smartest person in the world"" roles, although I was corrected today saying Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) is actually smarter. And, in addition to that person who knew more Sherlock's history that I did, another individual gave me the background today of a lot that happened in the books (and real-life history) that also appeared in this movie.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I'm not a huge Holmes fan. I am a Robert Downey, Jr. fan and he led me to these two (and, hopefully more) films. He did create an enormously believable, fun, funny and adventurous already-established character brand new for me. And, though I appreciate them sticking to legend in this tale, I'm just happy with what I saw on screen and not have to watch countless hours of celluloid or read numerous books just to appreciate the two hours of film here.<br/><br/>Honestly, there is not much more I can say about this project – without spoilers, that is, but that I had a roaring good time (outside the forest, that is) and that it's a tremendously enjoyable time with how brilliant both the character Sherlock was written and how great it was to see Downey, Jr. play him perfectly. I hope for a Part III, and pray they look past the so-so American box-office to justify it."
"gus-swan","7","0","0","2 January 2013"," Distinctly lacking in mystery
","Guy Ritchie's sequel to the surprisingly fabulous Sherlock Holmes is an enjoyable romp concocted from many superficially similar elements to the first movie, but at the same time fundamentally less satisfying as a piece of storytelling or as a homage to Arthur Conan Doyle's detectives. At heart seems to be a recurrent weakness in Ritchie's approach to directing, which is to return to the scene of a successfully committed crime and try to up the ante. After his initial success with 'Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch' Ritchie drove his career into a cul-de-sac with ever more convoluted reworking of the British gangster movie. His Sherlock Holmes was a new departure, whilst retaining his trademark stylised hyperviolence and successfully deploying his flair for popvideo like visuals to the backdrop of Victorian London. The visuals and the violence are intact, even improved on with a bigger budget and the confidence of the original global hit in the bank, and Robert Downey Junior is still hilarious and mesmerising with his Depp-like hypercamp re-interpretation of great detective. What's lacking is the decent storyline. While the original film employed mysticism and some real plot puzzlers which were untangled wonderfully in the denouement, there is not that much mystery to the sequel. Yes, there is lots of confusion as to what there is going on in the opening reels, but nothing really intriguing to ponder before the action kicks in. From that point there is little time for the plot to expand into the space between the setpieces, gags and Downey Jr and Law's homoerotic banter. That itself is an example of what was delicious and slightly daring in the original feeling a bit treadworn already in only the first sequel, along with the pre-narrated slow motion fight scenes. The only genuinely new factor in play is the character of Moriarty pitched perfectly by Jared Harris who is understated, yet convincingly menacing. If someone can come up with a gripping yarn, a third outing with the talents of the director and stars now firmly established in character would be welcomed, but if its only further spills and thrills we can look forward to, Ritchie might be better to quit while he's still ahead."

","It took me a while to watch this film...I wanted to see it at the theater as I really enjoyed the first one, but I never made it. Finally got it as a gift and have to say that I enjoyed it just as much as the first one. I know many out there do not like this version of Sherlock, but this is one of my favorite versions of the famous detective. I am not the biggest Holmes fan admittedly. My other fave Holmes is Peter Cushings, I really enjoyed ""The Hound of the Baskervilles""...in both these cases I really enjoyed the actor playing Holmes.<br/><br/>This film has Holmes trying to match wits with his greatest adversary, Professor Moriarty! A man whose genius is only matched by his nefarious desires. Sherlock must once again team with his good friend Dr. Watson as they have to go through Europe to figure out Moriarty's scheme. Once again there is a lot of humor and a lot of action. Some may find this off putting, but I really enjoyed it. The movie starts out with Sherlock on the tail of a familiar friend, he takes his good friend Watson to his stag party where then his wedding, has a great encounter on a train and ends up at a very nice castle in Switzerland. The locales are great in this film too, by the way.<br/><br/>I enjoy films from this time period so that is probably one of the reasons I enjoyed it and the predecessor. Probably explains why I enjoyed the film ""The Raven"" as well...though that one took place in America. I also enjoy a good train action sequence, whether it be in a movie or even a video game. This film has that too. At times though the film does move around to much which is why I did not score this film a 10, I really enjoyed the film, but at times it became difficult to follow! <br/><br/>So while it may not be the popular thing to do, I enjoyed this film. Cannot pretend I didn't. To me these Sherlock are the perfect combinations of action and humor. That is the kind of role I like Downey Jr. in, action type films with some comedy. I do not really enjoy his totally serious films or his comedies. So basically I like him as Starks and Sherlock I guess. I am looking forward to the next Iron Man film and I also hope I can look forward to the next Sherlock film. There is one listed, but it has no date so it may never come to fruition."

","Sherlock Holmes' intellect and kudos appears to be challenged, from his judgement, to an extraordinary degree. Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) disturbs Watson's (Jude Law) Brighton honeymoon by venturing around the gates of France, Germany and the Alps in Switzerland in an investigation behind the mastermind and equally academic Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). His remarkable sense of empathy and wit prove indispensable in this impressive sequel due to Moriaty's sadistic and charismatic volume. In this ravishing sequel, Holmes undertakes the hero role beyond any extremes of the first movie of the Guy Ritchie franchise.<br/><br/>The complex plot and swift nature of moving through discovery and intelligence is balance astonishingly well due to Guy Ritchie's camera and technological advancements and his visualisation for the scene. The music is delicate and remedies with the situation with such beautiful tone and timing. This replicates Holmes' movement and motive as he attempts to form an understanding of the motivation behind his arch rival's menacing path. There is a wonderful scene that depicts the whole scenario that the film plots out for us, the Chess game. Here, ideology demonstrates themes of death, fate and the suspense of making the correct decision whilst attempting to countermand your opponents every thought of conquering the world.<br/><br/>Despite the element of mystery that the Sherlock Holmes franchise has possessed, so far Guy Ritchie has introduced a vast amount of intense action which works notably in comparison to the rest of the narrative. Not only does it reveal an additional coating to Holmes' manner, but, it modernises a series that critically needed freshness in a fashionable sense if the Sherlock Holmes brand was to continue to exist and platform itself in the modern arena that Hollywood imposes. The third instalment unquestionably has a mass of expectation to topple this second chapter."
"brando647","9","0","0","4 September 2012"," Even Better than the First Movie; Fans Should Love It
","I really enjoyed Guy Ritchie's first SHERLOCK HOLMES. So I should warn those who didn't, you may as well just move along. But if you're like me and thought his first movie was a fun new spin on the classic character, then you'll probably have a blast here because it's even better the second time around. The second movie ramps everything up to the next level with a stronger story and better action sequences while retaining all of the fun elements of the first film. I haven't gotten tired of this series yet, and if Ritchie can keep the movies as entertaining as they've been, I hope we'll get a few more out of him. A GAME OF SHADOWS adopts elements from the Holmes tale ""The Final Problem"" (one of Doyle's stories I haven't had a chance to read) with the battle of wits between Holmes and his nemesis. As the movie begins, Holmes and Watson have gone their separate ways as Watson prepares for the approaching marriage to his fiancée Mary. Meanwhile, Holmes is deep into his latest investigation surrounding recent events: bombings, suspicious deaths, countries on the brink of war. All of the trails he has uncovered converge on one man: Professor James Moriarty. Holmes fears that Moriarty's plans might have worldwide consequences and enlists the aid of his trusted colleague Watson one last time in a bid to uncover the nefarious plot and put an end to it. But Holmes may have met his intellectual match in the professor<br/><br/>You won't hear me complaining about Ritchie's action-infused version of the classic detective. If you want the usual Holmes sleuthing, there are hundreds of other sources out there, but I like to think Ritchie's movies maintain the heart of Holmes while adding a nice action punch to kick it up a notch. I love the ""Holmesavision"" method of sharing Holmes' train of thought and bring the audience into his mind while he does his does best. There's an awesome moment in the final act of the film where we experience to two genius minds attempting to out-smart each other when Holmes confronts Moriarty. It was a cool means of bringing something new to my favorite element of these movies. The story is fun, with Holmes and Watson breaking free from the confines of England to travel Europe in their pursuits this time around. The action sequences are bigger and more extravagant and Ritchie loads it up with his slow-motion/ramped speed, stop-n-go style. Another aspect I appreciated in the film, the stakes definitely feel higher. There are a few moments in the movie where I genuinely wondered if all of the characters would make it out alive, and at times wondered if Ritchie planned on ending the franchise here before it went any further. A GAME OF SHADOWS is a total blast, and I'd go so far as to say it was one of my favorite movies of 2012. My only concern is that it couldn't be topped in a third movie. The scope on this one is about as large as a good Holmes movie can get without going too over-the-top, and they've already brought out the detectives most cunning enemy: Moriarty.<br/><br/>If you want to make a blockbuster icon out of Sherlock Holmes, you can't do better than Robert Downey Jr. He continues to be great in the role, even if he does come off as a little cartoonish this time around. RDJ brings equal parts eccentric and intelligent to the character and comes across as just shy of insane. Jude Law is again the perfect straightman as John Watson. He looks like he's having more fun this time and has a few funny moments of his own. Rachel McAdams was my least favorite part of the first movie and I'm happy to say her character, Irene Adler, receives no more than 5 minutes of screen time. The best characters in this movie, though, are the newcomers. Stephen Fry (as Mycroft Holmes) and Jared Harris (Moriarty) steal their scenes. Harris was a great choice for Moriarty. There had been a lot of early talk that Ritchie and the producers had been considering some A-list names for the character, but it worked so much better with Harris. He's confident, conniving, and sociopathic. He's a perfect Moriarty for this sort of Holmes film. Noomi Rapace (from the Swedish Millennium trilogy) has a role as a gypsy fortuneteller drawn into the chase, but she hasn't got much to do here.<br/><br/>Whether or not A GAME OF SHADOWS is worth your time all boils down to whether you are a fan of Ritchie's vision for the character. Being a fan of the first, I absolutely loved this one. It's an action-oriented SHERLOCK HOLMES on a bigger scale and an excellent chess match in the final act to sum up the battle of two great minds."
"XweAponX","10","0","0","28 August 2012"," Jared Harris: ""I'mThe Bishop!""
","Guy Ritchies direction of this film, and its close relationship to a Chess game, brings to mind Jared Harris' last words as the character ""David Robert Jones"" in the Season 4 Finale of Fringe: And that too refers to a Chess game, where to lose a valuable player is a trade-off to a winning game. In that episode bad Guy Leonard Nimoy as ""William Bell"" sacrifices Harris' Character for an upper hand advantage over his opponent, Walter ""Bishop.""<br/><br/>And just as Harris plays evil genius ""Jones"" in Fringe, he takes on the role of Moriarty without bringing any leftovers to this movie from that TV role. Even so, the two disparate characters do have many striking similarities. Both evil geniuses, both extremely polite and almost likable in a way, and both doomed.<br/><br/>The Beginning of this film has Rachel McAdams once again playing Irene Adler for the last time. Robert Downey Jr/Holmes is a mess as usual, his housekeeper Geraldine James refers to his diet of tobacco and coffee with a side of Cacao Leaves and shots of Formaldehyde. Once again, things that are shown in a passing way in the opening scenes become major plot elements: Holme's ""Urban Camouflage"" and his new Adrenaline injections.<br/><br/>Stephen Frye emerges as ""Mycroft Holmes""-""Sherlock Holmes Smarter Brother."" Holmes, Watson (Jude Law) and Mycroft indulge in a night of debauchery intended as a ""Bachelor Party"" for Watson (Which Holmes as usual seems to have forgotten about, but not really), who is still going to marry, Mary. But Holmes uses the club as an opportunity to meet Noomie Rapace as ""Madam Simza Heron"" who has something to do with a letter he intercepted from Adler before McAdams stopped being Adler. Madam Simza is looking for her long lost brother Rene, but a Cossack is in the ceiling, waiting for an opportunity to assassinate her. He is foiled by Holmes in the ""Acrobatic"" part of this film.<br/><br/>In the first film, we were introduced to ""HolmesAVision"" and that is put into play here, with the added change of showing how Holmes does not always guess correctly what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>Watson does indeed get married to his ""Mary"" (Kelly Reilly) before the end of the first act, but their nice honeymoon trip to Brighton is interrupted by Moriarty's Assassins. From there, we go to Paris, and discover an assassination disguised as a bombing, and from Paris to Switzerland and Reichenbach Falls- And we all know if we have read the books what happened there.<br/><br/>This film is very loosely based on ""The Final Problem"" which was to be the very last Holmes story ever written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, fortunately for us it was not and Holmes was brought back for ""The Hound of The Baskervilles"" and other stories.<br/><br/>A method for Holmes to survive the ""falls"" had to be concocted, and it was tossed in to the story as an apparent non essential early in the film. The fact that I did not guess this gadget is a compliment to Guy Ritchie's ingenious way of hiding things in plain sight.<br/><br/>As an avid fan of the Basil Rathbone Holmes films of the 30's and 40's, and intrigued by some of the treatments of Holmes from the 70's and 80's, I was pleased with this take on the character. I liked both films made by this company so far, and if there is a third one, I am hoping the franchise stays with Guy Ritchies very capable hands.<br/><br/>Kieran Mulroney and wife Michelle were a great writing team, captured the flavor of the first Ritchie film. Kieran had the distinction of playing ""Benzan,"" An Alien ""Prince"" in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in a second season episode of that show."

","The 2nd in the Sherlock series starring the dynamic duo of Law & Downey Jr. does not disappoint. What was disappointing was that I took Tomato Meter's advice and chose to pay and see MI4 at the theater over Sherlock. MI4 couldn't hold a candle to this one. The plot is brilliant; the script is brilliant; the action scenes, better than the first installment; and the overall work engaging and enjoyable up to literally the last second of the film. Compare that to MI4; which stunk, let's face it. Terrible script and screenplay, lousy acting, cheesy delivery of lines, so contrived to say the least.<br/><br/>But I digress. I think Guy Richie has done a fantastic job with these films and I'm looking so forward to the next. The only thing that detracts from the overall euphoria of just having watched this is the reality dawning that it'll be at least two years before that next one arrives in theaters. Until then, Sherlock lives on!"

","I suppose I'll sound like a broken record. I enjoyed this movie, but, like the first, I almost never think of it as a Sherlock Holmes film. If Indiana Jones were to be transferred into Robert Downey's body, it wouldn't make any difference. Because of the name recognition, many entities are capitalizing on the Holmes name. Making him a quirky indecipherable enigma, or making his partner a woman named Watson who is of Asian descent. These are certainly interesting but so far removed from the Holmes mythos that it does nothing for me. This is a wild adventure with lots of twists and turns, leading to some really dramatic moments; but it's also so full of contrivances that I have to suspend so much disbelief. People just know things without the ratiocination that was the whole of the original character. We could use a dose of that in any new Holmes incarnation which would really substantiate the character."

","Allow me to expand, I found the first Sherlock Holmes an outstanding film, its original but not on the point of experimental. Robert Downey Jr. is a thrill and a laugh to watch in most of his appearances; As Sherlock Holmes though, he was something else, a brilliant mixture of intellect and humour.. Which, in most cases, equals sarcasm on the brink of annoyance. Now, in this one, I think he decided to take the jump, and land straight in the ball-pit we call annoyance.. And the only thing that structures him as a character is maybe being a little bit of a badass, MAYBE. The film start of slow and, yes, ends in a cliff-hanger but getting to the cliff is not a thrilling journey so.. Is it worth it? I've tried to watch the film twice; the first time I managed to get through the first half, the second time I found myself distracting myself during the first half, purely to get to the second. NEVERTHELESS, it is still a movie, a Sherlock Holmes movie too! The picture is great and there are some good action scenes.. But don't expect to be sitting through the credits with a stupid look on your face like 'that was AMAZING' cos its more than likely you're going to be sat there staring at your phone or half-asleep.. or both."

","Guy Ritchie created something really neat with 2009's ""Sherlock Holmes"", and manages to equal it with ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"". The part about a series of mysterious assassinations plaguing Europe and possible leading to war sounds exactly like something that governments would do to distract their populaces from any problems. Robert Downey Jr. continues his depiction of the famous detective as having another side that the audience never knew about, with Jude Law's Watson often irritated at the antics. The movie sometimes goes a little overboard on the action, but the intrigue more than makes up for it. I especially liked Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander in the ""Millennium"" trilogy) as the enigmatic Roma woman.<br/><br/>The movie probably isn't for everyone, but it pleased me."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","0","0","22 June 2012"," Holmes gets more explosive, not complex, in second Ritchie adventure
","The success of ""Sherlock Holmes"" in 2009 certainly opened up Warner Bros.' pockets wide enough to give director Guy Ritchie a bit of free reign over the sequel. His choice of what do with that cash, however, didn't have to be as straightforward as it is in ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows."" In other words, there are explosions. Lots of slow motion and lots of explosions.<br/><br/>Just as the first film was about witty banter and bare-knuckle action, ""Game of Shadows"" follows suit to an even greater degree. Perhaps it's the inclusion of Holmes' arch nemesis in Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) that would lead one to believe a greater degree of intellectual thought and mystery would be infused into this second outing, but he serves merely to up the stakes as far as what Holmes must overcome to outsmart someone as clever as he.<br/><br/>""Game of Shadows"" is a chaotic action ride that jumps willy-nilly from locale to locale (London, Paris, Germany, Switzerland). It moves so quickly that if you blink you'll miss the reasoning for going from Point A to Point B, even though it hardly matters in the long run. All parts of the mystery are explained/introduced before you can even begin to process them and suddenly we're in the throws of a new action sequence.<br/><br/>As far as non-stop entertainment goes, here's a blockbuster that doesn't dawdle, though every so often that wouldn't be such a bad thing. Fans of the traditional Arthur Conan Doyle character who figured for some reason this would be a return to form compared to the 2009 film will be sadly mistaken yet again. There's not much mystery to savor, just the endless pursuit of Moriarty and an attempt to uncover and foil his plans.<br/><br/>Stars Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Dr. Watson are as sharp as ever in this new adventure, with Watson getting a bit bigger of a spotlight this time around. His impending marriage helps to further the emotional divide between him and his partner and makes their banter all the more effective.<br/><br/>The story, for what little of it matters, involves Holmes' pursuit of his soon-to-be rival, a man he believes responsible for a series of highly political bombings. After Holmes saves a gypsy named Sim (Noomi Rapace) from being one of Moriarty's expenditures and Watson's honeymoon is interrupted by machine-gun fire, they head to Paris to pursue Moriarty, though Holmes knows that his rival has threatened Watson if he does not relent.<br/><br/>The new faces in the series, which in addition to Sim and Moriarty includes Stephen Fry as Sherlock's infinitely more logical yet no less quirky brother Mycroft, don't do too much for the film, Sim in particular. Moriarty is the necessary foil for Holmes, the Joker to his Batman to say the least, and Mycroft always ends up being one of those nice change-of-pace characters in the Holmes universe, but Rapace is rather wasted as Sim. She's not a love interest and she just goes along for the ride. Her motivation is typical and uncomplicated, though the same can be said with all the characters, even Moriarty, who though formidable should come across even more menacing than he does.<br/><br/>Ritchie turns all the action scenes in ""Shadows"" into his slow-motion playground. One particular scene involves Holmes, Watson and Sim running through the woods as Germans launch all matter of artillery at them. We get various isolation shots on the characters as they run and inside looks at how the artillery fires, not to mention trees exploding at a snail's pace. Any thought that something other than purely stylish entertainment lies in store dies in this scene.<br/><br/>To be fair, however, the final act in Switzerland proves to be the film's best. Here, deduction plays its biggest role as Watson and Sim try to identify a man surgically altered to look like another and Holmes and Moriarty engage in a game of chess in which chess is completely secondary. It's a gripping and fun final scene that captures everything Ritchie's vision of Holmes is about. Although Sherlock's internal thought process breaking down how to attack his adversary flirts with being too much in terms of using that same technique over and over again, the end results of the scene proves to be most intriguing.<br/><br/>""A Game of Shadows"" is infinitely more engaging than stimulating, though certainly to some those qualities are interchangeable, and this second outing for the reinvented Holmes will be a mild affair. With as many sharp and wild turns as the film takes, however, not to mention the exploding that happens around each corner, boring will not likely cross many minds.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","After watching this film for the second time I have concurred with my original opinion that this film is quite excellent, at least as much as the first film, but the only thing I dislike about this film is the scene after they break out of the weapons factory (the part where they run through the forest whilst being fired at). All of Guy Ritchie's usual devices are in play here: the slow-mo, the fantastic editing, the wonderful sound and music – yet it completely destroys the momentum of the film at this point. We have been lead on a merry chase up until this point and then it dies, slowly into a pool of bullets slicing through trees and it is completely self-indulgent on the part of the director and a terrible way to lead us into the final act. oh well. Robert Downey Jr's Holmes is quite possibly one of my most favourite interpretations, he is simply faultless and is quite clearly at home working with Jude Law; they are utterly wonderful together.

","On first viewing I was completely underwhelmed by this second outing for the world's greatest detective, although this might've been considerably flavoured by a cinema that would've been more effective as a fridge.<br/><br/>A second sitting, though, revealed a well-paced and thoroughly entertaining period romp, channelled, of course, through Guy Ritchie's highly-stylised lens.<br/><br/>The roguish, yet gentlemanly bromance between Sherlock and Watson, continues to blossom here, allowing for all manner of shenanigans typical of the period, and to add my voice to others suggesting likewise, both actors seemed born to play the parts of these characters.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast perform admirably, although naturally playing second fiddle to our two detectives, with Stephen Fry joining in the hi-jinx as Sherlock's brother.<br/><br/>Noomi Rapace is largely wasted as a Gypsy plot-adhesive, yet continues to make a name for herself, regardless.<br/><br/>The story itself is one of diabolical ambition typically reserved for a Bond movie, with Moriarty, Sherlock's adversary wonderfully pinning down the archetypal villain in just the right measure of charm and menace.<br/><br/>The music is flawless, the scenes exciting, and the possibility of a further adventure is on the cards. All in all, it's pretty hard not to enjoy.<br/><br/>My only real criticism is a lack of moral understanding from Guy Ritchie, highlighted in two separate, but related conversations. In the first we hear Holmes analysing Moriarty's handwriting, which he claims suggests a lack of empathy bordering on moral insanity, yet within half an hour we hear Holmes criticise Moriarty for indulging in a hobby of feeding pigeon's which he dubs ""...winged vermin"". Surely even the most ignorant of moralists understands that it takes far more empathy for a person to relate to a bird than it does to another human. This actually shows Moriarty to have, either greater empathy than Holmes, or simply a lack of empathy regarding people.<br/><br/>That very minor detail aside, though, I thoroughly enjoyed it, although that may have also been coloured by the fine bottle of red, and the roll of green, I enjoyed whilst watching it.<br/><br/>Here's to the return of our fearless duo."

","Definitely a game worth watching.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes (Robert D Jr) returns for another adventure- against his fiercest and in par nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), with his loyal sidekick, Dr Watson (Jude Law). In the collision between two great minds, there are possibilities of collateral damages, and this itself makes the movie more thrilling on top of its crime busting, mystery solving forte.<br/><br/>The movie begins rather choppy but when it reaches the high gear, it is exhilarating. There are many scenes which pulled me to the edge of my seat. The train action scene is one to be reckoned with- i suppose train scenes are now favourites for high octane acts. While Watson heads to his honeymoon, little did he know he had fallen into a trap set by Prof Moriarty. Fortunately for him, Holmes followed him, in disguise- and you will laugh here, to rescue him and his newly-wed wife. Another scene that wow-ed me is when Holmes and his team are escaping through the forest. This movie absolutely has pitch perfect timing, especially for its slow-mo added with incredible sound effect. You can see the bullets flying across the screen, the men running and chasing. Lots of gunshots, lots of explosions.<br/><br/>With Robert D Jr playing Holmes, there are hilarious scenes- right until the last moment, he will tickle your heart with his creativity and perfect use of punctuation. It is nice to see when the bromance magic between Holmes and Watson returns in the second half of the movie, after his wife is thrown overboard to safer grounds. Knowing how strong a team they are together, Holmes and Watson complements each other, and watching them tells the importance of understand others' brilliance, skills and talents like in the movie: Watson's medical viewpoints, and Holmes' time management and peculiar behaviour.<br/><br/>Whether you need to think in this movie, i can tell you it is not as much as a thinking game like Inception. The plot is masterfully crafted, straight-forward paced that is enough to keep you engaged from start to finish."

","I loved the first film, but this one was even better. To duel with Professor Moriarty using keen intellects was astounding. Robert Downey Jr. (Sherlock) delivers a brilliant performance as always to his character. Jude Law (Watson) as his sidekick is as boisterous as he was in the first film. Together, they try to solve the greatest mystery in their careers to stop the fiendish Moriarty Jared Harris (Son of late Richard Harris) - (Prof.Moriarty) of causing a world war using stealth and a sniper at a peace summit in Switzerland. This movie gave us the more incredible details like never before. Such as Sherlock using his deductive skills to outwit or out match his nemesis on an equal level. Yet still, Moriarty has more aces up his sleeve than Sherlock which is why at one point, Sherlock dies on a train. But as with all of Sherlock's skills, never fails to make sure that his good friend and colleague Watson is prepared just for his death. Thus the syringe he gave Watson as a wedding present. One sequence of Sherlock and his friends romping through the forest with bombing shells after them was refreshing to watch. A unique take on the scenes using stop-still-slow motion is fantastic. I was not disappointed with this film. Especially seeing Sherlocks brother walking around naked in front of Watsons wife. I really thought Sherlock's brother had the brains in the family. Oh well, it still was amusing, breathtaking, edge of your seat fun. The music, the action, the story just fit perfectly for our favourite actors to give us the legend in quite formidable conformity. Highly recommended to watch. Not for those under fourteen."

","The thing with SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS is the same as it was with the first movie. Allow me to elaborate. This man indeed is a wondrous legend on paper. When Conan Doyle created the character of Holmes; the detective with his top hat and smoke pipe from 221B Baker Street he inked down a man with great thinking powers, a man who does most of his works in the minds' eye. A mystery solver. What Guy Ritchie did in 2009 and what he is doing once again is enhancing Sherlock with guns, explosion, cinematography and some fine action sequences. The movie is brilliant on its own and the books are brilliant on their own. The moment you mix this up you would either be a hater of one and a fan of the other, which is the case with every movie that's adapted from a book. I loved the books and I surely love SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS.<br/><br/>The most obvious next question is what's the better movie? My opinion, both movies are indeed great. The 2009 picture looks better at times, since it was the first of its kind in this period of cinema. It gave a new face to Sherlock and Watson back in 2009 and this time it's just another story for the same faces. Also it would be only fair to state that seeing Holmes comprehend a situation proactively before he attacks his enemy was quite a treat back in 2009 and came as a surprise back then. This time not so much? On the other hand the 2011 version of Holmes takes him back to an almost identical version of the character as it was written in the books by Conan Doyle. Holmes is a man who does most of his work in his head, this is his signature move. This time Guy Ritchie focuses more of connecting Holmes and Watson back to the basics to avoid any slander from the critics who love to always compare his work with Conan Doyle's. Therefore on a very neutral level the answer to the question in my opinion is in terms of originality the 2009 productions gets the win and in terms of sincerity to the source of the fictional character Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson the 2011 version takes the bow.<br/><br/>There is trouble in Baker Street again and the man himself needs to stop Professor Moriarty (Javed Harris) from destroying the lovely set of Victorian London, Paris and Switzerland. Yes I did mention the word set deliberately. Just as it was in 2009, Guy Ritchie without a doubt hits it way out of the ball park and over the next few football fields as well with his cinematography and the Victorian London set the movie is shot in. The movie does move a tad bit too fast making it hard for the viewer to actually savor its true beauty. It reminds me a little of Hogwarts itself. What Guy Ritchie lacked in terms of pace and intensity in the earlier stages of the movie he matches up with this glorious treat for the eyes. There are a few obvious moments of frustration evident in the movie at first to create the require sense of interest. Some unnecessary acrobatics at the bachelors' party of Dr. Watsons makes it quite obvious making the fight sequences a bit of a farce. <br/><br/>The Verdict<br/><br/>Great movie, in fact it did feel like somewhat being at the opera. Just as when the first moments began to pull the entire plot down, it woke everyone up with a bang and gradually excelled itself to a decent climax. Watch out for the part when they use Hansel to hunt Holmes and Watson down. Some great tools used by a great director performed by great actors to compile the great movie!<br/><br/>Title: Sherlock Holmes; A Game of Shadows Starring: Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, Noomi Rapace, Rachel McAdams, Stephen Fry and Jared Harris Rated: PG13 Rating: 7.5/10 129 Minutes"
"The-Sarkologist","7","0","0","19 January 2012"," A great rendition of Sherlock Holmes
","Well, a not so long awaited sequel to Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes has arrived and my initial thoughts on this movie is that it is good, but it is nowhere near as good as the first one. While it is clear that there was always going to be a sequel, and that the sequel was going to involve Holmes going up against his arch enemy Moriarty, it is always difficult to beat what was, in all intent and purposes, a brilliant movie. This, as I said, simply did not have the same drawing power that the first movie had.<br/><br/>There is a lot of debate about how true to form Ritchie was in creating his Sherlock Holmes. While I would hardly say that it is spot on (the original Holmes did not seem to have the same amount of eccentricities that the original Holmes did, and I will not even try to compare him with other Holmes) upon reading some of the short stories I do feel that Ritchie has captured the essence of what Sherlock Holmes is, and in a way that at least attracted me to actually considering his stories.<br/><br/>This film, as mentioned, is about Moriarty and is set in 1891, the year that Sherlock Holmes dies. Anybody who is familiar with the stories will know that the only time Holmes confronts Moriarty is in the story 'A Final Problem' and in this story it is insinuated (though not actually said) that Sherlock Holmes dies when both he and Moriarty plummet off of a waterfall. One can thus work out how this movie ends.<br/><br/>However, it is interesting to note that the characters in this movie do not resemble the drawings that accompanied most of the stories. Moriarty in this film, while being a very evil person, is not the older man with sunken features, but rather a full fleshed man who is a respect man within society. This is because Moriarty is truly Holmes' match. While Irene Adler is often mentioned as the only woman to have ever outwitted Holmes, Moriarty is the man with whom Holmes meets his match. However, Moriarty does not win, because in Holmes, Moriarty has also met his match.<br/><br/>I found the ending to be very disappointing though. While it is only insinuated in the books that Holmes dies after struggling with Moriarty, it is clear from this film that he does not. I find that disappointing, and has in a sense put me off any further films that might be made. Personally, I hope that Ritchie does not go down that track, unless, of course, he decides to create some backstories, or maybe even work off some of the books. I do not believe that the first movie is based on any particular story, while the second film is only very loosely based on 'A Final Problem'.<br/><br/>I do believe that Ritchie has got the characters reasonably right, however the chronology in the films is different to the books. In the books Watson is already married, however in the films it is suggested that it is when he marries that he decides he no longer wants to go on any adventures. Obviously there is also the glaring anachronisms, such as the automobile and the machine pistols, both of which I do not believe existed in 1891."

","What made Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes revival two years ago so unique was the style and finesse and the gadgets and action and story and everything just worked so well. It was one of the action movie greats for the year and I had a lot of anticipated for the sequel that would introduce us to Sherlock Holmes' one and only nemesis Dr. Moriarity. The first film was primed for a great sequel. Game of Shadows made a lot of mistakes, I think, but some of the things that made the first movie great saved this from being a complete disaster. Let's talk about the good stuff first. Holmes' manic and often disturbing way of solving the crime, putting together clues and going to exorbitant means to catch the bad guy is as fun as it ever was. The chemistry between Holmes and Watson, while not as good as the first, is still a ton of fun! Where the film falls short is the story is way more complex than necessary, in fact it is almost confusing at times though by the end it does come together reasonably well. And I also felt like finally the unveiling of Moriarity was a bit of a let down as I didn't think he was quite the epic nemesis I had hoped for.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Holmes. To be honest Downey Jr. is fantastic in almost any role. But he goes above and beyond playing the manic, head case who happens to also be completely brilliant. He also pulls of his action scenes flawlessly. Jude Law is terrific as Watson but as I said I think perhaps his character had a little more depth and was just a little bit better as a character in the first film. Him and Downey Jr. had such incredible chemistry in the first film and while it was still there it wasn't quite as good. I don't think this script gave Jude Law as much depth. Noomi Rapace, I'm just laying it out there, was awful in her role. I don't know if its her fault or the script but her character was pointless, vapid, and zero chemistry on screen. Jared Harris as Moriarity was disappointing for me. He didn't exude the evil master mind like I would have expected. I would have liked to have seen a powerful big name actor, someone known for villains, take the role. I thought the chemistry was virtually non-existent between him and Downey's Sherlock Holmes. The addition of Stephen Fry as Holmes' brother was a welcome newcomer. He had some funny moments in the film even if some of them seemed just slightly out of place.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has a reputation for a certain style of film and he did a great job on the first film. Why he decided that practically every action scene in this movie required slow motion is beyond me. He uses slow motion so much that it becomes a joke and is overwhelmingly annoying. It really is Downey Jr. that saves the film with his performance along with decent action. If you loved the first movie than you will enjoy the second but don't expect the same level of solid action that came out of the first. A valid effort with some stumbling. Hopefully they pull it together for a third! 7/10"

Like Daniel Craig renewed the world's most beloved spy, Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr. renewed the world's most beloved detective.<br/><br/>Fans of the books liked Ritchie's new approach, although many still questioning the presence and importance of some facts and characters like Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) in the first installment, since that character is mentioned in only one story. The presence of Rachel McAdams as Irene also brought a different dimension to the first movie because she was a great partner and, as Sherlock mentions in the story, she is ""the woman"" and I could not hide my disappointment when I noticed that her presence in The Game Of Shadows would not only be important, but also brief... very brief.<br/><br/>Instead of Rachel McAdams, now there is Noomi Rapace performing gypsy Simza Heron, a character that appears and disappears and no one even notice that during the movie. If some fans say that the presence of Rachel in the first movie was useless, now they have reasons enough to do the same with Rapace's character. Of many films I've seen lately I haven't watch any that features a so useless character that has nothing to contribute for the development as happens with Sim Heron.<br/><br/>The name of Noomi Rapace in the credits is just an indirect way to promote and link her name to David Fincher's remake of the first part of the Millennium Trilogy. That's so that way that here in Brazil both movie posters of Game Of Shadows and the remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo are arranged and disposed in hall theaters intentionally.<br/><br/>The Game Of Shadows is a great action movie. The slow motion scenes and the scenes representing Sherlock's logical reasonings and his practical side were maintained and improved and for me those are the best scenes throughout the film together with its linear plot and great story development. But I think that some exaggerations turned Sherlock Holmes more like a new great political incorrect superhero than just only a clever detective.<br/><br/>Many people loves the eccentric figure of Downey Jr. and his cynical way of acting, but I personally don't like his constant habit of always acting like everything was a big circus. Jude Law was great as always and Jared Harris as Moriarty really is the great villain that you should never met.<br/><br/>Also happened in this movie what happened with Soderbergh's Ocean's 12, a film filled with improvised dialogs and full of inside jokes between a bunch of friends.<br/><br/>But despite all of that the film flows as it should, the plot development is linear and holds our attention, keeping what it promises during its 129 minutes.<br/><br/>And Guy Ritchie proved that he could stop being a director of cult action movies to become an excellent blockbuster director without losing his own style."

","I really wanted to like this, as I loved the previous Mitchell offering.But this one was let down by scores of anachronistic props and modern dialogue which grated on the nerves. The M1906 Mauser pistol and the 1912 Vickers Machine gun were bad enough but when Watson started firing what appeared to be a World War 2 Owen sub machine gun things got really stupid.This was all after the date being boldly stated as 1891 in the first scene. We also had not one, but two, Checkov's guns. i.e. a device is introduced early on that we just know will be used in a later scene. Like the obvious man trap in Straw Dogs that was just obviously going to have someone in it by the last reel. Here it was the magic Dungeons and Dragon's style healing serum, and the ridiculous cyberpunk/ Thunderball style micro breathing apparatus. Two get out of death free cards for our hero that were total pants.<br/><br/>Despite all this there were magic moments of acting and direction, but I was just too appalled by the under use of Irene Adler and the pointless intrusion of Naomi Rapace together with too much Band of Brothers style gunfire which made it all look like the Battle of the Bulge in several scenes."

","¨Slow and steady wins the race. ¨<br/><br/>How can you go wrong with a movie involving one of the best literary detective characters ever? And if that isn't enough consider having Robert Downey Jr. playing that part. It seems these two guys were meant to go together (although I guess I can say the same thing for him and Tony Starks). Downey Jr. is just a great actor with a perfect sense of comedic timing. Sherlock Holmes isn't a great movie, but it's really a lot of fun. It has plenty of action scenes, interesting characters, and a lot of funny moments. Add Guy Ritchie to the mix and you have the perfect popcorn flick. Sherlock Holmes may not be Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, but it does live up to the original film. This sequel is perhaps a little lighter and easier to follow which allows for a better pace, but it also is much simpler and the plot pretty plain. What makes this movie stand out from other ordinary action films are the actors and the action scenes. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have great chemistry together and they share a lot of funny scenes. Jared Harris provided a decent villain who could compete alongside Holmes with his intelligence. Noomi Rapace who really shined in the Swedish Millennium trilogy, doesn't really stand out in this movie and doesn't do much since she isn't given an interesting character. I think she is misused here and it's too bad because she is really a talented actress. The screenplay written by Michele and Kieran Mulroney is pretty solid. A Game of Shadows is a decent sequel and is a fun movie, but it does have several flaws nonetheless. <br/><br/>We are back in 1891 London right where the first film left us. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) believes that Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) is responsible for a series of bombings across Europe that is threatening world peace. No one else seems to suspect Moriarty is involved and the press believes a group of anarchists are responsible for the explosions so Holmes decides to investigate on his own. Moriarty isn't pleased to find out Holmes has been disrupting some of his plans. Irene (Rachel McAdams) continues to work for Moriarty delivering certain packages for people who sometimes end up dead, but Holmes gets in the way a couple of times. Meanwhile, Watson (Jude Law) is back visiting Holmes the day before his wedding expecting to celebrate his bachelor's party, but Holmes has other plans. He has intercepted a message from Irene for a gypsy named Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace) and wants to find out what the Professor might be planning. At the bar Holmes saves Heron's life after discovering that Moriarty wants her dead since her brother who works for him has been sending some messages to his sister. Watson doesn't get the bachelor party he was expecting, but he makes it to the wedding the next morning. The honeymoon will also be interrupted after Moriarty threatens Watson and his wife, so Holmes decides it's time to save his best friend by throwing Watson's wife (Kelly Reilly) off the train and having her rescued by his brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry) while he and the doctor try to stop the Professor from beginning a World War. <br/><br/>Like the first film, Sherlock Holmes is very grayish, since that is probably what London looked like during 1891, although this time we get to travel all over Europe as Holmes chases Moriarty from one place to another. The plot is way more simplistic than the first film, but the action sequences are very similar. Ritchie always includes these sort of really fast paces action scenes with a lot of editing (which I'm not a really huge fan of since sometimes it's hard to follow what's going on with so much cutting and pasting. There are also some slow motion scenes which are sort of cool looking, but also a bit distracting. I think the best part of the series is the performances from Downey Jr. and Jude Law. This is what makes the franchise work and makes for an entertaining film. The action mixed with the comedy works really well and makes this an enjoyable movie experience. A Game of Shadows isn't one of the best movies of the years, and it isn't very memorable either, but it was a lot of fun and much better than other action films. It is very similar to the first film so if you enjoyed that one you will definitely like this sequel, and if you didn't than I don't think you will really be interested in seeing this because it follows pretty much the same design. The costume design in this movie is also pretty good, and it was fun to see Robert wearing all sorts of costumes throughout the film. A Game of Shadows is fun and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"jburtroald95","7","0","0","10 January 2012"," A more than decent sequel to a ripper of an original
","The last couple of years have given moviegoers a mixed bag of modernised Hollywood revivals of classic franchises: some pleasing hits – The Adventures of Tintin, The Muppets – and quite a few ill-received misses – The Smurfs, Alvin and the Chipmunks. So it is a pleasure to kick of the year with a fine sequel to what is perhaps the most successful of these adaptations, along with Steven Moffatt's inspired BBC television series Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Old- fashioned slick and smart plot developments and the traditional period English setting are skilfully blended in with the high-tail action scenes of today's summer blockbusters. Its appeal to both laidback and serious cinema audiences will surely continue to generate the promising commercial success that it has been enjoying thus far. On this outing, the novel mysticism of the menacing Lord Blackwood has been left behind, and the old eroticism of the slippery Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is present only briefly as more elements of the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are introduced. Stephen Fry makes a delightful entrance into the series as the irrepressible detective's brother Mycroft. Usually there is an awkward rivalry between the two, where Holmes is frustrated by his brother possessing superior intellect and wasting it with his laziness, but here they are mostly very co-operative allies. The villain of the piece is a very familiar figure, the unbeatable Professor James Moriarty, but he has also changed. While in this film, as always, he is described as being faceless and consistently elusive, his pompous countenance is revealed within the first half hour. What's more, Jared Harris doesn't play him with nearly as much wicked relish as his predecessors; Guy Ritchie doesn't seem to want us to view him as a diabolical mastermind, but more a neat personification of the inevitable corruption and conflict present in modern society.<br/><br/>However, the overall film is far from dulled down and certainly not as restrained as might be suggested from those aforementioned characterisations. The outlandish escapism is partly given in by the spectacularly gripping and often humorous action sequences. Chaotic explosions certainly abound, against a variety of backdrops, including a stirring performance of Mozart's famed opera Don Giovanni and an exhilarating chase through the woods that has spiky wood splinters zooming in every direction. Early on, there is also the classic comical assassin evasion, involving the enigmatic gypsy Madame Simza (Noomi Rampace from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). The other half is of course given by Robert Downey Jr.'s reprisal of another typically erratic role, but this is one of his better excursions of eccentricity. Jude law puts in some fine work also as Holmes' much more sensible and long-suffering roommate and associate Dr John Watson, who exhibits a deeper maturity as he prepares seriously for a marriage to his equally sober girlfriend (Geraldine James).<br/><br/>Much lighter this time, yet filled with a stronger sense of doom and danger than the first film, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows might not bring anything terribly new to the table, but it presents its familiar yet reliable products with fine gusto, and aptly manages to keep its audience engaged and energised throughout its sizeable two hour duration, a time that can be treacherously difficult to sustain interest with."
"adrongardner","7","0","0","9 January 2012"," Improved round, but there's a better boxer
","Guy Ritchie's first go around with Sherlock Holmes felt a lot more like ""Snatch 2"" with pigs, slow mo punching and dank leaky interiors, but here he has genuinely improved. Despite the bore inducing overdose of patented Ritchie camera shutter ramping and slow motion, this is actually sorta kinda qualified to be a Sherlock story. <br/><br/>Modeled hazily on The Final Problem, there's more mental gymnastics with Moriarity and less British pit boxing. Nice recovery Guy.<br/><br/>What bothers me the most here, is the inclusion of too many guns blazing scenes - a near contractual requirement for any director working with 80s fossil, producer Joel Silver. John McTiernan joked about just this point working with Silver when making Arnie's Predator. His solution, or Flip Off to Silver, was having Bill Duke fire the ""Painless"" mini-gun surrounded by the other commandos dumping lead into the jungle - and hitting nothing. In Die Hard he had the terrorists do the same thing shooting glass. But that is another story. No, I have nothing against guns, but Sherlock is not an action hero, he is a heroine addicted supercomputer and he wins the day with his mind and eye, not running from mortars.<br/><br/>Overall it is money well spent if you want to escape. Though the movie is so dense with quick cutting for more than two hours I don't really remember anything from the first half of the film at all. While Downy Jr. enjoys playing our dear detective and Jude Law perfectly at home as Watson, in the meantime Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have done better with their interpretations on BBC's Sherlock. How about that? Guy Ritchie beaten out by a TV show. You don't even need slow motion to see the knockout blow from those two show how it's done.<br/><br/>It is nice to see Noomi Rapace in there. Hooray for life after Dragons and Tattoos."

"jennie-lt","8","0","0","8 January 2012"," Trick of the Mind
","For those of you that haven't watched the first Sherlock Holmes it really does not matter. I am always effie about big box sequels because they are never really better than the first. However, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is remarkably so much more exciting and smart than its predecessor and it made me laugh a ridiculous amount. <br/><br/>The plot takes part months after the first movie, where Dr.John Watson (Jude Law) is about to marry his fiancée Mary (I must warn you that I had the most suspicious feeling about this ""wife"" character and indeed she does play a pivotal role in the movie) and Inspector Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) to be his best man and to throw his best friend and partner in solving crimes a stag party. Of course being Sherlock Holmes, he has other obsessions on his mind. <br/><br/>Where this party takes place we get to meet the lovely Madame Simza, (played by a lovely and very bohemian Noomi Rapace, the Swedish superstar known for the Original Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"")and even though she has little dialogue in the film she goes along for the ride and stunts with the boys. <br/><br/>This movie introduced Professor James Moriarty who is the complete duplicate of Holmes, if Holmes was evil and out to cause mass destruction. This adversary is perfect because whatever mind trick Holmes plans on executing, Moriarty is one step ahead of him. It's so smart to see how both characters think and play around with each other.You are thrown for a loop and at moments when you think one character has the upper hand the tables are turned. You really don't know who survives until the very end. <br/><br/>This movie was so much fun, there was enough action and aerobatics that made the first Sherlock Holmes movie exciting and successful but always an equal amount of humour and cleverness for the fans of the old school Holmes. This movie was like a chess board. Never knowing you're opponent's move until it's done or when only a few chess pieces are left can you try to piece it together, but this movie has never once confirmed my predictions for what's going to happen next. <br/><br/>Bravo Holmes and we must really ask the question: The End?"
"BigWhiskers","8","0","0","8 January 2012"," A fun movie with a clever ending
","I missed seeing the first Sherlock Holmes so will have to eventually go an rent it but if it's anything like this one -it must be very good too. This movie takes off and never stops and Robert Downey Jr seems to be enjoying himself as is Jude Law. They really do work well off each other. The movie itself is about Holmes and his arch nemesis the brilliant Dr Moriarty trying to outwit each other and ultimately kill the other. It takes so many twists and turns and things move so fast that you really need to hold on and enjoy the ride. The only negatives I can see are some lulls in scenes between the action where the writers didn't seem to know what to do and the actors seem to be ad libbing like the scene where Holmes is asking Watson if he is happy about his life to this point ,he asks Watson if he is happy being married and settling down -a nod to the fact that Holmes is unmarried and enjoys the chase and wonders if Watson is truly happy or if he will miss the chase being Holmes sidekick. They both hesitate in this particular scene when delivering their lines as if wondering should they say what's written or make something up and the scene is left somewhat unresolved with Watson never really giving Holmes a straight answer . Other than that the action is simply top notch and fun. The ending is also very clever and worth hearty applause. I enjoyed it thoroughly and there is a hint of a sequel at the end too. Enjoy and I will see you at the movies."

","If you are into action films, you will love the latest film about our favorite detective. Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson try to kill their foe, Professor Moriarty because Holmes believes he is linked to a number of recent crimes. They discover that Moriarty invests in companies in England owning cotton and other goods. He plans to start a war so that there will be a high demand for the goods, so he can make a fortune. Will Holmes succeed in preventing this war?<br/><br/>The cinematography of the movie is impressive. Several action scenes are filmed in slow motion, making it more thrilling. However, the lighting of the movie is gloomy and, for me doesn't really match the tone of the movie since it is a combination of action and adventure with a dash of comedy. <br/><br/>The storyline of the movie doesn't quite work for me either. Although the film is like ""Mission Impossible"" in the 19th century, it's a bit difficult to hear what the characters are saying since they have a British accent, and the plot gets confusing at times. I did enjoy the ending though. It is interesting watching the director's comparison of the face-off between Holmes and Professor Moriarty to a chess game.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to teens 13 and up, especially to fans of Sherlock Holmes.

","After seeing the trailers of the original Sherlock Holmes, it was with much trepidation that I watched the film. Holmes is supposed to be an intelligent man, extremely refined and gentlemanly, with an air of dismissive irreverence towards social norms. I wasn't sure if Robert Downey Jr's macho portrayal of Holmes would do justice to the character, nor was I convinced that Guy Ritchie's action-oriented approach would suit the persona of the world's greatest deductive detective. But I was pleasantly surprised by the movie nonetheless, with the intelligence of Holmes deductions a bit of a delight. Needless to say, I was looking forward to the sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, this movie won't appeal to you too much. If anything, it's even more of an action movie than a game of wits. The clever deductions that are so typical of Mr Holmes have been replaced instead by cinematography of the ilk of that fight scene from the first movie. <br/><br/>But if you forget the fact that this is a Sherlock Holmes story, then A Game of Shadows is a very good movie. It's all about Holmes' anticipation and Ritchie's special effects and excellent non-stop action instead. Go in without any bias and you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>The characters of Holmes and Watson are pretty much par for the course, and Downey Jr and Law pick up from where they left off in the last movie. The character of James Moriarty is weak. While he's portrayed as being an evil genius, I needed to be convinced of his genius more through the plot's narration than through the actions of the character on screen. I have no complaints with the acting of Jared Harris, though, whose expressions and overall acting were top-notch.<br/><br/>I must mention Stephen Fry, who plays the role of Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes. Fry is absolutely fantastic in this role, completely captivating the audience in every scene in which he's present—never overacting or underacting.<br/><br/>Final Verdict—All put together, this is a good movie, if you can forgive the change in Holmes' powers of deduction and general method of doing things. It's not terribly clever, but it keeps you hooked with quality entertainment for the entire duration."

What can't be faulted is that he got another OK performance out of Britain's blandest leading man Jude Law, who for once seemed to utter two words in a row without looking as though he was distracted from his cue cards. The Jack Sparrowisms of Downey's Holmes is again entertaining and the one true thing that was captured in this film was how awful Holmes disguises are, Richie deliberately showed us that his skull caps are painted pigs leather with stuck on hair and dotted stubble.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry excels as Mycroft and it was brave of him to show us what a 50 year old naked man does look like from the groin up. It was a shame that Captain Tanner and the Baker Street Boys are only glimpsed at in the last couple of minutes and Eddie Marsan is not given more of a role as Inspector Lestrude.<br/><br/>The females Kelly Reilly, Noomi Rapace and Rachael MacAdams are underused and the actual leading lady was Robert Downey Jr went topless.<br/><br/>Listen out for a piece of Ennio Morriocone music from 'Two Mules For Sister Sarah' as Holmes is seen travelling after his requests for a bicycle are not met.<br/><br/>The film is not a waste of time, but two are enough.

","This is without a doubt a superior film to the original and simply one of the best movies of the year. I enjoyed everything and every moment. Robert Downey Jr. again proves why he's one of the cinema's masters. Moriarty is the perfect villain and watching how these legendary characters match wits is everything I had hoped. The shear adventure, fun and wit are masterfully tempered by a dramatic overtone. The action also held up well and some of those scenes are the most imaginative and most beautifully presented scenes of any film this year. There's a race through the woods, slo-motion sequence that's as visually stunning as any art house film ever made. Released during the time of year where often times pretentious films make an Oscar grab, this action/adventure movie vaults right to the top of my best of the year list.<br/><br/>I loved this movie yet I'm a complete Sherlock Holmes novice. Never read the books nor have I even seen the old shows or movies. I know the legend and the basics but not much else. I saw the first film because I'm a RDJ fan. So, I bring no baggage to this franchise. As film, I was entertained by the first and highly engaged by the second. This movie is simply a well structured, fun and remarkably smart movie. Moriarty's motive is solid and ominous. Holmes takes his quirky genius presented in the first film to new levels. Watson was the stunner for me. He's every bit the partner and as big a factor as Holmes all the way through. Even his actions are smart and fit the plot perfectly. There's depth to all the roles. That's what I loved most."

","I didn't like the first SHERLOCK HOLMES film very much at all, so I had little hope for this sequel. Unfortunately, it's even worse than the original, moving further away from the source material in a bid to deliver big bucks, action packed excitement. Downey Jr. plays Holmes as a superhero type in a Victorian setting, utilising his physical prowess and mental skills in a bid to bring down some typically shadowy villains.<br/><br/>First of all, for an action film, the action is very poor. A GAME OF SHADOWS was made during a trend for ultra slow motion in cinema, and the slow motion sequences are ridiculous. I don't know if they're meant to be edge of the seat or exciting, but despite the cutting edge technology they look very fake and the CGI augmentation is all too obvious.<br/><br/>Downey Jr.'s acting here is rather pitiful and his Holmes is required to cross dress and do other stuff that's about as far away from the spirit of the literary Holmes as is possible. Jude Law and Jared Harris work hard in support, but Noomi Rapace's fortune teller is out of place and Rachel McAdams remains awful. The worst thing about all this though is the nonsensical script, which turns realistic detective fiction into teen-friendly grandiose fantasy that remains frequently incomprehensible."

"humm_off","1","2","5","19 June 2012"," Not about Sherlock Holmes
","I think Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law would make a very good pair for a Sherlock Holmes movie, but unfortunately this movie is nothing but action and explosions - i.e, it is a movie about with two main characters named ""Holmes"" and ""Watson"" but there ends the resemblance with Arthur Conan Doyle's work.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a video game style shoot-em-up movie then this is for you. If you know who Basil Rathbone is and you are in the mood for that, by all means avoid ""A Game of Shadows"" It is visually interesting but absolutely sucks as a Holmes movie.<br/><br/>There are some good, if small, efforts to build the credibility of Downey Jr as a Holmes character but they are even too extreme for Doyle's style. There is no sense of class from Downey Jr in this role - it's as though he's remaking a Victorian version of ""Iron Man"" and it's an awful portrayal of Holmes. He appears to possess not just a superhuman intellect, which he should, but superhuman hearing and vision. Um, no. Apparently this Holmes is also a prizefighter - huh?<br/><br/>Finally, the cinematography in the numerous action scenes (making up more than half of the movie with visually interesting but utterly mindless fluff) is bizarre. There is a hyper-focus on minutia such as extreme closeups of bullets flying by characters in slow motion. Numerous explosions are painstakingly displayed in three dimensions, crawling slowly across the screen in super slo-mo. It's like examining a hair on a fly's eye from every possible angle . . . for 60 minutes non-stop.<br/><br/>If you are interested in a modern interpretation of Sherlock Holmes that Doyle would recognize, continue looking (check out the BBC's version?)"

","I personally don't like the interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. I think that Robert Downey Jr. does not fit for the role. Though he may be a good actor, he and Sherlock have different psychological types, I think. Besides, Guy Ritchie's style (too much kinetic, benny-hill-ish knockabout comedy) does not suit the noble, measured classic novels.<br/><br/>There is nothing really special. Meanwhile the movie is pretty watchable, stylish, entertaining. It has many neat details, sometime proper atmosphere, sometime funny (not so often). It's worth to see it at least once. Just for entertainment. Some evening after some brain crushing hard work, you know, just for relaxation. At least it's not kill your brain by its stupidity as Sherlock BBC may do."

","2009's Sherlock Holmes was something of a stylish mess, redeemed almost entirely by the superb performances and chemistry of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as the world's greatest consulting detective and his faithful friend, Dr. Watson. When this sequel finally gets up to speed, it's a better film in many ways. Before that, though, it spends a surprisingly long time floundering on screen in a very obvious and labored fashion. In both movies, it's almost like director Guy Ritchie struggles to admit to himself that he's taken Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic characters and reimagined them as a mixture of James Bond, Lethal Weapon and Matrix/300 special effects. I think Richie's version is invigorating but, goodness gracious, he seems to have a lot of trouble marrying that vision to competent plot.<br/><br/>In this go round, Holmes and Watson need the help of a gypsy fortune teller (Noomi Rapace) to stop Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) from staring a world war before the 20th century arrives. When the master of deduction and the Napoleon of crime come face to face for the first time, the movie clicks into gear and everything after that is a pretty fun adventure. Before that meeting, however, much of A Game of Shadows is problematic at best. The story takes forever in establishing its point and defining its main conflict, and not in a ""it's a mystery"" sort of way. It's more like a ""these filmmakers don't know what the heck they're doing"" sort of thing. The wedding of Dr. Watson is treated as a very big deal when, let's be honest, would anyone have cared if they'd simply broken off the engagement and restored Watson and Holmes to their Odd Couple status? On the other hand, Holmes' smarter brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry) is introduced in an abrupt and anti-climatic manner. Even though he's just plot device and comic relief, it feels like there should have been a bigger deal made out of him if Mycroft was going to be used at all.<br/><br/>This movie also makes the most publicly implicit acknowledgment of and apology for poor casting that I've ever seen in a motion picture. You can't tell me that if Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler had seemed more like Holmes' equal and less like his niece in the first film, the character would have suffered the same fate in this sequel. On the other hand, Noomi Rapace fits in very well with RDJ and Law. Not only does her character play a more believable role in the story and doesn't get shoved into some romantic entanglement with Holmes, but Rapace's more exotic, striking beauty meshes better with the grubbed up handsomeness of RDJ and Law.<br/><br/>Jared Harris deserves credit for his performance as well. It's not easy to be the counterpoint to an actor as talented and magnetic as RDJ, especially when your role is much quieter and less ostentatious. Harris' coldly commanding Victorian gentleman is easily the equal of the roguish Holmes and makes the viewer entirely believe that Moriarty may just be the smarter of the two. And director Ritchie, while indulging in lots of slo-motion punchy/explodey stuff, extended the battle as much into the mental realm and creates a genuine battle of wits that, like Conan Doyle's tales, the audience may not be able to anticipate but can always appreciate at the end.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows still isn't as good as its two stars. But while it takes a clear step back at the start, the film manages to take two steps forward by its conclusion. I still hope RDJ and Law can get at least one Holmes movie where the script can live up to their outstanding work."

","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) is on the trail of a case that if left unsolved could lead to a world war. His arch enemy, Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) is in the process of striking fear into the general public and creating political tensions between France and Germany to hopefully start a world war. As he puts it in the film, mankind is prone to fighting and it is inevitable that the world will come to blows...he just wants to own the bullets and the bandages.<br/><br/>A gypsy fortuneteller's brother has been recruited by Moriarty to assassinate a prominent government official in hopes that this assassination will be the final straw in a long drawn out plan to move France and Germany to war. Sherlock Holmes, enlisting the aid of his long time friend and colleague, Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) and the fortuneteller, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace), set out to foil Moriarty's plot and put an end to his reign of terror.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed this film more than the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" released in 2009. The balance of action and humor are excellent and the chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law is excellent. Jared Harris is very good in his part as the evil Moriarty. The film, although 129 minutes in length, moves along at a great pace. The use of slow motion during a scene when our heroes are fleeing a most dangerous situation is excellent.<br/><br/>I recommend this film even if you didn't see the first one you should enjoy installment #2. I have a feeling there may be a 3rd iteration in the coming years."
"rigoletto339","8","3","11","17 December 2011"," A new Sherlock Holmes
","This is not your old Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. This takes place in a parallel universe where Sherlock has become a master of martial arts and no-holds-barred street fighting. Any resemblance to the Sherlock we know from the books is purely coincidental.<br/><br/>If you see the movie with that understanding, you'll see a great action movie, with Sherlock fighting innumerable Bad Guys. Doyle's Bad Guys also inhabit this parallel universe: Professor Moriarty is a higher math professor, as well as a maniacal ""take over the world"" type. More sinister is the parallel Sebastian Moran.<br/><br/>The parallel Mycroft is excellently played by Stephen Fry. I kept asking, ""Why is Oscar Wilde in this movie?"", until I saw the credits.<br/><br/>Jude Law makes an excellent Watson. The script has him as having served in Afghanistan (yes, there was a war going on over there then).<br/><br/>Irene Adler makes a smallish appearance at the beginning, and Inspector Lestrade an even smaller appearance at the end.<br/><br/>There is gratuitous nudity in the movie, but unfortunately, it's Mycroft.<br/><br/>If you've read the Conan Doyle books, you know about Reichenbach Falls.

This is the worst Sherlock Holmes ""A Game of Shadows"" 2011 I have ever seen with Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes. It has some humor in it but it does not equal the amount of violence right from the beginning. Many scenes of fist fighting, buildings and rooms being bombed and injured and dead bodies under the debris.
Robert Downey is dirty and injured 95% of the time when he is not in disguise so enemies do not recognize him
Some of the cast I liked was Jude Law plays Dr Watson,
Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza Heron who is looking for her brother
After watching this for 2 hours and 7 minutes the only thing I found out was is that Professor Moriarty is still Holmes evil enemy.I don't know what this movie was about. Every body seemed to be an enemy to each other and modern guns were being produced.<br/><br/>Downey Jr plays in more Holmes movies. I did not see them but after this one I probably won't see them.

","Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in the sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. While I still maintain that the films would have been more enjoyable if the casting were reversed, the way each character is written is cemented even further in this second installment. Robert Downey Jr. is the eccentric detective, and Jude Law is the boring, superfluous straight man who's consistently annoyed by his partner's antics. The setting for this film is Jude Law's wedding to Kelly Reilly. In the art of storytelling, when a character is married the audience is usually supposed to see that his or her journey is complete and their usefulness to the plot is over. So, Jude Law's character is viewed as even more boring and superfluous!<br/><br/>As Jude and Kelly are supposed to be enjoying their honeymoon, the famed villain Moriarty, played by Jared Harris, attacks, leaving Bob to save the day, and leaving Jude to continuously complain that he'd rather be enjoying his wife than fighting bad guys. Still, if you liked the first film, Sherlock Holmes, you'll probably like the sequel. The action-comedies are pretty similar, and director Guy Ritchie returns with his slow-motion action scenes. These aren't my favorite Sherlock Holmes films, but they're not terrible either. I just would have preferred Jude Law as the lead."

I have not read the Sherlock Holmes books. So may be, many would disagree with me on the thought that no movie could have justified the character of Holmes better. But my friends, I have seen more than a couple of thousands of them. And that perhaps grants me the ability to praise one when I feel like. I will give the movie 9.9. 0.1 deducted, because the word ""Perfect"" is not heard in this world. Call it fate, I could not watch the movie when it came to theaters.

Hats off to Robert Downey Jr. for a performance even he himself will not be able to forget in his life. And special gratitude to Guy Ritchie for crafting the Masterpiece out of a great character.

"IllusionOfLife","7","2","6","21 December 2011"," Lacks the Spark that Made the First Film Great
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was a bit of a disappointment. While by no means a bad movie, it just didn't have the spark of the original. <br/><br/>The point of Sherlock Holmes has always been the fact that he really doesn't care about much other than solving his latest mystery. That's why he has no friends aside from Watson, what few romantic relations he's had have always been a bit screwed up, and he's addicted to drugs. While the first movie didn't quite capture those elements to the degree that they could have been (see the TV series House if you want the best version of Sherlock Holmes ever put to screen) they were still present and the film understood Holme's character. This movie doesn't understand Holmes. It tries to play him off as a heroic figure, which was never the point. Holmes doesn't solve crime out of moral obligation or a sense of heroism, he does it for the thrill of solving a new mystery, it's a game for him and one of the few things he truly enjoys. <br/><br/>The story this time around was solemn and heavy-handed and didn't allow itself to be fun like the first film was; the mystery was not very compelling and, in fact, hard to follow for most of the movie; but perhaps the biggest issue in the film was the wasted presence of one of literature's most well-known villains. Professor Moriarty, while played very well by Jared Harris, was a let down as a villain. Until the end of the movie, his conflict with Holmes didn't feel like two of the greatest minds of all time locked in a battle of wits. You weren't even really sure why this guy was supposed to be a villain outside of the fact that the movie told you he is. <br/><br/>I noticed that this time around there was a different writing team for the film which makes sense because the flaws in the movie felt like they came from the screenplay. The cast was just as good as last time, the direction was fine, but the focus of the story just wasn't there. I would definitely give this film another watch and suspect I'll appreciate it more the second time, but I can't recommend seeing it in theaters. Pick it up at Redbox when it comes out on Blu-Ray. In the mean time, go see Mission: Impossible or The Muppets again. <br/><br/>C+"

"chrome-hearts","6","2","6","19 December 2011"," Entertaining, but too much James Bond and not enough Sherlock
","As you probably know, A Game of Shadows is the sequel to the 2009 blockbuster that left orthodox Conan Doyle fans incredibly angry and the rest of the movie-going crowd suddenly really attentive to the fact that Sherlock Holmes still exists. At the time, I was of the latter—but I took it upon myself to go back and read the original stories and watch classic interpretations of those stories (Jeremy Brett is still my favorite), and after becoming the former I can honestly say: Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is just not Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were fantastic in their roles, as always. Noomi Rapace was also great, as was Jared Harris as Moriarty. Overall, I can't say anything bad about the performance of the actors. They had the chemistry to make the story move and the characters come to life, and I enjoyed that part of the film.<br/><br/>The technical things and interpretation is where the problems arise. For the editor in me, there were technical things in the movie that I just found awkward. The first was how they introduced the title—in the first movie it was slick, perfectly timed, and in classic Sherlock Holmes style. In this oneit seemed so forced. Also, Guy Ritchie took way too many cues from The Matrix, because there was a ridiculous amount of slow-motion sequences almost back-to-back during action scenes.<br/><br/>The interpretation left me with mixed feelings. Professor Moriarty is the arch-nemesis of Holmes, after all. Ritchie was playing with the big guns now, not some random lunatic who thought he could use black magic. Who was that again? Oh yeah, Lord Blackwood (who has apparently vanished into thin air—in fact, the entire first movie seems to have vanished into thin air). For the most part, I was liked how the film portrayed Moriarty—he was smart, menacing, and genuinely Moriarty—a satisfying equal for Holmes. Their conversations were honestly more heart-pounding than any explosions and gunfights. I loved that the tension between them was so cerebral.<br/><br/>Mycroft, on the other hand, was slightly sketchy. I didn't really understand his role in the movie. He was kind of a snob and sort of lacked common decency in one scene (if you've seen it, you know which one I mean), and didn't have the relationship I expected him to with his brother. Speaking of which, Holmes didn't seem to know much about his brother, which was contrary to what happened in the stories. Therefore, my opinion is that Ritchie got the Sherlock-Mycroft relationship totally wrong.<br/><br/>Holmes himself is also questionable. His relationship with Watson is smarmy and sarcastic, but almost excruciatingly so. Their banter is too exaggerated. I like his wit, and he's arrogant and insensitive to the way a normal human being should act, which is true to the books, but he was sodramatic. Holmes was never dramatic. He was an almost-sociopath who lived for his work. He was only interested in the details of his cases and frankly half-hearted about saving the day. This Holmes thinks of himself as an action hero. Real Holmes hardly took credit. At the end, Holmes does something that Holmes would never do: he alters Watson's manuscripts to make them more dramatic. Conan Doyle fans know that Holmes hated Watson's stories and how they portrayed his cases as adventures. He only wanted the facts. Holmes isn't a Hollywood star. He's a subtle hero, and Guy Ritchie tried too hard to cater to audiences that in this era wouldn't pay to see a guy sit in his chair, pipe between his lips and violin underneath his fingers.<br/><br/>Watson is a swashbuckler, but a little too much so. Same as in the first film, Jude Law as Watson just makes him too heroic. He was capable and smart, but not like this. It just doesn't feel right. But I suppose, it's an excuse to put Watson in every action scene.<br/><br/>And thus, explosions and fist fights fill this film. They're okay in moderation, but by the fourteenth action sequence, I couldn't believe that Ritchie was trying to pass this as a Sherlock Holmes movie. There was too much firepower and not enough of the intellect that made Holmes a great detective. Just because Conan Doyle mentioned in one story that Holmes and Watson 'apprehended a suspect' doesn't mean that suddenly Watson gets to fire a cannon and Holmes gets to send a guy flying through a wall. It's too much. It's way, way too much.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that Ritchie realized this at some point, and tried to please the fans of the stories. (Of course we were all still going to see the film.) The running gag about Brighton was pleasing. The ode to the Reichenbach Falls scene was surprisingly good; that was the first time that I smiled and thought, This is Sherlock Holmes. The fact that Watson's monologue was exactly the one from the books was satisfying. Ritchie was actually trying to make a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br/><br/>But a couple strolls down memory lane for Conan Doyle fans couldn't save this film from being completely not Sherlock Holmes. It was a fast-paced, entertaining movie on its own, and I respect it for that. I enjoyed the film as an action-adventure, but only at face value. The Conan Doyle fan in me just can't accept this as even a remotely sensible interpretation of the world-famous detective. Sherlock Holmes in my mind is an eccentric human being who has intrigued people with the strange workings of his mind. He's just not a fist-fight brawler or a prankster who puts on lipstick and shoots his friend with blow darts. This Holmes is silly, ridiculous, and undignified. He disappoints on many levels."
"DICK STEEL","7","2","6","17 December 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows
","The world's greatest detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle returns to the big screen once again after the successful boot up through director Guy Ritchie's vision back in 2009. Ritchie returns to the director's chair, along with main leads Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson respectively, going in to what would be the duo's toughest challenge yet with arch rival Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) whose intelligence rivals that of Holmes and is the equivalent of the greatest criminal mind out there, adopting loosely from Doyle's short The Final Problem, and following on from the seeds that were cunningly placed in the earlier film.<br/><br/>We return to Victorian England which sets the stage for Holmes to continue where he last left off, tailing ex-lover and thief Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams in a bit role only, which I suspect is for continuity purposes) who unwittingly becomes a part of an assassination attempt. With Holmes spoiling Moriarty's plot, we soon get to see the villain himself in the flesh, given that he only existed in shadows in the earlier film, and learn of his dastardly plans to catalyze a European theatre of war at least from which he would make money from shrewd investments carefully positioned in commodities and supplies. Yes if you did not already know, war is actually profitable business.<br/><br/>But it's not that clear from the start, and one of the quibbles I have from this installment is how we constantly get led by the nose from one episode to another, journeying with both Holmes and Watson, the latter having his wedding and honeymoon to Mary (Kelly Reilly) rudely interrupted, outside of 221B Baker Street, London and England in general, to go on a whirlwind European tour of a few countries as they chase the villain and his many henchmen to throw a spanner in their works. With mystery films there are clues and red herrings left behind in which the detective will break or revisit them in due course, but many times in this film the cheat mode got set, leaving room for plenty of convenience to happen and for the narrative to skew events to whichever direction it so desires.<br/><br/>While Professor Moriarty may be the strongest villain in Holmes' Rogues Gallery, the character here proves to be anything but. He's ambitious in his plans and shows no mercy in its execution, but he's somehow lacking that inherent menace that villains possess. His demeanour played by Jared Harris may throw anyone off guard that this academician has a brilliant criminal mind, and holds his own in fisticuffs against Holmes since they share similar strengths in analytics. It's not that Harris didn't play the role to expectations but I felt he got hampered by the limited screen time and to have plenty of his actual dirty work committed by others, makes him a brainy villain instead, that didn't get translated too well for the big screen.<br/><br/>So thank goodness that the Downey Jr and Law pairing still contain as much chemistry and fun as seen from the first film, and this camaraderie worked up advantages for the buddy relationship between Holmes and Watson that carried the film through as they go country hopping and crime busting. Again filled with plenty of innuendos and double entendre in their dialogues, the bromance here continues to be solidly strong, that a new ally in gypsy Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace) stood out like a sore thumb, unable to blend in with the duo naturally, and in some ways made her feel like an unwelcome female entrant into an all boys club.<br/><br/>As with almost all Guy Ritchie films, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is technically strong, with the look and feel of the film, consistent from that of the first, being one of the winning elements in my books. Incredibly detailed and intricately crafted, the sets, costumes, CG and production values are all top notch in transporting us back to an era that once was. The multiple flashback scenes that showcase how we get to where we are at the point of the narrative, and those events that play out in Holmes' mind, were all done with precision as we cue in to his thought process, and one of the plus points is that of Moriarty's input at times when it got boiled down to an intense battle of minds. And not forgetting Hans Zimmer's powerful score that's a natural companion piece from the first film.<br/><br/>I don't recall any other December period with that many blockbusters making their bow in Singapore, and this installment of Sherlock Holmes proves to be up there amongst the greats, but in some way lacked a certain X-factor to be truly memorable. Hinting at another film adventure, I hope the next one if it does get made, has what it takes to make the trilogy a definitive modern interpretation."

There are many callbacks to the original and it wastes no time introducing characters, relying on the audience having seen the first. Like in the title, games are referenced repeatedly which is nice writing. Without Rachel McAdams the movie loses a lot of its charm previously but the addition of Moriarty as a great villain and match for Sherlock makes up for it. I really do not have anything extra to say about this movie that I didn't say about the original. However, Downey's costume department really steps up their game here (in a mostly comedic and funny way). Definitely refrain from seeing the sequel if one hasn't seen the original considering this movie could be seen as less of a sequel and more of a part-two."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a period mystery film that premiered in 2011. The movie is directed by Guy Ritchie and is the follow-up to 2009's Sherlock Holmes movie that is also directed by Guy Ritchie. Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, and Rachel McAdams reprise their roles as Sherlock Holmes, Dr. John Watson, and Irene Adler. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson embark on an adventure across Europe to foil a plot by Professor Moriarty.<br/><br/>This sequel is incredibly entertaining and enjoyable. Anyone that enjoyed the first movie's style and direction will also enjoy the direction in this second installment of A Game of Shadows. If anyone is on the fence about the direction in the first movie this second movie absolutely improves upon it. The action scenes still have that slow motion slow-down and speed up however there is more of a reason for this choice in this movie. These scenes are used more to highlight the perill the main characters find themselves in. They are also executed in more of an entertaining fashion in this movie.<br/><br/>There is a strange misstep in this move that happens at the beginning. It is revealed that Irene Adler played by Rachel McAdams is working for Moriarty. She is immediately poisoned and dies. It felt weird that she was given a part of the main cast even though she was not present for much of the movie. That scene was a good way of introducing the main villain of Moriarty.<br/><br/>Montarty is a fantastic villain in A Game of Shadows. This is how I imagined Moriarty from the novels. Moriarty is a terrific villain in his writing, presentation, and execution. Moriarty's plans are well written in the execution and it is great to see them unfold on the screen. When Moriarty and Holmes do one last duel it definitely had an epic feeling of two intellectuals clashing. Everything up until that point had a lot of build up for Holmes to stop the plan of Moriarty.<br/><br/>Noomi Rapace joins the main cast of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as a Gypsy traveler. I enjoyed her character, but I still missed Irene Adler. Noomi Rapace does a good job in the role. I did not think the writing of her character was the best. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law does a
fantastic job and they continue to nail the role of Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.' This is a solid adventure mystery movie with a great period theme to it.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","17 December 2011. Guy Richie's risky photographic approach to this movie really shines somehow and even the over the top comedy like with the butler seems to fit nicely into the overall tone of action, intelligent humor, and mental twists and turns that consistently underlie Sherlock Holme's character. Like a Bourne movie plot twist in the movie, this Sherlock script also puts the audience at a sudden emotional tailspin and successfully uses the off balance of life and death to creep into the movie late making for a surprising suspenseful and even at times scary compelling experience. Richie has successfully introduced a new level of slow motion action to good effect along with a color scheme and set design that seems off but captures the period feel of the movie well. Like 3-D and Avatar, Richies introduces a new fresh and exciting look to the period and action movie that would have easily become a stupid and cheap looking feature film."

","The decades old rivalry between Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and arch-enemy Moriarty (Jared Harris) is rekindled in this second movie of the updated franchise, making the villain's belated appearance a welcome one. I kind of missed him in ""Sherlock Holmes"", though there was a tease of his eventual appearance near the end of that picture provided by Miss Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams). So on the flip side, it was a bit disappointing that she didn't have a larger role in this story, though it seems to me that situation will be rectified in future installments of this new series.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to get used to the idea of Holmes being a martial arts whiz, but it grows on you after a few viewings. Jude Law's Dr. Watson proves himself to be quite the scrapper as well, and I find it refreshing that his partnership with Holmes is on a more equitable basis than was ever seen in the Holmes flicks of the Thirties and Forties. Nigel Bruce would portray the good doctor as a comedic foil in most cases, whereas director Guy Ritchie affords Watson with an intellect almost as sharp as Holmes, and a cleverness that gets the proverbial sleuth out of more than his share of jams.<br/><br/>In a throwback to the cinema origins of Sherlock Holmes however, one's sense of finality when it comes to the demise of Moriarty will I'm sure, be sorely tested in a sequel. I was always amazed to see Holmes and Moriarty casually engaged in verbal combat in pictures of an earlier era, knowing what bitter enemies they were. In fact, as far back as 1945's ""The Woman in Green"", Basil Rathbone's Holmes would calmly declare to his rival Moriarty (Henry Daniell), that ""We shall walk through the gates of eternity hand in hand"". It looked like that might have been the case in this film, even if Holmes's comeback wasn't quite adequately explained. Therefore it's a given that Moriarty will show up again in the future. After all, he died falling from obscene heights in 1935 (""The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes""), 1942 (""Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon""), and again in 1945 (""The Woman in Green""). No reason to believe he won't be back again, more dastardly than ever."

"classicalsteve","8","1","2","30 May 2016"," An At-First Confusing But Eventually Compelling Chess Match Between Holmes and Moriarty
","One of the first criminal-geniuses in genre fiction is Professor Moriarty, the ever-present nemesis of Sherlock Holmes. The latter calls him ""The Napoleon of Crime"". Part of a successful Holmes film is how well Moriarty is portrayed. In this installment of the Robert Downey/Jude Law Sherlock Holmes film series, Moriarty is played by Jared Harris, a British actor and one of the best casting choices for the role to date. (Andrew Scott also makes a fine Moriarty, albeit a younger version, in the updated-modernized ""Holmes"" BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.) Prior to Moriarty, few if any criminal-geniuses were portrayed in genre literature, and Conan Doyle's creation remains one of the best. (Later characters in genre fiction of a similar nature include the Joker, Mr. Ripley, Lex Luther, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter.)<br/><br/>The film is at first rather confusing. We learn there have been a series of unexplained explosions around London causing lots of carnage, dismay, grief, and fascination for Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.). A woman then carries a package to a wealthy older man attending an art auction, which turns out to be a bomb discovered by you-know-who. Inside the bomb-package is a letter addressed to a gypsy fortune teller who practices at a cabaret in London. During a bachelor party for Dr. Watson (Jude Law), Holmes intervenes to save the gypsy from an assassin. We don't quite understand the connection between the gypsy and the bombings until well into the film.<br/><br/>Holmes soon realizes Moriarty, who fronts as an Oxford professor, is behind the attacks, but he doesn't know why. He meets with the professor at his office at Oxford and there Moriarty claims he is intrigued with Holmes' abilities, the only reason Holmes hasn't been blown to bits like other lesser Londoners. They agree to engage in a chess match of sorts. Moriarty, in true Conan Doyle style, believes he will outdo Holmes. Thereafter, Sherlock and Watson meet with his brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) who indicates he will be attending a peace conference in Switzerland where the major powers will negotiate to prevent an international war. Eventually, as events plays out, the peace conference and Moriarty's scheming will intersect.<br/><br/>The typical devices of the first film are all here, particularly the slow-motion flash-backs and action sequences with Holmes' voice-over describing what's ""really happened"". Although much of the movie is probably not what Doyle had in mind, Downey still makes a splendid Holmes, always playing his character just a bit understated. Jude Law reprises as the straight-man Dr. Watson, although his character is not quite as well-developed as Martin Freeman's interpretation of the character in ""Sherlock"". Highest marks for Jared Harris as Moriarty who nearly steals the show. Despite some of the confusion at the beginning, it's enjoyable once the plot becomes clear."
"ramsri007","9","1","2","4 October 2015"," Racy. Interesting. Intriguing
","As a Holmes fan, I couldn't have asked for a better take on the stories and the character of Holmes & Dr. Watson. Robert Downey Jr & Jude Law make their roles come alive with such élan that you just refuse to believe that anyone else could take on these roles. The only cast member who I felt was out of place was Jared Harris who acted as Professor James Moriarty. Somehow, I felt the role need someone more cold, calm yet menacing, and deep. Holmes' relationship with Watson is highlighted in this film. Their chemistry is hilariously funny as there are a few scenes involving Holmes dressed as a woman that brings the comedy to its peak with the lines ""lie with me Watson"". The action scenes were awesomely backed by beautiful cinematography. Some of the scenes help build a connection between the character and audience. For instance, when Holmes's sees everything as he says his curse; it engages the viewer on his personal thoughts. The train ride to Watson's honeymoon & the one with face-off between Moriarty & Holmes are my favourites. The movie ends with a hint of the next sequel. It has been some time since the game of shadows has released. I really am looking forward to the next Sherlock Holmes movie in this series."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","28 July 2015"," Inferior, Insipid & Uninspiring On All Levels.
","Despite making the right move of heading into the darker territory, the follow-up chapter to Sherlock Holmes fails to capitalise on the excellent platform provided by its predecessor and is a highly disappointing sequel that presents a downgrade in each storytelling element, tries too hard to be funny, and is also marred by its poor rendition of Holmes' arch-enemy.<br/><br/>Following the events of the first film, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows continues the adventures of Detective Holmes & his companion, Dr. Watson, as they travel across Europe in a race to prevent their fiercest adversary, Professor Moriarty, from executing his sinister plot of starting a global war, only to find that their enemy is always one step ahead.<br/><br/>Directed by Guy Ritchie, A Game of Shadows features more style & visual flair than its already impressive predecessor but fails to add anything of substance to its story or characters. Art direction is incredibly alluring, Camera-work adds a few more tricks up its sleeve but the use of slow-motion shots borders on excessive, Editing is terrible while Hans Zimmer's score is very much a rehash of the original.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law reprise their respective roles of Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson and while their chemistry works, their performance was much better in the last picture. The new additions include Jared Harris, Noomi Rapace & Stephen Fry and all of them disappoint for Harris' Moriarty isn't intimidating at all, Rapace just wanders around while Fry is annoying at times.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is inferior on all levels for this sequel completely fails to build on the solid foundation of its predecessor, is tedious to sit through, offers nothing captivating enough to keep the interest alive, and despite the modest expectations, fails to recreate the magic of the original. Putting more emphasis on action than its plot or characters, A Game of Shadows is an inferior, insipid & uninspiring movie that ends up making a mockery of two of Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creations."
"bowmanblue","8","1","2","26 April 2015"," Not bad... for a sequel
","One of the easiest ways to sum up Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows would be to say, 'If you liked the first one then you'll love this one too.' It's basically more of the same, but if what was done the first time was a winning formula, then who really care? (it worked for Terminator 1-3!).<br/><br/>You have more witticisms from Robert Downey Jr as Holmes, more of long-suffering Jude law as Watson and more trendy and stylish slow-mo directing, courtesy of Guy Ritchie. This time round they team up to lock horns with arguably Holmes' most famous villain - Moriarty.<br/><br/>You could call it all a re-tread of the first film, but in different locations, but that would probably be overly cynical. It's a new story in itself and, while certain purists complain that it's not completely faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original books, it's got its own charms. It may not be a hundred per cent accurate or believable, but it's basically Hollywood's take on what Sherlock Holmes was and - in my opinion - it's a pretty exciting take. Bring on Holmes III!"
"user-177-817364","7","1","2","10 December 2014"," This movie is a fantasy that involves cleverly thought out humor and adventurous scenes
","I stumbled across this movie when I accompanied my friend to the cinemas, and to my surprise it was definitely worth the audience's ticket price. ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" picks up where the prequel left off. Holmes is tracking down Professor Moriarty, a man he believes is responsible for a series of bombings and mysterious deaths around the world. Filled with schemes and suspense to reinforce how Holmes uses his detective skills to capture the criminal mastermind and antagonist who is just as smart as Holmes himself. The first scene takes place in Hotel De La Ville, Paris, in 1891 when Irene Adler delivers a package to Dr Hoffmanstahl, a payment for a letter he was to deliver. Holmes takes the letter while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. He later discovers that Hoffmanstahl is assassinated moments later. After getting himself involved in some tangles, Holmes is captured by Moriarty who interrogated and tortures him. With his natural instincts, Holmes manages to spell out Moriarty's plot, revealing that the professor secretly acquired shares in multiple war profiteering companies intend to instigate a world war to make him a fortune. Holmes cunningly replaced Moriarty's personal diary that contained all his plans and financing with a duplicate. They anticipate an impending physical confrontation and Holmes instead grapples Moriarty, however, forcing them both over the balcony and into the Reichenbach Fall. They are presumed dead. An action-packed and adventurous movie that captures the audience's attention to experience Holmes' journey of detective solving, also enter his surreal world of fantasy. <br/><br/>Main characters: Robert Downey Jr. portrayed Sherlock Holmes, Jared Harris portrayed Professor Moriarty, Jude Law portrayed Dr John Watson, Stephen Fry portrayed Mycroft, Holmes older brother, and Rachel McAdams portrayed Irene Adler. Robert Downey Jr. portrayed Holmes as brilliant and perceptive as he always has been. He is true to the character and adds his natural twinge of detective persona. It is refreshing to be seen such a well-loved character updated to appeal to a modern audience. Downey Jr. Plays the eccentric sleuth with the mixture of brilliance and manic tendencies. However, he also adds in his own elements to create a character that can be appreciated in the context of this film. Jude Law plays Dr Watson, a role he manages to pull off well through the clever use of a mustache an array of hats. Holmes' relationship with Watson is highlighted in this film. Their chemistry is hilariously funny as there are a few scenes involving Holmes dressed as a woman that brings the comedy to its peak with the lines ""lie with me Watson"". Rachel McAdams has a small role; the female lead is replaced by Noomi Rapace. She plays the mysterious fortune telling gypsy, Madam Simza Heron, who joins forces with Holmes and Watson when she discovers that her brother is concerned. She makes a wonderful companion for the two men. Jared Harris gives a convincingly evil performance as Professor Moriarty, the person with equaling brilliance of Holme's mind or his insanity. Stephen Fry plays Holmes' older brother, Mycroft. His character contributes little to the main plot.<br/><br/>The film had several climaxes with their rise and fall of action. It kept the pace of the movie up and viewers engaged. The action scenes were enhanced by the beautiful cinematography. Some of the scenes help build a connection between the character and audience. For instance, when Holmes's sees everything as he says his curse; it engages the viewer on his personal thoughts. The scene on the train ride to Watson's honeymoon, involving some large guns and Holmes disguised in a wig, dress and makeup was most likely to be the best humorous scene. The scene that I found rather surprising was when Holmes and Moriarty fall off the balcony and lands in Reichenbach Falls. Holmes is not injured by the fall and abodes drowning by using Mycroft's oxygen inhaler. He yet uses his tricks to escape another time, but of course the protagonist never gets written off the script. In the meanwhile, he conjures up plans to catch the next mastermind. <br/><br/>The partnership that Holmes and Watson enjoy is definitely more a lifelong relationship. The remnants of sibling rivalry that shows between Holmes and his older brother do not compare with what Holmes has with Watson. ""A man of many companions may now come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother"". Professor Moriarty is the villain. He manipulates everything to achieve his goals. His pride is shown when he has lunch with a victim who believes themselves safe in a restaurant only to find out that, at Moriarty's command, everyone leaves foretelling their impending doom. This lesson implies that one should not be too quick to befriend someone who comes across as trustworthy, as he is the one that betrays the innocent in the end. Morality has shed innocent blood and devised wicked schemes.<br/><br/>The target audience for this film would be anyone that enjoys an action-filled and suspense film, especially those young teens who are obsessed about detective stories. The main idea of the film is based on mysterious crime saving tactics. It is a thrilling and thoroughly enjoyable film, outstandingly captured the surreal fantasy brought to life on screens which were once a paperback story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The recommended age group can range from 13 - middle ages adults who enjoy detective stories that incorporate humor and suspense in the storyline. The MPAA rating for this film is PG-13. Overall, I thought it was a great movie for thirteen and above. It was definitely much better than the first Sherlock Holmes realized in 2009. There was hardly any offensive content. Rating: 41/2 out of 5."

","As a continuation, this isn't as great as the first part but the ending does take your breath away. <br/><br/>This movie portrays a very different side of Holmes quite on the likeness of Capt Jack Sparrow with some Tony Stark thrown in. Dr Watson thankfully isn't the bumbling fool he is made out to be in the books by AC Doyle. And Prof Moriarty seems far more formidable than in the books.<br/><br/>A great portrayal by Guy Ritchie and some fantastic performances by Robert Downey. <br/><br/>If you get bored in the movie, just remember that the ending is really nice. Wait for it. It is worth it."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","2","29 October 2014"," Similar to the first movie. Well executed, interesting, and exciting.
","I think it's popularly agreed that this is the better of the two newest Sherlock Holmes movies. This retains the genre of an action thriller that was introduced to this character in the first movie. Of course, in the stories, there are some light moments of action and suspense, but nothing like what is brought into these movies. The two movies are also, like much modern cinema, very much more dramatic than the literature of Arthur Conan Doyle's time. Some might not like the overpowering action element being integrated into this character, but I believe that it is done with the intention of appealing to the interests of modern audiences. Besides, the amazing deductions are still very present and the cinematography and display of the deductions is great, if a little too fast-paced at times. As in the first movie, a good amount of Holmes' deductive powers are used in combative settings. The techniques he uses in these situations are not explicitly illustrated in the stories, but have the same personality to them as some of his other more remarkable detective work. The two main points where this movie (and the first one) divert from the spirit of the stories are both connected to the plot. Firstly, there is a lot of international traveling and therefore many minor characters, whereas the original manuscripts usually consist of events with only a couple of outside characters within a fairly short distance of London. Secondly, the plot is again very important with, in the words of Holmes ""the collapse of Western Civilization"" at stake. I did not find that this detracted, but it is something for prospective viewers to look out for. Even if you are opposed to the breakage of Holmes tradition, the story is still good, if a bit complicated. If you can't or don't want to follow the major plot line, you can still enjoy the movie whether with the action or the deduction. Both of these two elements are interspersed frequently. The action is a bit more explosive than in the first picture. The fights have sort of upgraded in scale from hand to hand fights to machine gun barrages and bomb detonations with a couple of chase scenes. There is still some hand to hand and these scenes are all mixed with deduction. The deductions are varied in style. Some are done in the heat of combat with Holmes planning out his attack and defense with precision and a splash of superior humor. There are a couple of deductions of people, but these are less spectacularly portrayed. We get a good look at Holmes' crime scene deduction abilities. On at least three occasions, he is able to re- create a person or people's actions in a certain location and use it to his advantage. All of this is marked with the combined quirks of Robert Downey Jr. and Sherlock Holmes. That brings us to the characters, some new and some old. Holmes hasn't changed a bit and is still making queer remarks all the time in a somewhat arrogant way. This matches the ego of both Holmes and Downey's other characters (e.g. Iron Man). He has a hard time with his relationship with Watson since Watson is trying to enter his married life with Mary Morstan (who is given a pretty small role), but Holmes doesn't quite understand that this new life does not quite have room for him. Watson is again useful to an extent to Holmes in his work. However, the personality created for him in this version still does not make him a convincing friend to Holmes, which irritates me. Almost everything he does with Holmes is done reluctantly. That does not mean he is not a good character though, as he implements some of his own deductive skills at the end in rooting out Simza's brother (this was my favorite scene). Simza in this case is sort of the client, but is introduced as a string in the web of international politics with James Moriarty at its center. Moriarty is probably the most formidable adversary Holmes ever faces. He has very political and financial motives in his large scale crimes. He cowardly uses pawns to do his will, but we see his intellectual potency in his intriguing confrontations with Holmes, particularly the one at the end. The only other characters to address are Irene Adler and Mycroft Holmes. There isn't much to say about Irene here since she is SPOILER ALERT presumably killed off quite early. Mycroft isn't a huge part, but he is played well by Steven Fry and connects some of the international strings in the case. The final element to address is the execution. The acting was solid all around as was the script. The cinematography was, as stated before excellent both in its transitions and its portrayal of Holmes' deductions. The score has much of the same feel with Hans Zimmer's lilting violins and deep horns. The costumes were good too, though everything was annoyingly dull, almost as if a tint of grey was added to every pixel. Overall, I would say that if you liked the first one, you'll love this sequel. If you want an interesting or exciting movie, this should satisfy those desires. It might be disappointing to fans of the traditional Holmes stories, but it retains many of the original elements. Apart from that, the only reason anyone interested might not enjoy it is if they can't tolerate overly complicated story lines. Overall Rating: 8.8/10."

It's not a surprise thus that Noomi hasn't really the opportunity to shine: her best moment is her introduction because the way she says ""'i'm Madame Zimza"" is really charming!<br/><br/>By expanding the scope of an European playground and run after a big conspiracy, Holmes loses his originality all along and this sequel appears more like a James Bond movie done by gaslight!"

This time around Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) has little screen time, but she does drive the storyline. It is too bad she's not there because the chemistry between Irene and Sherlock jumps off the screen. The film feels the absence terribly. Simza is no replacement.

","Peppered with enough pointless slow mo and colourful explosions to keep most people happy Sherlock Holmes 2 is bloated and direction-less. It just about flirts with a vague and familiar plot involving an evil genius and a possible world war but never quite embraces it properly and fully. The film also manages to skip any meaningful character and story progression by virtue of a succession of languid expository sequences and monologues. Furthermore, it fails to engage or involve the audience as its overtly 'clever' central characters have to constantly remind us what is going on and more importantly, why we should care. The trick with this kind of movie is to show us the intellectual merit of our characters but to always let the audience be smarter, it has to be this way otherwise there is no connection, no cinematic symbiosis.<br/><br/>It is too easy to lambaste the film for not holding true to the source material, so i wont do that here but it is important to note that the film is astonishingly short on mystery or indeed, any interesting ideas. Instead we get so-called 'clever' disguises, whimsical plotting and an overwhelming sludge of absurdity more akin to that of a Tom Cruise era Mission Impossible film. <br/><br/>Finally, Guy Ritchie continues to be director of interest although this is not always due to the importance or success of his films. Indeed, he seems to have a few ideas up his sleeves but sadly gleams too much delight from showing us the same ones over and over again from project to project. How is the fighting between Sherlock and his faceless baddies here any different to Brad Pitt's bare knuckle forays in Snatch? Also, how long can we endure the Tarantino-lite, pseudo-intellectual rumblings of his central characters who seem intent on talking around the films hollow plotting with puffed up similes and mindless metaphors. <br/><br/>Anyways, this all results in the movie being a mildly watchable piece of cinematic pap."

","It seems that the writers managed to detect whatever people liked from the first movie, and literally repeated that hoping to please them again. The worst is that, reading other reviews, this cheap initiative worked fine for most of them. But there's something even more threatening than cloning your own movies. In the first movie, Holmes is confronted to apparent magical powers challenging his skills and reasoning (which is the most important thing in the plot), while in the second, is the plan simply lowered to an evil strategy around warfare? You can even see Holmes and Watson holding a gun in the DVD cover and posters... food for thought.<br/><br/>Let me go a bit further in guessing. This reminds me what happened with The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Daemons, the former with truth and depth, the latter with lies and lack of imagination. It makes me wander if somebody from outside the cinema industry has affected both Sherlock Holmes and Da Vinci Code sequels for some reason.<br/><br/>One more thing, the dialogs are twisted way too much, compared to the meaningful, short and hilarious punch lines succeeded in the first movie.<br/><br/>Now the good thing about A Game of Shadows is the adventure, the chemistry between the actors and that this version of Sherlock Holmes is totally enjoyable and cool.

","When my supervisor at Dish said that the next Sherlock Holmes movie was out on DVD I knew I had to watch it. I have been reading the books since I was a child and had always wondered how they would include Holmes' amazing intellectual insights without using a narrator. They did an amazing job of it. Sometimes these amazing leaps of mental agility would be stated plainly, or stated as if it were very plain to Holmes rather. On other occasions they would actually slow time down and go through, step by step, what was going through the mind of Holmes, which was just as good if not better than the former. I would have loved to buy this movie but since I couldn't afford to I rented it with my Blockbuster at Home subscription. Since then, I have watched it about three times total now. It is a must see. Even if you cant afford to buy it outright, you need to see this move."

","As the critic Ebert states, this Sherlock Holmes bears little resemblance to the Holmes of the books or earlier movies. I suppose today's movies, to be well-received by audiences, must have almost non-stop action, gunfights, and explosions, and this one does.<br/><br/>I found the story to be a bit obscure, but narrows down to Holmes needing to solve the mystery where an old adversary is intent on getting war started in Europe because he would stand to get wealthy on it. I suppose the old adage ""follow the money"" is alive and well.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. of course plays Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law is back as his sidekick Dr. John Watson. A wrinkle is that Watson is getting married and his new wife plays a prominent role in the eventual code-breaking that is required to solve the mystery.<br/><br/>Jared Harris is the adversary, Professor James Moriarty. It was nice to see Noomi Rapace in a different role as Madam Simza Heron. I can't easily explain what her character's function was.

","I must agree i was really awed by the art-direction and near-perfect costume design. It's really difficult to bring forth the life and culture that existed more than a century back.<br/><br/>The movie failed to meet every single expectation set by its prequel. Sherlock Holmes, known for his wit and intelligence in deciphering codes, codes that could unfold a mystery, is presented as a polar opposite of his original-self in this movie.<br/><br/>The Editing that forced all our jaws ajar in the prequel, has become nothing less than a bore. Too many plans of action makes the editing hackneyed. Hans Zimmer's reboot of the original tracks is the only bright facets of the movie, though the originals were comparatively better.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie raised our hopes of experiencing a near-Doyle world in which Sherlock rescues the yesteryear England from the hands of Moriarty in the first part.

","Jeez! The repeating of the violent scenes where Holmes would envision what he would do and then the actual fight, was very confusing. Deleting the duplicate scenes would have made the film have been shorter. Then the munitions factory, what was that all about? Slow motion to distraction, what did this add to the film? Not much. The weapons, such as the gas piston type of weapon used by Watson during this part of the film was not in type of successful production till 1910 or so. The pistols where not in production till later as well. I only mention this because the pistol in production looked much more interesting and showed the general laziness about the writers then anything else. If the film was about a consulting detective then how did Holmes get the job? In any Holmes story he has to meet with the client, it is a basic rule of the Sherlock Holmes style. Consultants don't just jump into the job they have to think and review. Good pieces and actors where the wife of Watson and Mycroft, the movie was worth just for them. Professor Moriatory was well played and one wished for more of him. Downey acted well, just not as Sherlock Holmes and was fun to hang with. Jude was a good Watson, but without a Holmes. Mrs. Hudson, why not just have Paltnow take the part. Then it would have been truly Victorian Iron Man. The movie was enjoyable but it was not a Sherlock Holmes movie in any sense. It was fun to see the question mark at the end, but really did we need it? No. The deviation from the historical accuracy made the film more expensive to make and took away from the detective component. I am glad to have watched this on pay per view and not paid 15 us dollars to see it. Best I can say is that it too long for no reason but not a waste of time."

","Apparently, unlike most of you, my wife and I found ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" to be dreary and uninvolving. Rachel McAdams (""Irene Adler"") provides nothing more than a cameo; and Noomi Rapace (Madame Simza), who impressed so much in the ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy, is simply too remote and cool to provide much chemistry. The cliché gypsy fortune teller has flair; Rapace barely registers beyond her action sequences. Note to Naomi: Watch ""Golden Earings"" with Marlene Dietrich to see how it is done. Speaking of action sequences, there are WAY too many in ""...A Game of Shadows"". Action sequences require a tension build and there simply isn't any. Perhaps, worst, Jared Harris essays a bland Professor Moriarty. Then there is the story; little mystery, lots of noise and a climax that should really frustrate fans of ""Sherlock Holmes"". It is more appropriate to a third, fourth or even fifth movie.<br/><br/>Memorable performances by Robert Downey, Jr., Jude Law and Stephen Fry (""Mycroft Holmes"") plus top-not production values are all that saves this movie from being a total ""dog.""

"cbn119-258-962279","4","1","2","23 June 2012"," My dear Watson, it appears we've become caricatures of ourselves...
","The first Sherlock film, while surely a departure from the traditional way a Holmes story is told, I thought to be quite enjoyable, despite its few flaws. Game of shadows, however is an entirely different experience- and not in a good way. I won't sit and dissect the entire plot if the movie, but I will tell you what it does well, and what it fails miserably at doing.<br/><br/>The good: There is no shortage of witty banter or a good time to be had watching the two leading men go about their mysterious trade. When the action scenes occur, they are fast- paced and visually stimulating to watch. The film does a wonderful job at being an authentic-feeling period piece ( for the most part.) Characters are often dirty, bleeding, and they retain their bruises for days after a skirmish. Also notable is the score, which contributes to the mystique of the Holmes universe, but with a smattering of action film- style ambiance added into the mix. <br/><br/>The Bad: Unfortunately, so many things are wrong with this film. I could buy in the first film that, given his genius level and insatiable appetite to learn, Holmes was a skilled fighter. However, game of shadows seems to endow him with superhero qualities, as he dispatches trained soldiers, Russian Cossack ninja's, and the like. The film falls flat during most scenes and lacks interesting character development, personality, and subplots altogether. Downey and Law are THE only element keeping the film afloat most times. More frustrating is the films over-use of the bullet time sequences, and the strong vibe that the movie is thoroughly impressed with itself throughout the entire sitting. Particularly eye- roll inducing is what I like to call the ""Jack Sparrow"" effect; in that the producers seem to think the audience are a bunch of idiots who ONLY want to see Holmes at his absolute craziest. This is forced in every scene, and the result is an, almost, cartoon version of Downey's portrayal in the first film. Lastly is the movie's lack of direction and ""bite"" to its plot. Most times it's unclear what the objective is. And Moriarty's lack of showing his criminal genius is a missed opportunity, his evil plans somewhat esoteric. <br/><br/>Bottom line: <br/><br/>Game if shadows is worth a rental if you're a fan. But don't expect to be dazzled. Shadows is at it's best when playing up the tense moments of deduction by Holmes and company, but those moments are few and far-fetched. Sometimes great actors are given not-so-great material. (I'm looking at YOU, Phantom Menace)"

","That quote form a Gilbert and Sullivan lyric defines this movie's appearance. Remember that particular pleasure of reading Arthur Conan Doyle's intelligent and vastly entertaining stories about a man and his sidekick whose braininess unraveled impossible mysteries that no one else could solve? That man was Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick was Dr. Watson, and neither of the ghosts of those two fascinating and intelligent gentlemen can be found in this lengthy, boring mess of a film that seems to be concerned only with action movie clones so popular today and setting in a period that allows beautiful costumes to hide the lack of story. Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney are responsible for hiding behind famous literary characters to create a script that is likely less than 5 pages long. Guy Ritchie is the star of this noisy piece.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his longtime trusted associate, Doctor Watson (Jude Law), take on their arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), with the help of Holmes's older brother Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) and a gypsy named Simza (Noomi Rapace). Now make a movie-long story out of that and you have the second installment (and hopefully the last) of Sherlock Holmes a la Guy Ritchie. The endless fighting on the screen is also populated by some fine actors such as Rachel McAdams, Eddie Marsan, and Kelly Reilly. If the viewer is entertained by the countless costume changes by Robert Downey, Jr. and by some fairly silly swashbuckling by all concerned then perhaps the two hours will pass quickly. But in the end there is simply no story or resemblance to the creations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to warrant plagiarism of his books. Pass. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

Though the represented personalities differ a lot in their approach, but the underlying characters remains the same. Both Solve Cases !!<br/><br/>We had studied many stories of Sherlock Holmes in school which was very boring since Sherlock Holmes was just too Classic and Sober. Thus with the same thought saw this adaptation and I was quite impressed with the first part, it made a a fan of Sherlock Holmes by Guy Richie.<br/><br/>The best part of part 2 lies in how the part 1 is extended in all its forms of Action, Thrill and lots of Mind Bending logic. Guy Richie gets his camera works on the spot by mixing thoughts and actions into a very interesting situation which treats eyes and mind. The movie makes you think and learn how dots can be connected to form a picture.<br/><br/>I would understate my thoughts if i said i loved Robert Downey Jr, He seems to have made a unique identity for Sherlock Holmes with the kind of portrayal.

","Having enjoyed the first Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes adventure and having read all the Conan Doyle stories in the past, I was of course looking forward to the next Ritchie instalment with bated breath. And I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>From the first scenes, the game was afoot. And with not a spare second to dip into your popcorn tub, you're taken on a roller-coaster ride through the darkest depths of Victorian London and pre WW1 Europe, where you get to marvel in some superb set pieces, eye catching special effects and deliciously quirky characterisations.<br/><br/>On the downside, the plot is a little slight in substance, and the rather irritating fashion to cram in as many 'dark' scenes as possible (ie night shots, or rooms with no lights etc), can be a little annoying at times. I also thought Jude Laws Watson was a little bland and a let-down in comparison to Downey Jrs all out, take no prisoners characterisation of Holmes. These are only small gripes however, as the film overall is a thoroughly enjoyable romp that will earn a few repeat views in the fullness of time.<br/><br/>In addition to the spectacular sets, special effects and performance by Downey Jnr as mentioned above, Stephen Fry was excellent and a good choice for Mycroft, and I thought Jared Harris' performance as Professor Moriaty had a nice underlying evilness about it. I also thought the Holmes' fun 'interior' chameleon disguises were great fun and very original.<br/><br/>All in all then, an excellent period adventure film and well worth two hours of anyone's time. Roll on the next instalment."

Jude Law returns as his partner Doctor Watson and Guy Ritchie once again directs (2 years after the immensely popular updated original). Rachel McAdams reprises her role as Sherlock's loves interest Irene Adler, in a cameo, and Jared Harris, Stephen Fry and Noomi Rapace (the original 'GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO') also join the cast this time around. The movie is complete chaos and extremely hard to follow but it's also got a lot of great thrills and energy. I can't imagine this new Sherlock Holmes being very faithful to the original (which I know little about) but these movies are definitely entertaining in their own right.<br/><br/>This chapter is based on Conan Doyle's 'The Final Problem' but only loosely. It revolves around the marriage of John Watson to the love of his life Mary (Kelly Reilly). When Holmes learns that his archenemy Professor Moriarity (Harris) might try and harm Watson and his new wife, to get back at Holmes, Sherlock must of course involve the good doctor in his adventures once again.

It's up to Holmes, Watson and Heron to save Europe and the rest of the world.<br/><br/>There's so much going on in this movie and it's so fast paced that it's almost impossible to keep up with.

","It opened on Christmas Day and the Sherlock Holmes sequel proves to be quite a gift to moviegoers. In ""A Game of Shadows,"" Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Holmes and Dr. Watson, carrying on a fine bromance complete with trivial spats, heated arguments, wrestling matches and unwavering loyalty. It's clear that these two would do anything for each other, including sacrificing their lives.<br/><br/>While there is a mystery afoot in ""A Game of Shadows,"" the theme of the first Sherlock Holmes movie and its sequel are the same — they both deal with love and loss. Holmes feels great affection for Watson, but the good doctor is about to get married and Holmes is clearly jealous of the bride.<br/><br/>While Watson prepares for his wedding, his best man, Holmes, prepares a wild stag night. Even though it doesn't go quite as awry as the bachelor party in ""The Hangover"" it certainly isn't focused on Watson. Holmes uses the evening's opportunities to gather more clues to his latest mystery, the diabolical scheme of his arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty.<br/><br/>Seemingly not quite able to deal with his best friend's nuptials, Holmes derails the honeymoon — at one point donning a drag ensemble — and throws Watson's bride from a moving train. While his actions look extreme, the audience trusts that Holmes knows what he's doing. Also, Holmes truly loves his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) but he faces losing her to the evil clutches of Moriarty, too.<br/><br/>One of the best features of these Sherlock Holmes movies is the use of super slow motion in the middle of hectic, fast-paced scenes. It's a fascinating juxtaposition of styles and it makes certain sequences absolutely mesmerizing, including one scene in which Holmes, Watson and the band of gypsies they've enlisted for help come under fire from Moriarty's well-armed henchmen. There's something really satisfying about watching a bullet travel in slow motion and pierce through the jacket of a sprinting Watson.<br/><br/>A new addition to the cast is Stephen Fry as Holmes' brother, Mycroft. He is a hoot, especially since he prefers to walk around his manor house in the nude. Little surprises like that make this sequel much funnier than the original.<br/><br/>While part of the appeal of these movies is to figure out the mystery, the thing I liked best about this sequel was watching the two delightful characters of Holmes and Watson, inhabited by immensely entertaining actors, have so much fun together on screen."

","Sherlock Holmes: It was a movie with so many action - comic - thriller and hallucination points I saw both of the series which has been screened and I liked them both. both of them followed almost the same cinematographic techniques which was very interesting and grabbed my attention which was Sherlock Holmes hallucinations or better to say imaginations of analyzing the real actions in his mind (I mean all of the fight scenes) and I think the director used Phantom Camera to facilitate his goal in order to convey it perfectly to the audiences... One of the most interesting points which I think was the weak point of the story is related to usage of Adrenaline by Dr to woke up Sherlock Holmes in the train ; the story of Sherlock Holmes was first published in 1887 but the first invention or discovery of Adrenaline was in 1895 by a Polish physiologist Napoleon Cybulski but as I said before Hollywood movies conquer your heart and captures your mind with marvelous special effects and make you to hold your breath and distract you from the real world so it wont let you to you think about it and you as a viewer forget to just think about it. I think this series will be continue because Sherlock Holmes typed a question mark with a typewriter and it had dual meanings first to the Dr to show that no I am still alive second for the audiences to show that do you think that it is the End of the series ? it means it will be continue."

","Considering how much I enjoyed the first film and being someone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes movies and TV shows (The Granada series with Jeremy Brett series being the most notable), I was looking forward to seeing this film. Now having seen the film I can say I enjoyed it, this sequel has elements of action, humor, adventure, and camaraderie. Yet, it lacked a certain polish that I was expecting as sequels are supposed to be superior and more colorful than their predecessors. This film is not better than the first film but it isn't a waste of time either.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The classic duo of the world's greatest consulting detective and his trusted medical companion. This time they have to deal with a new nemesis Professor. James Moriarty also known as ""The Napoleon of Crime."" Along, the way they meet a gypsy Madame Simza, whose brother Moriarty has hold on.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. and Law continue to have great chemistry. The way that they play off each other makes this almost a buddy picture. There plenty of action, changes in scenery as well as tongue in cheek humor. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty is a much more interesting villain than Mark Strong's Lord Blackwood from the first film. Also, Noomi Rapace is a much better leading lady than Rachel McAdams was as Irene Adler. Guy Ritchie continues to show off his directorial style, particularly with the somewhat lengthy slow motion sequence where our heroes are running through a German forest with bullets crashing and splintering through the trees. The music, photography, and production values are splendid. It was also fun to see Stephen Fry as Holmes equally brilliant and eccentric brother Mycroft.<br/><br/>However, although there were improvements in some areas, I still feel the first film is better as it had more personality. Some purists have criticized Guy Ritchie's Holmes films for being more about action and comedy then about mystery and deduction. I prefer the first film mainly because it was more like a detective movie where there was a good balance of both deduction as well as action. Here, it is more of a breathless action-adventure yarn with a second half that drags a bit. Also, the supporting characters such as Mycroft or Mary Morstan could have had more development.<br/><br/>Still, if you don't take the movie seriously (which I don't think your supposed to) it has plenty to enjoy. Even though it was a lesser film than the first I might still buy it when it comes out on DVD. This film was a big success at the box office as well as with the public, so there will probably be a third sequel and when that happens I will be looking forward to it again."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","2","5 February 2012"," Action first of all and visual effects
","Quite a well done film situated at the very moment when Sherlock Holmes is supposed to die in the Alps to be resuscitated twenty years later or so by his author Sir Conna Doyle. Of course here there is no suspense. We know the end.<br/><br/>But the characters of Holmes – and his brother mind you – Dr Watson and their arch-enemy Dr Moriarty are so well acted and depicted that just for these three or four guys you have to go and enjoy the action. In 1891 in Europe everything was centered on France and Germany and England was something like the umpire. By playing on that situation the film, just like the original stories, is super dramatic since we know such efforts are vain since they will only postpone the event. Sooner or later the industrialized war will have to happen and after that one the industrialized genocide will have to come before the world can finally start thinking twice before shooting the first bullet.<br/><br/>The action is packed so tight that we cannot even breathe between the sequences and we travel all over the continent, London, Strasburg, Paris, Iceland, and some other places. Perfect. Good entertainment, even if the gay innuendo is a little bit insistent with Sherlock's brother being even more on that side than Sherlock himself. It is in a way funny but maybe next time we could move on and just imagine a Sherlock Holmes who likes adventure and a Dr Watson who knows adventure is never funny alone and is a lot better, like chess and draughts in pairs. But if the director gets his kicks out of this, let him get his kicks and let us get a smile, though Sherlock is a lot better at dressing like an armchair than disguising himself as a woman. The beard shows quite nicely under the lipstick."

The presence of Rachel McAdams as Irene also brought a different dimension to the first movie because she was a great partner and, as Sherlock mentions in the story, she is ""the woman"" and I could not hide my disappointment when I noticed that her presence in The Game Of Shadows would not only be important, but also brief... very brief.<br/><br/>Instead of Rachel McAdams, now there is Noomi Rapace performing gypsy Simza Heron, a character that appears and disappears and no one even notice that during the movie.

"MaximumMadness","7","1","2","1 February 2012"," ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shaodws"" starts off on a sour note, with a weak first act, but once the pace picks up, the Finale makes up for it!
","Guy Ritchie's 2011 sequel ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a bit of an oddball film. I adored the 2009 film, and thought that Ritchie and his stars (Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law) did a great service to the character- delivering a fresh take on it, at least in comparison to previous films, while still maintaining a classic mystery story. However, 40 minutes into this one, I was ready to fall asleep. The first act of the film has its moments, but felt extremely sloppy and thrown together. I actually hated it, and that's quite a feat, as I generally love films, and am very hard to not please.<br/><br/>However, I am glad to say that once the film hits the halfway point, something happened- the pace picked up, the characters fell back into stride, and everything seemed to fit together much better. The pieces of the puzzle fell into place, and the film worked darned well. I fell in love with the characters again, and in particular, the finale was amazing. So, I am happy to report that despite a shaky beginning, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" ended up being a good, fun film. Not quite as good as the first, but still a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The plot is a bit hard to follow (mainly due to the somewhat-sloppy first act), but the plot boils down to this- Sherlock (Downey Jr. is perfect... 'nuff said) finds himself in a battle of wills against Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris in a chilling performance), whom is hatching a scheme of some sort, which may lead to a worldwide war from which he would profit. It's pretty basic- Sherlock must stop the villain. It's simple, but it works, mostly. (Although a few subplots involving Moriarty's henchman, and other aspects of his plan seem slightly convoluted.)<br/><br/>The acting all around is marvelous. Like I said, Downey Jr. is perfect- when is he not? Jude Law is a lot of fun as Watson. Jared Harris makes a great foe for Holmes, and comes off as someone you both despise and admire. Kelly Reilly as Mrs. Watson is fiery and fun. Noomi Rapace as the gypsy woman is interesting, though a little under-utilized. Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes was hilarious, though a bit over-the-top. I even liked Rachael McAdams in her cameo of Irene Adler. (I'm one of the few people who didn't hate her in the first film, although this just may be the fact that I have a massive crush on her.) The acting is all solid.<br/><br/>The action was a step up. From a fun chase sequence involving an assassin at Watson's bachelor party, to a massive sequence where Holmes must outrun artillery fire from an army, it is all magnificent. Although I must complain slightly about the use of ""Holmes vision"" in this movie. I am referring to the ""slow-motion"" moments in the first film where we enter Sherlock's head, and hear him plan out his moves. It didn't seem to work as well in this movie. In fact, the first time it happens, I wasn't sure what was happening, as it was stylized a bit differently in this film. I wish they had stuck with the way it was in the first film.<br/><br/>The film was shot beautifully, and the music was all suitably magnificent. From a technical standpoint, this is a very well-made film.<br/><br/>So I am going to go back and address my initial complaint a bit more. That is, the sloppy first act. Something about this film just felt a little forced. It felt like the director and writers knew that there was a quota and formula for films like this, and just followed the basic outline. It didn't have much heart for the first 40 minutes. I could have sworn Ritchie was running down a checklist: ""Uh, I guess we need a small pre-credit fight sequence... check. A first act chase scene, I guess we can throw one in. Make the humor more blatant. Check."" It was too sloppy and formulaic.<br/><br/>However, like I said, the film does reach a point where, all of the sudden, everything started to fall together. And once it picks up, I was able to forgive a lot of the mistakes of the film.<br/><br/>I'm giving ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" a 7 out of 10. The first part of the film kinda sucked, but once it picked up, it became a treat, and fit right back in with the fun tone of the original. If you're a fan, go see it!"
"Ganieda1","10","1","2","26 January 2012"," Witty, rollicking Game of Shadows; surprisingly great Holmes!
","I went into this movie not knowing quite what to expect -- I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I can remember, and I missed the first Guy Ritchie/Robert Downey Jr. (RDJ) Sherlock movie because I'd heard it turned Holmes into some kind of Victorian-era action hero. Well, that was my loss - I LOVED this film. It's a rollicking, slam-bang, intelligent, witty and compelling update of the Sherlock Holmes canon, and surprisingly, in many cases it is closer to Arthur Conan Doyle's original concept of the characters than many earlier movies and TV shows have been. Doyle, remember, was writing popular, mass-market entertainments - and his Sherlock is not a stuffy, sedentary dude who just sits around in his armchair puffing his pipe and working out Great Deductions. The original Sherlock IS a man of action -- he is a boxer (yes, that's canon!) and in ""The Final Problem,"" where he fights Moriarty to the death at Reichenbach Falls, we learn he knows an Asian martial art called ""baritsu"" (there actually IS one called ""bartitsu,"" which may have been what Doyle meant). So RDJ's take on Sherlock is spot-on canonical -- manic, genius-brilliant, a bare-knuckle fighter, a martial-arts expert, a violinist, an imbiber of intoxicating substances (though they don't show his cocaine habit - interestingly, it was OK to mention it in Doyle's age, but in ours, it has to be Sherlock swigging stuff like formaldehyde and gypsy wine, although Mrs. Hudson does mention he survives on a diet of tea and ""coca leaves""...).<br/><br/>RDJ's Holmes is also dashingly handsome, as is, for once, Dr. Watson (how could he not be, when played by Jude Law?). And this, too, makes absolute sense -- Watson was portrayed by Doyle as a wounded war hero recently returned from Afghanistan (that earlier Afghan conflict that England found itself embroiled in), so it would make sense that Watson would be fairly young and in fighting trim (Law uses a cane and limps a little, due to that war wound, but he's a mean hand with both a stick and a gun) -- not some old, querulous duffer as portrayed by so many earlier actors taking on Watson.<br/><br/>There's a fair amount of covert (and overt, hilariously enough!) slashiness (fan term for, er, ultra-bromance) going on - Holmes and Watson are definitely crushing on each other; they bicker and make up like a married couple, which is the ongoing in-joke of both movies (yup, I've seen the first one, now, too!). All this means the ladies don't get to do a whole lot -- ""The Woman"" of Holmes' life, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is in this movie only very briefly (and I'm not buying that she's gone for good...). Watson's new wife, Mary, gets booted early, too, but I can tell there's a lot more going on there - I'm liking Mary, and she gets to do a little a**-kicking of her own in this one. The leading lady of this movie is Noomi Rapace, playing the gypsy Madame Simza -- Noomi is the original Swedish ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" and she's put on a few curves to take on this, her first big role in an American movie. She does well here, but her character is mostly a plot device to lead us to the middle of the web woven by Holmes' arch-nemesis, the ""Napoleon of crime,"" Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris of ""Mad Men,"" son of the late Richard Harris).<br/><br/>Now here is a villain worthy of Sherlock Holmes. Harris' Moriarty radiates menace, with his foxy face and yellowy teeth; he's here (in 1891)trying to create a sort of proto-World War I by taking over the whole line of products, ""from bullets to bandages"" -- including an armaments factory where some enormously anachronistic weapons are being manufactured, which becomes a setpiece battleground in the movie. Nicely done, too. Director Ritchie may have gone a bit overboard in his extreme slo-mo sequences, showing bullets crashing through and splintering trees as our heroes flee through a German forest, but it's all undeniably beautiful. The effect of his ""Holmes-o-vision"" (where Holmes -- and we -- ""see"" what will happen in a fight just before the fight takes place) is also very cool, especially when things don't quite turn out as Holmes pre-envisions them. It's especially effective in the final confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty at Reichenbach, where the two engage in one of the great cinematic chess matches of all time (and half of it is in their heads, not on the board! And yes, there's a ""chess adviser"" listed in the credits, so I have to assume the moves are all realistic...).<br/><br/>A large part of the joy of this movie is just seeing an ultra-intelligent character who also gets to be an action hero -- so often, intellect is downplayed in movies, or relegated to the bad guy (aren't the bad guys always the brainy ones?); or the intellectual is portrayed as a sedentary ""man of thought"" rather than action, as in most earlier Sherlocks. This Sherlock Holmes dares to break the mold, and for that I say ""Huzzah!"" and here's to many more in this series. Thumbs way up!"
"kristospencer","7","1","2","23 January 2012"," Fun, but not without flaws
","I'm not going to give you a scene-by-scene critique, just a few observations about this fun but flawed movie. It's been said that the second Sherlock movie lacks the witty banter of the first and is too frenzied for its own good, and I have to agree. The banter isn't terribly memorable and what little you get is jammed into action scenes that border on incomprehensible if not preposterous. The pace is breakneck, but I suspect it was necessary to cover up plot holes and distract viewers into not paying too close attention. The first movie was fast too, but not as frenzied and really allowed you to lose yourself in all the steam punk majesty of the art direction and score, which is evidence here as well. I just wish Ritchie would allow the audience to check out the details that are wasted on fast-cut flicks like this one.<br/><br/>In the first movie, we were treated to some really funny, smart homo-erotic bromance scenes, but in this movie you get a tarted up Holmes in drag encouraging Watson to get on top of him. Oh, how droll. What seemed subversive in the first movie, just seems like shtick in the second.<br/><br/>Then, we have poor Noomi Rapace (the original Lizbeth Salandar) who is completely wasted in the role of a gypsy fortune teller who rarely gets any lines.<br/><br/>Yet despite these shortcomings I still enjoyed the movie as popcorn entertainment, and I'm likely to watch it again if only to catch some of the stuff that flew by so fast the first time."
"Jonathon_Natsis","5","1","2","19 January 2012"," 'Observancy is a dying art.'
","So sayeth the late, great Stanley Kubrick regarding the self-perceived genius of his final film. He was talking about the tiny details inserted into every scene of Eyes Wide Shut, leaving the sharp-eyed viewer with more questions than answers with every viewing. Sherlock Holmes' ability to notice these fine points, and the camera's ability to linger on them just long enough to give you a fighting chance of solving the problem before he does, is one of the few quality aspects of this film. As for the rest of it, A Game of Shadows adheres to the typical conventions of a sequel. That is, bigger, louder and more ambitious, but ends up being nowhere near as fun as its predecessor.<br/><br/>With Dr. Watson (Jude Law) happy to have the events of the past behind him, he makes plans for his long-overdue marriage. That is until news spreads regarding a series of mysterious bombings in and around London. Never one to work alone, Watson is again dragged into the deep end by the crafty Holmes (Robert Downey Jnr.). And so, with the help of Holmes' highly inappropriate brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry) and Simza the gypsy (Noomi Rapace), they are led to Holmes' greatest adversary, the evil but equally cunning Moriarty (Jared Harris).<br/><br/>If that sounds more like a trailer blurb than a synopsis, it is because attempting to explain this plot in detail would only result in digging a deeper hole. One of the strengths of the first instalment (trying to steer away from the word 'original' here) was a plot that was balanced enough to keep the viewer's attention without seeming too simple, and allowing for some enjoyable interplay between the utterly immersive Holmes and Watson. This time around, however, director Guy Ritchie substitutes substance for style, placing great importance on keeping the film moving from place to place to place with very little deduction in between. <br/><br/>These efforts to keep the audience's mind occupied actually end up having negative effects, as the film degrades into more of a visual spectacle, and less of a romping mystery, with every passing scene. In fact, from the absurd set piece involving a firefight on a train halfway through the film, the rest of the story seems to almost give up on anything that could even be considered rational or believable. Suspension of disbelief is a key requirement when watching films like this, sure, but Shadows takes things to new levels of foolishness, wasting the chance to deliver a fresh, clever sequel.<br/><br/>Despite these occasionally over-the-top moments, the action is mostly well directed, albeit with a tendency to overuse slow motion and crash zooms at key moments. Holmes' re-imagining as an expert martial artist is still fun to watch, and his methods of predicting his opponent's entire move set before the fight has even begun are more refined in this film. His prior planning to prevent poor performance meets its match during the climax when we see Moriarty studying Holmes in the same way, resulting in the film's best moment by a long margin.<br/><br/>Speaking of our hero's arch-nemesis, Moriarty's presence is disappointingly underwhelming. The best villains are able to invoke a feeling of dread even when off-screen, but it seems this much-lauded mastermind is content to be the office general; watching the good guys fight off hordes of faceless henchmen while he sits in his swivel chair, stroking his cat and practicing his best 'I've been expecting you.' Again, this is not the actor's fault- the character simply suffers from inadequate screen time to develop a truly menacing persona, while other insignificant side characters clog up the scenery (not including Rapace's Simza, who has the whole hippie-gypsy dread thing going on to great effect).<br/><br/>But, for all its pitfalls, it would be unfair to give this film anything less than a straight average score, particularly in the light of almost all other blockbuster franchises still alive today. Yes, RDJ's characterisation has regressed from 'charmingly pompous' to 'borderline psychopath' in the last two years, but he and Law still try their darndest to make it work.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

","Okay. I went to the movie with some friends on my birthday. And I had a great night. Now to what I thought of it.<br/><br/>As usual I will point out the bad first and then the good stuff.<br/><br/>The Bad.<br/><br/><ul><li>The movie was a bit to long. Two and a half hours are long to sit trough. Not a major complain. But it isn't a short but sweet movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is the moment when Sherlock is 'dead' and they are crying and such. And than of course they find something to bring him back. I'm really tired of the 'Fake Deaths' from main characters. When the director does this he wants to bring more drama in the film or wants something to get a laugh from the audience. This is entirely pointless.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is also another death in the movie from the brother of a gypsy. This death was also pointless. We didn't care for him. He was just a throw away character in the movie. We should care about him cause he's the brother of the gypsy girl. But we never saw the person or herd he was kind or something like that. No intentions to care for his death.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The gypsy girl was only in the movie to bring some girl power in the movie. There's nothing wrong with a women side-character but she had no purpose. She doesn't do something really important and it feels forced.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Good.<br/><br/><ul><li>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are still perfect as Sherlock and Watson. Smart,funny and of course Bad-ass when they need to be. Great Performances.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The parts where Moriarty and Sherlock are talking and arguing are brilliantly clever. Smart comebacks, lot of clever thinking, perfect arguments and when you watch is you're thinking you are getting smarter. These two work so good together. Because they are on the same level. They are both brilliant people. Which works really well in this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The editing and soundtrack is much much better in this movie. Less shaky flashbacks and an awesome soundtrack.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The slow motion parts in this movie are mind blowing. Just seeing every part move in great detail is just awesome. Nothing wrong with it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The comedy is, as in the first movie, clever and funny. These people work really well together. Smart characters making smart jokes.</li></ul><br/><br/>I have to say that this is a good sequel. More improvements than flaws. And with this cast and writing, the movie deserves a 8.7/10.<br/><br/>This was my review. Peace Off."
"deltafire1972","10","1","2","20 January 2012"," Breath-taking, action packed and WOW!!
","If you love action movies with a touch of suspense, this film is the one to see. We saw it twice, and would see it a dozen more times.<br/><br/>This one is far better than the first, and I hope they make a third. The year is just beginning and this film should be one of the top of the year.<br/><br/>The action scenes seem more crisp that the first one and less choppy. We did not see this one in 3D the two times we saw it, but this film will be worth waiting in line for at midnight to buy when it comes out to DVD.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is brilliant with the witty humor. Watson is the brilliant side kick on his witty come backs. The fast paced graphics still could use a little more polish, but if there was a movie since Avatar I can say I was blown away on, it would be this one."

"a_2","Null","1","2","18 January 2012"," Brilliant and Highly Enjoyable!
","Lets start backward and cut to the chase first, this movie is brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable. There are myriad different pieces which have all worked well on this but the biggest by far is the screenplay and direction. And to put some smarts at it, what makes it great is you neither have to remember the first, nor have to watch this as a sequel. You will also not find the need to compare it to others. In fact, you could watch this first and then watch the part that came before, and you would be equally thrilled with both. Lets start separating the gems and get into why this movie is a great watch.<br/><br/>First the screenplay and direction, where Guy Ritchie has done what he does best. The characters are well carved out, there is a plot, there is a case, and there is a solid END. The writers Michele Mulroney, and Kieran Mulroney have packed this with originality and simplicity. It does not take a genius to follow the plot and is not like watching CSI or a murder mystery. This one is more like admiring a great book visually by enjoying the moments of humor, appreciating the twists, and applauding at the end. Bottom line, the story is wise and keeps you entertained. Guy Ritchie has done this enough number of times to establish a knack for it and he does not disappoint. Just a great story is not good enough, and if it was not for the cracking acting by the cast, nothing would live up the screen the way it does on this one.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Jude Law and RDJ is flawless and is brilliant enough to make the real pair look fake. RDJ packs the punch, looks the part, times the moves and lines, and is the best portrayal of Sherlock so far in any movie or TV show. The characters all appear a natural part of the story and appear and disappear just as they would in a real setting. The sets and the setting, including the look and feel of all characters is true to its core and, even Stephen Fry is not bad with his cameo. The elevation in this definitely comes from Jared Harris. JH plays the professor and carries the character beautifully throughout the movie. He almost competes directly with RDJ both in character and screen presence and keeps the balance of having to wait till the end. Jude Law is charming as always, and complements the role in every aspect. Pick any movie within this genre and you will see how good all the characters jive on this one, because just seeing Sherlock would not have cut it.<br/><br/>Then comes the cinematography, the visual effects, the action sequences, and the tiny details of critique that can be used to start ripping it apart. While each person liked, or hated the visual effects, each person is sure to agree on one thing, that this movie is intelligently made and acted, and the intent of telling a good story is clearly visible and felt. We all hate to see sequels just because the first one was a huge hit and the team just wanted to capitalize on it.<br/><br/>Kudos with this one to the team and I cant wait to see another addition to this!"
"xboy614","8","1","2","15 January 2012"," Sherlock Holmes- brought the child out in me
","The new Sherlock Holmes, which had huge boots to fill from the first one had clearly stuck in my mind. Action, comedy, a little mystery, it was just brilliant. It brought back the child in me. It had everything you wanted in a film, romance, great fight scenes, a twisting plot and a shocking end, big guns, witty lines, a great theme tune I couldn't stop humming after wards, this is the type of movies that should get five stars. I liked Stephen Fry in the film, he was just superb as Sherlock's older brother, Mycroft. People may complain that it is really different from the Conan Doyle books and that the BBC series is better, Sherlock Holmes is probably in the top five best Sherlock Holmes movies of all time, maybe even number one."
"rob-lawler","8","1","2","15 January 2012"," A whole new Holmes
","Guy Richie's interpretation of the much loved novel character Sherlock Holmes will be despised by any fans of the books or the original films. Luckily for me I'm not one of them. Yes It's much closer to Hollywood than Baker street and yes It's filled with slapstick humour, but none of this takes away from Robert Downy Juniors quite brilliant take on Sherlock Holmes or for that matter Jude Law's performance. Unfortunately we see a very male orientated performance with amazing unused female talent. Then again Stephen Fry's slightly arrogant, camp upper class performance deserves all the attention it receives. So why a 9 out of ten? Because as you watch it you forget all of the negatives. So what there are slightly too many slow-mo shots, an abundance of slapstick, less emphasis on Sherlocks intellect and more explosions than a bond film. You'll be way too engrossed in the pure brilliance of the film to worry. It's hilarious, witty and filled with more action than you could of ever hoped for. A must see. Just think less of the past and more of the future of Sherlock Holmes and you will love it."
"badajoz-1","5","1","2","13 January 2012"," Jolly Japes
","Yes, it is Panto season, and there is one on the big screen - this follow up to the rather dragged out first outing for Downey jnr and Law with Guy Ritchie helming. Not bad - a good frenetic, joke-laden, buddy buddy, effects heavy romp that is the norm for today's entertainment. Not heavy on intellect or memory, but watching is enjoyable in the darkened movie theatre. The best bits are undoubtedly the interplay between the two male leads - apparently involving some improv on set - and the worst bits (as in the first movie) the overlong, overdone action sequences, particularly the escape through the woods under fire from some nasty German heavy howitzers (unfortunately the explosive shocks barely travel more than ten yards!!!!). Many minor characters simply are pushed aside when they appear, but Jared Harris puts up a rather good 'professor' as opposed to the usual miscast villains in action movies. OK for the occasional blockbuster, but it all will need rebooting soon, if repetition is not to set in."
"Johannes_jacobsson","6","1","2","13 January 2012"," A pile of good-looking mess
","I do not understand how a good director such as Guy Ritchie can make such a mess of a story. They didn't explain much, everything just happened. They came to a place, did something for some reason, it looked smart, then a fight that looked cool, then the went some other place for some reason. Maybe this looked good in Ritchies head but he forgot that it had to make sense for the audience. I mean he did make Lock, stock and two smoking barrels etc. so i expected more creativity. But it's worth watching for those who don't mind so much about the story and just want a good looking movie with cool fights.

"udarmohit","9","1","2","11 January 2012"," fast pace cinema at best!!!
","In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, my mind turns two ways: The first half is guns, gunpowder, and gymnastics. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) contend with the salvation of civilization mostly through athletics, aided by director Guy Ritchie's considerable skill with the camera and graphics.<br/><br/>But in the second half, when the duo moves swiftly but intellectually to confront the arch villain Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), my mind is at equilibrium, renewing my love of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original brainy, eccentric sleuth. The chess game is a marvel of strategy, replete with revenge, intrigue, and just plain ingenuity. Director Guy Ritchie's visuals include delightful Downey disguises and lively speed ramping in a forest bombarded by bullets. Hans Zimmer's music leans heavily on the fiddle to lighten the load of a difficult plot.<br/><br/>Watson's marriage, rather than taking away from the romance, adds unexpected color and creativity. So Ritchie has ramped up the intellectual content and at least balanced it with the athletic, which was a strength of his 2009 version, Sherlock Holmes. With Inspector Lastrade just a memory and Holmes's love, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), appearing briefly, we are left to enjoy not so much the interaction of Holmes and Watson but the explosiveness of Holmes and Moriarty."

Everything you would want really with the emphasis on ENTERTAINING.<br/><br/>I could easily watch this film again and can't wait to add this one to my DVD collection when it becomes available.<br/><br/>If I had any criticism that I had to mention I would say there is probably too much action to the point where the whole Sherlock punch ups become slightly repetitive.

Thanks to the new concept, Sherlock Holmes has become an entertaining mix of wit and action speaking to all audiences. Thank you Mr Downey.

"mikeg994","9","1","2","9 January 2012"," Entertaining if Untraditional take on Sherlock Holmes
","I loved it. This is definitely a guy flick but not completely so. The explosions, the stop action sequences, the special effects, the gadgetry and the alternative reality sequences owe something to the CSI Las Vegas and to that wonderful old TV program ""Wild Wild West"" where the Robert Conrad and his sidekick Artemis Gordon traveled in Victorian elegance in a private train car and dealt with evil genius strangely similar to Dr. Moriarty, if only in an old West context.<br/><br/>While it is not in keeping with the Holmes and Watson created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the wonder of the characters is that they are larger than any one writer's conception. Doyle himself grew tired of Sherlock Holmes and did his best ultimately to kill him off, but such characters have steadfastly refused to die. It is fitting therefore that generations of writers have seen fit to provide their take of the classic Holmes and Watson.<br/><br/>The movie is a joy to watch, the period costumes, the lush photography, the locations, the historical context and the extremely complex tapestry of narrative in all of its confusion of pieces which in the end do well fitting together in the final scenes. The manic genius of the Downey Holmes meshes well with the somewhat more normal Watson, and the touches of humor are just right."

If you are going to see this film, look out at the last part of the film when Watson is writing a book about his and Sherlock's adventures, as he believes Sherlock to be dead, when actually he is sat in a chair just in front of Watson, disguised!

","When I went to see the first Sherlock Holmes, I was expecting a decent movie with a few comedic moments, and that's what I got. While I loved it, there weren't a lot of 'big' moments in the film. I expected the same for the second one. Boy, was I underestimating Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows surpasses the first film by miles. The chemistry between Holmes and Watson was more evident in this movie and a lot of emphasis was put on it in some scenes. The characters were well-developed and I felt connected to all of them. The slow-motion action sequences absolutely blew my mind.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were so in character that I honestly forgot I was watching them act. Their chemistry was flawless and it made the movie so much more enjoyable. I can't even touch on how good Jared Harris did portraying Professor Moriarty. He was excellent. The electricity between Holmes and Moriarty during the chess sequence near the end of the film drew me so into the movie that I don't think I touched a piece of popcorn for a half an hour. <br/><br/>Some people think that the slow-motion sequences were overdone. I personally think they were necessary. Arthur Conan Doyle gave attention to the fact that Holmes can 'see everything around him.' Guy Ritchie and the visual effects crew accomplished this by using multiple camera angles and slowing down the footage to show everything that is happening. It puts you in Sherlock's mind; it lets you understand how he sees things, and that makes you so much more attached to the character.<br/><br/>I can ramble on about this movie to no end. Everything about it was excellent. From the small details to the big picture, everything you love about the old Sherlock Holmes stories comes alive in this film. Every emotion I can think of came out of me while watching this. I laughed, I cried, I almost screamed at the characters, I cringed. This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in a while."
"SpiffDico","Null","1","2","5 January 2012"," This film's no mystery to see.
","When talking about the greatest fictional detective of Britain Sherlock Holmes, and the many movies based on this iconic character, many have seen the most memorable of actors, Basil Rathbone to be the one we think of the most. Lines like 'Elementary, my dear Watson' have been used from generation to generation, letting others know of the legacy of the character Sir Arthur Doyle had given to the world.<br/><br/>Since 2009, director Guy Ritchie had given this generation a NEW Sherlock Holmes, portrayed by former SNL comedian, Robert Downey Jr, who had gained the role of also portraying Iron Man. Downey had given a fantastically stunning performance in both the Iron Man AND Sherlock Holmes films, that it's difficult to explain how more good he's become. The way that he pays good tribute to the character of Holmes and what Rathbone had given, he also manages to create his own Holmes as well. He's smart, witty, and strong willed, especially with his amazing predictions. As for Jude Law, he himself brings new depths into the character of Dr. John Watson, Holmes' sidekick. The chemistry between the two is in such well depth, that it almost makes you think that the two of them are brothers. With that, the original stands as a strong, well determined piece of art that is both fun and intense.<br/><br/>With this new film, it's much of the same. It continues the story of Holmes, with a new case that could possibly be his last, or at least that's how I felt about it. Sherlock and Watson are reprized by the duo of Downey and Law, as they try to figure out what plan is in develop by Professor Moriarty, played by Jared Harris. Harris gives off the attitude of a smart villain, giving everything his best shot, and does a well done job at doing it. Stephen Croft plays Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes, and gives a few good laughs with his cheery performance, and his ways of assisting his brother in the film.<br/><br/>Is the film as good as the original? No, I found some scenes to be a bit slow, boring, and not well examined. But is it good? Yes. Is it worth the ticket price in theaters? Yes. I guarantee that audiences who enjoyed the first film will enjoy this new film, and it deserves a viewing every once and a while. If you got the time, then Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is one of the perfect works of art, and in my opinion, one of the best films of the year."

","It was 3rd January morning 10:15 AM; a 2$ ticket in my hand; seat number F 3; second block, fourth floor, BTM, Bangalore. More or less 32 people are sitting inside, 20 stuffs working outside the hall; two snacks shops; four security officers, including one woman officer; three ticket counters; two elevators and two escalators, one is coming up and one is going to down. This is the way of expression that I have learned from ""Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows"".<br/><br/>The film shows Sherlock Holmes' superhuman intellectual brainstorming, meditation and precautions of every-single steps; before taken by his enemies. I think, Guy Ritchie's version of Holmes is full of errors. The climax is started in the beginning,<br/><br/>Professor Moriarty: Are you sure you want to play this game?<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.<br/><br/>Professor James Moriarty, the role is played by Jared Harris is an unforgettable villainy. Holmes's elder brother, Mycroft Holmes was expected more roles that was missing. The 'slow wits' and puns are the only entertainment, that at least make the audience laugh.<br/><br/>Dr. Watson: Did you just kill my wife?<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: I timed it perfectly!<br/><br/>The movie is primarily based on the short story ""The Final Problem"" by Sir A.C. Doyle and also from many of the other Sherlock Holmes stories: ""The Sign of Four""; ""The Greek Interpretor""; ""Valley of Fear""; ""The Speckled Band""; ""The Dying Detective""; ""Bruce Partington Plans""; ""The Adventure of the Creeping Man"" and ""The Second Stain"" are included in one single motion picture. Isn't it sounds idiotic?<br/><br/>Sherlock defeats Professor Moriarty by pulling him over Reichenbach Falls, with both of them falling to their apparent deaths. Holmes is later shown to have survived. This was meant to be the final Sherlock Holmes story, ""The Final Problem"" by Sir A.C. Doyle.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr.'s 1992 biographical role on Chaplin is noticed in Holmes. It is not exactly that I read and imagine about the literary character of Sherlock Holmes. Calculations, actions and re-actions are overdosed. There are many abstract and unnecessary clips broke the central story, was totally unexpected. Cinematography is like an artistic boon of modern technologies. Here science, arts and literature are brilliantly juxtaposed.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes riding a pony, ""Slow and steady wins the race"" is a good wit and moral. Overall ""Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows"" is entertaining."

","** out of (****)<br/><br/>Back in X-mas '09, Richie unleashed ""Sherlock Holmes"", which rang with critics as well as audiences alike. It was inclusive to a few clever gags, some well choreographed action set pieces, and a slick, neat style. Fast-forward twenty four months later and you have the exact opposite. ""Shadows"" may be eccentric and ambitious in its attempts, but the result is rather unsatisfying. What's even more disappointing to hear is how the film starts off with a bang, but unfortunately lets up before its two hours clocks in. <br/><br/>I won't waste my time and energy deciphering the plot since it's pretty much the same concept except with some twists and turns thrown in along the way, so onto the acting. First of all, the performances are undoubtedly up to par. Without the star power, the films wouldn't carry its weight as great as they have. Downey Jr, Law, Rapace, and McAdams give it their all. In terms of a script? Very jumbled. I will say this though: If you look at the movie in parts, it's a whole other film (an impressive one). But alas, since the film has to run its course, watching it all play out is like watching someone re-arrange the pieces of a Jigsaw puzzle. You know that in pieces its parts are much greater than as a whole. <br/><br/>The major knock against this film is the pacing. The film begins with this ferocious first hour. Action-heavy sequences interspersed with smart dialogue and a very well-guided direction. But once the second hour hits, the script/writing/direction is too misguided. If you're coming here for one thing- and one thing only: The cinematography is definitely up there. Every scene soars with its visuals. Same with its action.<br/><br/>If you want a full-throttle of a ride, ambitious and daring in its actions, see the first half and then leave. The second is not worth bothering for. Richie, for number tres, take a bit more time on how you map out your film direction. It's unfortunate to see such a promising start with such a wimp of an ending. ""A Game of Shadows"" quickly fades to ""A Game of Insipid""."

","I watched this movie together with my husband in cinema. I liked this Sherlock Holmes even better than the first one! There is a great atmosphere, created by beautiful decors and great music. Some people might not like the slow-motion action-scenes, but see them as a parody on movies like James Bond an you will cherish them like I did (think on the effect Inglorious Basterds had on you)! Although the title makes you expect a dark movie, this is a cheerful movie with a lot of humour, and not very much of a shadow. Some critics criticise the movie for it's thin plot line. I don't agree. There is really a lot happening! Maybe some things aren't very likely to happen in the real world, but in my opinion this is one of the charmes of Sherlock Holmes. The historical settings are by the way very plausible. Characters are quite multi- dimensional...Holmes is not only a genius, but he is also a little bit pschycho (in a good way) en turns out to be quite lonely sometimes. Here you see one of the strenghts from the first movie again. Although my husband and I mostly watch art-house-movies, we enjoyed watching this movie, because this film was so well-made and so very entertaining!"

","A certain Mr. Guy Ritchie has a flair and repute for producing pure gems dipped in English culture. This time he has exceeded his previous attempts by keeping the amount of the 'dip' to the just 'perfect level' with getting all the elements required to make an awesome and may be the perfect movie. Take a bow Mr. Ritchie!!! Excellent acting, perfect suspense(an integral part of Sherlock Holmes, traditional English dialogues filled with chivalry and sarcasm that make them so enjoyable, awesome action and maybe the best climax sequence for any movie of the 21st century till date make a game of shadows the perfect action comedy. the exotic sets and props bring the Victorian Era alive with all of its pomp and flair. Robert Downey Jr. continues from where he left and has excelled the previous one. Jude Law is always dependable and shares more screen space which was needed for a friend rather than a sidekick. The support cast,especially Paul Anderson as Sebastian Moran,is up to the job. But it is Jared Harris as Prof. James Moriarty who brings in the ruthlessness as the antagonist and his encounters with Sherlock,especially the climax,which lights up the movie. Even if you see it a number of times the entertainment value won't decrease a bit. Go grab a ticket and watch the movie ASAP, its just too good to miss."
"jpc8024","8","1","2","2 January 2012"," my review of sherlock holmes 2 a game of shadows
","Sherlock Holmes 2 A Game of Shadows The sequel to Sherlock Holmes has more pizazz and atrocious slow motion camera shots then any film this year. The story is a coherent one but the action sequences slow it down. Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriaty, a genius mathematician who wrote the book The Astronomicals of an Asteroid are common enemies. Professor Moriaty distract Sherlock Holmes evidential and clueless mind while building ant-Christ missiles and bombs in a abandoned stockyard. While Holmes is busy with talking to a fortune teller/gyspy played by Noami Roapooce, Dr. Watson is getting married and enjoying his honeymoon with his beloved wife. But soon Sherlock Holmes invades Dr. Watson's life by meeting with him intensively on the train and throwing Watson's wife off a bridge to catch up with his brother Mycroft Holmes who is setting up a summit auction party in Switzerland. But for Watson's wife, he is embarrassed to be around Mycroft Holmes because he is in the nude. Robert Downey Jr.'s accent is great. Even Jude Law portraying Dr. John Watson is fun. I have no problem with the art direction. It is gorgeous in 1891. You have London, Paris, Switzerland, Berlin and Scotland. It sets the mood for a Sherlock Holmes story. The problem is the action sequences. For a young audience Sherlock Holmes goes from a detective having fun with clues and spy games in the first half of the movie to a elite stone cold action hero in the end. The slow-mo scenes are in every corner. It reminded me of the Matrix Reloaded or a PC computer game. The editing is way off in the sequel and the original score is the same from the first movie 2 years ago. No new piece of music. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows has it's flaws but it is still a quirky film with humorous and naughty moments to pleasurable movie entertainment. If you want a film that really is like the Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories go back and re watch the films from the mid-40's or early seventies PBS Mysteries that reinvented the Holmes character as he is in the book, a clueless detective looking for mystery. Robert Downey Jr. is the right choice for portraying Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law is reliable as the infamous Dr. John Watson. But except this one to be more marveled than the classic mysteries of the past."

I'm sure you already know the plot so I'm not going to summarize it but this movie has a great plot and a twist at the end. The last few seconds of the movie really made me excited. I can really see how this movie has a potential for another movie. At some points this movie can be kind of hard to understand but you can put the pieces together and understand the plot. I also really like Professor Moriarty's character a lot. You can tell that Watson and Holmes are really good friends by their humor and the hard times they give each other. I would suggest this movie to someone else."

Will Holmes and Watson be able too outwit Moriarty before it's too late? <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie does it again, with it's adventure, humor, and intriguingness. It became a fun ride for everybody. Robert Downey Jr is good as Holmes, I think he had him down little better this time then he did in the first, he seems more relaxed. Jude Law is also good as Watson, he and Downey play off each other perfectly."
"katie-sirles","10","1","2","30 December 2011"," Sherlock Holmes: dangerous at both ends and crafty in the middle
","I've never read the books and I only just saw the first Sherlock Holmes movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law about a week ago. Guess what you don't have to be a total nerd to like this movie! I'm not saying that I'm not a total nerd. I know like three words in Elvish and I enjoy reading books about sharks, but when it comes to knowing everything about Sherlock Holmes, it's not at all necessary for enjoying this Guy Ritchie joint. Not everyone who watches this movie has read all of the books six times each and knows all of the other movies and so on and so forth. Some of us just have giant, raging crushes on Robert Downey Jr... I mean cinema.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is really a perfect gent for a role like this one. He's funny, charming, and quit-witted to boot. He also has the right amount of crazy to pull off Sherlock Holmes. Because one would have to be at least a little crazy to do the things that Sherlock does.<br/><br/>Here's a synopsis for you: Sherlock intercepts his love Irene (Rachel McAdams) when he finds that she is being followed, only she isn't being followed. She is doing a job for Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris – the only man alive who is directly related to frogs). When she screws it up he releases her from his services. How unfortunate for her. Holmes gets Watson wasted the night before his wedding. That night he meets Sim (Noomi Rapace) the gypsy fortune-teller. Gypsy fortune-teller has something to do with the unfortunate misfortune of Irene. His observation skills do not fail him and he is on yet another mission. After a meeting with Moriarty, Holmes learns of his beloved's fate and finds that tomfoolery is afoot. Instead of letting Watson enjoy his new bride, he must protect Mr. & Mrs. Watson from Moriarty's cronies. This includes throwing Mrs. Watson from the train. Dressed to the nines in blue eyeshadow and red lipstick, Holmes thwarts Moriarty's plan.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is much of the same. A back and forth between two masterminds and their attempts to stop each other. But the real glory of this movie is the hilarity. Knowing when to be funny and when to get down to business is a vital skill in making a movie like this one. Word to the wise: get all of your bathroom/food/drink needs out of the way before the movie and don't get up. You won't want to miss a minute of this movie. I – like a fool – got up to fetch a refill for a thirsty pest with whom I saw the movie. I came back and boy was I ever sorry that I left at all.<br/><br/>I suppose the bottom line is that RDJ is a phenomenal actor, Guy Ritchie has a winning style of making movies, and Jude Law is the perfect match for Holmes's crazy antics. Without ruining anything for you, be prepared for a shocker in the last five minutes. I was the idiot in the audience who gasped loudly in an otherwise silent theater. I'm a sucker. All I'm saying is that when I grow up I want to be like Sherlock Holmes."
"frogfrognewt","9","1","2","30 December 2011"," Super-stylish, steampunky fun for everyone!
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is as good, if not better than its predecessor ""Sherlock Holmes"". Robert Downey Jnr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Homes and Watson respectively, giving expected, predictable, but absolutely fantastic performances. Downey Jnr's histrionic performance and Law's straight faced ex-military doctor has such brilliant chemistry between them, clearly the actors themselves like each other(although, they seem more like a married couple than friends). <br/><br/>The camera work is clever, and the editing is fast-paced and very Hollywood. In a good way. The smoky, dusty, steamy, misty cityscape of victorian London is iconic, British, and provides a stable substrate for the real action to take place.<br/><br/>Dialogue is simple, effective and funny, especially Holmes, often switching between English and French, with wisps of German thrown in. But don't worry, there are no subtitles and the narrative is easily followable even if the words are gibberish. <br/><br/>Noomi Rapace (Girl with a Dragon tattoo Original) is the cunning (and remarkably sexy) gypsy who helps Holmes and Watson to deduce the tricks and traps laid by the fabulous Moriarty. <br/><br/>Moriarty amazingly portrayed by Jared Harris, and is possibly the best character in the whole film. Cool, calm, but very very intimidating, Harris uses his silence to scare the audience and is the binary opposite to Holmes, but yet very similar in some ways. <br/><br/>I won't say much, but the final scene is sensationally composed by the former ""cult"" director Guy Ritchie. <br/><br/>You don't need to see the original film to be able to follow A Game of Shadows' narrative. In fact, there aren't really any references to the first film at all. <br/><br/>If you like a stunning visual style, with British brains and American brauns then Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is definitely suitable for you! <br/><br/>9/10"

","This is my first movie review. I liked this movie very much. Its much better than MI4:Ghost protocol. Even the action sequences-specially near the arms-ammunition factory- are excellent. Kudos to the director. <br/><br/>The plot and the story may be normal, but the game played and the twists take us into the movie. Its the best suspense-thriller movie i faced in recent times. <br/><br/>Robert Downy Jr was excellent at his acting skills and the guy portraying Dr.Watson was also good but could have been better. Few action sequences were far from normality, but few are absolutely good. I don't know why people rate it low, but its good. I wanna watch it again (if possible). Its worth my money.<br/><br/>I recommend it for the people who read Sherlock Holmes stories and like the character and like the character as much as I. The story seems to have been taken from the short story 'His last bow' of the Canon Doyle stories. I don't remember the exact short story. Its good and reached my expectations."

","Dr. Watson's Stag night, Wedding and Honeymoon go awry as he and Sherlock Holmes join forces with a gypsy to outwit and bring down adversary Professor Moriarty.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie explores the time period further and creates a detailed and richer world. Cobbled and dirt streets, sweeping landscapes and skylines all add to the atmosphere of old London and Paris. The effects and costumes are amazing, the sets fantastic - secret passageways, opera houses and trains. The music with the familiar theme of the first fittingly returns. <br/><br/>Many of the pacing issues of the first film have been corrected, but arguably there is less subtle humour and more all out gags. That said, the essence of Sherlock remains intact. The story is less convoluted than it's predecessor and despite some stifled lines the two leads are Law and Jr. are on fine form oozing charisma. With their unmatched rapport they can do no wrong as they are so well cast and have so much chemistry between them. <br/><br/>Although there is a little too much crash and bang in Ritchie's set pieces,there's enough wordplay courteous of writers Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney to keep it becoming just another action. <br/><br/>Both Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes and Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty are both perfectly cast giving fitting and wonderful performances. Familiar faces of the first outing make appearances and it feels like a true an equal sequel. <br/><br/>Overall it's more of the same and Guy Ritchie delivers a great continuation of the adventures of Holmes and Watson."

","I had really low expectations on this one. Sequels are rarely as good as their predecessor, and I had read a few negative early reviews. Haha. I'm glad I went and saw it for myself. Honestly, I loved this movie.<br/><br/>It's a pretty fast-paced film; a nonstop thrill ride filled with mystery and intrigue. Downey and Law are great together, as always. Their 'chemistry' is spot on, and they really feel like friends who have experienced much together. Noomi Rapace is a great addition to the cast as well, and Jared Harris plays an excellent villain in Moriarty.<br/><br/>It's a really fun film as well; don't even get me started on the action sequences. They are thrilling and extremely well shot; the cinematography is beautiful. The forest sequence (if you see the film, you'll not what I mean) is one of the most awesome action bits I've seen in a long while. It's crazy.<br/><br/>A really good sequel, that really goes above & beyond the first. The ending is killer, too. Perhaps the best bits of the film are the one on one scenes with Holmes and Moriarty. It's poetic."
"hsmith-252-80375","9","1","2","29 December 2011"," Witty, Endearing, Insightful
","A Game of Shadows deserves props for its witty banter: RDJ and Jude Law continue to have fabulous on-screen chemistry. It also earns a nod for its deft handling of the women in the movie. Irene Adler is given a chance to demonstrate her cleverness; Mary provides material assistance in a believable way and is generally much more likable in this film; and Madam Simza Heron, the gypsy, is savvy and human, able to hold her own without needing a love interest angle to justify her presence.<br/><br/>Also, the casting of Moriarty was spot-on, perfect in every way. He's believable as an academic, and as a ruthless, cold-blooded killer. He's an excellent match for RDJ's Holmes. And the scene at Reichenbach Falls is performed admirably, with a deft and subtle touch, particularly by Holmes and Watson, but Moriarty is excellent too. And I was impressed that Moriarty and Holmes managed to trade some very insightful remarks about human nature, setting this film a cut above action flicks that have very little to recommend them beyond their special effects budgets.<br/><br/>The humor was even generally clever and fun, particularly some of Holmes's disguises and one rather ingenious way of jamming a machine gun. And, of course, no review would be complete without a nod to Mrs. Hudson, or ""Nanny,"" as RDJ's Holmes so quaintly puts it. A long-suffering housekeeper, indeed. :) If you've not yet seen it, get thee to a theater! A Game of Shadows is well worth the hassle of finding a babysitter."

"achyutaghosh","8","1","2","29 December 2011"," Action packed, Intelligent and Entertaining
","Professor Moriaty: Are you sure you want to play this game? Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.<br/><br/>In addition to him being the template for countless detective fiction writers, Sherlock Holmes evokes sweet childhood memories, stirring the colonial spirit in us- of restrained Victorian surroundings, intellectual jaunts by an eccentric yet bohemian detective aided by his faithful friend and chronographer. When in 2009, Guy Ritchie turned the very concept of Sherlock as we knew and as written by Conan Doyle on its head to come up with his version of a grubby, brawling Sherlock in an action packed, edgy thriller, a lot of the purists turned their eyebrows, and rightly so, because we all missed the cerebral Holmes.<br/><br/>Circa 2011- Sherlock Holmes- Game of Shadows, even though picking off right from where it left in the previous movie, makes a brave attempt to bring back to the new fold, the faithful by creating a feature that has something to appeal to both- the action seekers, and the intellectually oriented. Sherlock is on the track of Professor Moriarty, the one who he believes is responsible for creating a chaos in Europe, and who, he later learns, wants to unleash a world war from which only he can benefit. The first half of the movie is a modern day action movie played in period costumes. The film opens with Watson getting all set to marry, despite Holmes' best assurances that he doesn't need anyone in his life other than Holmes himself. The movie hurtles through at bullet train speed, with some old characters being unceremoniously disposed off, and a slew of criminal activities portrayed across Europe which Holmes, though being at the right place at the right time, yet, is unable to prevent the machinations of an evil genius.<br/><br/>The second half is where things slow down, and yet become more interesting, involving Holmes powers of deduction, memory, and intelligence- things that for a change would not make Doyle turn in his grave. Tension rises to a crescendo in a high stakes chess game between our hero and villain with a world changing assassination attempt going on in the background, and it is beautifully visualized that there is only one end to it. Its a battle in itself, this game, and kudos to Guy Ritchie for making the chess game and the associated mind games the focus, in spite of the wide-ranging ramifications of the assassination.<br/><br/>Speaking of villains, Jared Harris as Moriarty is stupendous. Here is someone who is carries his cover as an Oxford professor sumptuously, yet can look fearsome even while grinning, in addition to be smart enough to match wits with Holmes, and in most cases outwit him. There is repressed hatred in the friendly badinage between Moriarty and Holmes. Which brings us to our heroes- clearly this is as much as Downey's movie as Law's for Watson's role has been considerably enhanced in this one- he is a hero himself, the time spend with Holmes has been put to good use by him. <br/><br/>And it continues to be a dream comeback for Downey- he completely rules in the movie, only he can be so unfazed in the face of danger, and yet a buffoon to the core- his impersonation of a wall and chair is fabulous, as his extended turn in drag. The only time he misses his target is with his fake British accent. Downey and Law's chemistry was one of the few positives in the first movie, and in this one its gone up by several notches. Their banter is witty, smile inducing, and very very British- setting it apart from the usual Hollywood fare. Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes probably gets the best lines, and has loads of fun as someone who is as good as Holmes, and yet every bit as quirky.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie brings his familiar brand of manic energy and tongue in cheek humor into the movie. With an all European setting, the cinematography is awesome. The visual effects are very good, without being overbearing, and the musical score by Hans Zimmerman is as usual, a class apart. However, the extended use of slow motion deduction and action sequences do drag things after a while, though its the end forest bombarding sequence that has the most extraordinarily effective exposition of this technique. <br/><br/>To sum up, this is a modern day action thriller set in 1891- as a result it has plenty in it to make the new fans happy, and enough wit, intellect and charm to retain the loyalists. Hence not only for fans who liked the first, but also for those who have a thing for Doyle. Powerpacked performances from the all star cast and high levels of technical competence makes this a solid, all round entertainer. A new years gift it is then- 10/10 for Robert Downey fans, 8/10 for others ;)"

Sequels have been popping up more and more recently, they are a sure seller, but this one definitely lived it to it's first instalment.<br/><br/>Guy Richie's signature blue tint is back in force but didn't manage to depress me, the comedy between Robert Downey Jnr. and Jude Law certainly lightens the mood. The angles used for the chase turn a now normal and possibly mundane scene into something new and raw, we move with the punches as the camera swings around. Things that are so often taken for granted in films such as establishing shots, are used perfectly so the only questions the audience is asking are the ones the story has set up.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes is bloody marvellous, I'm not afraid to say that he is quite simply perfect and the final fight scene is epic."

At any rate, the additions were subtle from the first one, but it definitely laid the ground-work for future SHs movies to be made, which I for one am a fan for. I know this won't win any awards, and I'm sure it won't be as highly praised as this year's winner of the terribad artsy film, The Tree of Strife, but it'll win all kinda awards in my book. <br/><br/>1) Film with the most BROmance - Winner 2) Film with the coolest running away from danger shot in slow-mo - Winner 3) Film with the best dialogue between good guy and bad dude - Winner <br/><br/>All in all, it's worth seeing but maybe not as good as MI:4."

The frame of the movie extended due to the genius professor. However, the storyline became so straight which decrease a taste of complication.

Despite some disadvantages within the movie, it's still worth watching.<br/><br/>If you're book fan of Sherlock Holms, you would find out disappointed because the quiz in the movie is not so mystic. However, if you take it as an action movie, it's still doing well in many aspects."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","1","2","27 December 2011"," ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a much better film than the second half of its title would lead us to believe
","Let's admit it. Whatever our feelings are about self-taught film director Guy Ritchie (""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Swept Away""), he certainly has taken Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's world-famous character of Sherlock Holmes and transitioned him to the screen in a way that stands out, that is unlike what we expected. For the better or the worst (and that depends on your own perspective), he has presented the character in a way that is unique, almost self-described. In spite of my few reservations about his style, Mr. Ritchie made 2009's ""Sherlock Holmes"" into a devilishly entertaining re-envision and his new film, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is just as good. Even if it does need a better title.<br/><br/>In this second installment, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) go up against their most famous and formidable enemy, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). As we learned at the end of the first film, Moriarty is at least equal to, if not more clever than Holmes himself and the quest to bring down Moriarty's wildly complicated scheme is more of a competition of wits jumping hurdles.<br/><br/>Mr. Ritchie and his screenwriters (Michele Mulroney & Kieran Mulroney) are clearly more interested in individual moments than they are in the big picture. For just like in the first film ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is far more interesting and much more exciting when it concentrates on scenes rather than a whole entire. Professor Moriarty's plan, which I will not give away as a means of saving review space as opposed to giving away plot information, is so hyperbolic and overly complicated that to try and work it into a cohesive, ominous, and prone-to-logic storyline would be suicidal to the patience of the audience, and to the movie. Watching it, I found myself not really giving a hoot about following the clues or articulating the schemes of the characters, but locked upon the individual moments. It's watching Holmes and Dr. Waton decipher and devise their next move, often with bursts of kinetic action, that really ring the bell.<br/><br/>It's like a big chess game, where you don't really care about the players' strategies as opposed to just waiting to see how many pieces each guy can knock off the board.<br/><br/>Casting proves a benefit the second time around. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, two of our best actors, are just as splendid as they were in the first picture, and do a fabulous job with the witty banter they are supplied with by the screenplay. Although I wished there was more menace in the character for him to portray, as Professor Moriarty, Jared Norris is an inspired choice. Sadly, Rachel McAdams is hardly in the picture at all this time. Her replacement character is well-played by Noomi Rapace. Unfortunately, her performance is lot more interesting than her character.<br/><br/>I do still have reservations about Guy Ritchie's directing. His toggling from slow-motion to kinetic speed, a gimmick I've seldom appreciated by any director, still irks me some, and at times he seems to forget that he's making a movie set in the 18th century. But when it comes to action, he's a near-virtuoso. There are more action sequences here than in the first, so this plays to his advantage.<br/><br/>With great performances and packing a walloping amount of effective humor, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a much better film than the second half of its title would lead us to believe. And as 2011 comes to a close, it's one of the better films to cap off a twelve-month span which frankly has not been all that good for the cinema."

I new he wasn't going to die on the train since it was only halfway through the film, and I new he didn't die in the end, Only thing I got wrong was I thought he was going to pop up at the funeral :P If you are looking for a film which is an easy watch, and you'd rather spectacle like Avatar, than watch this.

"CrazyEX","6","1","2","26 December 2011"," Not entirely sure...
","Sherlock Holmes the game of shadows was a bit of a disappointment for me. Why? Well, the movie had a few errors, that I think failed to deliver the thrill and mysterious mood of the first movie.<br/><br/>The first movie had a modernized/different but effective approach to the super sleuth; at first the audience thinks that he is actually investigating a paranormal incident, but it all appears to be a hoax to re-capture the US. This added a great amount of mystery to the movie, we actually wondered what it would turn out to be. In the end, Holmes performs a good little monologue that sums it all up, and that was a great ending to a fair movie.<br/><br/>In this one however, the movie was lacking in some certain aspects. First of all, Watson was less of a character that we could relate to (although I relate more to Sherlock). He just stood there and complained a lot. (Just like Obi Wan did in the Phantom M-) why am I talking about Star Wars?<br/><br/>Anyway, back to Holmes. (Oh good) So, the character of Moriart-I'm sorry, Professor Moriarty was set up to be a very mysterious and dark character in the first film. I think he was revealed and humanized way to early in this movie. Although the performance by the actor was perfect, the character itself lacked the usual insanity/compulsion the original Moriarty character displayed. (By the way, did you notice that his voice was ENTIRELY different?)<br/><br/>Now, the mysteries and the way they were solved. In the first film, we see Holmes progressively putting the pieces together to reach a final and absolute conclusion. In this movie however, he solves them with such speed and efficiency, the audience gets no time to actually think & wonder, which is what I did a lot in the first film.<br/><br/>To further support this, I didn't even notice that two of the bad guys were meant to look like twins until Holmes pointed it out, which is really not a positive trait if you're filming a crime/mystery film.<br/><br/>See, there are two fatal mistakes that adventure movies can display.<br/><br/>1 - Making the main enemy forces completely ineffective (Battle Droids in the Star Wars prequels)<br/><br/>2 - Making the characters too efficient and hasty<br/><br/>This movie displayed no 2. The main point in this film was the adventure and the characters, which is a thing for adventure movies. Crime/Mystery films must be based on a very complicated plot and surprising twists, which I think this movie lacked.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me, I didn't hate this movie. I think it was a pretty decent adventure film. But if you're actually looking for a crime-based, investigative Sherlock Holmes, you're out of luck.<br/><br/>By the way, the ending was excellent. Really."

","Sherlock Holmes lived up to my expectations, clever, funny and action-packed to the rafters.

It was one of few films that i felt confident it wouldn't fall into that dreaded sequel ""curse"", and when i saw it on Wednesday, it didn't disappoint one little bit! I was hooked from the start and i was that way until the end where Holmes (Robert Downey JR) printed a '?' on Dr Watsons work. This surely means an arrival of a third film?

","What these Hollywood critics don't understand is that Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is an ADAPTATION. The films aren't supposed to be verbatim of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels. Besides, if the movies were made to resemble the books, 85% of the population wouldn't be able to enjoy, let alone understand, them due to the vocabulary/dialogue. Imagine Shakespeare brought to the silver screen, along with all of the old English dialogue. Everyone praises ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"", but they aren't anywhere close to their book counterparts either. Both series are entertaining and engaging, as is Sherlock Holmes. You will laugh multiple times. You will find compelling characters. The story is full of twists and turns. The action is exciting and well-thought-out. The cinematography is excellent. Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic and lovable as Sherlock. This film is well worth the watch, so be your own judge and see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed."

","Saw this in the theater on a friends treat, and wasn't disappointed, but at the same time wasn't dazzled either. The movie is in motion much of the runtime, and I actually fell asleep for part of it due to lack of sleep before - not really due to the movie itself perhaps. It has a lot going on and is frenetic; yes there's a lot to look at, but many scenes don't feel substantial or of merit - too much filler. Having a lot of motion and action doesn't necessarily make a movie better. Anyway, Comparing it to it's original, I don't think it's as good. I liked the action sequences and McAdams in the original better as well as the original's story. The dialog in Shadows, garners some snickers, but the movie really follows it's older predecessor's blue-print - music is a re- tread and again interesting. 6/10 - around average"

To summarise, this movie was, not only better than the original, but excelled most films by all standards, making it the, or at least on of the, best films of the year so far. Downey Jr and Law have given a spark of life into characters that haven't been portrayed in literature or media as greatly as this since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories.

You can only do outrageous if it works and that's exactly what Downey Jr. and Law pulled off. I hope that this is just the beginning of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson with these two guys. It was a great bromance in its most asexual sense--after all part of the story line was Dr. Watson getting married. Perhaps unintended but it showed a powerful relationship they had together as much as Dr. Watson had his frustrating moments not completely understanding the motives of his partner but ultimately trusting his incredible acumen in dire situations. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed that there was more story line plot than just one action scene after another.

"tieman64","Null","1","3","11 January 2013"," Indubitably, my dear Watson
","Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce played Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson throughout a 14 film series which started in 1939 and ended in 1946. Younger audiences are largely unfamiliar with these films, but some are very good and worth seeking out. For many, Basil and Nigel are the ""definitive"" Holmes and Watson, some of their films even on par with Bogart's ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"".<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" series, of course, is a different beast altogether. Big budget action comedies, Ritchie's franchise depends heavily on the sheer exuberance of actor Robert Downey Jr, who plays the film's titular hero. Manic and overflowing with energy, Downey plays Holmes like a cross between two of his previous roles, the armoured superhero of ""Iron Man"" and the motor-mouthed detective of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". Resolutely postmodern, his Holmes is a jester, a trickster, pure Id unleashed. A giant bag of unrestrained ego, Downey's always right, seems to know the future and is always in total control, even when (or especially when) absolutely wrong.<br/><br/>The sequel to Ritchie's first Holmes film, ""A Game of Shadows"" possesses all the positives and negatives of its predecessor. It sports some nice Victorian-era scenery, is pleasantly under-lit for a blockbuster (lots of muted, murky lighting to simulate the grungy tone of late-1800s Britain) and Downey's schizophrenic performance mirrors, sadly, our own postmodern, drug-addled brains. Watching him is like checking your email and flicking through a digital TV-guide, all at once.<br/><br/>Like Ritchie's first film, ""Shadows'"" plot is mostly junk. Ritchie's script is lazy and cheats often, Holmes magically solving problems, deus ex machinas whimsically conjured up and our heroes figuring out ridiculously complex problems simply because their screenwriters will closure into fruition. In Ritchie's defence, this is exactly how most Holmes tales functioned. And while your typical detective story ends with a coda in which the hero ""explains"" and ""ties together"" the story the audience has just watched/read, Ritchie's ""Holmes"" is packed with miniature mysteries within the main mystery which are ""solved"" using similar flashback/flash-forward devices. We're thus offered a ""heightened"" form of your typical detective walk-through.<br/><br/>The film's villain is Professor Moriarty, a character who, like Holmes, possesses a near supernatural intellect. Some context: Charles Darwin published the ""The Origin of Species"" in 1859 and Arthur Conan Doyle his first Sherlock Holmes story in 1887. It is commonly thought that Doyle's hero owed much to the development of the nineteenth century scientific method, with its emphasis on observation, logic, deduction and a dash of imagination and daring, but Holmes, with his unbelievable gifts for problem solving and frequent impossible leaps of logic, was originally meant as a joke, a mockery of the flurry of scientific discoveries that the era saw being made. Doyle was himself fond of mysticism, spiritualism, magic and often wrote about the Dark Arts. He cooked up Holmes as an attempt to ridicule that which he believed was slowly killing off various branches of enchantment, religion and spirituality. Of course this backfired completely. People are fond of order, control and the commanding aura of Holmes, and quickly took the detective to heart. From then on, Doyle found himself unable to abandon the character.<br/><br/>What's interesting about ""Shadows"" is that Moriarty is as much an uber intellect as Holmes (Holmes specialises in inductive, not deductive reasoning). Indeed, the guy's brain is so big, he's single handedly manipulating whole countries, controlling continents and orchestrating World War 1! Standout scenes include Holmes and Moriarty locking horns over chessboards, both masterminds attempting to anticipate and counter the anticipations and counters of their foes. These scenes of intellectual sparring work well. What works less well are the film's countless big, action set pieces, which seem tacked on to satisfy blockbuster junkies. In this regard, Ritchie's Holmes is very much a 21st century hero, a guy who must be all things to everyone, ticking all boxes, catering for all demographics and all audience needs. He's comedian, brain and muscle man, all at once. Part sitcom, part vaudeville, part mystery, part action movie, it's the kind of film that's too dumb to take seriously, but, paradoxically, whenever it takes itself seriously you want it to shut up and get back to comical buffoonery.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Slight, but faster and funnier than its predecessor. Better Holmes flicks: ""Zero Effect"", ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" (1939), ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1939), ""They Might Be Giants"" (1971). Worth one viewing."

I must say right up front, I do not like the idea of Holmes and Watson as superheroes who can defy gravity and rational behavior with equal dexterity. I liked the more pedestrian movies of long ago with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in which the two acted normally and solved mysteries.<br/><br/>But there is another component missing from those films, and that is a coherent script. This is not the first modern movie I have seen which lacks continuity and order; it is as though movies nowadays have a schizophrenic quality wherein the plot diverts from reality and descends into periodic madness. Are Hollywood screenwriters now all on drugs, or just some?<br/><br/>Well, enough. I have made my point and I am obviously outnumbered judging by the user ratings. I do think Robert Downey is one of the better actors around nowadays, and Jude Law made a better effort this time. I just long for some indication of the superior workmanship that Hollywood was known for and which began to recede in the mid 70's, approximately after ""The Sting"", which may be the last great American movie."

","You probably know already that this is modeled after The Final Problem. Doyle's design with that was a heroic end to Holmes so he could go back to more literary aspirations. Of course the public wouldn't have any of it, so the series went on. But here's the thing. Doyle came up with a convincing account of Holmes escape; he never left the cliff. The film's solution in keeping with everything else is daft movie logic. Everything else from Doyle's story has been amped to blockbuster scale, Moriarty is in control of entire nations, Holmes has to save Europe from war on a cataclysmic scope.<br/><br/>Logic is not strictly the point of course, something else is, which brings us to the titular game. This is the one ambitious bit.<br/><br/>Now Sherlock Holmes is no ordinary detective, by this point he's vested in the public mind with practically superhero powers. What Doyle had in mind however was simply expert boxer and a master in logic, meaning the ability to see structures of causation instead of trifle detail. The whole point extending to the writing endeavor itself was structured chaos, a chain of events that appears chaotic to the remote viewer but in fact had been plotted that way by a writer in full control. The plot only made sense when he told it in the end, for example the miraculous escape at Reichenbach, not so miraculous upon hearing about it (in the original).<br/><br/>In the film this is expertly rendered as Holmes being able to know the plot in advance, then reality resumes as envisioned. But this is Moriarty's plot on a larger level, where the same rules of structured chaos apply - people on the streets experience acts of random anarchy but we know it is all being scripted and controlled by Moriarty. So the arch is that Holmes will have to rise to the level where authorship of the world is decided and there best the existing writer in storytelling wit.<br/><br/>(If you want more Doyle reference about this, an early description of Holmes in Scarlet is that he knows nothing about philosophy or politics but an immense deal about crime fiction. This is how Holmes solves cases, the same way writers plot them. This conceit is key in detective fiction, a writer's fiction. Another famous example? Dashiel Hammett, Pinkerton agent turned detective writer.)<br/><br/>This means that Holmes can no longer be in the same room as the plot and really has to trust that he has written characters astute enough to carry out deductions in his place. Watson has learned enough from Holmes to see this part through. Clever.<br/><br/>All the threads point towards film noir, including Moriarty as a Dr. Mabuse type controlling from out of sight."

Making the Holmes movies is not easy. There is not only a rich written history but also quite a few movies. I have to admit that I wasn't thinking of either. Ritchie managed to create a world (especially with the first entry into his Holmes saga), that can be seen as standalone.<br/><br/>So if you liked the first one, you will like this one too. Even if you think you might be fed up by some of the neat tricks he's using or even if you expected Rachel McAdams to be back ""big"" in this movie too."

","A sequel should give viewers more of what they enjoyed from the first, less of what they didn't and add a few twists and turns to change things up a bit to keep you on edge.<br/><br/>The style is the same as the first (same director after all), the witty repartee between Holmes and his sidekick Watson remains sharp as ever. But it's the introduction of Moriarty gives the film real life. He's the opponent that Holmes needs to truly shine, a genius on the side of evil versus a genius (albeit eccentrically so) on the good.<br/><br/>The storyline has plot holes that I won't go into to too much here. But the weakest points of the film have to do with the actual mystery itself and connecting the dots between the gypsy brother and Moriarty. Noomi Rapace got a lot of screen time but didn't have much to do or say. She seemed to be getting in the way of the budding bro-mance between Holmes & Watson much like Mary Watson's character. In some ways, the role of the gypsy fortune teller really didn't need to be so prominent at all.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is the fast paced action, the interplay between the characters, and the charisma shown by Law, Downey Jr and Jared Harris. It's a light-hearted, yet intriguing and suspenseful movie, so entertaining that it made me forgive its obvious flaws.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This film was amazing, still keeping the traditional sherlock Holmes characters and personalities while making an exciting thrill ride! Highly recommended!

Downey JR and Jude Law are great actors and really portray the parts really well. One of my favorite films ever! Better than the first! Glad it wasn't in 3D as that would have ruined the experience, the whole feel of the film is of excitement and light hearted humor while keeping the hard set story line based on the original Conan Doyle books!"
"unimonster64","6","1","3","14 January 2012"," An Entertaining Movie, but it's Not Sherlock Holmes
","While Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) is an enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining film, the characters of Holmes, Watson, Mycroft, et al. are so completely bastardized as to be unrecognizable to those of us who are devoted to the adventures of the world's greatest consulting detective. As was the case with the first Guy Ritchie Holmes film, Robert Downey, Jr. is the most un-Sherlock-like Sherlock Holmes since Peter Cook essayed the role in 1978's The Hound of the Baskervilles. Jude Law is slightly better as John Watson, M.D., though the difference is negligible. The most surprising performance of the movie is Stephen Fry as Sherlock's elder brother Mycroft. Easily the most unusual portrayal of Mycroft I've ever seen, the sight of Fry's Mycroft wandering the house naked must surely have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, spinning in his grave.<br/><br/>This is a Holmes that not even Conan Doyle could recognize. Thank God that we have the definitive Holmes, in the person of Jeremy Brett, with which to console ourselves."

","This movie got ""mixed"" reviews from critics, who felt the movie wasn't all that great. Then again, the critics tend to like movies most people don't and vice versa.<br/><br/>Anyway, Game of Shadows picks up where the first Sherlock Holmes left off. This time, the main adversary is Professor Moriarity, ""the Napoleon of Crime,"" as Holmes calls him.<br/><br/>I will say that the plot takes a little while to develop but once it does, it really takes off.<br/><br/>---Spoilers--- I will say I was surprised that Irene Adler was killed off in the first ten minutes of the film. I had expected her to remain in the series, but her death was necessary to create a level of humanity in Holmes.<br/><br/>I do wish they had done a better job at showcasing Moriarity's sinister mind. The one time they do is at the opera house. The rest of the time, you only really see the end result. I feel like they maybe could have done a little more with him, but I was still very pleased with how they brought one of the great super-villains to life.<br/><br/>The ending was pretty good, I thought, I loved the dueling minds in the showdown with Moriarity, and with how for a good 10 minutes, the audience was left wondering if we had really seen the last of Holmes. The end...?"

","The first Sherlock Holmes was not only an accomplishment of storytelling and intrigue, but it pushed the ever-present envelope of science vs. magic. With that said, it is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. And though this sequel doesn't quite capture the wonder of it's predecessor, it is worthy enough to carry the title of the famous detective.<br/><br/>The story is engaging and will keep you hooked from beginning to end. The character of Moriarty presents an ever elusive threat, and it's up to the famous Sherlock Holmes and his trusty Dr. Watson to stop him! Though this scenario may seem clichéd and tired, the filmmaker's awesome dialogue, combine with excellent performances from Downey Jr., Law, and Harris, makes it quite an experience.<br/><br/>As awesome as I'm making this movie seem, and trust me, it is, there are some problems I have with it. The killing of McAdams character is too quick. And though we clearly see how her death affects Holmes, they filmmakers don't dwell on it. I see this as a great opportunity to create a truly dramatic scene. But no! She's killed, Sherlock is sad for a bit, and that's the end of it.<br/><br/>I also hate Stephen Fry in this movie. The character of Mycroft Holmes is every bit as ingenious as Sherlock; he is intelligent, but lazy and blunt. Fry certainly captures the apathetic nature of the character, but I never saw anything scintillating about him. For Fry's weaknesses, however, we get more of the back-and-forth banter from Sherlock and Watson in this film. Much like the first one, it focuses on their relationship-er, excuse me, partnership, and satirizes it to the one hundredth degree. This makes both characters more identifiable and more like brothers.<br/><br/>Particular praise is for the dialogue between Moriarty and Holmes. It brings back fond memories of reading the original short stories. Both men hate each other for their opposite morales and personalities, but at the same time, respect one another for their equal intellect. I wont say anymore, but trust me when I tell you that those scenes make the movie.<br/><br/>There's also a lot more action in this one, and though the constant slow motion and organized battle strategy is an acquired taste, there's a lot of gunshots and explosions to please any popcorn-flick fan.<br/><br/>Final verdict: This is a brilliant film! It's not as good as the first one, but certainly one of the stronger Sherlock Holmes movies (and trust me, there's quite a few). If you liked the first movie, or just want a huge murder/mystery story, then this movie is for you!"
"edwbur","10","2","12","17 December 2011"," the greatest sherlock Holmes movie ever. better than the first
","now don't get me wrong sherlock Holmes was a fantastic film. it had you at the edge of your seat the whole time. but this one had you falling out of you seat. the whole film was a joy ride. it picks up right where it leaves off in the first one. black wood is dead and the great detective sherlock Holmes and his trusty companion the good doctor Watson are facing the most challenging villain of all there careers professor James Moriarty. Moriarty in a lot of ways is like sherlock Holmes. he is smart, can defend himself, and tests everyone. Moriarty in this film tested sherlock Holmes like no other. giving him riddles and challenges even Holmes cant solve. in certain scenes Holmes and Moriarty are no farther than five feet away from each other which gives you more goosebumps for the ending and who will win and who will loose. the movie brings back Robert Downey Jr, Jude law, and Rachel McAdams. this time Rachel McAdams has a smaller role, but still shes great. Robert Downey Jr brings in the solid performance just like the previous sherlock Holmes maybe even a better performance because of the chemistry he has with Moriarty. Jared Harris plays Moriarty a much more worthy villain for sherlock Holmes than mark Strong's black wood because Moriarty is smarter and is not a fake. Jude law has a much bigger part in this film because his personal life is in far more danger than the last film and then becomes a more important ally than before. this also has more comedy in this film. very funny movie, but the comedy is not overbearing, its put in at the right moments. there is also a lot of drama in the film and Jared Harris shines in the film but smartly doesn't steal Robert Downey Jr's performance. which is good for me. this film gives you more challenging puzzles to solve fantastic action sequences, great acting, smartly written screenplay, and smart directing by guy Ritchie who directed the first sherlock Holmes. this movie is currently out in theaters. it came out yesterday December 16 along with Alvin and the chipmunks. but Sherlock Holmes is worth seeing and will diffidently win the box office draw. see it."
"billcarr31","Null","1","4","18 June 2018"," Very disappointing.
","Well not really as I was not as impressed as many seem to have been by the first one. What a shame that a movie with such good productions values and sets, although most of them are only seen for seconds, is so over burdened with pointless dramatics. Notions like putting a platoon of redcoats on a train with a machine gun to kill a man and his wife are too ludicrous for words. A pistol or a small bomb would have done a better job. Of course Holmes dispatches the whole platoon with ease, even somehow making a time bomb from a brass a tap and a toilet chain pull. This was done so quickly that the point of making a bomb was lost. 
Holmes mentally planning his fights was also silly, you cannot plan a fight like that as you do not know what your opponent's counter moves will. It broke the continuity of the encounters and wasted time. How as Watson an able to get the explosives in place to bring down the tower on Moriarty? There were also many anacronisms such as was directly injecting adrenaline into the heart known in the Victorian age? The whole thing was reminiscent of the super hero genre. 
Personally I think the Cumberbatch/Freeman series and the Holmes in New York series much more connected to the original characters"
"Radagast23","8","1","4","14 March 2012"," Serious upgrade from the original
","The 2nd chapter in Robert Downey's turn as the classic detective, A Game of Shadows came out during the 2011's packed holiday movie season. For me personally, this one got pushed behind releases like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and the U.S. version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. While I have plenty of faith in RBJ's ability to carry a movie, I just had a feeling this one would fall short of the original. Turns out it made me forget about it altogether.<br/><br/>Game of Shadows starts off with Sherlock's ever faithful companion, Dr. Watson, leaving his adventure days behind to get married. It turns out that the timing could have been better, since Holmes suspects the well-respected Prof. James Moriarty of having a sinister plan underway that could plunge all of Europe into war. Will the duo be able to take on their most challenging adversary yet?<br/><br/>This film provides just more examples on how Robert Downey Jr. improves a film. His acting and natural humor help create a great character in Sherlock Holmes. Even more, he allows the other actors to play off his talents and then be better themselves. The addition of Noomi Rapace, ever popular after her turn as Lisbeth Salander, adds even more depth. Outside of the acting, Guy Ritchie yet again crafts a unique atmosphere through the setting and soundtrack. While the sets may be drab and dark, scenes are filled with excitement and adventure. Lastly, while the twists and turns along the way are more than enough, the best is saved for the end. This is particularly enjoyable when so many movies are predictable these days.<br/><br/>Overall, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a thrilling mystery, filled with a good amount of action and humor. It's a smart movie that will keep you guessing until the very end. Enjoy 8/10"

","Sherlock Holmes is back with a bang! Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows continues with the adventures of Sherlock Holmes(Robert Downey Jr.) along with his sidekick Dr.John Watson(Jude Law). Following the events of the first movie, Holmes & Watson are hot on the trail of Professor Moriarty(Jared Harris). This movie has some of the best action & chase sequences in the history of action movies. The moviegoer is literally on the edge his/her seat in anticipation of what's going to happen next. Thank god, this movie wasn't in 3D. It was mind blowing on it's own & 3D would have ruined this movie. I must say, that it's much better than the first movie. Robert Downey Jr. is outstanding as detective Sherlock Holmes. No one else could have pulled off the role of Holmes, in the brilliant manner that he did. Jude Law is excellent as Watson, Holmes' trusted friend & sidekick. Downey Jr. & Law share great chemistry. Together, they create magic on screen! Noomi Rapace is effective as Madame Simza Heron. Professor Moriarty is a brilliant villain. Jared Harris has done an impressive job. I really wish that Rachel McAdams had more screen time. I really miss Irene Adler in this movie. Stephen Fry is hilarious as Mycroft Holmes. The ending, will simply take your breath away! So, I would like to conclude by saying, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is worth a watch.

","A+ <br/><br/>The first film truly was a surprise treat, I myself much expecting much less of it. Of course, I was blown away. Then came the news of the sequel, and then came the anxious trepidation. Would it flop? Could the previous story really be matched? Under the helm of Guy Ritchie once again, the film soars and abounds. Everyone is back, including a few new faces. Stephen Fry is a nice edition as the brother of Sherlock Holmes, and Jared Harris makes for a one intriguing villain. And let me not forget Paul Anderson, also well done.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is (SPOILER) the afterthought Rachel McAdams becomes after she's been murdered, but Noomi Rapace is up to the task of playing yet another great character. She isn't the femme fatale-inspired character that McAdams was, but all the same very enticing and great to watch on screen. The plot moves at a steady pace and builds tension quite admirably. The comedy is well orchestrated but does not over shadow the plot twists which will demand your attention. And the climatic showdown between Holmes and guy's character, well it's one of my favorite film moments in a long time.<br/><br/>Strikingly original, exciting locations and Hans Zimmer composing, the question is not if it can match up to the first film. No, the debate becomes which one of the two is superior to the other, and I myself have not been able to reach a verdict yet."
"3xHCCH","6","1","4","2 January 2012"," Sherlock Holmes Should Be Treated With More Respect!
","The first ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie was an unexpectedly great one. Before I watched that film, I did not think Robert Downey, Jr. could ever be acceptable as Sherlock Holmes. However, after watching that one, I admit that I was mistaken. Therefore, despite the unpromising trailer for this second installment of this franchise, I still went on to watch it, expecting this to exceed the action and humor of the first.<br/><br/>However, things did not really go very well in this sequel for me. The process of Holmes anticipating the next moves of his enemies in fights which was so innovative in the first, felt tedious in this one. I felt Guy Richie delved too much into close-ups and slow mo effects, fight scenes and explosions to hide the material deficiency of the script. This movie had more flourish than there was substance. <br/><br/>For the actors, only Jude Law for me played his character Dr. Watson as I would expect. Robert Downey, Jr. was NOT Sherlock in most of his scenes! Sherlock would never go drag and almost flirt with Watson the way it was played out here. I did not like it. The gypsy character of Noomi Rapace was quite unnecessary it seemed, just an excuse to have a new female character. The eccentric character of Sherlock's brother Mycroft as played by Stephen Fry was teetering on annoying. The very laid back way Jared Harris played Holmes' arch-enemy Professor Moriarty lacked palpable passion and life opposite Downey's hyper-acting. <br/><br/>Overall, except for a well-written cerebral confrontation scene between Holmes and Moriarty towards the end where they verbalized their moves as it be in a chess game, the rest of this sequel was a big disappointment for me. Hints of charm like the first movie were still evident in certain scenes, but the whole was not very satisfying, especially for traditional fans of the Sherlock Holmes books. Making Sherlock overly buffoonish is definitely NOT the way to make him click for this new generation. I think Richie and Downey have got to reassess the way they bring Sherlock to life, if they are thinking of a third installment."

"thecatswhiskers01","9","1","4","28 December 2011"," A rare, ""better"" sequel...but could a third match up to it?
","The original was enjoyable, but laborious in places - no fault of Messrs Ritchie, Law and Downey Jnr as necessary character introductions had to be made. Sequels have the benefit of establishment, but it is a rare sequel that equals or is even better than the original. GoS pulls it off; unrestrained by the 'setting up' exposition that the original had to plough through the story launches straight in and is all the better for it. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr are clearly having a riot, and they transmit that sense of delight to the audience. The sequel is a lot more quips/banter/playful especially between the two leads, and unlike the original, Jude Law (mostly) remembers Watson's limp. Kelly Reilly excels as is the perfect Mrs Watson: brave (the train), competent (locating the money) and wryly empathetic to her husband's long relationship of affection and friendship, and that Holmes' emotional-psychological need for Watson's presence is greater than the other way around. My only quibble is that Rachel McAdams (Irene Adler) dies implausibly - such a savvy woman would not have let her guard down and in the books survived to emigrate to America. Above all the movie, via Moriarty, highlights the subtle truism Conan Doyle only hints at in the books, namely that Watson was never in as much danger from anyone else - literally, emotionally and psychologically - as he was from Sherlock Holmes. ACD grew up with a functional, but eventually a violently demented, alcoholic doctor father and knew, (to steal Hugh Laurie's line from House) that 'dangerous people don't break into your home, they already live there.' Holmes, either unintentionally in drug stupor or through some crazy case, was more likely than any bad guy to kill Watson or get him killed 'unnecessarily' - in GoS Holmes' emotional need to have Watson nearby nearly causes Watson's untimely demise on several occasions as well as his own. The emotional depth of the original stories is that Watson is perfectly well aware of this, and accepts it as being a worthwhile risk in being Sherlock Holmes friend. Which brings me finally to Jared Harris, an excellent performance; what's more, he's true to the books in that his appearance is slightly 'older' than Holmes - in the books Moriarty is at least 5 years old than Holmes, but most adaptations have them contemporaneous. Again, in the books, ACD's subtle hint was that Holmes was well on the way to being heir to Moriarty, but retained his humanity due to his friendship with Watson, a lucky encounter Moriarty had never had in his own life. I hope they try a third movie - in canon, of course, sadly Mary Morstan died shortly after Holmes' return into their lives and they were then faced with Colonel Sebastian Moran trying to take revenge (particularly against Watson, a fellow military man) for scuppering Moriarty's schemes - so there is plenty of scope for Mr Ritchie and Co, to go at. If so, I hope it retains the playfulness, banter and sense of emotional connection evident of the first two movies."

","The biggest challenge any sequel has in Hollywood is, to surpass the expectations of its predecessor. The original Sherlock film was brilliant, the action, the suspense of the plot, the almost brother-like closeness of the Holmes and Watson and the vernacular employed, left me thinking it was one the few films where I actually got my moneys worth.<br/><br/>So knowing the challenges the new film faced, i went to see it on the big screen with some trepidation...<br/><br/>After watching the film, i felt that this film, has managed to better its older brother and not by any short distance. the humour was familiar yet better, the twist bore the fingerprint of a Ritchie movie, Professor Moriarty lived up to his reputation and role as Sherlocks' primary Nemisis, and the evolution of the friendship between Holmes and Watson now he has left Baker street was dealt brilliantly.<br/><br/>So to sum up, if you want to see a film which will have you laughing on a too frequent basis, riveted all the way through and want you craving for more... this is the film for you.

The plot this time, though confusing, leads you on a merry chase that will leave you intrigued and wanting more. By the end of the movie, you feel as if you have gone a journey in them.

","One thing you have to love about ""A Game Of Shadows"" is the pitch which it starts. The touch of comedy makes it enticing to the eyes and ears. With over 2 hours of watch time, Holmes delivered a enough juice to keep you watching.<br/><br/>With a more like Jackie Chan fight scenes, lovely disguises by Holmes and it was fun to see the dynamic duo, battle together in a sheer masculine type male bonding, with Watson being the joker in every scene introducing jokes and fun as the plot untangles.<br/><br/>Holmes brother Mycoft was also introduced, as in the books Sherlock Holmes brother was more in touch with his power of observation than Sherlock himself. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle made Holmes brother smarter and better than Holmes in his books the only different being he had more political ambition than Holmes and less interest in being a detective.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) is up against a criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) who is Holmes' intellectual equal. The story starts off with the death of the Crown Prince of Austria. Holmes deduces that the prince has been the victim Professor Moriarty.<br/><br/>Holmes goes after Moriarty, but always seems to be behind all that is going on. The two masterminds start a game of who will succeed a game which Moriarty's lack of conscience led to chaos and death.<br/><br/>The movie did have an initial faceoff between the two major players Holmes and Moriarty, a faceoff that was less exciting than I hoped.<br/><br/>No need to say anything about the acting, as it was the main steed in the movie riding hard and strong till it crossed the finish line in front, the acting was something extraordinary, good delivery of lines, wonderful facial expressions and grand gestures; making the actors more like the character they represent than being distant from the movie, what am saying in few words is, the actors were the bomb.<br/><br/>The scenery was well crafted to fit and suit the screenplay which (screenplay) was a grand gesture of mastery. Directing must have been made easy for Guy Ritchie (who directed the first Sherlock Holmes) as the screenplay to me did the main task. The script and dialogue won't bore you that's for sure and the cat and mouse game of Holmes and Moriarty was good to watch.<br/><br/>The effects were great and the tragedy was endless as the collateral damage grew intensively in this movie. There was a scene that was like a war was going on.<br/><br/>All in all, if like me you delayed to see this masterpiece, I advice you do so now before it gets away from the cinema if it hasn't already."

","The idea of this sequel consists, of course, in using the same actors and the same basic idea but this movie is directed with more confidence and a sense of humor as well as a sense of identity, as far as I can see. This story is clear to the viewer from the beginning and remains such at every turn. The film is full of action set-pieces but intelligently constructed and fitting very well within the Holmesian proceedings. The tone is fairly appropriate and the characters are right. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law have a very strong chemistry with one another. There will surely be a third installment with the same lead actors but anyone who hasn't disliked the first and the second movies won't be be stopped from going to the movie theaters."

","A Game Of Shadows is the sequel to Guy Ritchie's very successful reimagining of the Sherlock Holmes mythos. Holmes embarks on a battle of wits (and more) against Professor James Moriarty (whose shadowy existence was introduced tangentially in the previous film, and the occasion of Watson's marriage is one of the early incidents in the incident-packed journey from the end of this film to the final showdown between Holmes and Moriarty.<br/><br/>Unusually for me, I spotted the maguffin which was critical to the twist in the tail when it was introduced: otherwise, this complicated film meandered satisfactorily all over the place. I'm not sure it all made sense: however, I was always so confused that it doesn't really matter whether it did or not. This is broadly similar to the first movie, where it wasn't until I had watched it a second time that I felt it broadly made sense.<br/><br/>This film works on the basis ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"": thus, like the first one, we have a convoluted plot, we have a number of sequences where Holmes' thought processes are unravelled, we have the slow-fast-slow editing and slow motion explosions, we have plenty of period atmosphere, and we have the very pleasing chemistry between Holmes and Watson. Added to this are Holmes' brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry, very enjoyable notwithstanding the brothers' somewhat improbably habit of referring to each other as Mike and Shirley) and Jared Harris' wonderful Moriarty, a very believable Machiavellian thinker, planner, manipulator, and cold-blooded killer. And, importantly, Holmes' equal.<br/><br/>There were a lot of laughs in the cinema - this film is funnier than a lot of films which call themselves comedies.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it as much as its predecessor."
"griffolyon12","9","1","5","20 December 2011"," More of This, More of That...
","There are three things that make for a good sequel: more, more, and more, and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows does just that. Is there more action this time about? Yes. Is there more character and relational development? Yes. Is it more faithful to its literary counterpart? Yes.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr. returns with charisma as the sleuth, with Jude Law not far behind as Dr. Watson, the straight man of the duo. Watson is getting married this go-around, which does not sit very well with Holmes, conveyed well by Downey, Jr without ever coming across as unnecessarily jealous. However, Watson's whole Honeymoon runs amok when him and Holmes must embark upon one final case to prevent Professor James Moriarty from manipulating the world powers -- via acts of terrorism -- into starting a World War.<br/><br/>Moriarty is every bit Holmes's equal, and Jared Harris manages to be as cool and collected as Downey, Jr. is as Holmes. However, what makes both portrayals work, is the emotions flashing behind their eyes that are masked by their demeanor and the way they deliver their lines, resulting in a lot of sophisticated set pieces that are more Hitchcock than what one tends to associate with the films of director Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>The flick has fewer plot holes than its predecessor, though it lacks much of the crackling pace and energy of the first installment, often moving a touch slow for such an action heavy piece. Same as the first installment, there are a few scenes that just felt unnecessary and bogged down the flow of the story, such as the scene with Holmes's brother, Mycroft, in the nude.<br/><br/>Even through all of the slow moments, Ritchie manages to keep the audience in the story through the verbal sparring that is always enjoyable between Holmes and Watson, and taking us into Holmes's mind by not just hearing Holmes's thought as to how he is deducing his environment, but by also visually representing these things through camera movement and reactionary point-of-view shots.<br/><br/>The action as a whole develops organically throughout the story, with the story dictating the action rather than the action dictating what the story is about, and this is where A Game of Shadows is a step above so many other action films. The action is cleverly woven to where Ritchie can do a breathtaking chase sequence through the woods entirely in slow-mo, detailing every minor graze of a bullet and explosion, and then dial back to have a chess match between Holmes and Moriarty as the climax in a Hitchockian fashion. It is in moments like these that A Game of Shadows is the most successful, and it is why it builds upon the framework of its predecessor and surpasses it.<br/><br/>I give Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows a 9 out of 10!"
"blacklist-1","9","1","6","23 December 2011"," The second outing with Holmes and Watson is just as fun and action packed as it's predecessor. Terrific entertainment!
","Guy Richie's modern take on Sherlock Holmes for me has been interesting and refreshingly different. The first film I wasn't sure what to expect but it bought out a terrific comedy duo between Holmes (Robert Downey Junior) and Watson (Jude Law)thanks to a witty script, excellent acting and exciting action.<br/><br/>Their second promises more of the same and delivers. Coming up against Holmes ultimate Nemesis Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). They suspect him of dozens of killings across Europe in a plot to start a world war as he is into arms manufacturing. They are joined by Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace) from the Swedish version of the excellent Millienium Trilogy films and come into contact with Holmes brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry). The story is quite predictable as we know who the villain is from the outset unlike the first one, which did have more of a mystery. The women of course like the first outing are criminally underused, though Noomi Rapace gives a great performance and makes the most impact of the limited female characters on screen. Another criticism is even though Jared Harris gives a good performance as Moriarty, he just wasn't as menacing or have as a sly demeanour as Mark Strong who played Lord Blackwell. <br/><br/>However I loved everything else though the film did start off a bit slow, once it got going it was at it's best. Robert Downey Junior and Jude Law give excellent performances once again, which are just so much fun to watch, particularly Downey Junior who just makes the role of Holmes seem so effortless to carry out, it's almost bewildering in it's simplicity of his portrayal. Of course what makes this comedy duo so fantastic is that script, which is just as wise-cracking and witty as the first one and though some of the comedy is quite silly, it is meant to be in a funny and goofy way as this whole movie just has the air of not taking itself seriously, which made it a real delight to watch. Special mention must also go to Stephen Fry as Mycroft though in a cameo appearance he makes the most of in a hilarious and cracking performance. <br/><br/>Guy Richie's directing is equally exquisite with wonderful scenery and editing of slow-motion during the action sequences, which were choreographed to the highest quality, with plenty of excitement attached. The musical score is also wonderful. Though I did have a few gripes with the film (not every movie is perfect, even the ten of out ten movies). I loved this from start to finish.

","The cinematic reinvention of the English sleuth in 2009 was such a success that it was clear we had a new franchise in the making and so two years later the old team are back for a second outing with the same leading actors – the brilliant Robert Downey Jr as the eponymous detective and engaging Jude Law as his long-suffering companion in a duo with evident chemistry – plus the same director (Guy Ritchie) and the same musician (Hans Zimmer).<br/><br/>Sequels so often disappoint compared to the original, but ""A Game Of Shadows"" is even more confident and fun. This may not be high art but, in terms of sheer entertainment, this is almost as good as it gets. The threat could hardly be larger - the instigation of a first world war – and, as Professor Moriaty, Jared Harris supplies a splendid villain, while Stephen Fry is a delight as Holmes' older brother. The first movie was weak on women and here Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly have little to do, but at least Noomi Rapace (""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"") looks the part as an exotic if sullen gypsy.<br/><br/>In truth, except for all the deduction from detail, period settings in 1891, and wry humour, this adventure is so frenetic, with one action sequence after another and Ritchie's trademark rapid cutting alternating with slow-motion shots, that this could almost be a Jason Bourne or Mission Impossible movie. But, heh, who\s complaining? Certainly not me."

","I enjoyed this movie. I found it to be unpredictable, always being on the edge of your chair. It had a great deal of action, and hand to hand combat compared to the previous film. The plot of the film was very complex. The best word to describe the movies' plot is ""clever"". This is the only fault I find due to the lack of knowledge a viewer may have if he/she hasn't viewed the previous film. This movie was also filled with a great deal of humor; which I also found to be ""clever humor"". The performance of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law was impeccable, realistic, and both had great chemistry when portraying their roles as such close friends. Noomi Rapace, who portrayed a Gypsy woman, had an great performance as well. The sinister professor and villain in this movie is portrayed by Jared Harris, who in my opinion, made his character very believable and one of the greatest acts in the entire film. What I liked most is the element of surprise this movie carried, constantly making theories of the end but being astonished by the real final outcome. The ending of the movie was the perfect icing on the cake. I left the theater thinking to myself ""absolutely brilliant"". All in all, this movie was one of the greatest mystery films I have ever seen. There was never a dual moment and it kept the wheels of my mind constantly turning."

","I couldn't wait for the weekend to begin because I knew I was going to hit up a popcorn, blockbuster double-header in the theater, Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, a back- to-back pairing almost unmatched this year. Two incredibly big budget franchises with two incredibly charismatic leading men. These are the box office battles I just live for. Since the weekend numbers have already come in, we've seen Sherlock Holmes dominate the weekend ($40 million vs. $13 million for Mission Impossible), so the honor of first review goes to them.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows picks up fairly close to where the last one left off. Watson is getting married and Holmes is closing in on his arch-enemy, Professor Moriarty. The two masterminds face off against each other in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse which threatens not only the life of our quixotic hero, but his best friend and possibly the entire world beyond.<br/><br/>It's likely been said before, and as much as I hate repetition I'll forego it this one time, Robert Downey Jr. was born for this role. Obviously the historical version of Holmes was tweaked and crafted around Downey's skills and persona, but the magical merge between the real person and the literary classic created something perfect which will be cherished by viewers for generations to come. All future attempts at playing Holmes, which I am sure there will be someday, will be weighed against Downey, a bar now set incredibly high. His charm, wit and energy flow through the scenes effortlessly, keeping the audience in tow no matter what is going on. He also lets his co-stars, like Jude Law (as Dr. Watson) and Jared Harris (as Prof. Moriarty) own the moment equally, not overshadowing their own crisp deliveries and subtle mannerisms. From back-to-front, the performances throughout were playful, charming and more than enough to please any afternoon crowd.<br/><br/>So if everyone was so great in it, why is the rating so low? That is a fantastic question.<br/><br/>The downfall here is the script. If you are going to create a story for the world's most renowned investigator, you need to plunge the imagination of the audience into a world of multiple story lines, interconnecting webs of deceit and subterfuge, something only Holmes could solve. The first film had this, but Game of Shadows rolls out a plot all too plain for such a complicated enemy like Moriarty. There seemed to be an effort to cover that up by actually showing a room full of interconnecting threads built by Holmes, to demonstrate how complicated this all really was, but that felt a cheap way out for writing a more complex story. Moriarty is the epitome of villains, the mental match for Sherlock Holmes, and in the end he just turns out to be greedy, a motive far below the weight of his character.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie, the returning director, held up his side of the bargain, but didn't push anything forward in terms of the style and execution. We got more slam-to-slow-motion shots and a couple good moments of Holmes playing out the oncoming violence in his head in order to predict the exact counter maneuvers. I will give both Ritchie and the screenwriters credit through for the final scene between Holmes and Moriarty, which I won't go into detail about, but it was a nice twist on a familiar theme in this franchise."

","I loved the first Sherlock Holmes movie and couldn't wait to see this one. Before I went to the theater I was worried by some of the reviews that I saw posted, but I went into the film with an open mind. Well after the first couple of scenes I could see why the critics downgraded this movie and that's ashame. I think that Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect Holmes and in the first film, yes he was quirky but not annoying. In this film he has moments where annoying comes through. The film makers are making the same mistake that way made with the Pirates movies. In the first Pirate movie Jack Sparrow was quirky brilliant and in the second some of the brilliance remained but the quirkiness was starting to take the forefront. In the last two film quirky had taken over, especially the last. This is the same thing I see happening to Sherlock Holmes. He is a brilliant detective with a few idiocracies but they are staring to change him into a clown.<br/><br/>I also didn't like all of the choppy camera work and there was way too much of the slow motion. It works in the last scenes with Holmes and the Professor but by that time you've had so much that you might be ready to tune out and thus the meaning of the mental battle is lost. I hope that if they decide on doing another (I don't think the box office will be as big as it was for the first movie though) I hope they go back to the brilliant Holmes and leave the quirky at home."

","In 2009 Sherlock Holmes became a break out hit making over half a billion dollars and successfully brought the brand into the mainstream blockbuster film community making both Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson both known to the average film goer and relevant to modern cinema. While the movie's story and concept themselves didn't boast anything new or above average, the movie did boast lightning in a bottle chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as the leads as well as the very cool and stylized take on late 19th century England from director Guy Ritchie. Because of the chemistry and the style Sherlock Holmes was able to be successful with audiences as well as critics which now brings us to the inevitable sequel A Game of Shadows. While Shadows doesn't have as much to prove as its predecessor it certainly had a whole new set of problems to deal with; the biggest being just another sequel that tries so hard to recapture the original, but ultimately failing like so many other sequels out there. The movie does return with the entire original cast and the marvelous Jared Harris joins the cast as Holm's greatest foe Prof. Simon Moriarty.

","First of all I'll start off by saying that despite how good the movie was I still enjoyed the first movie more than this one. I thought that the movie was very funny it had another great performance from Robert Downey JR. I thought Rachel McAdams did a good job with what time she had in the movie oh by the way her character Irene Adler dies ten minutes into the movie Moriarty kills her by giving her tuberculosis. I really thought that Noomi Rapace did a good job this being her first American movie and all but her character Simza's only significance to the story is that Moriaty is trying and eventually succeeds in killing her brother. I thought Stephen Frye as Sherlock's brother was hilarious particularly the scene where he's naked while talking to Watson's bride. Jared Harris did a pretty Good job as professor James Moraity although I would have liked to see more of him in the movie I thought his take was good he played a very smart and keen version of Moriarty who has other people do his dirty work for him and who is ultimately outwitted by Sherlock at the end of the film. Jude law's take this time around was a bit different in that he grows more and more tiresome of Holmes during the duration of the film but still helps him non the less John Watson is dragged into the battle whiskey Moriarty when he goes after him and tries to have Watson and his wife Mary killed on a train on their way to their honeymoon he also grows more remorseful for Holmes during the movie although he does save him at the end of the movie. Robert Downey JR. like I said just really nailed the role of Sherlock Holmes the funniest parts of the entire movie are at the begging and end of the movie when he's dressed up in camouflage but to me the greatest improvement is his mind he is a lot smarter than he was in the first movie I still love that he projects how he is going to beat someone up before he does it and then does it flawlessly and exactly how he rehearsed it in his head I also loved the way that he outsmarted Moriarty because it was more of a challenge for him than in the first movie the fact that he had to let Moriarty torture him by hanging him on a fishhook and then stealing a little red book that had all of Moriarty's plans and investments in it and making him bankrupt in the process a I am not going to say much about the ending but trust me you are going to get your money's worth it's a great ending I just ca't give it away. in closing I think Sherlock Holmes a game of shadows is a very fun ride a very intense and thrilling edge of your seat adventure movie."

Poor old Conan Doyle came to hate his creation, and killed him off. And it almost worked, he got so much flak about it, from everyone he had to bring him back. When Gilbert, the famous actor in the U.S. of that time wrote to Conan Doyle asking his permission to use the Sherlock Holmes character in his stage production, and with what limitations, Conan Doyle replied ""Murder him, marry him, do what you like with him"". This is a good movie, it has a good story. I would have like Robert Downey jr. to be taller, but you can't have everything. Enjoy."

","A series of bombings across Europe are threatening to start a war between France and Germany; Sherlock Holmes is convinced that the man behind it is Professor James Moriarty. The authorities don't agree though; Moriarty is a respected academic and counts Prime Ministers amongst his friends. Holmes is of course right but proving it will be difficult and Moriarty is aware that he is being investigated. He decides to make things personal, first killing Holme's friend Irene Adler then targeting the newly married Watson and his wife Mary. Holmes manages to save the latter two but their plans for a honeymoon must be put on hold as Holmes and Watson head to France. Here they find themselves working alongside Gypsy fortune-teller Madam Simza Heron as they race to uncover exactly what Moriarty is up to; all leading to the famous meeting at the Reichenbach Falls.<br/><br/>After and enjoyable opening film this sequel manages to keep the enjoyment going. The story is fun and there is plenty of action from start to finish. Much of this action is fairly stylised; notably in a sequence where people are fleeing through woodland while under artillery fire where trees shatter in ultra-slow motion; I found this highly effective although I can see how some viewers won't be so impressed. There is also a particularly exciting fight on a train. As well as good action there are also plenty of laughs throughout the film. Most of the jokes are fairly obvious but some are more subtle; I loved the musical joke of having the theme from the film 'Two Mules for Sister Sara' play as Holmes rode a donkey behind his horse riding companions. The cast do a solid job; Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law continue to impress as Holmes and Watson and newcomers Noomi Rapace and Stephen Fry are fun as Madam Heron and Holmes brother Mycroft. Jared Harris makes a fine Moriarty; threatening without tipping over to be a pantomime villain. Overall I'd say this was a fun film and heartily recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the first film however if you didn't like this first film I suspect you'd be equally disappointed with this as it is similar in style."

","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011): Dir: Guy Ritchie / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Noomi Rapace, Jared Harris, Rachel McAdams: Entertaining sequel to the 2009 hit. It addresses trickery and intellect as Sherlock Holmes always has every move mapped out before they commit. His partner, Dr. Watson is getting married but Holmes interferes in that when attempts are made on their lives. Director Guy Ritchie is backed with intense action and a plot that travels Germany and Switzerland. The opening effectively cuts a previous tie and it opens to a payoff that is often clever including a brilliant conclusion that contains the trademark humour. Robert Downey Jr as Holmes is clever with amusing disguises and an extreme sense of wit. Jude Law as Watson must put his honeymoon reluctantly and suddenly on hold while he bails Holmes out of certain death. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty is the film's villain using bombs like they are toys to be wound at will and set loose. He is every bit as clever as Holmes as they nearly match up but Holmes will ultimately have the last laugh in an amusing final scene. The only weak role is Noomi Rapace as a gypsy whose brother is missing and Moriarty is linked to it. While her role thankfully avoids being a romantic prop, it is still lifeless nonetheless. Rachel McAdams is featured in the effective opening where she is poisoned, which is actually a shame since she brings much to the table. While the first film breathed new life into the classic character, this film is pure entertainment that is a game of shadows where the audience is delightfully tricked. Score: 8 ½ / 10"
"williampsamuel","8","0","2","15 January 2015"," Game of Shadows is a solid sequel.
","To those raised on the Holmes or Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Bret, 2009's Sherlock Holmes, starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role, came as something of a shock, some might say a revelation. Here was the esteemed detective as action hero, battling the forces of crime not only with his keen intellect and powers of observation, but also with fisticuffs, gun play, and a near precognitive ability to predict his opponents' motions. It was highly unconventional, a complete departure from past portrayals, but it worked. And in Game of Shadows, it works once more.<br/><br/>The formula director Guy Ritchie has taken works because it adds new aspects to the persona of Sherlock Holmes, thus broadening his appeal, while keeping largely intact the things which endeared generations of fans to the character in the first place. By which I mean that although this version of Holmes is far more action oriented than previous incarnations, his ultimate success still depends on his ability to see details and make connections that no-one else can.<br/><br/>And while the wisecracking, somewhat rakish Holmes seen here may come as something as a shock, it should be remembered that Doyle's great detective has always nursed a morphine habit and delighted in backhandedly belittling lesser investigators, and that the author did on at least one occasion refer to Holmes's study as 'Bohemian.' So while Downey's portrayal may be something of a stretch, it is a least partially grounded in the Doyle's work. And regardless of its faithfulness to the source material, there's little doubt that this Holmes' wit and unconventionality are highly amusing.<br/><br/>The action scenes are very good, with choreography easily equaling that of most contemporary martial arts pictures. It's especially interesting, if a bit credibility stretching, to watch as Holmes works out each movement of the upcoming fight within his head, then makes a few minute adjustments to achieve the desired ends. Nor has the big reveal, in which Holmes shows how he has fit the pieces together and outsmarted the criminals, lose any of its impact. As is to be expected in any good mystery, even the smallest details, going back almost to the beginning of the case, can have great importance at the case's end.<br/><br/>I will admit however that while the chain of clues didn't seem to have any gaps, it wasn't entirely clear what set Holmes on the trail in the first place. More seriously, at times film becomes a bit too goofy for its own good, and it seems that the actors are unable to resist cracking up just a bit. And based on one scene around the halfway mark, I would urge Downey to avoid playing members of the opposite sex in the future.<br/><br/>Overall though, Sherlock Holmes- Game of Shadows has successfully captured the magic of its predecessor. It combines action, humor, and unexpected twists a package that should satisfy and entertain most film goers."

And this is a good thing, it really is. If you liked the first film, then this won't disappoint at all and you may even like a bit more if its story is more to your liking.<br/><br/>Yet personally I cannot help but feel that novelty played a large part in why I liked the 2009 so much. It was a version of Sherlock Holmes I hadn't seen before. But now with a sequel I don't have that. I've already seen much of what it has to offer before, and the new it has is not enough to pull me back in completely. It's also worth mentioning that don't really like Jared Horris as Professor Moriarty. His acting here is very workmanlike. It gets the job done, but I would have preferred to see more spirit from him, even little hints of brilliance and menacing intellect.<br/><br/>Still, it's by no means a bad film. Downey Jr. and Law are still absolutely brilliant in their roles, the rest of the returning actors do a good job, technically it's just as professional as the previous one, the story is one of the classic Holmes stories told well and as a whole it'll keep you entertained.

","Sherlock Holmes a game of shadows was a very different film than it's predecessor, Sherlock Holmes (2009). While reviewing Sherlock Holmes a Game of Shadows, I will be reviewing it in a much different way than typical movie reviews. I am neither a professional movie review nor a want to professional movie reviews. Below is my review of the ending or Sherlock Holmes a Game of Shadows.<br/><br/>The plot is very interesting, however, the resolution, or perhaps the ending of the film is not as in depth as the previous Sherlock Holmes. While the plot was, in my opinion, very interesting and more in-depth than the majority of movies that have come out recently, it was lacking compared to the first. Sherlock Holmes a Game of Shadows builds up the viewer's hope of Sherlock once again being the smartest man, and also solving and perhaps putting a man behind bars in the process. When the movie is nearing its end (SPOILER) Sherlock Holmes falls into, or off, a waterfall with the Professor, undoubtedly killing the professor and Sherlock Holmes. Then minutes later, we see Sherlock Holmes alive and well, while Dr. Watson believes he is dead. We see Watson get a package; it is the breath tool (I don't know what to call it) thus meaning that Holmes must have lived (a reference to a previous scene in the film). At this, I was left wondering how in the world he survived the fall of the waterfall? Yes, there was water below, but from that height, hitting water is like hitting concrete. If he didn't die (which he would), he would have had at least broken bones, or have been knocked out. While he did have oxygen, thus he didn't drown, he would have frozen. After all there was snow on the ground and it was snowing out. He would have died of hypothermia, or frozen to death some other way. He would have died. Lets face it. There is a 0% chance of any human surviving fall, let alone the climate outside. However, I did like this ending. I didn't wait Holmes to die, so I was relieved to see that he didn't! I personally am excited to see the Third Sherlock Holmes, when or if it comes out. This was a phenomenal film!"

","My Respects sent out to Guy Ritchie and British Television. This outstanding movie not only intrigued me to think while watching, it gave incredible visuals, crazy plot twists and flattering character development, did i forget Robert downey's insanely clever performance? This movie stands out from a lot of 1800's based films, see in this movie it doesn't show the 1800s as a boring depressive age, it shows a clever modernizing society that functions outside of the trouble. Plus you could watch this movie not caring if it was in the year 3000 or 2013! I think Guy chose the 1800's because it was just outside of the age of industrial revolution and it provides an environment where there are more possibilities within the plot, and more can be done under the radar so to speak. Also the original book series took place in the 1800's anyway. Anyway overall i'd give this movie a 9/10"

","After a good, solid first outing by Guy Ritchie featuring excellent cut-and-thrust chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law, and a suitably mysterious and involving plot, I was unsure what to expect from the sequel, but there is no dip in form here, 'A Game of Shadows' is excellent, its canvas is the whole of Europe, Moriarty is on the move and the game is afoot! The action is well-paced, Holmes and Watson's relationship is under strain and darkness and daring abound as a spate of bombings shakes Europe.<br/><br/>The introduction of Stephen Fry is inspired; he provides an excellent second foil for Downey Jr. and also a degree of gravitas that was missing before. Noomi Rapace is superbly cast, a pity she was not given more to do, but excellent to see her in a big circulation movie, hopefully more to come. The stand-out performance however is Jared Harris, oh how different from his meek and mild-mannered role as Lane Pryce in 'Mad Men', his Moriarty is superb; not a blustering caricature of evil, thank goodness, but the best kind of villain, a super-intelligent man of strong desires and no morality. The scenes that he shares with Holmes are riveting, none more so than the last one, which is superb cinema.<br/><br/>To conclude, despite the very tacky strap line 'A Game of Shadows' IS bigger, it IS better and it IS funnier, but not at the expense of an excellent Gothic action thriller with a tremendous denouement."

","Sometimes it happens, that when directors and actors bring forth a new version of well known character they don't always have the guts to go all in, despite it might seem so from the eyes of the purists. This was the case with the first Holmes movie directed by Richie. Sherlock Holmes wasn't a bad movie, but it was somewhat constrained by the heritage of the titular character. The Game Of Shadows is an entirely different matter. In this movie Riche dares to amp up the character to his usual standards, as he already has familiarized himself with it.<br/><br/>Robert Downey's Holmes runs like in steroids. He's maniacal, funny, emotional and crazy, but utterly brilliant in his deductions. Jude Law is a perfect contrast for Downey and they share brilliant chemistry, which is so important for Holmes and Watson.<br/><br/>The Game Of Shadows is a well cast, railroad action adventure, that dares to take Holmes into another level. In this version Holmes is not as cold and emotionless as he often is portrayed, but more of a eccentric lunatic.<br/><br/>In TGOS Moriarty, played nicely by Jared Harris, takes aim to Watson, who is planning his honeymoon with his newly wedded wife Mary (Kelly Reilly). Holmes is on the heels of Moriarty, who is for some reason trying to kill gypsy fortuneteller Simza, Noomi Rapace. This all results into a chase running all over the Europe, while the audience is trying to figure who is the cat and who's the mouse in the game of two brilliant minds.<br/><br/>As it is TGOS an entertaining addition to the Holmes series. It's not a traditional portrayal, but then again, that is not even necessary. It's a refreshing portrayal of Holmes, that isn't afraid of being a bit silly from time to time."

The action is quick, no-nonsense and takes your breath away while also being fun and exciting. <br/><br/>The film's bullet effects are breathtaking and not too dissimilar to the ones used in 'The Matrix.' The entire film is full of clever sound mixing and editing. The score used throughout the film is very playful and catchy which adds to the 'not taking it too seriously effect.' The whole film's Victorian set-up is once again spot on for a certain detective to mess around in. That is Downey Jr. 's Sherlock Holmes. RDJ is absolutely brilliant and the little situations his character gets into are absolutely laugh-out-loud. The whole film was written just to let him run riot with his incredible style of comedy acting. He also shows Holmes' more serious side as we see that even the most perfect men can get things wrong, after he witnesses a bomb attack he could have stopped.<br/><br/>Jared Harris is chilling as Moriarty, while Noomi Rapace is good but her character has little effect on you, as a viewer. Jude Law provides the serious delivery of lines but is certainly likable as ever. New to most Americans, is Stephen Fry who plays Holmes' brother, Mycroft. The timing of his lines are perfect as ever with his irresistible dry wit. The fact that he calls his brother 'Shirley' and is physically superior to him, only causes for more enjoyment. <br/><br/>The plot (as described above) is surprisingly a little thin, you only realise what is really happening until the second half of the film and it gets a little too politely global for Sherlock Holmes. However, these faults are second to the brilliant enjoyment of a film that finishes as it starts; intense, suspenseful and hilarious."

","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is the second installment in the Sherlock Holmes franchise and it does not disappoint. While it lacks the charm of the first film, it makes up for that with the thrills, wit, and some clever action. It also makes use for the slo-mo scenes that made the first one really enjoyable. Also this film has a better and popular villain that all fans of Sherlock Holmes know of: Professor James Moriarty.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's film joins Sherlock and Watson together on another adventure and this time they aim to stop the evil Professor Moriarty from destroying the world.<br/><br/>This movie works because of the wit and interplay of Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law. Just like Iron Man, I can't see anyone else playing a better Sherlock than Downey. I love his sardonic attitude and it's a nice feature to give to Sherlock. Jude makes a good Watson and I really can't see anyone doing better. Jared Harris makes a good Moriarty. I didn't know what to expect out of him.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really fun film. While it doesn't improve on the first film, it's still a welcome addition to the Sherlock Holmes franchise. This movie is action-packed and it features some cool stunts. it doesn't hurt to have scenes where Downey dresses in drag. I rate this film 9/10."
"ChristianUnchained","8","0","1","23 April 2013"," A Phenomenal sequel
","I'm very surprised and impressed by this sequel to the original Sherlock Holmes. To be honest, I was not a fan of the original despite it being somewhat of a ""classic"" among occasional movie- goers. The sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows, isn't necessarily better in the story- telling department, but it is better in every other aspect as compared to the first. <br/><br/>The film definitely has a better grip on the manic and silly Sherlock Holmes, and finally Downey Jr. nails the character. Jude Law is funnier and more charismatic, and the antagonists are violent and evil. The stylized, brutal, and bone crunching action that was present in the first film is now at full force in the second film. It's wonderfully choreographed, exciting, and unique. Sets are a neat stylized ""Tim Burton"" take on Britain, Paris, and more. The action set pieces are a combination of hilarious mishaps and neat Sherlock-esque action. <br/><br/>The most rickety aspect is the plot. It starts totally manic, hair brained, fast paced, and illogical but ends totally smart, stylish, intense, and wonderfully cheeky. It's a film that pulls a 180 in terms of being watchable, and shifts wildly from manic insanity to clever intensity by the end of the film. It's a film that's hard to digest: not because it's deep or complex, but because it starts out as a hair brained origins story with no direction and ends with a bang - but not the dynamite, explosion kind. Whatever that hard to digest element may be, this film is charismatic, exciting, funny, and a pleasure to watch."
"DubhDoo","8","0","1","3 January 2013"," It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Holmes
","No one expected much from 2009's 'Sherlock Holmes'; Guy Ritchie doing Holmes with Robert Downey Jr.? Many predicted it to be a huge failure, but wait, it turned out to be surprisingly good; a rather likable action-packed mystery romp bolstered by sparkling chemistry between its two leads. It garnered a generally positive critical reception and enjoyed box-office success, thus making a sequel inevitable. <br/><br/>'A Game of Shadows' follows Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) as they encounter the sinister Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) and are forced to partake in a mysterious game of cat-and-mouse to outwit the cunning villain.<br/><br/>This film's predecessor largely worked because of its well-matched leads; its story was relatively simple and nothing special, however the note-perfect casting of the detective duo managed to elevate the movie to heights it may not have reached otherwise. Downey Jr. continues on the path he strode on the first film, bringing a certain degree of swagger to Conan Doyle's iconic creation, inducing him with a few drops of the action hero charm and irresistible charisma he so perfectly honed as Tony Stark. While Jude Law, essentially the straight man, acts as a great foil to his partner and also gets a number of moments to shine, one in the film's third act is surprisingly touching. It's the dynamic between them though that makes this movie what is; they are the new Butch and Sundance, as far as I'm concerned, bouncing off of each other brilliantly and giving the film its beating heart and soul. <br/><br/>When Daniel Day Lewis was originally cast as the iconic villain Moriarty, I found myself in a state of glee; however, he eventually passed on the offer to portray the title character in Steven Spielberg's much-delayed 'Lincoln'. Jared Harris was cast instead and after being rather good in 'Mad Men' he continues to impress, proving a formidable antagonist to our heroes, exuding a presence of unmistakable menace. He shares a number of great scenes with Downey Jr., most notably their first meeting and a third-act game of wits. The reliable Stephen Fry lightens the mood as Holmes' brother Mycroft, while the fantastic Noomi Rapace is unfortunately wasted in a rather bland role.<br/><br/>This being a Guy Ritchie movie means action; so yes, the slo-mo of the first film returns, but thankfully doesn't manage to outstay its welcome (just about). There are fisticuffs, explosions, shootouts and big collapsing buildings. Holmes' near-superhuman fight-strategising skills also reappear throughout. Fortunately, all the action sequences don't manage to get in the way of a rather engaging story, with a script more intelligent and complex than that of its predecessor, with the writers wisely devoting some of the standout moments to encounters between Moriarty and Holmes. The film also moves at the pace of a freight train, continuously galloping forward, never leaving the viewer bored or unengaged, as the plot zips from London to Paris to Germany to Switzerland in Bond-like motion, making a nice contrast to the London- only setting of the original. <br/><br/>To put it simply: this film is bigger, bolder, funnier and better than the first, with even more bromance between Law and Downey Jr. and much more memorable villain. Building upon the strengths of the first movie, this is easily Guy Ritchie's best film yet, with snappy one-liners, exciting action, humour and moments of genuine emotion. Let's just hope that third time really is the charm."

","I have to say that Sherlock Holmes: a Game of Shadows was absolutely terrific. It totally blew me away by how great it was.I went to see this on a cold night back in January, not expecting much, but it ended up delivering. Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job as Sherlock Holmes and the way that Jude Law as Watson participated in the plot made him not seem like a sidekick but an equal.Jared Harris was brilliant as Professor Moriarty. He is definitely my favorite movie antagonist ever. This film is funny, the plot does not drag and it has lots of action and mystery. I love the first movie and this was just as good. This sequel definitely did not suffer the fate of most sequels. It is a rare, brilliant sequel that will leave you on the edge of your seat for two amazing hours. With brilliant cinematography, great acting, an interesting plot, a great antagonist and wonderful music, this is my favorite movie of all time along with the first movie. I will always feel proud to have this movie in my DVD collection."
"Schnayblay","6","0","2","26 June 2012"," Everything That Worked in it's Predecessor is Thrown Out and Made More Generic
","I was really excited to see ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"". I highly enjoyed the first film, and with Guy Ritchie returning to direct, and the addition of Jared Harris playing Professor James Moriarty joining the stellar cast, I had little doubt that 'Game of Shadows' would blow me away as much as the first film had. And then the trailer came out, and the doubt started to form. Robert Downey Jr. creepily cross dressing, giant gun fights, and recycled jokes made me worriful that the movie may fall where the first film excelled. Sadly, I was right.<br/><br/>Watson has now moved out of 221B Baker Street, and Sherlock has become obsessed with linking evidence to the infinite web of crimes Moriarty is behind. Now, when a single clue reveals itself to Holmes, he embarks on a determined endeavour to take down his arch-nemesis once and for all. It's hard to explain the plot because some of the main plot points happen for no reason, so it's difficult to even write a proper synopsis. Seriously, things happen at random in this movie. Like within the first 5 minutes the most enraging, lame, and downright stupidest move the writers made happens for almost no reason.<br/><br/>All main cast members return from the first film. Robert Downey Jr. is back as Sherlock Holmes, and as before, he's great. He is completely into this role and you believe him. What is really great in this movie is Sherlock vs. Moriarty, and this is really where Robert Downey Jr.'s acting in this movie flourishes. He gets really confident and serious, and you're just thinking ""it's going down"".<br/><br/>Jude Law is perfect as Watson. I think I prefer Jude Law's Watson to Martin Freeman's Watson. But the two adaptations are set in different time periods, so I think Jude Law is the perfect Watson for the 1800's, and Martin Freeman is the perfect Watson for the 21'st Century. But Jude Law's Watson is perfect with the smart-ass remarks. He is totally Sherlock's backup and he hates it, but he accepts that and he deals with it, and it makes for some great comedy.<br/><br/>Jared Harris is good as Moriarty. His first appearance on the screen, you know that he is in control. He's very calm, very smart, and menacing. The only thing I wish had been different about him is the actor. While Jared Harris is pretty good, I really wanted someone younger than or as old as Sherlock. That would be a great parallel for Holmes to deal with, but instead he's like sixty years old. This really sucks because I loved the Moriarty in the first ""Sherlock Holmes"". He was young, skinny, very threatening, and had this seriously scary voice. But now he's just this normal, heavy-set, old guy.<br/><br/>The fights in this movie suck. You may remember in the first ""Sherlock Holmes"", a lot of the fighting was hand to hand, and I loved that aspect. In this movie, we get like two fisticuff scenes and then the rest is gunplay. I hated that; don't make the action just generic slow motion bullet fests. That's my main gripe with this movie is it feels like someone wrote an 18th Century action film and just added in Sherlock Holmes at the last minute. I know that's not what happened, but that's what it feels like.<br/><br/>The major thing that sucks about the Guy Ritchie movies is that after watching BBC's ""Sherlock"" series, everything else seems second place. Everything that is done in the Guy Ritchie films, the BBC series does better, which makes enjoying the Ritchie films difficult because you're constantly comparing to something much better.<br/><br/>I will personally not be buying this movie. I'd only get this movie if it was like a $5 movie in the bargain bin. I heard a lot of other people say they liked it, so I'm not saying everyone will hate it, but I did. And isn't that the point of a review, to state your opinion? So I did not like ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"", but you might so at least rent it or borrow it off a buddy. Who knows how you'll feel?"

","That's where we are at with this movie, Rathbone, Brett, are the Holmes of old. Great actors, but now we have another strong group, in a well crafted flick. It was entertaining throughout, which made up for the little glitches. I read Doyle as a child, everything in the library; before Los Angeles got over 6-7 TV channels. I also enjoyed the great Rathbone flicks and all of the later productions, which were lacking until Brett on PBS. The first flick was choppy, but it was the fun in spots. They put in work and made this one a sweet ride. They even tied in the most famous scene of all times from the old classics. What I liked most is how they highlighted the social quirks, of Sherlock and MyCroft alike. This movie was the rebirth of Holmes. Great job. Who is the best Holmes?"

"amahlanand","9","0","1","9 May 2012"," ""He played the game for the game's own sake""
","'He played the game for the game's own sake' would be a perfect description of Robert Downey Jr's take on Sherlock Holmes. He's matter of factly slick, inadvertently cool and cheekily eccentric not to mention a king of one liners. He returns to deliver superbly in this sequel to Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' in an enthralling cat and mouse game between prodigies involving a clash between him and Sherlock Holmes' classical, scheming nemesis, Professor James Moriarty played by Jared Harris. <br/><br/>Ritchie has directed a complementary film where everything and everyone seems to complement everything and everyone else whether the acting, dialogue, score or the sets. The plot is well crafted if not masterful but undoubtedly vastly entertaining. The usage of flashback storytelling, as seen in the prequel to this film, gives many enigmas in the movie a sense of finality; you can't help but be in awe of the manner of storytelling presented to you not to mention the filming style through which the narrative is presented. Don't be put off by the slow, almost uneventful start, it is certainly made worth your while very quickly. Occasionally, it can be hard to keep up, such is the pace with which events transpire, it does lose you at junctures but fear not, only temporarily. <br/><br/>This light hearted iteration of a mystery thriller is absorbing and compelling, much like its predecessor and we have to attribute it to the director and the acting talent in the film that the light hearted tone hasn't become slapstick as much as a new spin on the mystery and intrigue associated with Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. may yet again have been the star of the show but it's the chemistry between his Sherlock and Jude Law's Watson that really shines. Their dialogue interchanged is so fluid and natural not to mention damned entertaining. <br/><br/>Everyone's holding out for the climax though and it probably wasn't as fantastically revealing and ingenious as the first movie, but was well built up nonetheless. It's perhaps not how you envisaged it and in all likeliness, not how you wanted it to be either, or maybe it was"

"abigtuna","6","0","1","3 May 2012"," Since when did Sherlock need cheap gags?
","To start off, let me just say that Director Guy Ritchie's special effects capture the viewer. The images of artillery shells slicing through trees in slow motion are, admittedly, quite cool. But once you get past those visuals, the story quickly wears thin.<br/><br/>Despite the spectacular special effects, A Game of Shadows' plot lacked. Watching Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law take on the world reminded me of Shia LaBeauf dodging hulking robots in the last Transformers movie. At the end of the day it doesn't really make much difference who the star is. Simply put, it is difficult to care much about either character when they inhabit such nonsensical, CGI-inflated tales.<br/><br/>Speaking of nonsense, allow me to talk about the naked man scene. For no apparent reason at all, a pudgy, middle-aged man comes out to greet his young, just-married female house guest one morning while wearing nothing. Did the scene get a laugh? Sure. Unexpected nudity often stirs the viewer to laugh; however, scenes such as this one reveal just how far one must stoop for a laugh. Additionally, I'm compelled to question why was it necessity to add the scene where Holmes and Watson share a sleeper car while the former is dressed in drag. This is the great Sherlock Holmes, remember. Did Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever add this little cinematic gem into one of his books? Absolutely not. I understand that Sherlock is eccentric, but Ritchie pushed the envelop here. <br/><br/>Equally squirmy, in a rather different way, is Moriarty skewering Holmes with a giant hook, then watching in catlike amusement as our ageless hero contorts and dangles, screaming. The extreme brutality of this scene left me wondering: Moriarty's a really bad guy and all, but was this scene really necessary? After all, Moriarty killed Sherlock Holmes' sweetheart without batting an eye, and he's plotting to throw the whole world into a war simply for self-profit. Do we need such a graphic scene to further this evil image? I don't believe so.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being harder on this sequel than I need to be. Sherlock Holmes 2 is a great jolt of special effects, paired with good character chemistry. It doesn't pretend to be the perfect plot. Still, even with the explosion-filled, theatrical thrills of A Game of Shadows, we need to be asking a couple of questions: What are we gaining from watching this movie? What kind of people do we want to be when we're done watching? That is not to say that we cannot entertain ourselves. A movie can invite us to take leave of our various cares for a time and transport us somewhere magical, inspirational, and/or sentimental. The result often can renew our sense of vigor, re-commit our love the ones we hold dear, or even help us determine to tackle any problem we may encounter.<br/><br/>But at the end of Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows, I just felt numb."

I just thought that the villain was kind of lame, I mean we knew who he was, and it seemed that he was not smart enough for Holmes. This film fixes that, it is way more interesting this time to see Holmes try to outwit him, because Professor Moriarty is pretty much Holmes equal.<br/><br/>Everything that I liked in the first Sherlock Holmes movie is present here. The best part being the chemistry between Holmes and Watson, Downey Jr. and Law must have known each other all there lives, because they have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen in a film. The action scenes are fun, although one of my problems is that director Guy Richie uses way too many slow motion shots, and shows way too much. However the comedy almost never misses, this is one of the funniest movies I saw from last year. Robert Downey Jr. steals the show, he is now one of my favorite actors, and the Sherlock Holmes character is one of my favorite movie characters. The film always keeps you guessing as to how Holmes will escape, and when it ends, I had a huge grin on my face because of how brilliant it was.<br/><br/>Like I said, the action scenes can be annoyng at times and there are a few boring parts, and Watson's wife seemed entirely pointless and just slowed the movie down, but I enjoyed this film, and I await a third movie."

Bigger, but not quite better than the first film, A Game of Shadows features everything I liked and disliked about feature one, and it's about as good a December blockbuster as you can get.<br/><br/>Like the first film, the film is light on plot, occasionally uneven, and a tad more confusing if you're not paying full attention. However, Ritchie continues to show what a great fit his stylistics are for this movie, and the action, which is perfectly paced, staged, and choreographed, continues to thrill and astonish. The friendship between Holmes and Watson continues to set the screen ablaze, but begins to play things up more. Producer Joel Silver once said that Downey and Law's chemistry had this ""Butch and Sundance"" quality to it, and he was right. Their chemistry is the main attraction, absolutely electrifying, surprisingly emotional, and often quite funny, occasionally hysterically so.<br/><br/>Though, with the exception of the film's villain, the supporting cast isn't quite as strong. Jared Harris couldn't have been anymore brilliantly cast as Professor Moriarty, but Sim, the film's leading lady, isn't very much of an improvement over Irene Adler, even if Noomi Rapace has a bit more to chew on than Rachel McAdams did. Still, the film is beautifully designed. Sarah Greenwood's stylish production design is gorgeous, Phillippe Rousselot's cinematography is ever so flowing, the costumes are beautifully realized by Jenny Beavan (who, in my opinion, provided the best costumes of any film in 2009 for the first Sherlock Holmes), and Hans Zimmer raises the pulse and fun with his exciting musical score.<br/><br/>Prognosis: A light, refreshing piece of popcorn entertainment. Probably the most fun I've had with any 2011 movie. When even a simple game of chess is enough to put you on the edge, you know you're in for a good time.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","I did not have high hopes for this movie. Knowing that the previous film was an average B movie, no more is expected from this flick.<br/><br/>This whole movie is packed with idiotic comic relief and totally improbable action sequences. And this Sherlock character, my God is he ever annoying! He cannot open his garbage mouth without saying a stupid joke or mock his partner, even in a totally inappropriate situation where their life is hanging in the balance.<br/><br/>This movie is full of clichés and cheese that I found myself at many times looking at my watch and wondering when this movie would end, and I also took a brief 2 minutes nap! Yup.<br/><br/>Anyways, I won't elaborate more on this film. All you need to know is that it's a ridiculous and exaggerated action-comedy. But if you are the kind to enjoy an action packed film with every line coming out of the actors' mouth is a joke, then this movie is for you! If you however enjoy a smart and coherent movie, this film will bore you. Quite honestly, the only reason I went to see this film was to see The Dark Knight Rises' trailer in theatre, well at least that was worth my while.<br/><br/>Anyhow, this film is not total crap, though. I give it a 6/10. A 7,7/10 rating as of today is really beyond me. At most this movie should have a 7/10 at best....if only it wasn't plagued with comic relief."

","Well it wasn't really a shocker that the fabulous Mr. Downey Jr. Has ceased to amaze us in his return of Holmes. Personally, I think this one outshines the first. Even though the first one was fantastic, this one just blew me away. It was full of suspense, mystery, and action that it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. When you would think that it would come to the end, it just kept going. It was one of those movies that had me disappointed when the credits rolled in. It defiantly left me hungry for more. It also had its perfect amount of humor. With Holmes sass filled attitude and Watsons series but calm wits, this dynamic duo did not fail to make the audience laugh. I also enjoyed the new characters that were brought it. Jared Harris did an excellent job of portraying the spine chilling doctor villain. And sadly with the mysterious death of Rachel McAdams that Disappointed us all, there was a new heroine that came into the picture. Noomi Rapace, who played the beautiful and sneaky Madam Sim, was a very interesting newcomer. It was definitely a different mix with the two heroes, but her role Was a key to the mystery and She fit In just right with the rest of the cast. I've seen the movie three times since it was released in December and I cannot wait till its out on DVD. If you have not seen it yet, I would very much recommend this on your list the next time you are looking for something to do on a Friday evening."

","I could give a whole account of this movie by simply stating what happens and what it is about. However, i believe that you can basically glean the plot of this movie from previous summaries and trailers. My job in this review is to simply tell you MY whole opinion on this movie. First let me start off by saying that Sherlock Holmes : A Web Of Shadows was the best movie i have seen for the year. With amazing slow motion effects, fast paced and intelligent action, a spellbinding plot, perfect acting, gut-busting comedy, and a fitting setting, This movie a most definitely a MUST WATCH! If you liked the first one (as did i) you may wonder how could #2 best such a compelling start. I must admit that at first even i was a bit skeptical of this movie due to the fact that most sequels never live up to the first one's glory. But surprisingly ""A Web Of Shadows"" did and in my opinion bested the first one! In Conclusion, Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job on this movie in my opinion and i definitely nominate this movie for an Oscar. Fast paced, Intelligent. Mind boggling and hilarious!"

","After much speculation and expectation, one has to say Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr have together pulled it off once again with a crunchy screenplay and acting with at most ease. With Jude Law and Noomi Rapace bringing justice to their characters, Jared Harris proved to be the perfect foe for a super hero with no super powers. Screenplay was well written with enough wit; adding to the twists and turns unfolding one after the other. Action sequences even though are not breath taking, are loud enough to keep audience glued to their seats and a special mention for two the sequences, One when Holmes salvages Mr and Mrs. Watson and the other when Holmes and Watson run for their lives. <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie, deserves all the accolades not just for being the captain of the ship but also for being smart enough to serve all the desserts cold to the audiences. As a screenplay writer Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney have saved the best for the melodrama, Game of Shadows has a stellar last 10 minutes which will not just grab all your attention but will make you forget all the logical flaws you noted or tried to note down during the previous 119 minutes. Robert Downey Jr as cool as ever; with Jude Law trying to match him frame by frame; with Noomi Raplace providing enough support to both of them; with Jared Harris proves to be their perfect demon, Game of shadows proved to be the one to watch out for.<br/><br/>1 (Guy Ritchie) + 1 (Robert Downey Jr) + 1 (Jude Law) + 1 (Jared Harris) + 1 (Screenplay) + 1 (Wit and Fun) + 1 (Gladstone) + 1 (BGM) + 1 (Holmes - Moriarty Chess play) = 9/10"

","t has some clichés and cheap turns, and I won't even speak of the ending - but it's still a well crafted action movie. I have quite the taste for Guy Ritchie, and even though he revels in excessive slow motion it's impressive at the same time as it's just a bit too much.<br/><br/>Robert Downey jr. seems to have found a role he really loves playing and he's a perfect fit. The role allows him to bolter in absurdities, he's an absolute delight to watch throughout and he's in no way afraid to go the extra mile. Jude Law is also quite fitting, and seeing how I got used to him in the first movie I'm no longer looking for Nigel Bruce whenever someone calls out for ""Dr. Watson"".<br/><br/>On the other side of the scale Noomi Rapace has next to no presence, nor has the main villain Professor Moriarty. Two dull and easily forgettable roles, in Noomi's case it's OK, has she is hardly needed, but I would have wished for a more compelling villain.<br/><br/>It takes far more time for character development than expected, and unlike many of it's kin it does relay on a script rather than constant action and explosions. Though the Downey jr. reincarnation of Holmes is clearly more of an action hero, and the mystery has been replaced with saving the world(at least in a sense) the movie does know it's place and knows not to throw away great character dynamics - and though the action scenes are excessive and extravagant beyond belief it does set a more adventure-esque mood not too unlike those of previous Sherlock Holmes interpretations.<br/><br/>The movie contains a lot of quality humor, often playing on the semi-homoerotic undertones we are so familiar with in regard to Sherlock Holmes. Sometimes it's just too hard to buy into it all, and as stated some of it is just too much - but it's a constant riot and Domney really keeps it together. Certainly met my expectations, if not exceeding them."

"KineticSeoul","7","0","1","14 January 2012"," It's about the same amount of enjoyment as the first
","From the people I spoke with that saw this movie. Some liked this sequel better than the first one and others thought the first one was better. I am in between cause there was some aspects I liked about the first one more than this sequel but there are aspects to this one that I liked more than the first one. I enjoyed the constant duel between Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty where they are constantly trying to one up each other. It would have been far more interesting if it showed more of Moriarty's schemes and more about his characteristics. For Holmes's equal he didn't stand out all that much. But some of the best scenes are when Holmes's and Moriarty are on screen at the same time, even there conversations are fun because of the intellectual way they try to one up each other. Anyways Jared Harris who played Moriarty didn't stand out as much as I would have wanted him to be. As for Robert Downey Jr. he is good but sometimes he tries to make Holmes's a bit too kooky. I don't know if he is trying to copy Jack Sparrow but his character threw me off a bit at times and not in a good way either. So yeah I liked how the villain at least had more of a presence this time compared to the first one and felt more ominous. And I also liked the action sequences, they didn't seem all forced and was entertaining to watch because it was well choreographed and cool. Unfortunately the movie just seemed a bit messy at times and all over the place without it being fluid. If the movie flowed a bit better it would have been more engrossing, I can see how they wanted the movie to be fast paced but it just didn't work. As for the plot it's alright, but since it's a Sherlock Holmes movie it would have been better if it has more intellectual and well crafted detective work gone in. But the movie just seemed more convoluted than it should have been despite the simple story when it comes down to it. Overall it's about the same level of enjoyment as the first.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

"caroline_girl","10","0","1","12 January 2012"," Our Review for SH
","Set in London in the 19th 20th century, Sherlock Holmes retells the story of the famous fictional detective. I think the main point of the story is quite simple, the good guys are trying to stop the bad guys from causing a European War. I like how the writer wrote the story, it's intense and also funny, and entertaining at the same time. The story involve 3 main characters, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and Prof. Moriarty.<br/><br/>The characteristics of the characters are very unique. First of all, let's talk about Sherlock Holmes. Holmes is a lazy crazy smart guy, but he has a brilliant mind, a professional detective. Dr. Watson, he is Holmes' best friend who is really kind, nice, handsome, and smart. The bad guy named Prof. Moriarty, he's a very smart guy but unfortunately his personality is really bad.<br/><br/>What I like the most about the movie is the slow motion part in the forest. When the enemies were shooting and Holmes and his friends just kept running it's really cool. It made me go 'Wow', 'Cool' sort of things! The movie's sets were also convincing, London, the forest, the castle at the Swiss Mountain, German, and everything were making me felt like I'm in Holmes' time. I have no complaint about the sets.<br/><br/>I'm satisfied with the performance of the actors. They're all acting really natural and it's so real and so refreshing to our mind. You know, sometimes the movie is funny even when they're in a serious condition. Well, that's what I like about it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Sherlock Holmes-Games of Shadow, is better than Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol which is out at the same time. This movie is much more interesting, unpredictable,and makes you want to watch it over and over again. The moral value from the movie is to keep yourself aware of people around you, do not easily panic, and stay cool when facing problems."
"kluseba","7","0","1","8 January 2012"," Highly entertaining but less innovating than the first feature
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows is an enjoyable follow-up of the first movie with the same line-up and includes everything fans and critics likes about the first feature: the camera work, the images and the exotic locations are breathtaking, the visual special effects and action scenes are also mind-blowing, the soundtrack is once again very intense, the movie contains a lot of humour and slapstick scenes and the flick finally features a solid acting that is rated up by some new actors like the Swedish shooting star Noomie Rapace. You will get very well entertained for almost two hours in this ride of action, humour and tension.<br/><br/>The reason why this movie though can't keep up with the first part is that its story is less intriguing, less surprising and simply less twisted. Many elements of this movie are quite predictable and stereotypical for this kind of genre while the first part had several well thought twists. Some scenes of the movie are simply too exaggerated like the escape scenes in Germany and the final showdown in Switzerland. This is effect loaded Hollywood popcorn cinema as we see it every day and the talent of many great actors and some great pieces of literature are somewhat wasted in here.<br/><br/>Another important problem is that the actions and goals of the main villain remain somewhat superficial. In general, the different new characters should have been more developed. The actors do their very best to give the somewhat ordinary characters a unique soul but sometimes they struggle a little bit and their talent gets a little bit wasted in this movie.<br/><br/>The script should have been more detailed and precise and the movie could have needed a healthy dose of around ten minutes of additional running time to portray us the uprising and the first evil actions of the main villain and his first acts of terrorism in the beginning. On the other side, the ending on the castle in Switzerland could have been more detailed and one could have shown us what happened to the different characters after the final showdown.<br/><br/>Even though these important flaws, the movie is saved by all the positive elements mentioned in the beginning of my review and the ending creates some high hopes for a possible third part. I hope that a possible third feature might unite the amazing script of the first part with the solid acting of the second part with more impressive sound and image effects to create a nearly perfect flick honouring one of the most fascinating characters in the history of literature where the traditional meets the modern."

","This isn't a review. It's a handful of thoughts.<br/><br/>LITERARY HOLMES <br/><br/>Ritchie, Mulroney and Mulroney have conceived of a fitting tribute to the literary Holmes.<br/><br/>Some accuse Downey Jr. of playing the fool in these pictures, of not bowing down to that dusty archetype we learned by watching Jeremy Brett et al.<br/><br/>But Downey Jr.'s comedy makes his gravity more gripping.<br/><br/>Literary Holmes IS funny. He DOES make use of unseemly disguises. He ACTS like a manic-depressive, not like the highly-functioning sociopath of the current BBC series.<br/><br/>And when he addresses Moriarty, we see the joker's mask drop to reveal the dignity of someone who would design his own destruction to ensure that of an evil adversary. <br/><br/>ARCHETYPES OF HOLMES <br/><br/>Action heroes reflect archetypes, and this Holmes brings home a bundle of them.<br/><br/>--- Natural man, who drinks, eats and smokes with gusto.<br/><br/>--- Action man, who excels at boxing, baritsu and single-stick.<br/><br/>--- Intellectual man, who 'sees everything.' <br/><br/>--- And spiritual man, who risks his life to save his friends and the world.<br/><br/>ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU, WATSON <br/><br/>The bond between Watson and Holmes is cinematic glue. Good-natured bickering is fun to witness on screen and people who don't perceive 'chemistry' between the actors are missing what's there.<br/><br/>OVERDONE EFFECTS? IMPOSSIBLE! <br/><br/>(Mission Impossible, that is.) Sherlock Holmes gives us action mixed with effects. It also gives us thought mixed with effects. Moments--within moments--are telescoped through time to give us a giddy sense of omniscience.<br/><br/>Action sequences using effects are burnished blue, the sound comes in booming details, and each one contains a moment or two of humour.<br/><br/>(""Little Hansel"" is a lot funnier than ""Big Bertha,"" its real-life model, probably. Holmes whipping off his dress to reveal the dangling set of a grenade device is funny. The skip-and-whistle of Moriarty's four thugs gives us a laugh, a breath, in the first fight sequence.)<br/><br/>Game of Shadows offers action in discrete doses, each moment is produced for clarity.<br/><br/>Contrast these sequences to those in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>A sandstorm. Hm. A car chase in a sandstorm. That's new. But so what? Rappelling off a sky-scraper. Um. How long is this going to go on? I'd sleep if it wasn't so loud.<br/><br/>VICTORIAN ENGLAND: TRAINS AND TELEGRAMS, STEAMSHIPS AND CIGARS <br/><br/>Whoops! Some of the technology used in the film was still a few years off in 1891. Oh well.<br/><br/>Forgivable.<br/><br/>But it hints to the only problem with A Game of Shadows: The film gets slightly ahead of itself and might inspire the 3rd installment to balloon into something of a cartoon, just to 'top' #2.<br/><br/>The scope, from London to Paris to Germany to Switzerland, was a treat.<br/><br/>The stakes, personal and societal, were high.<br/><br/>The amount of machine-gun-play was considerable.<br/><br/>How on Earth will the writer top that without toppling what's been built up? <br/><br/>DEEPLY SATISFYING <br/><br/>Did I mention I saw this film five times? :-)"

The character of Sherlock in the book, suits when you are reading the book. Putting the same serious character out in the movie would have been a disaster. The character of Sherlock, in my opinion, is much more fun for movie-audience. <br/><br/>Alright, looks like this is what the movie makers have done: They have taken character of Sherlock from the book and tried to ponder what could make his character more appealing to movie-audience? ""Let's add humour to the duo of Sherlock and Watson"", ""Let's add some good action to the movie"", ""Let's make a spicy story"".. Sherlock in the movie is an overexcited person who enjoys solving mysteries and enjoys it to an extent that he forgets everything else. This involvement of Sherlock's mind in solving mysteries gives him special power to figure out things and predict precisely what could have happened in a ""crime scene"". Although there will be some parts where you would wonder how could Sherlock have predicted that? <br/><br/>The story is not too complicated, what I found to be more complicated was the English Accent. It always seems like the English folks keep adding more and more complicated words in sentences... big show-off! Thanks to the subtitles I didn't miss much of the story. Unlike most of the regular stories that involves solving mystery, in this movie you would know from the beginning who the villain is. What remains mysterious in the movie is how the villain tries to accomplish his goals. Sherlock and Watson are trying to stop the villain from achieving his goals and hence prevent the next world war.<br/><br/>My suggestion: This movie is fun to watch with family.

RDJ portrays a very convincing Sherlock Holmes(of course) as in the first movie, I can guarantee that you will laugh a lot on this one, Jude law is very good as Dr. Watson, but I have to say that I am a little disappointed with the fact that the role of Rachel McAdams was short, even tough people should be pleased with Noomi Rapace filling in for her. Jarred Harris makes a great villain in this one, as the main bad guy in the Sherlock Holmes Universe, I say he proves a real challenge for Holmes, being more dangerous and intelligent than Mark Stron's Lord Blackwood, but a little too diplomatic at times. The special effects are great as in the first movie, with excellent slow-motion action scenes and there are also a few of those mind images from Holmes before he starts kicking some a**!

The effects were pretty good and the dialogues were perfect for the scenes. Stephen Fry's portrayal of Mycroft was better than perfect - it exceeded even the Mycroft from Arthur Conan Doyle's books!<br/><br/>The only disappointment was the handling of Irene Adler... she could have been given more of a role.

","I was a huge fan of the first and went in with high hopes for the second. I was not disappointed. As a fan I might add. The big sets are still here, the frenetic chases through the streets, Holmes trade mark pre-fight slow mo sequences and a forest chase that is sure to delight the action hungry audiences.<br/><br/>Personally, I absolutely love the new take on Sherlock, dismissing the more traditional Sherlock was for some, a huge disappointment. In fact, I'm more than well aware of the more die hard Sherlock fans who were not happy to see a masculine Holmes barreling his way through dozens of thugs, swinging his fists and kicking his way through doors.<br/><br/>Some may also be disappointed by the fact the ""mystery"" didn't really tickle the intellect. I would agree as well. That I do think the detective side of Sherlock didn't really shine. Sure, Sherlocks brilliance was shown every so often, but not in the novel way we would like to see in a brilliant detective. The mental battle between Moriarty and Holmes was great, but could've been better. Maybe given some space to breath in between all the machine guns and explosions.<br/><br/>The same cast is there, and the witty banter between Holmes and Watson will often bring a laugh or two. The dialogue still as entertaining as the first. The female plays a more slightly up front role in the film, but it is still a film for the fellas. Needless to say though, Noomi Rapace's role does not disappoint but nor is it stellar. Moriarty is played by Jared Harris who died a fine job in depicting a timeless villain.<br/><br/>Really, all you really want to know if it's worth seeing right? Yes. Yes it is. It's an action film. A fun film. Don't go in for paradigm shifts or mind boggling puzzles, but enjoy the visual roller coaster Guy Ritchie has created for us. There are some wonderful camera shots and angles he employs that are sure to delight. Some of the older or more ""stiff upper lipped"" movie goers may be a little disorientated by them however. The phantom shots are great, Guy has a bit of a love for these sequences and they are shot well, giving a wonderful new pace to the action.<br/><br/>What you get one you shell out the money for your ticket is a wild romp in the park with Sherlock. Brilliant action sequences and well played characters. Sherlocks brilliance is somewhat overshadowed by the action, but the film still stands as a fun, fast paced movie which should delight many viewers at almost any age."

This is even better.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as the famous detective and his sidekick Dr. Watson, as they try to take down their fiercest enemy, Moriarty.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. The action scenes were great, and the story was great as well. The slow motion sequences were always put to good use, but there was one sequence, in which they are running through the woods, in which it worked the best. Guy Ritchie proves that he is still the guy to direct these films.<br/><br/>However, what makes this film great is the actors and their characters. Watching Downey Jr. and Law interact with each other was always amusing, but another aspect that made this film great was Sherlock's interactions with Moriarty. Moriarty is just as smart and as cunning as Holmes is, so while this proves a great challenge for our famed detective, it is always intriguing to see them interact with each other. For this reason, it is always fun to see who comes out in the end. And speaking of the end, I won't mention what it is, but the last scene is so strange and so well done that it is without a doubt the best scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this film. This is unlike any Holmes that we've ever seen (other than the first film). He is old London's Jack Sparrow, and therefore, he is such fun to watch. A 9/10 for me."

","Wait, wait, wait, I think it's one of those rare cases where the continuation of the original better. In defense of the painting in 2009 I can only say that it was the first and presented to the audience modernized Sherlock Holmes. What we will show today? Watson married, Professor Moriarty wants to unleash the First World War, and Holmes is on a diet of coffee, tobacco and coca leaves.<br/><br/>Scenario - a great chess game between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty. But right on red. As you must remember, a professor in the first part of a system of wireless detonators stolen and used it in this part, rather obviously did not apply, you can invent things. In the ""Game of Shadows"" Dr. Evil, he who tries to knock their heads against the two powers, I will not name names, but I will say that one country spoke French, and the other in German. It would seem, why should he? Yes, just part-time professor and another ""Lord of War."" A Sherlock acts as a catch-up - to calculate the great professor of mathematics - mission impossible.<br/><br/>The visual component - Guy Ritchie, getting the budget by about a third more than in the first part, so turned around that ... in short it must be seen. The scene in the woods, in my opinion, generally the most beautiful of those I've seen this year. Slo-mo, explosions, scattering trees, the big guns for the last time so I cut off the brain, only a third of ""Transformers."" Winter blockbuster, but with a firm sense of humor and a director Ritchie. At least a gypsy camp ...<br/><br/>The actor - ... (hello, ""Snatch"") and wait for what is now the scene Brad Pitt is out, and goes ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" Numi Rapas. No, this is not a film about which you're thinking. The charming young fortune-teller seeking his brother, who is the key to a great mystery of Dr. Ha ... Holmes. Vasily Livanov before the release of the first part said: ""All the bad guys!"" When he was invited as a consultant in Hollywood. Later, Robert Downey Jr.. refuted this statement, creating a distinct character. The second part of the missing spark in his eyes, but the game is also good. You can not say about Jude Law - replays. Of course, Guy Ritchie puts everything in such a way that at first glance it is not noticeable, distracted by the beauty, the passions, special effects, but for now, promatyvaya again, these scenes in your head, you notice - something was not right.<br/><br/>Finale - ""bomb disposal"" - all, the audience leaned forward. The atmosphere was tense to the limit, the pawn on e4, elephant elephant beats, the Shah, who watched ""Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson: Mortal Combat"" or read a book, understand what it's all over, I'd add that touched to tears, but at 2014 has already announced the third part of Robert Downey Jr. adventure. So what? This is not the end?"

","The year is 1891. There have been several bombings of large cities in Europe, and though he can't be linked to it, Moriarty may be behind it. But what's the endgame? Watson is getting married(and nobody thinks that's going smoothly, with his compatriot around), and with their relationship continuing to be like an old marriage(or a bromance), Holmes feels and behaves like an abandoned child. The latter matches wits with his new nemesis, and it's brilliant. In the first one, our titular lead is set up as a magnificent genius(and this one references it, with surprises), and in this, he has more trouble. The climax is phenomenal because of this. James is perfectly cast, as is Mycroft, the elder brother of our hero, Stephen Fry(his rapport with his sibling is priceless). The hilarious British comedy returns, with plays on words, crisp dialog and quirky, memorable characters. Rapace, the woman formerly known as Lisbeth Salander(until Rooney Mara's performance was witnessed by man), does a great job as the intriguing gyspy(and we meet her ""people"", and they're pretty likable and fairly treated) fortune teller who provides an opening into the case. McAdams disappears almost immediately from this. This remains an action adventure suspense mystery, and it keeps to a really fast pace. You get to breathe with the gorgeous establishing shots of Paris and Switzerland and take in all the rich details, writing and exposition. This doesn't fill you in on the original, and it is best to view these in order. There is again technology on the verge of what was possible at the time. This is a fun ride that requires paying attention and several views might benefit you. There is some disturbing, violent(mostly bloodless) content in this. I recommend this to any fan of the first and of the people involved in its creation. 8/10"
"dubricus","9","0","1","20 December 2011"," An avid Sherlockian LIKES it
","I think I've collected every radio, every film version of Holmes that there is... Wotner, Ronald Howard, even Stewart Granger's TV movie.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was less than satisfied with the first film. I found Downey's performance somewhat off-putting for the same reason that I found Jeremy Brett's earlier episodes a little challenging - too frenetic. I also found the style difficult. It took getting accustomed to the flashbacks and the ""thought"" segments... and rapid-fire video work.<br/><br/>The first film also had an implausible ending. However, this film, despite some faux-pas and inconsistencies, which I feel were done knowingly... to serve a film that was sort of ""in-it-for-the-fun"" rather than sticking to the canon or to history. It's good melodrama... in the way that the extreme Victorian stage melodramas could be so over-the-top as to be actually good fun.<br/><br/>Therefore, I can overlook things that were ahead of 1891. I must admit that the look of the period was right on. The ladies dresses were spot on for ca 1890, rather than a more 1900 look, which is a very easy error.<br/><br/>I'm also willing to allow Downey the deviation from Canon. Watson wrote in the Canon that Holmes was fastidious in his appearance, and cat-like.... tho' Holmes was not neat otherwise. Downey plays him consistently Bohemian. There is leeway... Doyle never really allowed us to see that ""other"" side of Holmes' life... that mysterious world of opium dens, Bow Street Runners, going undercover, disguises, boxing, fencing, etc. It is this secret side to Holmes' life that recent versions have made hay from.<br/><br/>What I actually really liked about this one was the foreshadowing of WW1... the munitions firms, anarchists, revolutionaries, sabre rattling. All of that was happening in the 1890s, but Queen Victoria and then Edward VII, kept the lid on by the fact that they were the senior members of a vast European Royal Family. The war waited until 4 years after Edward's death in 1910.<br/><br/>Moriarity's machinations were in keeping with the Canon.... and with real rumors that were circulating at the time... that the munitions barons, etc were exacerbating problems and, in fact, promoting war.<br/><br/>I find it an interesting pairing that ""War Horse"" was released at the same time... Despite their extreme differences... I would strongly urge people to see both films... within days of each other.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows lays a not too unreal groundwork, while War Horse will show the absolute futility of it all... the decimating of a generation of young men.... For what? All that WW1 really did was sell armaments and munitions.. and lay the groundwork for WW2, which laid the groundwork for the EuroZone... and today's problems.<br/><br/>The linkages in Sherlock's extreme melodramatic fiction to the realistic War Horse... to our present problems is somewhat intriguing."
"ajs-10","8","0","2","28 December 2011"," The best bromance on the big screen is back again with avengeance
","Having watched and enjoyed the previous Guy Richie Sherlock Holmes film at about the same time last year, it was nice to re-acquaint myself with the franchise on its second instalment. All the elements that made the first film great are back again, more so in some cases, and it was great to see that Richie still hasn't lost his eye for the visuals. I will give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.<br/><br/>Countries in Europe are being brought to the brink of war due to a series of bombings that appear to be being perpetrated by extremists. The truth is, they are all the work of one man, Professor James Moriarty. It is clear that there is only one person who has the capability to stop him; Sherlock Holmes. Of course he drags Dr. Watson into it and manages to ruin his stag night in the process. The damsel in distress this time comes in the form of a gypsy fortune teller, Madam Simza Heron, whose brother has been incorporated into Moriarty's plan. Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes also gets involved and that makes for some interesting times. The question is, can Holmes and Watson foil Moriarty's plans? Well, as you can probably guess, those Spoiler Police with their fiendish disguises may well be in the room at this very moment, so I must be very careful not to say too much (again).<br/><br/>As we've come to expect, this film looks great, Guy Richie really knows his craft and all the tricks are in evidence here. Some really superb 'bullet time' effects and some great fight scenes are fast becoming Richie's hallmark. A great soundtrack from Hans Zimmer also backs up the visuals perfectly. All the performances were great, in particular; Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as Dr, John Watson, both did a great job reprising the bromance that was so successful in the first film. Also worthy of note were; Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza Heron, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty, Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Paul Anderson as Colonel Sebastian Moran, Kelly Reilly as Mary Watson and Geraldine James as Mrs. Hudson.<br/><br/>Lots of action, a fair smattering of comedy and a thrilling plot go together to make up this film. Most of it works pretty well, however there is a bit of a weak link and that is the part of the story involving the character played by the, woefully underused, Noomi Rapace. I thought it was a little weak and didn't quite have enough believability (for me). Having said that, the rest of the film was very thrilling and entertaining throughout with a great ending! Over all, I did enjoy this film a lot more than I thought I would at the beginning and so I'm very pleased to deem it Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.7/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 19,468 votes when this review was written).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 59/100 (based on 173 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 85/100 (based on 48,913 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."
"SylvesterFox007","9","0","3","28 December 2011"," A Step Down from Perfection
","I spent my childhood watching old Sherlock Holmes movies with my dad and trying to convince the other kids on the playground to pretend to be Dr. Watson so I could play Sherlock. Needless to say, when Guy Ritchie attempted to re-brand Holmes and Watson as action heroes in 2009, a move that caused much gnashing of teeth from others, I went into the theater with high expectations. They were exceeded. I loved everything about that movie, every performance, every shot, every line of dialogue, and every note of Hans Zimmer's score. It was perfect.<br/><br/>The sequel, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is a pretty good movie, but it can't beat perfection.<br/><br/>What I feared would be missing going in, and what indeed was missing, was the sense of the unknown. Would Sherlock Holmes work as an action movie? It did, and still kind of does, and still was surprisingly faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's source material. How would Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law do as Holmes and Watson? They were, and still are, the freshest take on the characters since Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. How would Guy Ritchie do helming a big-budget blockbuster? The style from his gritty crime films translated well into the epic scale, though in the sequel there's more style than substance. <br/><br/>But the most crucial surprises came from the plot. It was an original story that created a new enemy for Holmes. Lord Blackwood, played chillingly by Mark Strong, was a crafty adversary who may or may not have had supernatural powers. Here he is replaced by Holmes' most conventional enemy, Professor Moriarty, played by Jared Harris, and his right-hand man, played by Paul Anderson. I won't name him here, because only hardcore fans of Doyle's canon will appreciate it, and for them it would be a spoiler. As the title implies, the focus of the film is a ""game"" of cat and mouse between Holmes and the Professor. While it's riveting to watch, the lack of a clearly defined mystery like in the previous film makes it harder for the audience to play along.<br/><br/>The main flaws lie with the script. ""Game of Shadows"" ditches the first film's stable of writers (including Lionel Wigram, who spearheaded production of the previous film and has now been reduced to a producer credit) in favor of Michele and Kieran Mulroney, known for a couple of Indie comedies. While the previous film had some quirky comedy, the new script ratchets it up to sometimes annoying levels. (A pro-longed ""breakfast"" analogy during a fight sequence is especially groan- inducing.) Also, the movie goes even further into action movie territory than the last effort, favoring chase scenes and explosions over a plot actually worthy of the great detective, with a story that seems made for James Bond rather than Sherlock Holmes. The movie also borrows more generously from Doyle's stories, so while die-hard Sherlock fans will grin at the many references, they'll also probably be able to see what's coming before Holmes and Watson do.<br/><br/>It's obvious Warner Bros. took more interest in the sequel than the prequel. While this means a welcome bigger budget, apparent in more exotic locations and bigger (and more frequent) pyrotechnics, it also means more studio meddling, possibly evident in the heavy recycling of the tricks Guy Ritchie used in the last movie. I'm sure, if left alone, Guy Ritchie could have created a sequel just as fresh and interesting as the prequel. Even Hans Zimmer's score, while still good, consists mainly of recycled cues from his other Sherlock score. <br/><br/>The saving grace is the great cast and their chemistry with each other. Downey Jr. and Law play off each other just as well as last time. Stephen Fry plays Sherlock's older brother Mycroft, another character exported from Doyle's canon. He and Sherlock call each other by the pet names ""Mycey"" and ""Sherlie"" respectively, which is not from the canon, but feels right, and Fry even looks like the Sidney Paget illustrations from the canon. His share of the comic relief is the wittiest. Sadly, Eddie Marsan's Inspector Lestrade is reduced to a cameo, at best.<br/><br/>But the best scenes are between Holmes and his nemesis. Rather than following the clichés that come with most portrayals of Moriarty, ""Game of Shadows"" takes the Professor back to his roots as a respected math scholar who leads a double life as a crime lord. Jared Harris is perfectly cast in the role, and the climactic scene between Downey Jr. and Harris is spine-tingling good and alone worth the price of admission."

When will he get to tackle the role which will make him the new Brando? This one isn't it, but amusing all the same. A true roller coaster of unrelenting action. The storyline is hard to follow at times but we can catch up easily along the way. And what about Ritchie's (this Madonna's Ex) style of slow motion and freeze frame shots to great effect. Are we witnessing a trademark in the line of Leone's majestic close-ups or Kubrick's cold reality? Time will tell. At the very least, we can say that it captivates, because I haven't heard an audience applaud a film with such enthusiasm in a long time. This film is candy, but good candy."

","The first Sherlock Holmes film to star Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law had been a masterpiece of mystery, drama, humour, action, romance and betrayal. The intricacies of the first were not renewed in this light- hearted humours sequel. <br/><br/>The story which was present in the first and woven so cleverly throughout the last movie is absent. In fact, there really is no story at all. And yet it is so well written, so well acted that the lack of story doesn't matter at all. Not once will the viewer become bored with the viewing or ever think 'just hurry up already'. Both Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law act impeccably as always, with an on screen chemistry that makes Holmes and Watson a true friendship and working partnership.<br/><br/>Without being truly sure that this is a spoiler, I marked the review as such regardless. The only disappointment that bugs me still is Moriarty's use of slow motion to predict the outcome of their fight. That was for Sherlock to use and Sherlock alone. There was also a bit too much use of the bullet time during a section of a film.<br/><br/>Despite the few niggling aspects of the film it is overall extremely enjoyable and worth watching.

","All of the stuff I said about the first Robert Downey Jr. re-invention (some would say assassination) of Sherlock still apply: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988045/reviews-31 <br/><br/>There is really little more to add. A Holmes devotee would be furious over a reinvented hero that is only a tad above Mr. Beans. The only thing worse is a Mycroft who enjoys carrying himself in complete nudity (you don't see it all but Mary Watson does). <br/><br/>The stylish filming and amazing set pieces are really what you are paying for. Actions are often in slow-motion and, although I hate to say this I'm compelled to acknowledge, poetic choreography. Everything is in Asian martial art fashion except for a couple of ""Oxford boxing"" punches as Holmes explains in voice over. Among the many great set pieces, the best is the one in the villain's ammunition factory, with such an pageantry of heavy arsenal that will make your jaw drop. <br/><br/>The story is anchored loosely on ""The final problem - Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"" in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's second collection of Sherlock Holmes short storied ""The final problem"". This is where the author intended to ""kill"" his hero, perhaps thinking that he had written enough. But by popular demand (maybe not explicitly made) he brought the world's greatest private detective back to life in ""The empty house"" in the third collection ""The return of Sherlock Holmes"", after which he went on to write two more. I used the term ""anchored"" because other than the aspect of Holmes and Moriarty plunging together into the sea grabbing each other in a melee, there's nothing recognizable. <br/><br/>Here, I'll quote the conclusion of my review of ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009): ""yes, this is not your version of Sherlock Holmes but it's at least your version of Robert Downey Jr."" This almost says it all. Downey-nowhere-near-Holmes will please his fans. Jude Law continues to serve the movie well in his version of Watson. Those who had been delighted with the wittily charming Rachel McAdams as ""the women"" Irene Adler, unfortunately, will be terribly disappointed because her appearance here is nothing more than cameo. The lead woman is none other than Noomi Rapace, the original ""Girl with a dragon tattoo"", speaking English of course. Not conventionally beautiful, this actress has her own special charm which particularly befits her role as a Gypsy. Jared Harris as Moriarty is serviceable but lacks the overwhelming personality under Doyle's pen. As mentioned, Mycroft as Doyle depicted has been completely bastardized but that is not Stephen Fry's fault. He actually did a good job with the persona to which his character has been assigned. Delightful Kelly Reilly as Mary Watson is a gem."
"Boethius-Wheel","7","0","1","25 December 2011"," Doyleian isn't even a word but it should be.
","First and foremost what sets Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movies above many other previous attempts to adapt the detective to the silver screen is the fact that it changes enough and keep enough the same to appeal both to hardcore Sherlock Holmes fans as well as the sensibilities of modern action movie viewing audiences. One of the main things that stands out is that instead of Watson being portrayed as the clueless buffoon and comic relief many other movies have made him into the Ritchie Watson is much closer to the original character and it benefits the films greatly. The mix of Doyleian detective drama and Guy Ritchie style action and bravado works far better in A Game of Shadows than it did in the first movie. The Chemistry between Law and Downey is fantastic and needless to say neither of them phones it in when it comes to the acting. Whereas the plot of the first movie was rather dull and forgettable with only the chemistry and skill of the actors saving the movie from being ""bad"" the second movies plot, although not exactly a masterpiece, is a lot more interesting and engaging. Mostly because unlike with the first movie I can actually remember what happened.<br/><br/>In what seems like the best casting decision in the history of film making this movie has Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes and if that isn't enough for you to want to see it then you probably have some sort of brain dysfunction and should contact your doctor as soon as possible."
"mac-hawk","8","0","3","25 December 2011"," Good Stuff
","Thoroughly enjoyed it. Much better than the first film. Downey Junior plays a much more eccentric Holmes to good effect. His play-off's with Law are good with some nice comical touches. Jared Harris is a great addition to the cast, playing the inscrutable Moriarty with the right amount of menace & intelligence without going anywhere near pantomime territory. Paul Anderson is good as Moriarty's chief sidekick but both the female leads are somewhat pointless and whilst there's nothing wrong with the acting from Rapace & Reilly they are pretty superfluous in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>Ah, the Stephen Fry character, Mycroft Holmes, is - well, in my opinion, it just about works, it certainly works better in the first half of the film than in the second, although there is a good comedic scene with Kelly Reilly later in the film. I think Fry could be utilised better in the next episode.<br/><br/>The action scenes are great as is the cinematography.<br/><br/>The main irritant I have with the film, and it's been mentioned in other reviews, is the use of the slow-mo in all the action scenes. It's simply used too much to be truly effective, it works in the scene when running through the woods but elsewhere it's overdone, something Ritchie needs to curb in the next episode.<br/><br/>All in all a good attempt but could do better"

","I speak for allot of people when i say how long we have been waiting for a number 2 after the good work done by number 1. Number 2, a game of shadows is certainly worth the wait, despite the trailer looking a little bit of a step down. First the plot. The story carries on from the cliffhanger at the end of the first, when Moriarty, a mysterious man with a concealed face, steals a weapon at the end and Sherlock ends with the lines ""Case reopened."" This sets this one up with homes practically devoted to finding out what he is up to and, of coarse Watson becomes involved and they end up travelling across Europe on the brink of a war between France and Germany. Its a step up from the last which was more about England and England alone. The hole of the western world is now in consideration. How this works with the character of Holmes is better than what i thought and this effects the plot in a significant way. Moriarty is a weapons dealer and so on but has friends in high places. ALLOt of high places so a war is in his interests and Holmes thinks he is the one who caused a series of explosions that, of coarse, France blames Germany for and vice verca. the whole mechanics behind this and how Holmes figures each step out is brilliant and, when he isn't doing that, hes getting into a fight or two. The slow down moments where Holmes devises his enemies take down has adapted to be better and way more flashy and there's allot of slowdowns in the action, maybe too much at points and you just want it to get on with it, but when it works, it is proper quality and makes it unique to any other movie. Seeing individual bullets slowly whizz past, breaking up trees and skimming clothes is great. There's great use of CGI and that really helps with some situations that i wouldn't imagine fitted with sherlock Holmes, but it does and it does it well. The plot is interesting and keeps you watching, but its the whole Holmes-Watson relationship which really keeps the humour and plot moving. Also, Mary also returns as a slightly more significant character, as does Eirine as a slightly pointless character that should of just been left and Lestrade as my favourite character with only one line. The last two should of been in it more as how good they were in the first, though this still is good without them playing that much of a part in it. What makes it also brilliant (without spoilers) is that the ending sequence with the plot isn't about action. There's no big fight (that actually happened, anyway) but the mechanic, the use of a chess game, the use of what was thought pointless moments of the movie actually being very significant is brilliant and ends great. There is a reason to be sad at the end however, so bring a tissue"

And here it is,although I wouldn't really call it a sequel, because the old story is mentioned nowhere in the film.<br/><br/>The film, like the old one, is full of gags and jokes involving mostly Holmes and an exasperated Watson, who should be on his honeymoon. These are all pretty funny, but the film does get boring around the middle, and you feel like you're just waiting for the climax. But when it does come you are rewarded for your patience. Again, like in the first film, Holmes uncovers Moriarty's plan to wreak havoc on the world, and stops him from executing it by throwing him off a cliff. But Moriarty pulls Holmes down with him. Everyone thinks he died, and Watson writes a book about him, honoring him as 'the best man of the law I have ever known'. I won't tell you the ending, it's a surprise and maybe the best part of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I don't think this is as good as the old one, but it's still enjoyable enough. I suggest you go see it if you haven't already, but don't expect to be blown away. Expect to be amused and entertained, but no more. If you do that, you'll enjoy it."

","..saw this one at a late show last night... <br/><br/>Have to say, as much as I enjoyed the first film (and I did very much enjoy Ritchie's take on Holmes!) this one just takes everything that was good and fun about the original and amps it up to 11.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Law and Downey is just crackling. It is so much fun to watch these 2 natter at each other. The mutual love and respect is spoken thru actions, deeds and performance. Very well executed by both actors.<br/><br/>The action sequences, a bit heavy-handed in the first film, are perfected in this one. Each and every one is an edge-of-your-seat affair, tremendously shot and executed.<br/><br/>Stylish, yes, but the style doesn't make them as clunky as they were in the first film.<br/><br/>Really hope there is a third entry in the series. The trio of Ritchie, Downey and Law are obviously having a lot of fun!"
"ihatespike","8","0","5","20 December 2011"," An engaging game
","The original cast and director (and a few newcomers) have banded together to bring us yet another visually delightful, humorous and action-packed sequel to Sherlock Holmes' newest incarnation.<br/><br/>A game of shadows takes place shortly after the events of the first film as Holmes interferes with Prof. Moriarty's plans one time too many and the two agree that it is indeed war between them, or if you prefer, the beginning movements in a good vs. evil game of chess.<br/><br/>Many of the same elements remain in the series, from Holmes' energetically manic and inconsiderate behavior to the slow-motion action sequences which are used a bit more, and artistically tinkered with. This is both a critique and a compliment, because it can be rather jarring and repetitive, but also very stylish and fun. I would highly recommend you choose a seat that is a decent distance from the screen so that these elements can be properly enjoyed without being a distraction. Admittedly, the second half of the film is where things really start to speed along nicely, but in most ways the moderate and somewhat bleak start is justified by the film's conclusion. I haven't watched many of the older Holmes films but I have read all the stories and I can say that it is a wonderful and satisfying retelling of the battle between Doyle's fictional geniuses. Yet again the sets and locations are appropriate and well made, the humor is goofy and offbeat (a bit more risqué than the last, but not enough to really offend I don't think), the cast shines in their roles, including the talented Jared Harris, who forgoes overplaying the role of antagonist in favor of a soft-spoken and covertly cruel narcissist, Noomie Rapace as the gypsy Sim does not torture us with stereotypically maudlin, lascivious or catty dialogue, and instead is a sturdy and calming presence added to the brotherly bond of Holmes and Watson, and Stephen Fry plays Sherlock's older brother Mycroft exactly as I pictured him; lazy, smart and endearingly snobbish.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I have with this film (and this is where the spoilers are, beware!) Is the supposed death of Irene Adler, which falls short of being a twist since it takes place at the beginning of the film, and is neither helpful in securing our dislike of Moriarty (since we do not see Irene's dead body or even prolonged suffering), nor our empathy for Sherlock (since he literally makes no comment or reaction to hearing of her death). The entire thing is less convincing than Blackwood's death at the beginning of the first film, pointless for the aforementioned fact that it was dealt with in a totally underwhelming way, and undermining of Irene's character in intelligence and the fact that she repeatedly escaped brushes with death in the first film. This write-off is disappointing not only because Adler was a useful and likable character, but also because if it was intended to be absolute then that means that the writers were sloppy and indifferent in that respect.<br/><br/>All this being said, I did enjoy the film, and perhaps if you take my recommendation, you will too."
"Chris_Pandolfi","7","0","2","20 December 2011"," Two Intelligent Men, One Elementary Rivalry
","The title is ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"" and indeed, it's all about the shadowy arts of cleverness and deception. This is to be expected when you have an adversarial relationship between two supremely intelligent men. I am, of course, referring to detective-for-hire Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), both engaged in a deadly battle of wits in 1891 Europe. They're each faced with the monumental task of being one step ahead of the other, which requires a thought process and an attention to detail that most would consider inhuman. For Holmes, it comes as second nature. We've once already seen his ability to make highly accurate deductions simply by analyzing the little things most people take no notice of. He finally admits that he notices absolutely everything, and that it's just as much a curse as it is a blessing.<br/><br/>""A Game of Shadows"" is, naturally, a sequel to the 2009 blockbuster ""Sherlock Holmes."" Both films are directed by Guy Ritchie, allowing for some rather interesting spins on the original stories and novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. For these reboots, the title character is a bit more bohemian, the plots are a bit more action-oriented, and the special effects are a bit more showy and expensive. Ritchie turns up the volume in ""A Game of Shadows"" with a story intended to be funnier, trickier, and literally more explosive than its predecessor. That it's a great deal of fun, there can be absolutely no question. One wonders, though, if some audiences will find the plot a little difficult to follow, as it works in twists, turns, and misdirection the way artists work in oils or acrylics.<br/><br/>The first film brought full attention to some of the quirky mannerisms Doyle created for Holmes, including his hyper analytical thinking skills (which some contemporary scholars convincingly attribute to Asperger's syndrome), his affinity for bare-knuckle boxing and martial arts, and his inelegant style of dress. This new film draws on other quirks, most notably his ability to disguise himself and his occasional use of cocaine. Ritchie and screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney take it one step further – in one scene, he downs a glass full of formaldehyde. I have absolutely no idea what that does to a living body, but I suppose it doesn't really matter. His 221B Baker Street flat continues to be the center of his eccentric behaviors; in this particular case, we see he has filled it with jungle foliage and specific types of animals. He continues to perform strange experiments on Watson's dog, and they always do less harm than they probably would in real life.<br/><br/>I'm going to describe the plot in hurried, vague terms, as I don't want to ruin the intricate mystery for you. Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) are drawn into a complicated web of crimes that seem to connect back to Professor Moriarty, who, as you may remember, was the stranger who kept himself hidden in shadow in the first film. They eventually involve a fortune-telling gypsy named Sim (Noomi Rapace), one of Moriarty's targets. Why does he want her out of the way? It might have something to do with her missing brother, who not only worked for Moriarty but was also once affiliated with a radical terrorist group in located in Paris. The unexpected death of a prominent businessman, masked by a deceptive explosion, leads Holmes to Germany, where they discover a massive arms factory. Clearly, Moriarty has invested in large-scale weaponry. But why? And how does Sim's brother fit into all of this?<br/><br/>All leads to a final sequence that's a triumph of plotting, pacing, and editing. It even works in an especially well-known turn of events, and if you're at all familiar with Doyle's original stories, then you probably already know what I'm referring to. During this scene, there's an especially well-written scene involving Holmes and Moriarty, who engage in a chess game that starts out with physical moves but eventually escalates to verbal one-upsmanship. There's an indescribable satisfaction that comes with watching one-on-one displays of intellectual prowess; I almost feel as if I'm being invited to probe deeply into the characters' minds, to determine for myself what it is they're really thinking and feeling at that very moment.<br/><br/>Intertwined with this is a subplot involving Watson, his new wife, Mary (Kelly Reilly), and Holmes' equally eccentric brother, Mycroft (Stephen Fry), who without explanation will wander his estate naked, even in the presence of servants and guests (the former are clearly used to this, whereas the latter most definitely are not). It should be noted that the entire film is actually a memoir being written by Watson, which further connects the film to Doyle's original stories. While a bit plot heavy, and although some of the action is overplayed – just wait for the scene of Holmes, Watson, and Sim running slow motion through a forest being blasted apart by gunfire – ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is an engaging and enjoyable mystery film. Like its predecessor, it remains faithful to its source, and yet it isn't so bogged down by insider references that it alienates modern audiences.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"zardoz-13","10","0","4","19 December 2011"," Better than the First ""Sherlock Holmes""
","According to The Guinness World Records, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's illustrious literary detective Sherlock Holmes ranks as ""the most portrayed movie character"" in cinematic history. Indeed, Hollywood has been shooting movies about Sherlock Holmes since the initial one-reeler, ""Sherlock Holmes Baffled,"" appeared in 1900, as a 30-second silent epic. Since then a number of actors have taken up residence at 221 B Baker Street, ranging from the most vintage, Basil Rathbone during the 1940s, to the most bohemian, Robert Downey, Jr., who received a Golden Globe for his performance in director Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009). <br/><br/>""Lethal Weapon"" producer Joel Silver and Ritchie have brought back Holmes for a superior sequel, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"" and ""Paper Man"" scenarists Michele and Kieran Mulroney have pitted him against his most diabolical nemesis, that Napoleon of Crime, Professor James Moriarty. Nothing less than the fate of Western civilization hangs in the balance during this taut 129 minute melodrama which sends Dr. Watson with our eponymous protagonist globetrotting across Europe after ""Sherlock Holmes"" had confined them to London. Although Lord Blackwood proved an audacious adversary in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" Moriarty emerges as a far more stimulating opponent in a sequel that surpasses its predecessor. This Moriarty may be the best in any Holmes adventure. <br/><br/>Ritchie and the Mulroneys have put the Victorian Era sleuth through the paces with several exciting sequences, including a bullet-riddled shoot-out on a railway train to a challenging chess match in a scenic castle in Switzerland posed on a waterfall. Happily, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" preserves the formula of its predecessor in every detail and character, not only replaying the ingenious Holmes-O-Vision fisticuffs scenes but also ushering in new characters, such as Holmes' brilliant elder brother Mycroft. My only complaint about this otherwise tour-de-force mystery thriller is the short shrift given to Holmes' love interest, Irene Adler, who doesn't garner her share of screen time.<br/><br/>""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" takes place in the year 1891 as anarchy threatens to engulf Europe and ignite war between France and Germany. The press speculates either nationalists or anarchists are behind the violence, but Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr. of ""Iron Man"") believes Moriarty is to blame. Indeed, Moriarty is to blame! No sooner do his unwitting henchmen carry out a piece of his elaborate puzzle of murder and mayhem than a dishonorably discharged British sniper, Colonel Sebastian Moran (Paul Anderson of ""A Lonely Place to Die""), kills them with extreme prejudice. Essentially, the sequel picks up where its predecessor more or less off as Dr. Watson is poised to wed Mary (Kelly Reilly of ""Pride & Prejudice"") despite Holmes' indefatigable efforts to derail matrimony. Holmes and Watson visit a London night club where Holmes was supposed to throw Watson's stag party. Instead, Holmes runs into his brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry of ""St. Trinian's"") and leaves a disgruntled Watson to gamble while he meets a gypsy woman, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace of the Swedish film ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""), who has been searching for her long lost brother named Rene. No sooner does Holmes read her fortune than a smelly Cossack warrior attacks them in an exhilarating scene. Later, after they escape, Holmes meets Moriarty at the university where he teaches mathematics. This is Holmes' first encounter with Moriarty, and Moriarty tells him he plans to kill both Watson and his wife Mary on their honeymoon. Naturally, Holmes sets out to thwart him and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Oscar-nominated actor Robert Downey, Jr., has another field day playing Sherlock Holmes. Some of his disguises make him virtually invisible. What may irritate die-hard Baker Street regulars are Downey's undignified antics, particularly when he appears in drag to thwart the villains on the railroad out to murder Watson and his wife. Downey's funniest scene has Holmes straddling a Shetland pony to the hilarious strains of Ennio Morricone's music from the Clint Eastwood & Shirley MacLaine oater ""Two Mules for Sister Sara."" Undoubtedly, Downey's best dramatic scene occurs when he crosses analytical swords with Jared Harris' Machiavellian Professor Moriarty. Mind you, Downey displays more personality than Harris. Nevertheless, Harris makes an undeniably menacing impression with a grand scheme to start a war. Jude Law reprises his role as Dr. Watson, and the chemistry between Law and Downey is still as charismatic as ever. Watson isn't the bumbling oaf that Nigel Bruce was in the memorable Basil Rathbone outings in the 1940s. The mustached Law is as sharp with his wardrobe as he is with his revolver. For that matter, he is pretty good with military artillery. As Watson's future wife, Kelly Reilly acquires more screen time here. Other supporting characters from the original, such as Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan) and Holmes' landlady Mrs. Hudson (Geraldine James), are back. One of producer Joel Silver's better characteristics is his predilection for retaining the same characters as well as actors as he did in his quartet of ""Lethal Weapon"" blockbusters. <br/><br/>As usual, despite his revisionist handling of Holmes as a pugnacious action hero, Ritchie makes sure that this lavishly produced thriller never wears out its welcome. Holmes and Watson find themselves up to their respective necks in danger. Meantime, the filmmakers never fall back on the formulaic woman-in-peril plot with regard to Madam Simza and her part in the action. Unlike the first Ritchie ""Holmes,"" the sequel boasts a couple of tragic moments, but these don't slow down the pace. Thanks to a lot of gorgeous computer-generated imagery and ""Sommersby"" lenser Philippe Rousselot's photography, everything looks convincingly Victorian. Nothing about ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is merely elementary, but everything is wholly entertaining."
"bigryanaaa","7","0","9","16 December 2011"," Good time that beats up the original (in slow motion)
","I want to start off by explaining why I only gave this movie a 7. I enjoyed it thoroughly and laughed out loud several times (much more than I did the first Sherlock Holmes movie). That being said, there were a few scenes that seem unnecessary are somewhat drawn out. These are the type when you hear the audience let out an audible yawn. I won't give them away, but you will see what I mean if you watch the movie. However, this does not make the movie un-enjoyable, just be aware that it is fairly long and there are parts when you will feel the length.<br/><br/>After saying all that, I must give it the credit it deserves as well. The movie is clever and entertaining. You will laugh at several parts if you have a sense of humor. I'm happy I watched it in the theater and I left feeling that the ending was appropriate and gave me the emotional payoff I craved. Robert Downey does an exceptional job and really carries the movie the majority of the time. Watch it, enjoy it, but be prepared for a long ride."
