","Yes, the original film was like a lot of 80s movies--campy, silly and sometimes just about the music—but this remake should have been forgotten. While the writers kept quite a few original lines and the director kept some iconic scenes, something was lost in translation. That loss cannot be blamed on any one part of the film but rather the disgraceful whole.<br/><br/>There some changes that I enjoyed. The opening scene, though storyline changed a bit, had more of an impact behind the impetus of the town's laws. The dancing was top notch by today's standards though a little raunchy a time or two. Kenny Wormald did justice to Kevin Bacon's dance in the warehouse, changing it just enough to make it his own. Julianna Hough kept up with him every step of the way during the dance scenes. Even the at the end, it was refreshing in this day of girl-power to see the football team told by a teammate to ""man-up"" and ask the girls to dance.<br/><br/>That said, the rest of the film is an empty cardboard parody, lacking any sense of poignancy that endeared the original to a generation. The soundtrack fell below the standard set in 1984, though they sort of kept Whitney Houston's original ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"" when Willard learns to dance (a highlight in both films). Also, they changed Beamis Mill (which I believe dealt with concrete) to a cotton gin mill, very poor taste.<br/><br/>The characters are hollow and thanks to the deletion of several key scenes, the actors are not given a chance to redeem themselves and give us characters we can empathize with.<br/><br/>Kenny Wormald was a great choice for the dancing scenes. It's impeccable and when when he dances you can feel his passion come through the screen. His acting, however, was limited to cockiness and poker face. Kenny seemed to struggle to find the balance in that sweet spot between underacting and overacting. Two scenes that clearly show this is when his aunt asked him why the dance was important and when he stands before the town counsel. Both times lack passion, conviction and inflection. He could very well have been reading the nutrition panel on the side of a bag of bread. The closest I came to identifying with him was when his Uncle talked about him taking care of his mom. Kenny could not seem to remember he was supposed to be a rebel with a cause and not just another rebellious teenager.<br/><br/>Julianna Hough is gorgeous and confident. Confidence like hers can hinder a performance when you are supposed to be playing a wild child who is acting out because of insecurity. I am trying to give her the benefit of the doubt as key scenes were not in the film that would have brought depth to her character. You miss out on the deep reasons behind the hurt and vulnerability that Lori Singer pulled off wonderfully. For example, the scene about types of music in the original between Ariel and Shaw went a long way to deepen the dynamics of father-daughter relationship, and helped build each character's journey in the minds and hearts of the audience. Or the scene with the music box, showed the vulnerability of Ariel as she shared who she really is with Ren, brave and yet fearful of rejection for her real self. Those scenes might have saved Hough's performance. Instead, her version of Ariel came across as an angry brat who looked good dancing.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid looked ill-at-ease throughout the entire movie, and even when he's angry he looks like he might lose his breakfast. Again, I am trying to give his performance the benefit of the doubt as they cut several key character-development scenes which would have shown how he grew throughout the course of the film. For example, the book-burning scene in the original is a major turning point for this character. John Lithgow's heart (original) could be seen in that scene when he sees what he's done. It's a point of no return when he had to really think about what he'd done and why and how he will proceed. Had they kept that scene, he would have reason, he would have believability. Now, instead, Shaw comes across as another fumbling close-minded dad/leader who had no clue about real life until his wife and daughter school him, along with a very brief talk with Ren.<br/><br/>Andie MacDowell didn't have much chance with the majority of Vi's scenes cut. That said, had been included them it would not have mattered. Only once during this film did she remind me of the quiet strength and dignity that Dianne Wiest brought to the role (town meeting). Her few scenes with Dennis Quaid are almost belittling and instead of the gentle correction of Vi quietly convicting Shaw Andie's Vi seemed to constantly condemn him.<br/><br/>Miles Teller as Willard is probably the most enjoyable of the entire cast. I know some out there have decried his performance, but I think he took the role and made it his own while retaining the child-like naiveté that was Willard. He was a little on the over-sexed teen side of things in this film (which got old), but otherwise, he was fun to watch.<br/><br/>The flaws are many in this film. I would give this film 2 out of 5 stars simply for the dancing, The tag line is ""Cut Loose"" and they stripped away any of the sentimentality that would have made this a fun film to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>They removed what made Footloose so foot loose. They simply cut too loose."
"rdnyscott","1","29","35","22 September 2013"," Removed the good stuff
","What was the point? The director just went through and removed all the good stuff from the first movie. The original is based on events which took place in Elmore City, OK and yes, they banned dancing. It's hard for today's teens to fathom how religious the 80s were, which might be why they can't grasp a movie like this. You can't make a modern remake of this movie because today's kids aren't suffocating under this type of extreme religiosity. In the original, the ban is on dancing, including a teen prom. The kids are only being reasonable to protest this. In this remake, the ban is on ""lewd and lascivious dancing"" which the teens think they have a right to perform in the streets.<br/><br/>In the original, Ren is an old soul. After his father dies, Ren and his mother must shack with his uncle, moving Ren from Chicago to a tiny town where dancing is banned. Instead of making things more difficult for his mother, Ren tries to fit in and treats everyone politely and respectfully, which results in him being bullied by the small towners. He even tolerates this and tries to play by their rules, never once pointing out the obvious insults a typical obnoxious city teen would have for the rural folks.<br/><br/>In this remake, Ren is instead that typical bratty teen, thinking an accident of birth makes him better than everyone, and greeting practically the entire town with the insult that they are hicks. Despite this, the town isn't even that small and is actually multicultural, and the kids dance to hip hop! The only issue the kids face is that their parents don't want them bumping and grinding too suggestively to it! Yeah, that's Ren's issue. His parents are dead, but that's his issue. Even the judge in this town had long hair as a teen, and Ren's uncle reminds him of this, to justify Ren blasting the town with noise pollution.<br/><br/>In the original, Ren must struggle to please an unreasonable uncle who blames him for things he didn't do, while this uncle has Ren's back before even asking him if he's guilty. Ren basically has no real struggles to speak of, yet he does a lot of whining anyway. We are supposed to sympathize enough over the loss of his parents to support him humping his girlfriend openly in the streets. The uncle thinks his little girls (and all little girls) should be exposed to this. Ren even declares to the adults that ""as kids, its our job to do stupid things"", yet he doesn't expand on what the jobs of adults might be.<br/><br/>Ariel's father protests not so much because he's a pastor, but because he maintains some shred of hope that his daughter is still a virgin, but when she informs her father that she's not, and Ren informs her father that his daughter is a slut, the pastor gives up and accepts that he will be a grandfather soon. Ren's revelation that Ariel is already hot for his bod means she should be allowed to dance lewd and become a teen mother.<br/><br/>In the original, the pastor and Ren finally bond because the pastor lost his son and Ren lost his father. Ren cleverly uses Bible verses to make his point at the town meeting, because it is the only way to convince a highly religious town that bases all of their rules on the Bible. He does this because he is a wise, respectful young man who isn't paranoid of a little studying. In the remake ""sir, your daughter is already a slut"" is the extent of Ren's argument to the pastor, yet it is (apparently) oddly persuasive.<br/><br/>This movie is just laughably bad, so much so that even people who can't quite explain why it's laughably bad still know that it is."
"Myrii","3","21","25","29 September 2013"," If you've seen the original no need to watch this one.
","I love the original and was really excited to see this remake. I was very disappointed. They copied the original, just added cell phones and CD's and a few modern dance moves. Same soundtrack, just a hint modernized, I'm pretty sure even some of the lines were exactly the same. There was nothing creative or original about this movie.<br/><br/>You know that feeling where you see an actor/actress in a certain role and then you see them in another movie and it's like they were told to keep the same character but the film's setting is so completely different and all you can think is 'no, this is wrong, this just doesn't work'. It's exactly what I thought while watching this film but instead of the character(s) being wrong it felt like the whole movie was wrong.<br/><br/>I would have even accepted it if the only thing they kept was the basic concept and redesigned the rest from scratch. But they played it too safe and ended up with a copy instead of a fresh film.<br/><br/>That said if you've never seen the original Footloose it's alright."
"DonFishies","4","91","126","2 October 2011"," Not as awful as it could have been, but not overly great either
","I enjoy bad movies, and enjoy bad remakes even more. So when the opportunity to get advanced passes to the atrocious looking remake of Footloose came, I pounced on them just out of the sheer will to see what kind of monstrosity Craig Brewer and company came up with. The film had gone through a number of changes, and had plenty of room to improve on the original. Sadly, I do not think there was ever any hope for it.<br/><br/>After a horrific accident takes the lives of five high school seniors, the town of Bomont, Tennessee outlaws a number of activities for the teenage populace including dancing. Enter Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald), a city kid and distinct outsider to the close knit Bomont townspeople. He is confused by the bans, and after making a few new friends, sets out to get them abolished.<br/><br/>While the nostalgia factor may cloud the memories of some people, the original Footloose is really nothing more than a fun diversion packed alongside an absolutely infectious soundtrack that is still great even today. It is a fairly silly film really, but with the help of Kevin Bacon's 1984-era charm and charisma, the film remains a wildly enjoyable film. Yet somehow, in remaking the film for an audience in 2011, it seems like the filmmakers missed more than a few steps along the way.<br/><br/>Now I will be the first to admit that this new remake does have a handful of fun scenes and astonishing dance choreography. The trailers do a good job of showing off just how great some of the dance moves are from this new cast, but what it does not let on too much is that most of these scenes come when they are replicating scenes from the original film. I basked in the glory of hearing Kenny Loggins blasting, while watching the various pairs of feet dancing to the beat. And seeing Willard (Miles Teller) learning how to dance is one of the highlights of the film, much like it is the original film. A key dance sequence late in the film is also significantly better than I could have ever predicted.<br/><br/>But that is where the enjoyment ends. <br/><br/>The rest of the film that surrounds these scenes is dull and lifeless, moving at a snail's pace and just going through the motions. There is very little fun to be had, and should someone venture into the film without having seen the original, they may wonder why anyone wanted to remake it in the first place. Instead of trying to improve and make the plot line less ludicrous, the filmmakers left the entire crux of the film the exact same. They merely changed a few character traits around, shuffled in some racy dialogue, and took out the tractors and added in school buses. They sucked out all the fun, and what is left seems like a mere project that was cranked out with little to no thought for what audiences may actually perceive to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>Worse yet, the soundtrack is a totally forgettable affair. While it is the crucial element of the original film, it feels like a largely laughable affair here. I was originally intrigued at the idea of the film containing all the original songs, albeit covered by new artists. But somehow, all of the catchiness of the original tunes seems to have been stripped from these new ones. Instead, we are left with versions that have a country twang or overtly urban feel to them, and absolutely no reason to want to listen to these new versions ever again. I would be lying if I did not think the most memorable tracks in the film were the two original ones that somehow were deemed okay to fit into the film. I would register a guess that this is the influence of Brewer, who is best known for Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan. He has a distinctly Southern taste to his body of work, and practically forces it on this film. But in forcing this ideology, alongside two completely different genres of music, he crushes the film into submission, leaving many scenes an absolute mess. <br/><br/>The acting in the film is even more disappointing. Dennis Quaid looks embarrassed in every scene he is in, overacting as much as he possibly can to forget that he is in the film. Andie McDowell looks like she wandered in off the wrong set, and just decided to stick around as a background character. Wormald is a poor substitute for Bacon, and is an even worse lead for a major motion picture. I realize he is a dancer first and foremost, but leaving him to carry this film was an awful decision. He looks frightened and confused for the majority of the film, and quivers through most of his lines. He lacks Ren's charm, and is never believable when he rebels against authority. You want to believe in this character, but all you will do is laugh at how staggeringly bad Wormald's performance is. Julianne Hough, the female lead, at least attempts to act. She comes close to a breakthrough in more than one instance, but she comes off a bit too amateur for her own good. She makes a great dance partner for Wormald, but for what little shred of chemistry she has, it is made totally moot when he opens his mouth. <br/><br/>What redeems the film from being the awful travesty it should be is Teller's performance as Willard. The moment he walks on-screen, he has an energy to him that is simply unmatchable. He is the single best thing about the film, embodying the innocence, spirit and fun of Chris Penn's original performance. If you venture into this remake, see it for him and ignore the rest. You may find some remotely enjoyable experience buried in there somewhere.<br/><br/>4/10."
"Patricia756","1","19","23","20 November 2012"," Remake mistake
","The original Footloose was a little film with a debatable script and a little budget. But contrary to all expectations was quite successful across the globe and became with time a cult movie and that thanks to the infectious music, dance routines quite impressive for the time, but most of all to a brilliant casting, believable and very suitable to their roles. Same thing that happened to Dirty Dancing. So take the original cast, the music and the novelty of the dance routines away from the equation and what is left is a very forgettable film with very unmemorable music, very ordinary dance routine and with a cast that makes you miss the old one every step of the way. Who was the guy playing the main role? I can't even remember his face that much mediocre he was and what about the leading lady, with no depth what so ever, painfully bad actors both with no chemistry between them. Do we need to equal the tension between the unassuming sex appeal of Kevin Bacon in that role and the irresistibly attractive vulnerability brought to the role by Lori Singer? Was it a not intentional carrier suicide taking up roles that are so vividly embedded in people memories? Was it? Well, I feel I need to mention, the countryman friend role, that in the original was so adorably played by Chris Penn, the guy who played the same part is such a poor takeoff, a caricature and his girlfrienda bubbly full of energy Sara Jessica Parker against a very dull actress there to fill space and nothing more. Even the original father and mother role (the preacher and his wife) were far more engaging at the point that you could see their point of view and sympathize, the original roles were played by John Lithgow and Dianne Weist, (believable even as a loving couple) in this new version played by Dennis Quaid and Andy MacDowell , that I usually really like, here they fell flat unable to be convincing in their role as troubled preacher and over concern but very tender and caring father and as the effectual moderator, sweet but strong mother as it was in the original. I'm sorry but would this film be an original it could be only regarded as a mediocre film, being a remake of a little delightful cult film is a very sorry version, terrible, not recommended unless you watch it on television and want something boring to doze off."
"lisag1012003","1","18","23","21 July 2012"," sucks
","I don't understand why we need to remake great movies. this movie sucks. Stay with the original. I was disappointed in the music. I am happy that a few of the original songs were in it. one song was changed and sang different. That was horrible. The songs and dance scenes needed to be the way it was in the original movie. I understand that it is a 2011 version of the movie but I think too many things were changed. I am not knocking the actors in any way. they are great actors and amazing dancers. I am just not a fan of the movie it self. the actors are amazingly talented. I am just not a big fan of remakes. The movie had too many changes."
"DomNickson843","Null","10","12","3 February 2015"," How Did It Get This High Of A Rating???
","This movie sucked big time! They remixed all of the songs from the original for no reason and it sucked so bad! I almost wanted to throw up after seeing it. The dancing is just so embarrassing and it basically craps all over the original. I'm so appalled that this movie has a rating higher than a one. It sucks so bad it should of been rated the worst remake in the history of remakes! I would much rather see somebody suffering a horrible death than ever watch this film again. I feel embarrassed to be called a human being because this film shows how stupid we all are! We let this happen and now there's no hope. If aliens come down from space and see this movie they will probably look at us as if we are the dumbest living thing on the planet! This movie is the reason an apocalypse should happen! Overall the film sucks so bad I rated it a -1,000,000,000,000 out of 10 because it is the absolute worst movie ever made!"
"cbou6988","3","12","15","19 August 2012"," Bad Acting + Terrible Remixes = Disappointment
","I had such high hopes for this movie. I was excited by the beginning, tragic explanation of what happened to make the townsfolk think it was a good idea to create a string of very strict laws. That's where the excitement ended. Aside from a few entertaining scenes, i.e. Willard learning how to dance with a bunch of cute little girls, it was one confused ""Seriously!?!"" moment after another.<br/><br/>In trying to stay true the the original, they made it laughably bad. If you're going to do a remake, make it original so it isn't compared so closely to the original. I heard the exact same lines, said with less feeling and horribly off timing. I saw great scenes replaced with ridiculous substitutions, like riding a tractor 20 feet to the buses they were about to race. I was devastated to hear how the songs from the original soundtrack had been thrown into a blender and murdered mercilessly, like ""I Need a Hero"" being made into an ultra-slow ballad. <br/><br/>And the dancing... come on people. The story is supposed to be about regular teenagers dancing to their music their way. Have you ever been to a dance club to see how teenagers dance? Have you ever seen a bunch of kids dancing their asses off with the music coming from car speakers at a park in New York? I have. The drive-in scene was close, but as far as I'm concerned, Wormald used way too many Broadway moves for these scenes to be believable. <br/><br/>As for the acting, I think Hough did slightly better than Singer, but Wormald was not nearly so memorable as Kevin Bacon was, especially when he was speaking to the town council. However, Miles Teller did do an excellent job of playing the slightly goofy, lovable Willard. Dennis Quaid was definitely not the right choice to play a preacher, but I loved Ray McKinnon and Kim Dickens as Ren's aunt and uncle. They were great.<br/><br/>Bottom Line - If they hadn't tried so hard to stick to the original, if they hadn't butchered the original music so thoroughly, and if they hadn't cast dancers as actors, it would have been much, much better."
"MovieBuff-fest","6","23","32","18 March 2012"," Not a bad movie, but pointless as a remake
","I was a teen when the original movie came out, and I also live near Lehi, Utah where it was filmed which made me think fondly of the movie whenever I drove by the Lehi Roller Mills. (Today it is a sprawling metropolis, resembling little of the sleepy little town like in the movie.) When I heard another pointless remake was coming out, I decided to give it the Redbox treatment instead of completely boycotting it.<br/><br/>After watching it with my wife who had never seen the original, I was able to say, ""Not so bad, but pointless as a remake."" Most of the original music (which I still love) was recycled into something recognizable but not lovable. The scenes played out nearly identical to the original but with different actors. The whole way through it, I had the feeling that the director was watching the original on a hand-held device, then turned to the actors and said, ""I have an idea for this next scene."" If I recall correctly, even the dialog where it wasn't modernized with MP3 players (instead of cassette players) and cell phones (instead of...what the heck did we have?) was word for word.<br/><br/>Usually remakes are for big block busters where today's technology and special effects can outshine the feeble attempts of the past and make a great story better by sucking the audience in. This movie had none of that, and in summary, became another pointless Hollywood rehash for quick cash. The only improvement I could acknowledge was a sub-plot that explained Ren's actions a little better, but it was still not an excuse to remake a classic.<br/><br/>My advice: watch the original. It's much better."
"StevePulaski","3","15","20","20 April 2013"," Cut Footloose (once again)
","The only real reason to pay any attention at all to the new Footloose is to watch the music video for the terrific Big and Rich song ""Fake ID."" Other than that, there is little appeal in the film, as it shamelessly recycles almost every scene, event, and line from its original counterpart, and the ones it doesn't, it modifies for an audience that is questionably existent. If there's anything the film made me do, it made me seriously contemplate what a ""remake"" actually is and what their inherent goal is. To make the original material better? Make the story more current? Give it a stronger, more contemporary feel and look? If those questions were considered during the making of the Footloose remake, they weren't considered for very long. This is a stale, unimaginably boring picture, with its first real problem being it is trying to make an immensely dated story of music and dancing banishment current and relatable to teenagers of the present. In a time where vulgar rap by artists named ""Chief Keef,"" ""Juicy J,"" and ""Wiz Khalifa"" can be found on the iPods of teens in schools and they can get away with it, I highly doubt teens will be able to resonate with playing Kenny Loggins or Quiet Riot a bit too loud.<br/><br/>The original Footloose at least had the benefit of being a film with a contemporary issue to its time and the appeal of its lead, Kevin Bacon. Granted watching it now is like dusting off a C-grade vinyl that barely functions, it at least had the ability to give the student body a voice and a personality as they tried to keep their freedom to play rock music (please say this out loud) alive and well. The new Footloose, however, is like that guy randomly wearing acid-washed jeans in public in 2013; random, out of place, and questionable beyond belief.<br/><br/>The story hasn't changed at all; we center our sites on the small town of Bomont, Georgia, that has been musically silenced since reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) pressured the city council to ban music and dancing after loud music ""resulted"" in the deaths of five teenagers driving late at night. I say ""resulted"" because the cause of death was more of teenage stupidity. The pop music blaring on the radio at the time had little effect.<br/><br/>Ten years after this horrendous legislation, Bostonian teenager Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) waltzes into town and experiences a culture shock when he realizes that, hey, not only do people who live in other towns have different lifestyles than himself, but music is frowned upon in this tight-nit community. However, that doesn't stop Moore's rebellious daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough), who can often be found batting her bubbly blue eyes and shaking her bouncy backside in no mans land areas deep in the outskirts of town along with dozens of other teens.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, Moore isn't fond of the way Ren behaves. His attitude is smarmy and purposefully instigating, and the thought that he is a teen with something to say unnerves him greatly. The remainder of the film amplifies this conflict between them, as well as trying to make a bold statement that teenagers are supposed to be reckless, dumb, and the driving force behind many mistakes.<br/><br/>This conflict between Ren and ""the man"" leads all the way to the city council, where Ren tries to use Bible verses to sway the entire council (including Moore) to allow music and public dancing to be etched back in Bomont's society. He states that people in biblical times danced for God and Jesus, leaping and ecstatically celebrating them with the art of movement. Okay. I'm sure when Ariel is gyrating and shaking her blue-jean short-shorts in front of every guy in a vacant field she definitely has our lord and savior in mind. Same with Ren; I'm sure when he got down in the crowded saloon for line dancing or when him and several others fight the gang of bullies during a school dance at the end of the film, they all had God and Jesus in their hearts and minds. You couldn't fool a maroon with your logic.<br/><br/>Director Craig Brewer (Black Snake Moan and Hustle and Flow - two films that wouldn't even be on the same shelf as Footloose in ANY category, list, arrangement, etc) doesn't even offer any pleasing attributes to this film stylistically, albeit some good choreography. Other than maybe a few good scenes involving a large production number and several dozen dancers, the film's redone music, contemporary atmosphere, updated production, and caricature-driven cast seems like an act of indolence, if anything. I had a hard time admiring the original Footloose, but credited it for being something of a time-staple, even if it doesn't hold up well in present time. It's hard to credit the new Footloose at all, since its very existence is perplexing.<br/><br/>Starring: Kenny Wormald, Julianne Hough, Andie MacDowell, and Dennis Quaid. Directed by: Craig Brewer."
"plasticanimalz","4","11","14","20 August 2013"," Terrible...and Boring
","The previews looked terrible but I wanted to like it and thought maybe it would be fun fluff. Nope. The original, '80s version wasn't rocket science but it was fun and sweet with great music and was loved by kids and adults. My mom played the soundtrack all the time. The premise of the original was taken with a grain of salt. In the remake they try to focus on the premise by getting all dramatic and emotional which just makes the fact that dancing is outlawed outrageous and comical. Not to mention, why would they outlaw dancing for drinking and driving? That's rather far fetched. In the original both Ren and Ariel had problems...but they seemed to deal with them like any other teen, with trademark angst, so, you could identify with them and like them. In the remake they have therapy kind of anger and issues that I could not identify with and the script failed to make the characters sympathetic, so, I didn't care about them. Ren was more just angry and a bit of a jerk (though, lesser in the sense that they added much bigger jerks to this film, I suppose in an attempt to make him more likable, though, that failed), and Ariel was also angry, reckless, slutty, bratty, and made her best friend angry...what is to like about that? In the original, Kevin Bacon was cute and charming and a leader. In this one Ren is kind of dorky, has a weird Boston accent that comes in and out, brooding, and everyone in the film is angry, rebellious and breaking the law of dancing so there is no real reason for Ren to even be in this film other than to add to the mix. He doesn't stand out in anyway, he just seems like some random face in the crowd trying to get through school so he can grow up to be an angry adult who works as a mechanic or something.<br/><br/>In the original there was a great pop soundtrack which worked and held the film together and made it fun. In this one there is country, hip hop and rock? None of it holds together as one working piece, kind of jumps you around, and doesn't give you any sense of the film. I mean, pick a freakin' theme. Just one.<br/><br/>In the original it was just a bunch of kids who liked to dance. In this film apparently everyone in a small Southern town is a professional dancer and likes to create synchronized line dancing to '80s songs. In the original you felt for their plight because the rules put upon them were ridiculous and Ariel was reckless because she felt pent up by the rules. In this version they were doing the exact same things that got them into trouble in the first place. There was no change, it was just illegal so they weren't really pent up and acting out. Anywhere in America it is illegal for minors to drink but minors get together in field parties and house parties, anyway. And, realistically, you could get a ticket for playing your music too loud and disturbing the peace. It just depends on the cop. Also, of course if a father sees his daughter behaving in a slutty manner with some new boy he's not going to want her to see him and will probably ground her. So, the point of this films is void. In the original the point was the rules were ridiculous and the parents were over the top. In this film they're mostly just being parents.<br/><br/>Also, Ren vandalized the placer where he works?? Not only is he an idiot but clearly he likes to 'cause trouble. He seems more like someone who is going to end up in jail than someone who is going to be a hero and make a difference in a town.<br/><br/>Clearly this is just a film where someone was trying to profit off the 'Step Up' success and use an old, popular brand to try to draw a crowd. Why not just let the film survive on its own rather than trying to meld some weird country and hip hop world together. It just seemed forced, calculated, ridiculous and unrealistic. If most of the film seems ridiculous and unrealistic you lose the point in watching it. I really get the sense that the writers don't have much point of reference of the world other than living in Los Angeles and watched a bunch of episodes of 'Gossip Girl' so they could understand the teen plight and how they interact, then thew a country hillbilly meets Boston spin on it. Considering, in a lot of small towns the kids are still fairly innocent and polite, it would have been easy to stick to the original film rather than try to make this an 'updated' film where all kids are angry, bratty and doing pretty much everything to make a parents cringe. Why would anyone like, admire or want to be those kids?"
"galahad58-1","3","12","16","25 March 2012"," She can dance, but she cannot act
","In 1984 Kevin Bacon starred in Footloose. It was not a great movie, but it was a fun movie that started a nice career. Now there is the remake. Remakes have a bad habit of tearing a treasured movie down and making a terrible movie in it's place. This is so true of this version of Footloose. It starts with all the bad remakes of 80's songs--why not just use the original artists rather than a terrible singer trying to sing. Like we need some bad singer remake Bonnie Tyler or Kenny Loggins. Next Julianne Hough may be able to dance and sing, but she was the absolute wrong choice for the lead actress. She is not an actress and her money may get her some roles, but she is one of those bad actresses that became popular in another genre that quickly disappears. My biggest disappointment is Dennis Quaid. What is happening with him? I was a big Quaid fan, but he is now making bad movies. He needs to reevaluate his decisions and either take roles for a man his age that have substance or retire from film."
"estreet-eva","4","8","10","31 May 2016"," Suffers as much by miscasting as the original benefited by its casting
","To the same extent Ava Gardner movies lingered on her face in the 1950's and Jessica Alba movies visually caressed her abdomen in 1990's movies so does this moving on the backside of Julianne Hough. Likely this has partially to do with Craig Brewer's personal interests and a lack of other interesting images to look at in a pointless remake of the Kevin Bacon ""classic"" (assuming you grew up in the 80's). The main drag on the film grows from the lack of a Kevin Bacon-level compelling talent among the cast. When Kenny Womald utters the iconic ""let's dance"" to the camera you could picture yourself opting to sit this one out instead. When Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father and town elder finally has his change of heart, it comes as no really emotional catharsis given Quaid's earnestness and track record as the good guy leading man. Now Randy Quaid would have made an interesting and likely challenging from a product standpoint casting choice. Julianne Hough plays Ariel as more sleazy than fun-loving and her dance moves do kind of make you agree to an extent with the Reverend. As always, Andie MacDowell brings her inexcusably flat line readings to a part that could have been cut from the film with little effect. Everyone else in the film comes across as the indistinguishable chorus line from a traveling company version of the Footloose Musical. Having said all that, the movie brings some entertaining visuals although it someone screws up the soundtrack; the version of ""Holding Out for a Hero"" used her is a sacrilege of the original Bonnie Tyler version of the Jim Steinman song. In short, see the original instead; although it wasn't very good either, the music was amazing."
"TheLittleSongbird","3","6","7","19 July 2016"," While there are worse remakes out there, 'Footloose' suffers most from not having any point to it
","Despite being an enormous hit at the time, the original 'Footloose' is somewhat of a love it/hate it film.<br/><br/>To me, it wasn't a great film, did have issues with the story, some of the script and one dance sequence (the one in the abandoned warehouse). However, the immense appeal is definitely understandable and the original 'Footloose' still stands up as an enjoyable film for the soundtrack, dancing/choreography and the casting.<br/><br/>While there are definitely worse remakes out there ('Psycho' and 'The Wicker Man'), 'Footloose' (2011) is still, like a fair few remakes, rather pointless.<br/><br/>It's not all awful. The best thing about is Miles Teller, a great and instantly appealing performance that is every bit as good as Chris Penn's in the original, the only actor in the film to have that distinction. Some of the dancing is dazzlingly good, especially Willard learning how to dance. Plus the production values are beautiful.<br/><br/>However, while the soundtrack was unforgettable and toe-tapping in the original they are forgettable here, the more contemporary and country arrangements robbing them of their catchiness and charm. The songs themselves are not bad at all, far from it, but how they're arranged are very much so. There are some great moments with the dancing, but too much of the dancing lacks the finger-snapping quality and energy of the original's choreography.<br/><br/>'Footloose' further suffers from being too faithful, with a lot of the same material but with little to none of the nostalgic charm and fun. Nothing is done also to improve on the daftness, ridiculousness and schmaltz of the story from the original, instead those problems are actually amplified here, with lots of cheese and overwrought emotion, and hurt even further by pacing that feels like one is riding on the back of a snail.<br/><br/>Miles Teller aside, though Ray McKinnon and Kim Dickens are also quite good but aren't in it enough, the cast just don't cut it, and neither does the very uninspired direction. Kenny Wormald is an incredible dancer but a lousy actor, a bland presence throughout and he is never sure whether to overact or underplay because the performance is a mess of both. Julianne Hough is beautiful, but doesn't have the confidence, vulnerability or charm to match.<br/><br/>Andie McDowell feels out of place and, with the lack of engagement with her material, looks completely cost. Dennis Quaid gives a limp and sometimes over-compensated performance, and constantly looks ill at ease. There is little chemistry between the two of them as well, the dignity and gentle touch from the original's chemistry between the two characters is missed, replaced with a sense of being condemned throughout.<br/><br/>Overall, there's worse out there but there was really not needed and the execution on its own merits is severely wanting. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
"phd_travel","4","20","31","13 April 2012"," Not enough dancing plus not very well choreographed
","The 80s version had more energy and focus. This remake was a bit lacking in impact. The story is similar to the original but here the obstacles felt contrived especially the confrontations with the trashy boyfriend. Dennis Quaid and Andie Macdowell looked like they would rather be elsewhere.<br/><br/>The group dancing and modern street style dancing isn't well choreographed and isn't exciting. Too much was done as a group and not enough emotionally interesting pairings.<br/><br/>The casting was hit and miss. Kenny Wormald isn't handsome enough for the lead even though he is a good dancer. Julianna Hough is very lovely though her dancing wan't showcased well. It couldn't have amounted to more than a few minutes.<br/><br/>Overall not a must see."

","This remake of the timeless, Kevin Bacon starring classic doesn't even make you want to tap your foot or even dance to the beat. No, it might make you want to get up and leave instead of get up and dance.<br/><br/>A fantastic director, Craig Brewer made some of the most gritty and beautifully made dramas that involve a main character, played by an African American, that has some sort of inner conflict, as well as conflict with everyday life. A great example of this is his movie ""Hustle and Flow"" which holds a 7.4 rating on IMDb and an 84% on rottentomatoes.com. Another great film of his is the somewhat well known movie ""Black Snake Moan."" Again, it involves an African American with an inner conflict and outer conflict in a gritty, edgy, dramatic setting. <br/><br/>But, what about Footloose? Why was it so bad?<br/><br/>Brewer's worst film, in my opinion, didn't work for me. Specifically, his attempts at making a remake of the 80's dance flick just didn't make me want to get up and dance. It was boring, unreal, and just didn't work for me. <br/><br/>But, what else could have made me give this movie a 2 out of 10? <br/><br/>Brewer tried to branch out and failed miserably. He wasn't himself doing this film and didn't show any parallels from his gritty dramas to this family-friendly, ""funny"" flick. The only thing I was laughing at was the fact that it was a terrible film. In no way, shape, or form would it make me want to watch the original film (if I had seen this before the original). Non-believable acting, terrible dancing scenes, and trying to be 50's-esque and integrate modern day conveniences, this movie just doesn't bust a move for me. <br/><br/>So, simply put, I'll put this in pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros: >Dennis Quaid did a pretty good job in the film. His acting was sub-par, but not fantastic. >Ren and Ariel were pretty good, in the dancing scenes. It was nice to see actual dancers playing dancers. >The setting was nice and very simplistic, yet somewhat believable. <br/><br/>Cons: >The acting was not believable in the least bit. The dancing, however, was somewhat good. >Not like the original at all. Too much going on. >Dennis Quaid, although doing a pretty good job acting, was not the right guy to play the reverend. >Dancing was a bit too flamboyant. >The only good parts of the film were the fight scenes and the credits. >Ren did not look, at all, like Kevin Bacon and did not act like him at all.<br/><br/>For all you fans of this movie and look at my other reviews, please do not judge the book by its cover. Yes, it might seem that I like horror movies and the fact that I think that every film, except for horror and comedy films are crap, I do not think that. And, don't take into account that I am a guy therefore I think all dance flicks are terrible. I am open to ALL films and this one just wasn't in the cut for me. <br/><br/>So, all in all, the remake of Footloose is, quite possibly, Brewer's worst film. I hope that Brewer will learn to stay away from dance flicks and lean more towards gritty dramas that involve an African American lead role."
"michaelhirakida","1","7","9","9 March 2015"," The Most Abysmal Remake Ever Made
","I already talked about the musical in my original review so I will not talk about it here or at least try not to or say stuff that I forgot. But seriously, I think I am the only one who agrees with Roger Ebert that the first one was bad, but the remake is bad also. But the difference is, I hate the remake even more. This might be the worst remake of all time and you will not understand the reasoning for this so I will try to explain to my very best. <br/><br/>ITS THE SAME MOVIE. ONLY DONE WORST.<br/><br/>I know a remake is suppose to be faithful to the original, but the first movie I wasn't a fan of and a lot of people weren't a fan of back then. So it would be best if they fixed these errors from the first movie and make the remake superior. BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! We have to have the same movie that feels like you have been assaulted and the movie actual gave me physical pain from watching it.<br/><br/>What scenes are still there but done worse? The Tractor Scene is replaced with Driving Race Cars, The smacking and assault of Ariel scenes are more cringe worthy to watch, the drug scene is absolutely worse in all ways, the town hall scene is word for word. You get the point? THEY WERE TOO FAITHFUL!<br/><br/>The songs are worse. Footloose is now a horrible country song ruined by Blake Shelton making the finale very hard to watch... and that's all I remember still.<br/><br/>The casting is OK for the most part. But they got the worst person to play the Reverend, DENNIS FREAKING QUAID. UGH I HATE HIM SO MUCH. WHY?! He always has the same >:I face on every single movie he is in. Why couldn't you gave the Reverend to some newcomer instead of this guy!? But enough of that.<br/><br/>I mean, I have never seen such a horrible remake in my life. They changed nothing. NOTHING! But it still made money because of a cult following. Do we want more remakes of bad films to come because of this? Like a Flashdance Remake, A Magical Mystery Tour Remake? Then please! I can't stop you. But I can only warn people about this.<br/><br/>To quote Roger Ebert: ""...The film's message is: A bad movie, if faithfully remade, will produce another bad movie.""<br/><br/>Amen.<br/><br/>22/100 D-"
"tavm","7","39","70","20 October 2011"," This version of Footloose is a pretty good remake of the original
","Full disclosure time: I saw the original 1984 version at the now-defunct Cinema 8 multiplex at the also-now defunct Bon Marche Mall (the buildings have been renovated into other places) and I remember enjoying it very much at the one time I watched it in its entirety. I had also bought the soundtrack LP album beforehand and had highly enjoyed that several times as a teenager. Then there were also videos of several of its hits like Deniece Williams' ""Let's Hear It for the Boy"", Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out for a Hero"", and Kenny Loggins' title song which consisted mainly of clips of Kevin Bacon's (or his dance double's) movements. So it was with all that in mind that I saw this remake with an open head. The verdict: I still had a good time though my excitement factor wasn't as overwhelming perhaps because of my fond memories of the original and some of the changes didn't seem necessary. Still, having the actor Miles Teller playing the same role done by Chris Penn nearly 30 years before in learning to dance and enjoying himself as a result was still a highlight in both versions. And former ""Dancing with the Stars"" pro Julianne Hough shows some chops in reenacting the Lori Singer role. And while Kenny Wormald won't make you forget Bacon in his iconic role, he's not too bad either. And the same goes for Dennis Quaid playing the John Lithgow part. So on that note, this version of Footloose is recommended."
"korneliuszen","1","5","6","9 March 2020"," A really awful remake of the 1984 masterpiece
","That sum it up. Ken Wormald's acting is far below Kevin Bacon. I actually hope Miles Teller can bring a fresh interpretation of Willard from the late Michael Penn in the 1984 version. But he cannot. He just can't. That is the point where one star is appropriate for this bad remake."

","Bad music (how was he inspired to do that warehouse routine to whatever that music was? I wasn't inspired to check the soundtrack list. I'm not against using ""modern"" music, but it needs to sound good and have a dance-able beat!) Julianne Hough seems to be about 30 with her cheerleader-worn voice, over-tan, and strip-pole dance moves (no, dad shouldn't be upset when he comes in the room to find me faux-effing some guy I barely know, who's a different guy than the one I've actually been effing{well, they left that kind of vague in the door-pulled-down scene, and when she was asked point-blank about it}- who appears to be around 30 as well, and she's a high-school student? 17 or 18? Nobody questioned that? potential statutory rape. Or the glossing over of her being beaten by him?) The lead WAS a brat, and I agree with another reviewer, completely unremarkable/memorable. boring! thankfully I saw it on DVD so I could fast-forward a lot, esp. the completely contrived and time-fill scene with the buses etc. on the racetrack. These kids actually WERE misbehaving! not just being screwed by over protective parents. As cheesy as much of it is, see the original instead. There can't be a spoiler because it's an almost complete remake (they barely tried to modernize it!) and because nothing happens."

It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.<br/><br/>Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original."
"TinyDanseur27","2","6","8","18 June 2013"," A Musical Without the Music: What's the Point?
","I was pretty disappointed with this version of Footloose. What makes Footloose such an enjoyable movie/musical is the music. Aside from a brief incorporation of the title song in the beginning, and a couple of the songs used as background music throughout the movie, this movie neglected its musical roots altogether! What a waste...<br/><br/>There were some fun dance scenes but I found myself unable to enjoy them fully because of the blatant display of Julianne Hough's sexuality. I have some words to say to the costume designer. To be fair, her character was supposed to look and act like a slut. Still, I found that the powers at be went overboard with that depiction in this version.<br/><br/>Kenny Wormald was a likable protagonist, Ren. His sidekick, Willard, played by Miles Teller was utterly preposterous however. I felt sorry for people who live in small towns in Georgia. Willard did not do much to convey a positive view of their lifestyle and culture.<br/><br/>If you like dancing, you might find this movie enjoyable for the dance scenes. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend it."

","I have not seen the original so I'm basing my opinion on just this film, and it was awful. First Julianna Hough and Kenny Wormald are horrible actors. Yes, they can dance, but giving them speaking parts equals bad idea. Second, a movie about dancing should have a great sound trak and this one was terrible. The only good song was Footloose, which of course is from the original. There's also some kind of rap/dance song in which Hough looks like a slut. I mean, she is supposed to play a high school girl, and she is wiggling all over these guys very suggestively, it's just gross and inappropriate for a movie aimed at teens. Lastly, the plot is nonexistent. It's about a town that has banned dancing. Can anyone say snooze fest.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Not worth anyone's time."

So we watched it.<br/><br/>Biggest mistake ever.<br/><br/>This movie is not only a pointless remake of a hallowed cinematic classic, it's just boring as a stand-alone movie. The film offered no redeeming qualities - none whatsoever. Even the dance sequences left me groaning and begging for the original (After completing the film, I went to YouTube and purged the old one out of me by watching the dance scenes from the original).<br/><br/>In particular, Kenny Wormald as Ren was singularly a bad choice. His performance left me wishing for Kevin Bacon (who, ironically, recently appeared on the Tonight Show for a comedic reprisal of his Footloose role). At one point, my father walked by and commented, ""He looks like a ventriloquist dummy!"" <br/><br/>Julianne Hough was also terrible as Ariel. She lacked the flirty, fun, mystery revolving around the original character. Her performance was dry, and her emotions were faked. <br/><br/>One of the worst parts about this movie was Dennis Quaid as the pastor. His performance left me literally crying in agony. I have never seen such a terrible reprisal of a role. He was dry, stereotypical, and lacked all the emotion of John Lithgow's original character.<br/><br/>Probably one of this film's only redeeming qualities was Willard, played by Miles Teller. In his surprisingly endearing performance, Miles Teller puts forth at least a decent acting effort. <br/><br/>Not much else good can be said about this film update.

"pythonkatie","3","5","7","17 March 2012"," Pro vs Con
","Pro: They added a slightly more emotional back story and had more finality to said issues. Ariel was played by an attractive woman rather that a tall 12 year old boy in a bad wig. The character of Willard could really dance, rather than learn to simply shake his hands and chest bump, and the learning to dance sequence was amusingly horrendous rather too embarrassing to watch. They actually managed to cast someone who makes Sarah Jessica Parker look attractive by comparison. The people Ren lives with are loving and supportive rather than judgmental. The dancing was overall quite impressive.<br/><br/>Con: The acting was absolutely terrible. Even the professional actors seemed to be asleep at the switch. They kept in far too many of the original lines to save it from being compared to the original, but none of the lines kept were said in a believable way. The whole point of a remake is to improve on it, not take memorable parts and ruin it. Im fine with adding new music despite the wonderful original soundtrack, but they at times played songs in the wrong places, and almost all of the remixes were terrible. The only one that didn't make me want to hit mute was ""Almost Paradise"" because it took out the 80s cliché sound the original had. Also, they kept in that horrid maroon tux."

It had amazing dance sequences and great music that left me dancing out of the theater.

Along the way, he'll attempt to woo the reverend's daughter, Ariel Shaw (Julianne Hough), while also taking down the preacher man himself (Dennis Quaid) at the city council.<br/><br/>The plot is laughable, cheesy, and amazingly Brewer manages to make it seem dramatic. No, there's never really a scene that moves past shallow, but there are moments where Hough and Wormald are able to engage in real emotions that have back-story and plausible reasoning. It's an accomplishment that should probably be awarded with an Oscar, but alas, it's not that kind of award show.<br/><br/>Among the many triumphs of Footloose, first and foremost is the dancing. It's simply stunning to watch, and is a mixture of step by step reproducing the original dance moves, and adding a new flare as well. The music is the same combination of old and new, and doesn't miss a step (except for the fact that Kenny Loggins's original Footloose plays during the opening scene where the aforementioned teenagers crash -- an obvious and egregious mixing of separate universes).<br/><br/>Special note should also be given to Miles Teller , who plays Willard, originally portrayed by Chris Penn. It seems blasphemous to say, but Teller is as charming as Penn was in 1984. It's once again proof that Brewer knew exactly what he was doing with this project, and each gamble paid off. Brewer didn't pull any punches (or slaps for that matter) in his attempt to update Footloose for the MTV generation err from the MTV generation. <br/><br/>Okay, the whole MTV generation thing is confusing. Brewer achieves the update however, despite everything working against him, managing to gives the audience something between a choking laugh and a smile. <br/><br/>Overall<br/><br/>Casting two professional dancers in the lead roles turned out to be a winning decision in regards to dramatic elements, as well as the physical/musical ones. it's a shame that Footloose has to exist in the world, but now that it does, this reviewer is okay with it. Strip away all the years of Saturday night on TNT love for the original, and Footloose (2011) is just as exciting, cheesy, and engaging as the original (even without the Bacon).<br/><br/>On the Side <br/><br/>It's nice to see Dennis Quaid in a role that he doesn't phone in. Still, he's borderline. Maybe he just Skyped it in this time."

"moviexclusive","Null","6","14","18 October 2011"," Hewing a little too slavishly close to the original, this remake is nonetheless a surprisingly character-driven drama that possesses the exuberant spirit of the 1984 classic
","What's the indie director of gritty pulp fare like 'Hustle and Flow' and 'Black Snake Moan' doing at the helm of a '80s teenage movie remake? Well frankly we were not quite sure till we caught his updated version of 'Footloose', and realised that director and co-writer Craig Brewer saw something much more within the original that went beyond the regular 'Step Up', 'Stomp the Yard' and 'StreetDance' modern-day teen-dance movies.<br/><br/>Like those films, 'Footloose' is about celebrating the spirit of youth through the freedom of movement, so expect the characters to speak passionately about how dancing isn't just a frivolous activity, or worse still an act of rebellion against authority. But while these other films were simply content to wow their audiences with some spectacular dance moves, Brewer surprisingly places story and character front and centre, using dance only as a device to either.<br/><br/>Beginning with a toe-tapping prologue set to a hip-hop version of Kenny Loggins' title tune, Brewer and his co-writer Dean Pitchford (who was behind the 1984 original) kicks things off with a literal bang when five teenagers are killed in a road accident after a night out partying and most importantly dancing. Among the dead is the son of Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid), a preacher in the small town of Bomont, who believes the act is a test from the Lord and exhorts the local community to put its young people under curfew and ban loud music and public dancing.<br/><br/>Even from these opening minutes, it is clear that Brewer's writing possesses admirable finesse- and instead of the fire and brimstone we would expect from a caricatured depiction of a Southern preacher, we get the deeply personal words of Rev. Moore that ring with the agony and grief of a parent. Into this restrictive environment enters big-city kid Ren McCormick (newcomer Kenny Wormald), who has returned to stay with his aunt and uncle after burying his mother.<br/><br/>Ren's first brush with the strictures of the town is getting fined for cranking the music in his yellow VW bug too loudly, and let's just say that his reputation with the adult townsfolk just goes downhill from there. Those familiar with the original will start noticing the similarities between Brewer's update and its source- the yellow VW for one, and also the Rev Moore's rebellious daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) who is not quite the same after her brother's death. <br/><br/>Exchanging tractors in the original for racecars, the modern-day Ariel still lives on the edge by dating a local racing lout Chuck (Patrick John Flueger), but is immediately drawn to Ren following a clandestine dance session at an outdoor movie theatre. Ren and Ariel's mutual attraction fuels the tension at the heart of the story, first between Ren and Chuck as romantic rivals who duke it out in a dirt-track race using modified school buses, and then later between Ren and the Rev. Moore who sees Ariel's errant ways as a result of Ren's bad influence.<br/><br/>It takes a while for Brewer to set up these characters and their relationships, so expect the first hour- that also contains the jealous boyfriend element which kinda falls flat- to be less fleet-footed than you would expect. Nonetheless, the pace picks up considerably once Ren decides to start a petition to end the law against public dancing, which also puts him on a direct collision course with Rev. Moore. The dynamic between these two characters is especially interesting- one the father grieving over the loss of his son; and the other a son grieving over the loss of his mother- and a scene where they come to mutual understanding of their common circumstances is deeply poignant.<br/><br/>But Brewer doesn't forget he's making a commercial product, not one of his specialty films, so he hasn't left out the obligatory comic relief that comes in the form of Ren's awkwardly shy best buddy Willard (Miles Teller). Deserving of special mention, Teller delivers a charmingly goofy performance radically different from his last appearance in 'Rabbit Hole' that is about as endearing as it gets. The hilarity is fortunate, for the dance sequences, while well integrated into the flow of the story, are quite forgettable- even the 'angry dance' replicated from the original by Ren at an abandoned warehouse after being wrongfully accused of drug possession. Choreographer Jamal Sims still makes these sequences look good on screen, but there isn't anything on display that will make you go 'wow'.<br/><br/>Bland is also the same description that can be used with lead actor Wormald, who could very well do with a little more of the film's own advice of cutting loose. Playing Ren all too straight-laced, there is too little of the brashness and insouciance in his performance that is required of his character. Hough fares much better, the 'Dancing with the Stars' alum absolutely luminous and sexy as Ariel in clothes so tight that 'if you put a quarter in her back pocket you can tell whether it's heads or tails'. Still, Wormald and Hough have good chemistry together, both of them better dancers than they are actors.<br/><br/>Of course, given the uncharacteristically character-driven approach Brewer has taken with the material, one wishes for better lead actors to play Ren and Ariel. Yet there is still much to enjoy about this remake of a generation's classic, which is a surprisingly solid movie with strong story and character elements. And though it is true his version veers closely to the original, it is clear that Brewer has taken great effort to craft a remake that pays homage to its source while introducing the 'Footloose' revolution to a new generation. It may not get to its feet as often as you would want it to, but its spirit of living out loud and cutting it loose is still very much alive. <br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

I definitely thought the girl, while pretty, is just a floozie. How can you like her or the things that come out of her mouth? Willard was a great character.

"freedonian-563-387177","Null","11","35","29 July 2011"," Saw Advance Screening of Brewer's Footloose- Outstanding.
","I was not expecting a great film, to be perfectly honest. The original was fun, but silly, a big wad of bubble gum for the brain. Its plot was silly, its characters were anemically underdeveloped, but it was fun. Silly fun, but fun.<br/><br/>Craig Brewer's remake kept the fun--- No, improved upon the fun, but featured fully developed characters that were deserving of whatever empathy the audience can give them.<br/><br/>For the first time, you get to see what drives these characters. What makes this dance, this fight, so important to Ren? What makes Ariel the self-destructive party girl? But the biggest character improvement has to be Rev. Shaw. John Lithgow did a great job in the original, making you hate him the beginning and feel empathy for the changes he goes through along the way. But Dennis Quaid's version of the same character tugs at the heartstrings from his first moment on screen and never loses his humanity in quite the same way. Just as in the original, Ren McCormick is the McGuffin--- The thing that it's about that it's not really about. Footloose is really the story of Rev. Shaw's struggle to become a better man and better father.<br/><br/>I cannot heap enough praise on the cast. Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough were utterly remarkable as Ren and Ariel, transforming them into characters that are easy to care about. Ariel was annoying in the original; The remake has you pleading ""Will someone please help this lost child?"" Miles Teller very nearly steals the show, as his predecessor Chris Penn did. Ziah Colon plays Ariel's friend Rusty as a character rather the prop that she was in the original. And Ray McKinnon put on a scene-stealing performance as Ren's Uncle Wes.<br/><br/>Don't let the character development lead you to believe that the pace is slower, or that it is less fun. To the contrary, Brewer has made a very fun, fast paced movie.<br/><br/>The true difference is this: The original film was quite content to treat its southern characters as rednecks, people to be made fun of. You don't laugh with those characters. You laugh AT them.<br/><br/>Brewer is a Tennessean (Which is why I was lucky enough to catch this screening in Memphis) and truly loves the South. And he never allowed his characters to devolve into caricatures.<br/><br/>If there is any justice, this will be one of the bigger films this year. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I saw an early cut--- Brewer said before the screening that there were three audio cues that were to be recut, and the closing credits were not finished.<br/><br/>But make no mistake, I will see it again when it opens."
"daym-733-122443","5","6","17","14 October 2011"," Surprisingly entertaining, even though it's a remake.
","So, I won't lie, I went into this movie very skeptical and scoffing at the idea of a remake of Footloose. After seeing it advertised endlessly and not generally being interested, I only went with friends because it was one of the few movies we could agree on. Two hours later, however, I walked of the theater with a grin from ear to ear.<br/><br/>This might be attributed to the great atmosphere in the theater; between my friends and everyone else there, we were all having a great time laughing and cheering and commenting on things. However, the movie itself was quite entertaining as well. Without going into to much detail, this is Footloose, almost just like you knew it, just in the modern day and with new actors. Not all of the actors are perfect, but, as a whole, they have a charm about them that makes you like them.<br/><br/>The dancing, obviously, is wonderful. Almost all the dance scenes are energetic and interesting, filled with some great moves from all cast members. The music, while still retaining some of the classics, is updated with mixed results. Not all of the songs are as fun as the originals but it is understandable for the modern tone here.<br/><br/>On a bad note, though, there are some parts of the film that aren't the best. Some plot holes (a character getting arrested but showing up later) and a story we all already know by heart don't make the plot anything to write home about. There are also some questionable scenes that feel odd in how they were updated (I'm looking at you new ""tractor race"" and solo dance in the warehouse).<br/><br/>Overall, though, I had a blast. I laughed, I jived as much as my seat would allow me, and I genuinely had a good time which is what I went to the movies for in the first place. I'm not sure why everyone is being so hard on this movie; it's quit a good adaptation that brings Footloose's energy and excitement to a new generation. If you go in with an open mind, and fun-loving people, expect to have a blast; just don't hope for anything new."
"calicritic","5","6","17","28 August 2011"," Not good,not bad,just kinda average
","I was able to catch an early promotional screening of the remake of Footloose on August 25th in San Diego. When I got my pass to it,I finally decided to watch the original Footloose for the first time,which I really enjoyed. A remake of this film sounded so pointless,especially of its MTV-esque ""Step Up"" vibe it added to appeal to this generation,but I must say that I didn't hate this film as much as I thought I would.<br/><br/>Instead of coming from Chicago,the new Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) arrives in Bomont,GA,to live with his aunt and uncle's family. However,he arrives in a town that has outlawed loud music and dancing due to the deaths of five high school students in a car accident that mixed together alcohol and loud music. He decides to start a rebellion against the town's preacher Reverend Moore (Dennis Quaid) to abolish the law in time for the senior dance. Basically,if you have seen the original film,you pretty much already know the main plot but since this is a remake and the fact that it's set in the south,it sets up a new town culture along with modern music.<br/><br/>I expected Kenny Wormald to suck the life out the character of Ren McCormack, but he surprisingly did a halfway-decent job. However,he is definitely no Kevin Bacon! Julianne Hough on the other hand,I thought did a better job that Lori Singer playing Ariel Moore. She looked more believable as a high school student than Lori Singer did in the original,and she never took the role too seriously. Dennis Quaid also did a decent job as the new Reverend Moore,but maybe he had to step it up when his agent told him you're going to have to match the way The Trinity Killer played him 27 years ago (Dexter FTW). Otherwise,everyone else was very average in their performances,especially Andie Macdowell whose portrayal of Vi Moore was treated as a neglected aspect in this version.<br/><br/>Director Craig Brewer did a pretty good job at staying true to the original film,but his Southern grit style that has been present in has past films Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan is one thing that brings this movie down. The southern culture is very evident throughout the film,but there are points where it makes it a bit too annoying. The dance choreography was pretty good,but there are two scenes involving a rap song being played that that really killed the vibe in comparison to the original film. However,I think that Brewer did a good job with 3 scenes in particular: the opening credits scene,the ""Teaching Willard to dance"" scene,and the ending dance number even though there's a new version of the Footloose song played for modern audiences only.<br/><br/>Overall,the Footloose remake is not as bad as I thought it would be,but at the same time,I found it quite useless to remake an 80s classic that starred one of my favorite actors Kevin Bacon. This generation's MTV fans and Step Up franchise fanatics will enjoy it a lot,but I have a strong feeling that fans of the original will pass it off as a useless remake,despite it staying mostly true to the 80s classic.<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"g-bodyl","7","4","10","8 May 2013"," Is This Remake Necessary?
","The remake of the 1984 classic Footloose is not a bad movie and is actually quite fun at times, but was it necessary to remake a movie that doesn't need a remake? I mean both of these movies are very similar to each other with the exception of some very minor plot changes. The music is good to listen to as always since the Kenny Loggins hit song is still a classic. I won't lie that I had the itch to get up and dance a few times. But quality-wise, it's on par with the original and possibly maybe a little less.<br/><br/>Craig Brewer's film is about a guy named Ren who moves to a Tennessee town and finds out dancing is illegal because of a fatal accident. He falls in love with the preacher's daughter and Ren decides to do all he can to bring dancing and rock'n'roll back in town.<br/><br/>The acting isn't really that bad. Kenny Wormald is a decent choice to play Ren but obviously no one will beat Kevin Bacon. Julianne Hough is also decent as the preacher's daughter and Dennis Quaid makes a tough minister.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good film but as it's almost the same as the original even when it comes to dialogue, I can't help feeling I'm actually reviewing the original. This has some good songs and people of today's generation will probably like this more than those who grew up with the original. I rate this film 7/10."

","A terrific remake on par with the original from 1984 with Kevin Bacon. TMG generally scorns remaking good films, but this one hits the mark.

Dennis Quaid takes the role of the father-preacher held in the original by John Lithgow and does a decent job. So why does this film work so well again? The dancing is literally off the wall great. Visit ArtandJoyofMovies.com and listen to America's No.1 radio show on movies.<br/><br/>The Footloose story is loosely based upon the history of Elmore City, Oklahoma, not the fictional city of Bomont, Midwest Somewhere. While Elmore had banned dancing for 100 years until high school kids changed things in 1980, both 1984 and 2011 versions are based upon a ban arising from a tragic car accident after a party five years earlier.

","I saw the Footloose remake in 2011 and thought it was a very good movie. I found it funny, sad, dramatic, romantic, and toe-tapping fun. I liked the original a lot but hated the book-burning scene. I liked the cast in the new one. I usually am not very fond of unknown actors but Kenny Wormald who played Ren did a great job and won me over. He was funny, handsome, and a good dancer. He looks a bit like Kevin Bacon. The cast was top notch. The best performances were by Kenny Wormald, Dennis Quaid, Julianne Hough, Andie Mcdowall, Miles Teller, and John Patrick Flueger. Dennis Quaid was as good as John Lithgown was in the original. His portrayal of Rev. Shaw Moore was good, in this one he just seemed too over-protective of the town and his daughter Ariel. In this one he hates Ren at first but begins to like him. In the original John Lithgow did a great job but at times he was too much of a jerk. Julianne Hough was funny and sexy as Ariel. She did much better then Lori Singer was in the old version. I liked that the old version of the songs appeared in the film and I liked Blake Shelton's cover of the title song. Blake Shelton sang the song good but the Kenny Loggins version was better. I like the cover of Almost Paradise better then the old version. I thought Miles Teller was great as Ren's redneck pal Willard. He was goofy and just as great as Chris Penn in the original. I liked when Ren taught him how to dance. I liked that the cast was not just all white people. I liked the Latin beauty who played Ariel's pal Rusty. And two characters Woody and Andy Beamis who were white in the old one were black in this version. This version is modern but is quite faithful to the classic one. Most of the great lines were the same. I liked the dance at the end, and I liked it when Ren confronted the council. John Patrick Flueger was somewhat scary as Ariel's older boyfriend Chuck Cranston. He was an ignorant ass and he became a good villain. I did not like it when he fought Ariel but I'm glad she smashed his truck. She did not take crap from anyone. I also liked the fight scene at the end when he and his gang fought Willard and Ren. Ren kicked his ass and saved the day. Footloose is a great movie even though it is a remake of a classic. People need to see it because they'll have a great time."

The town Council, prompted by Councilman and preacher - and father of the dead lad who was driving - Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) passes a batch of laws to protect their kids, including the outlawing of loud music and dancing in public. Into this town, three years later, comes Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) to live with his Aunt and Uncle following his mother's death. Knowing nothing of the laws he immediately falls foul of the local over-zealous police officer, and gets labelled as a bad influence. He joins in the youth underground music/dancing culture, gets very taken with the preacher's daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) and becomes the driving force behind a move to try to make the town's elders understand that the time has come for them to loosen their grip somewhat.<br/><br/>This is essentially a feelgood musical comprising a number of musical/dance routines (given a strong leaning towards line dancing) hung on a light rebellious youth plot and, as such, it achieves what it sets out to do perfectly satisfactorily - the musical numbers are all enjoyably executed.<br/><br/>There is an almost irrelevant subplot about Ariel's relationship with an abusive boyfriend, and there are some amusing goings on involving Ren's new best friend Willard (Miles Teller) and his inability to dance. Two songs from the original are brought in - Footloose and Let's Hear It For The Boy - and both are given affectionate framings. And it is interesting to have a film where almost all the dramatic tension is driven by Survivor's Guilt - this motivates Ren, Ariel, Preacher Moore, and the town's Councilmen. It is clear that this is a major factor in everything that happens: it is rightly touched upon and, equally rightly given the nature of the film, it is never laboured.<br/><br/>The actors are a pleasure. Dennis Quaid who, of late, has delivered performance which are, to be as kind as possible, phoned in (yes, Pandorum, I'm talking about you. You too, Legion. And GI Joe), here shows us a man whose knee-jerk, grief-driven reaction to do the right thing, has blinded him to the wrong things which have resulted from it. Kenny Wormald (who bears a strong resemblance to English actor Jeremy Edwards) does a nice job of developing Ren from a slightly sullen youth dealing with his own grief to an independent minded young man with many good qualities. Miles Teller is amusing, and the chemistry between the cast, especially the younger members (who can all dance, it goes without saying) is excellent.<br/><br/>But the standout here is Julianne Hough. She can dance, she is achingly beautiful as well as eye-wateringly sexy, and she can act too. She has a couple of moments which merit comment, one involving an argument with her father and the other a brief moment when it is heart-stoppingly clear that, in her case, Survivor's Guilt has damaged her more than anyone realised. And, at the risk of showing myself up to be completely superficial, I must say that she jiggles nicely when she dances. She is going places, I hope."

","OK. I'm biased when it comes to movies I like or movies I like and they were from my youth.<br/><br/>However, I will support reboots or new movies which are from the same story provided they are inline with the same emotion and cinematography<br/><br/>Take the original movie from 1984. It was based on a real story about a town of religious fanatics who outlawed dancing. Not only outlawed it, they made it illegal to the point where kids could be arrested just like they could for under aged drinking. No, its true.<br/><br/>This new movie does not have any emotion like the first movie. If you were going to make a new movie about the same subject, you must follow the guidelines. Use new actors, put it in a different town, but keep the same story. Heck, change all the names of all the characters and instead of religious nut jobs, make it a government issue or a zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>This reboot is a teenie bopper movie. It is made for the crowd of kids who are not in to Nickelodeon any more and are just about to go in to high school. It's like High School Musical but worse.<br/><br/>They completely eliminated all other generations for wanting to watch this movie."

","Okay... I understand, remake and that says to me, that not all of it is going to be just like the original, but some of the story is similar and I think they nailed ""Willard's"" character perfectly. With that being said, that's about it. I grew up watching the original 1984 ""Footloose"", and that's a classic!!! I'm more trying to watch it now, but can't because it's not grabbing my attention like the original one does. As the great Peter Quill would ask ""is Footloose still the greatest movie ever made?"" and now we'd have to make sure we say, ""sure, the 1984 version is the best and greatest version, for sure"". Poor Peter Quill... He'd be so upset like the rest of us... Please stop doing remakes Hollywood and get new ideas."

"cutecwhoa","Null","3","8","13 November 2011"," It wasn't the worst remake, but it was a major disappointment.
","This was a good movie, if it wasn't a remake. If they had never come out with the original footloose and this was a random movie that was made and not a remake it would have been worth watching, but knowing how great the original Footloose was this movie was abysmal. Julianne Hough, did a good job, but doesn't compare to Lori Singer, the original Arial. It seemed as if she didn't put enough effort into the character she was playing, and when they gave her a line that was word for word from the original script she tried way too hard to make it right she butchered the original line.However, Kenny Wormald did an OK job as Ren MacCormick, but he could never out shine the original actor, Kevin Bacon. Yes he is a great dancer and yes he did a good acting the part, but when it came to having the charm and problems of Ren MacCormick he was no good at making it believable. The part that really made me wanna turn away from the movie was the scene when Ren is upset and lets out his anger in dance. they ruined the scene the original scene was much more heart racing and more wow then the one in the remake most definitely. That said, another thing that made me not like the remake is the way they killed the original songs, either use the same song or a different one don't have new singers remake the song and use it! One of my favorite songs in the movie is Hero originally sung by Bonnie Tyler. In this remake they decided to make it a slow song and that was a major mistake! However, Blake Shelton's remake of Kenny Loggins Footloose was amazing! The only character i cared for was Miles Teller who played Willard. He sounded and had the same sense of humor as Chris Penn who had played the original. I think he is the only one who had actually kept me entertained and brought me back to the original. Im not even gonna go into detail of Dennis Quaid's part of Shaw. Just gonna say awful! all in all this was an OK movie but i have to say, major disappointment!"
"DICK STEEL","5","3","8","25 October 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Footloose
","No music no life, and for some, it's no dance no life. My memory of Footloose back in the 80s when I first saw it as a young boy, was Kevin Bacon, and the nifty dance moves that he did not perform. So do we need another remake to correct that, through the casting of a proper dancer in the lead role? In many ways this film by Craig Brewer is unnecessary, being nothing other than a platform to launch or further the acting careers of the multi-talented lead cast, and to satisfy his inner geek of coming up with his own vision of one of his favourite films, but in reality I'd rather stick to the Kevin Bacon version please, even if it meant having a stunt dance double twirl around the screen. It's almost as good as the original, almost, but lacking a little bit of its own soul since it's a superficial copy at best.<br/><br/>There's no major change to the structure of the story, set in a small town where loud music and public dancing are banned, following a tragedy involving the accident and deaths of a few high school kids after a dance party fueled by alcohol, and the knee jerk reaction to this is to outright ban such activity, obtaining the stamp of approval by the town's pastor Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) to impose a tight rein on morals, enforced by the cop with an attitude Herb (Jayson Warner Smith). But as we know all too well, what you ban never really stays away, as all you do is to force it underground, which the young and the rebellious would take to like fish to water.<br/><br/>As a teenage/young adult film, themes like challenging the status quo, or authoritative figures, is never quite far off, and usually it takes an outsider to come into a closed community to shake things up a little, and wake people up from their slumber of complacency. This change agent and catalyst comes in the form of Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) who following the death of his mom and the unknown whereabouts of his dad, made the trek from Boston to his relatives in Bomont, looking very must the angst-filled young man coming with plenty of family and emotional baggage and looking for any outlet he can to release pent up frustration, from a souped up Beetle, to of course, loud music and dance. Being told he can't do any of it means a set up for a rage against the system.<br/><br/>But before that comes the romantic aspects in the form of the village bicycle, so ironically the preacher's daughter herself Ariel Moore (Julianne Hough) who parties like there's no tomorrow, and with a token red neck, race car boyfriend Chuck Cranston (Patrick John Flueger) in tow who doesn't like that Ren can dance into the heart of his woman. So begins the love triangle, and the usual plotting about having a best friend (Miles Teller) who can't dance but can do so after a training montage.<br/><br/>In essence you'll know just what to expect since the story's basically the same, about not judging a book by his cover, where the townsfolk slowly realize that Ren's pretty much the harmless guy despite his macho exterior. I mean, the guy dances, and dances well, and Kenny Wormald has the advantage of being a professionally trained dancer to pull this role off convincingly, though it would be a stretch if one considers this film to be his calling card ala what Saturday Night Fever did for John Travolta. Having Juliianne Hough play that romantic interest also seemed like a logical choice given her career thus far, and undoubtedly these two look great together whenever they heat up the dance floor, be it improvised numbers, or conforming to the steps of a line dance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that's about the best parts of the film, although the dances with their stylish choreography somewhat pales in comparison in just about any big budgeted Bollywood film item number. There are some nice attempts at enriching the plot, but these remains just attempts as a number of scenes just fly by for the sake of, such as the drug incident at the library and the aftermath with the school principal, or the very fleeting non-discussion between separation of church and state, which will work as timely reminders for the religious over-zealous folks around us, that it's almost always counter-productive if one gets pushy in wanting everyone to adopt one's moral compass. Unnecessary distraction in the form of Ren's car having its hood appear and disappear also inferred scenes got shifted around because of indecision.<br/><br/>It's a good thing nobody had the insane idea of reworking the theme song for Footloose, but given the country version covered by Blake Sheldon, I'd still say, like the film, to give me the original please, with Kenny Loggins. Strictly meant for those who haven't seen the original or the fanbase of Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough, otherwise go dig up the original."
"Ryan_MYeah","7","4","13","7 October 2011"," Not particularly perfect, but humorous, toe tapping, and decently told for what it is.
","I got a chance to attend an advanced screening of Footloose, the remake of the 1984 original film.<br/><br/>Boston born teenager, Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald), leaves behind a troubled past in his old town, moving to Bomont, Tennessee, where dancing was outlawed through a notion by the local Reverend (Dennis Quaid) after a tragic car crash three years earlier. Ren decides to challenge the ban on dancing, and falls for the Reverend's daughter (Julianne Hough).<br/><br/>Footloose is not that special of a story. Character arcs are formulaic, several actions in the film are reckless, but at least they have a decent cast to lift them above that. Dennis Quaid is great, Kenny Wormald is decent enough, and Miles Teller is a riot of hilarity as Willard (Ren's clueless friend). I also really enjoyed the dance sequences, which featured some really slick choreography.<br/><br/>But not everything in the film works, including Julianne Hough. Her acting never really impressed me, she seems a bit too old for the role, and her character is under written.<br/><br/>All in all, Footloose is just fine for some light entertainment.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"
"fredericksmith1952","8","3","9","15 March 2012"," Footloose is about more than dancing, although Kenny Wormwald certainly can do that.
","Footloose is about more than dancing, although Kenny Wormwald certainly can do that. Footloose is a classic tale of tragedy and redemption, about the differences between teens and adults, about the way we see ourselves and others. Craig Brewer has managed to update this classic film without losing one iota of the feel of the original. Kenny Wormwald is excellent as Ren, the out of town boy thrust into the small country town environment. Julianne Hough plays the minister's daughter with a flair that shows some insight into the dynamics of a family dealing with the loss of a child. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell were perfect choices for the minister and his wife, and Quaid adds a different perspective to the role than Lithgow's original portrayal. Ray McKinnon gives us a new look at his ability to adapt his normally more aggressive character acting to a kinder, gentler advocate, and Kim Dickens provides just the right touch as the aunt. Very appealing were the characters of Willard and Rusty, played by newcomers Miles Teller and Ziah Colon. Filmed in the small town of Acworth, Georgia, the photography and cinematography are excellent. Rated PG-13 for language, sexual content, and some violence and drug use, this is a film, with correct parental supervision, should be viewable by the entire family. Collectible? No, go get the original."
"DarkVulcan29","7","3","9","19 October 2011"," Alright, but not as memorable has the original.
","I really believe that if not for High School Musical and Glee fame, Footloose would not have been touched. I remember seeing the original when I was a kid. Such 80's classics like The Karate Kid and Arthur are getting remade, now it's Footlooes turn.<br/><br/>The dancing is good, but going after in the musical style of dancing, rather than just going after kids having fun. It's not bad, but the overly rehearsal in the dancing begins to show. Now the filmmakers wanna bet that we saw the original, they through out things that remind us of the original Footloose.<br/><br/>Kenny Wormald as Ren, was alright, he plays the part to the best to his advantage, and he is a good dancer, but he just does not have Kevin Bacons rebellious charm, he's just so subtle in the role.<br/><br/>Julianne Hough didn't have me convinced that she is a wild child, the way Lori Singer did in the original, although she does have one good dramatic scene. But other than that she did not convince me she was a wild child.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid has the preacher, Quiad is a good actor. But just does,nt have John Lithgow commanding presence. But like Wormald does give it his all. So I'll give them all credit for trying.<br/><br/>Although amusing, this remake failed to be as memorable as the original. But You'll probably see it for the dancing and the music."

","I really enjoyed Footlose, it was actually not how I expected it to be. I don't think I've ever walked out the cinema with such a gleam on my face. if you enjoy positive movies you WILL enjoy this film. Perhaps the film is much better without seeing the original, however I reckon there is a large audience who will love the film as I did.<br/><br/>Despite the film having an overzealous Christianity theme, the film is still great. The dancing is nothing short of brilliant sometimes, and is so good to see traditional street dance as opposed to 'modern street'. And watch out for the lead woman actress, because wow is she hot! So go see it and enjoy yourself!"
"TrevorJD","7","4","14","3 October 2011"," Cut loose and see Footloose 2011!
","Preview screening on Monday 3 October 2011: I saw the original version of Footloose as a teenager and quite enjoyed it, particularly the music. As a result the film and its soundtrack will forever remind me of my adolescence. I would not have thought 27 years later that I would be sitting in a cinema watching a remake of it but hence I did and thoroughly enjoyed it. Quite a few of the songs from the original movie are still in this version, and while the story is still basically the same the film contains more racially diverse characters (something that was sadly lacking from the original) and a fairly snappy script. The original of course made a big star out of Kevin Bacon in the main role of Ren McCormack, and Kenny Wormald fills those shoes very well. His pretty boy looks and great dance moves will only get him so far but thankfully he can also act. Julianne Hough as the rebellious preacher's daughter looks beautiful and does an admirable job as Ariel. However it is Miles Teller as Willard, Ren's friend who cannot dance, that almost steals the movie. Willard's self deprecating hick southern character is played with much style by Teller. Dennis Quaid as Reverend Shaw Moore is suitably morose as the preacher / father in support of the ban on dancing in the little town of Boton, though I thought John Lithgow encapsulated the character better in the original. Craig Brewer who wrote and directed 2005's acclaimed Hustle and Flow has done a very good job with this remake of Footloose and the audience I saw it with seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. So cut loose and see Footloose 2011 as it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie."
"MosHr","6","4","14","10 September 2011"," Deep southern fried footloose
","The new footloose is a real hodgepodge; dancing, Southern culture, love story, family, church, tragedy all sort of power-blended into with the spices of music styles of blues, country, Jack White and the footloose theme song. While perhaps brilliant in small areas, it doesn't make for a good film.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's because I'm a guy, I found Julianna Hough's character fascinating or maybe it's because it's something the director really knows how to do well. It's basically the same character as Christia Ricci's in Black Snake Moan. The themes are all there, young confused beautiful girl that's rebelling in sexuality but meets salvation from her troubles from a man who refuses the sexual advances for something more gentlemanly. Saying that, Justin Timberlake's acting and character in Black Snake Moan was one of the most atrocious things on a major movie. The new-comer dancing Kenny Wormald fares a lot better but doesn't manage to shine. Ren played by Kenny, never really exudes rebellion nor does the chemistry with Ariel (Hough) truly sizzle. He exudes the sinuous athleticism but rarely convinces as a public orator or as a rebel or a lover. Dennis Quaid doesn't look the part of a preacher and feels way too hip to be an antagonist to dancing.<br/><br/>For a movie with dancers in the lead, the movie is quite restrained in the dancing department. It is almost stolen by Willart (Miles Teller) who does his amateurish renditions that almost outshine Ren. There is never a real sizzling dance between Ren and Ariel except for a short one in a drive in movie field that is never given the full treatment. Even the factory solo dancing isn't cathartic and explosive enough to awe. The soundtrack that mixes blues, country, rock and with a very little pop does give the movie a distinctive feel but really detracts from dancing since the choreographers don't really become inventive with the odd soundtrack. The angst, family drama and tragedy never seem to gel with the footloose skeleton borrowed from the original movie, nor does it really gel with the dancing.<br/><br/>While the movie is truly Brewer's footloose, the movie would have greatly benefited from either more dancing or a more introspective study of catharsis through dance by a more charismatic lead. As it is, it's an odd movie - riding on the footloose name while trying to explore themes perhaps not quite suitable to a dance movie."

","Now this is what I'm talking about! A remake made by people who obviously love the original (it's packed with nifty visual and aural tributes to the 1984 film) without being enslaved to it. From the terrific opening credit sequence on, this is non-stop entertainment - getting the guy who directed BLACK SNAKE MOAN and HUSTLE AND FLOW to reboot FOOTLOOSE was a brilliant idea, as he perfectly combines his own preoccupations (mainly having to do with his continuing examination of the American south) with the structure of the original to make a film that's both personal expression and mainstream entertainment. Everyone who's hating on this based on the teaser should keep an open mind - after all, thou shalt not judge a film by its trailer. Far from being a STEP UP retread (as many people who haven't seen it have theorized), this is a movie with a diverse range of music and a gorgeous visual style - and having the hottest chick on earth in the female lead doesn't hurt."

I made it a point to go up to Mr. Brewer after the movie and tell him that I was mad at him. The movie was so good I don't want to wait 2 1/2 months, for it to officially hit theaters, to see it again. I was really impressed with how true to the original he kept this new film, but also in how the minor changes really made it more modern.

"bjones","Null","3","10","20 October 2011"," An entertaining film
","This modern remake of a cultish classic is at least as palatable as the original. The updates work well for this kind of film, which is, admittedly, a semi-musical. So I was pleasantly surprised that it was worth the price of admission, with some change back to boot.<br/><br/>To make it enjoyable the film at least had to do the music and dancing well, which it did. The two young stars, Julianne Hough as Ariel Moore (a preacher's daughter) and an unknown for me; Kenny Wormald as Ren MacCormack, did deliver on the dance floor. Both of them are superb dancers and Hough, especially, looked great in the saloon, line dancing scene. I think part of the reason she's amazing to watch is because she looks like she's having the time of her life.<br/><br/>But music and dancing can't be the whole movie, we hope, so there has to be dabs of acting to weld the disparate pieces together. The sparks to accomplish the welds are some fine moments by all the supporting actors. It leads off with Dennis Quaid, playing Hough's ministerial father. He's turned into an excellent actor over the years and is believable in the role. There is also Ray McKinnon as Wormald's uncle. He's an asset to the film, one of the best actors on screen that night. Miles Teller as Willard, Wormald's side-kick was surprisingly good, an engaging personality that gave some comedic relief to the rest of the proceedings. The rest of the supporting cast were assets as well; Andie MacDowell as Hough's mother. Then there was Patrick John Flueger as Chuck Cranston, the resident bad guy along with the town meanie played by Brett Rice as Roger Dunbar. Also, worth note was Ziah Colon as Rusty; Hough's friend.<br/><br/>But the real acting surprise, and treat, was Ms. Hough. She was not only believable in just the right degree at the serious, crucial, points but solid throughout. The character she played called for a fair range of emotions and it was a genuine pleasure to watch her deliver every time. Even in the films early scenes, she looked radiant sans makeup. I appreciated the addition of those glimpses of her natural state, because as a trained artist I saw them as a great study in the structure of a classic beauty. I think she's the rare girl who looks just as beautiful without the makeup. And on top of that she can act. In this instance, she clearly outshines the female lead in the original. Hough's stunning looks are soon overshadowed in the film by the sheer talent she so effortlessly gives the audience.<br/><br/>By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/"

Understanding that re-makes need updated portrayals of their plots, I think the new FOOTLOOSE is a success! This is a dance movie with plenty of well thought-out and well executed dance moves, that are inspiring to any dancer, which could easily gain a reputation as ""Footloose Style"", just as the ""Flashdance Style"" became known after the movie ""Flashdance"". Music is good, acting is believable, scenes are interesting - By the way, who is that pretty chic with the long auburn hair in the grand stand during one of the early race scenes?

"pturner1010","6","3","11","7 October 2011"," Pointless for fans of the original, fun for everyone else.
","I admit I went into this rehash expecting to hate it. I watched the trailer and cringed. I watched the 1984 original trailer and my heart went out to all the fans of Kevin Bacon and his classic 80s rendition of the film. I thought of how I would feel if some hack director for hire dared to remake 1985's The Breakfast Club or The Goonies or Back to the Future. <br/><br/>Just think if 1984's Footloose can be remade in 2011, all these classics could be despoiled for 2012 audiences. That's next freaking year! So if you want to avoid this (and the unleashing of Armageddon with it), don't, whatever you do, pay to see this remake in the cinema. It will only encourage Hollywood to keep sacrificing originality at the altar of making a quick and (relatively) easy buck. <br/><br/>That said, I have a few admissions to make: 1. I've never seen the original Footloose. Kevin Bacon is great but dancing movies just aren't my thing so it was never really on my list of missed classics that I had to watch. 2. Like I said I don't particularly like dancing films or even musicals or teen romances. So I've never seen Save the Last Dance, Honey, Stomp the Yard, You Got Served or even West Side Story. 3. I actually thoroughly enjoyed the Footloose remake.<br/><br/>Why? Well I'm sure most of these reasons extend to the original. The dancing's great. The story (though a little ridiculous) is involving and the characters engaging. The forces of religion and the law versus the kids of the small town make for a compelling and righteous battle between order and chaos. In this age of the curtailing of civil liberties under the guise of protecting us from evil, perhaps this remake is actually rather relevant.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid is always very good value, no matter how poor the script but his character here is well-rounded and sympathetic even when banning dancing and public gatherings.<br/><br/>The two leads look pretty and dance like pros and while Julianne Hough (how's that pronounced???) spends much of the film looking like she's on a modeling shoot, emotions run high in climactic conflicts with her father (Quaid). <br/><br/>Comparing the two trailers, it looks like the remake has slavishly stuck to the original's template in terms of characters, narrative and even specific shots so this is probably another ridiculously pointless remake along the lines of Gus Van Sant's Psycho. However audiences like me who have never seen the original will no doubt be sucked in by the good story, great dancing and even better music.<br/><br/>If your toes aren't tapping by the finale, you're either a fuming fan of the original or your feet must be nailed to the floor. It's out October 14th and is definitely worth a watch. But before you shell out please heed my warning. The Breakfast Club could be next."

","I was completely surprised by this film. Director Craig Brewer (who also worked on the rewrite) has made an enjoyable film in the spirit of the original Footloose, with its energy and fun, and possibly even surpassed it in heart. <br/><br/>In the remake, the characters seem more developed and real. I did not know how anyone could live up to the iconic Kevin Bacon Ren, but the writing (particularly the changes to the back-story) combined with his talent and likability make Kenny Wormald great in this role. <br/><br/>Setting it in the South added another dimension to the film. As an urban Southerner, I found it familiar and the jokes hysterical, but if you loathe anything country and Southern, be warned that this has its fair share of that vibe.<br/><br/>The original film has quite a bit of sex, drugs, drinking and violence, and I was curious as to how they would be handled in a remake, especially one that seemed a little more intense from the trailer. Overall, I thought the portrayals of ""risky behavior"" sent a better message than the original without coming off as hokey in the least. <br/><br/>It will be obvious to film goers that Brewer loves Footloose and wanted to do it justice in this remake. He pays tribute and yet develops the film as well. If you give it a chance, I think you will be pleasantly surprised as well."

Footloose was one of them, and when it comes to feet, Footloose 2011 trips over their own. The colors that made the 1984 film so great....not here! The music that made the 1984 film so great....gone! The magic that made the 1984 film so great....doesn't exist here. And the story and romance, the mind blowing energies that made the 1984 film such a hit....it's not here, people. So what does 2011 Footloose have to offer you? Not much. Bland performances, pathetic dances to songs that already nobody listens to anymore, and not a rich character in the cast to be seen. It's as if they took all the meat and potatoes out of the picture, and just left you with scraps and fat....well, heh heh heh....we can't make blockbusters like that, can we, boys and girls? Lazy, feels rushed, and it's just not upbeat enough, if at all, to even carry the Footloose name.

And none of the stars shine in 2011 Footloose. Oh no, what have you guys done to our beloved 80's classic? Pulled the meat cleaver out, and THWACKED on it! Too many hits with the weapon makes this a miss, pass it up by all means, and do yourself a favor....if you're tired of all the remakes and reboots, say NO to Hollywood, and start watching indie films.

","The small town of Bomont imposed curfews and banned loud music and dancing after an accident killed five teenagers including Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid)'s son. Three years later, Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) moves from Boston to live with his aunt and uncle after his mother's death from leukemia. He finds the small town restrictive. He also finds reverent's daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) rebelling against the system. He makes a friend in Willard (Miles Teller).<br/><br/>I don't think it's a wise move to show the accident. It makes the ban more reasonable and harder to oppose. The Reverend is supposed to be overreaching and becoming unreasonable over the years. However the bigger problem has to be Kenny Wormald. He's more of a dancer than an actor. He doesn't have the charisma or the likability to lead. Julianne Hough comes off better. Although I would have prefer she has better separation between her two lives. She needs to dress down more as the preacher's daughter. This is a functional dance movie but not much else. It's also sad to see that the filmmaker can't think of ways to change up the story. This is obviously a Julianne Hough star vehicle. So it would be so much better to make her the newcomer to town and the lead of the movie."

","Firstly if I come across as biased this is because I love the original version, I had it on video, I have it on DVD, but...while watching this remake I felt like I was cheating on the original. The acting is okay but none of the actors have the character of the first film, the two main characters that didn't meet up to what I would expect were first of all Kenny Wormald, this guy is no Kevin bacon, yes he can dance but I found his acting a little shady, I don't think he did the job as well as the directors first choice of Zac Efron would have done. Second actor was Dennis Quaid, for me he just wasn't believable, watch the first film and you will see John Lythgow steal every scene he's in, especially when he's doing his sermons in the church, he's the kind of preacher that would keep your attention. The story line is okay, its been freshened up a bit, brought up to date and tweaked in some places, but the bus race was rubbish, they should have stuck with the tractor chicken. Some of the dialect from the first film is used again and if you've seen it you'll sit watching and saying to yourself that's from the original....and so's that...and so's that. I did like the beginning of the film as it gives a back story which sets up the film. Finally I hated it that the version of Footloose that was used wasn't the original by Kenny Loggins?, some things should be left alone. All in all it's not a bad remake but why remake a film that there was nothing wrong with in the first place? First The Italian Job, now Footloose, what next The Godfather?? I recommend you watch either of these films cos they are both enjoyable, but the 1984 version is still better!"

","I'm a big fan of the '84 version of this FUN movie, so when I went into the theater I was apprehensive. BUT! It won me over.<br/><br/>The plot is spun in the direction of life as it is TODAY... recession, tougher times. Our lead, Ren (Kenny) is edgy (kinda James Dean like). Kevin Bacon's Ren wasn't living thru a recession, so it makes sense that Ren (Kenny) isn't as light hearted. He's more serious... cool!<br/><br/>Julianna Hough was just great... kinda a young, dancing Jen Aniston. The girl can DANCE and ACT! She is a true star. I hope she continues to get more opportunities to prove herself.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid was excellent as the preacher/Dad.<br/><br/>I like the way the music people incorporated the original music with the new music. That was clever as the original music would have been tough to beat and they didn't try... good thing! Upon leaving the theater I asked several people what they thought and they all compared it to the '84 version. It is natural to do that, but try not to! This new version is a standalone even though it is similar. If given the chance both versions will win you over; double the fun."

","""Our Lord is testing us."" Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) <br/><br/>Footloose, 27 years later, is alive and well. It may not have the heavy-duty cast of the original (Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, and Chris Penn to name a few), but it is updated smartly with steamier sex, tighter jeans (""If you put a quarter in her back pocket you can tell whether it's heads or tails""), and more suggestive dancing. <br/><br/>But the melodrama of a small Georgia town (originally the Midwest) is all there and the religious anchoring, too much so for my taste. The town banned dancing three years ago after a teen-age tragic car accident, and newcomer Ren (Kenny Wormald), from Boston is destined to change attitudes toward the expression of teen-age longing and passion by dancing out his feelings. Along with him are senior high-school buddies, more diverse than ever, who may be just a little too scrubbed but are still a helluva dance group. <br/><br/>Most notable is buddy Willard played by the talented Miles Teller with an easy Southern redneck charm and surprising neophyte dancing. <br/><br/>If you ask an unhip critic like me, there's not enough of this dancing and too much melodrama. Updating the action with country line dancing (""white man's wet dream"") and crumping got me to hoping for more rather than less of the energetic and sexy foot work. Alas, Andie MacDowell as preacher wife Vi Moore needs her face time to be heroic and hip when more break dancing could have done the job. Even Frank Capra seems in on it as Ren gives his righteous speech in front of the town council about the freedom to dance. <br/><br/>Let's admit that Footloose is a formula film fulfilling its obligations with good cheer, some splendid dancing, and vividly colored costumes, characters, and sets to take an '80's treasure right into 2011. <br/><br/>Although the VW bug remains, director Craig Brewer changes for the better the original tractor chicken standoff to a school bus free for all, and he lets a couple of 10 year olds go all out with the cutest version of Let's Hear It for the Boy you'll ever hear. <br/><br/>Let's hear it for smart revisions."

The audience was made up of several different ages groups and all of had a great time. Julianne Hough was lovely, her performance was sweet and sexy.Her performance as Ariel was touching and real.

It had a really good story and one I found myself drawn into. The characters were likable and relateable. Of all the movies I have lately this was on of the best. I took my teenage daughter and got a little concerned with all the drinking, drugs, and partying in the movie. Everyone knows the story that a preachers daughter can be wild and crazy. This girl was that and more. She dates the town bad boy, loses her virginity, drinks, parties, etc. By the end of the movie she changes and realizes that the life she had been living wasn't was she wanted.

The dancing is fabulous and the acting is so much better than I had hoped for from dancers (when I see a dance movie, though, I don't care as much if the acting is sub-par as long as the choreography and dancers are great). I wasn't expecting much going into the theater, I don't know much about the story other than there would be dancing. Let me tell you, I wasn't just pleasantly surprised by this movie - I was blown away by the comedy, the choreography and the lovable characters. The music is a great mix of styles and genres (I'll be looking up the soundtrack for purchase, too). If you like dancing, rebel children or sweet love stories this movie should make you smile. I highly recommend it, and go ahead and see it in the theater - the music and dancing are great on a big screen!"

Some dance scenes remind me of (but are nothing like) the dance scene in the Breakfast Club, which helps to set the upbeat tone. It's a feel good movie.<br/><br/>Things that let it down are: the father/daughter relationship was not so believable. The pointless fight scene at the end. And the opening outline. Too much emotional drama is layered on after the tragedy without the audience forming any bond with the characters. Also the movie is a little slow to get going."

Seriously, that tractor chicken race is pretty laughable. Replacing it with school-bus figure-8 drag racing is hilarious and managed to be actually exciting.<br/><br/>This remake isn't better than the original, but it does keep it fresh by updating the music and the overall look, without losing the feel that made the original so great. Without question, this *is* Footloose, but updated for a more modern audience. It doesn't lose much, if anything, in the adaptation, and some scenes are nearly shot-for-shot tributes to the original.<br/><br/>While some may write this off as a ""needless"" remake, I found it to be a refreshing, toe-tapping, feel-good flick that manages to capture the spark of the original and will bring Footloose to a generation of kids that might otherwise have ignored it.

","You do realize that once you remake a film, there is no going back. That happened when I saw the original and remake of ""Hairspray"". My hand is somewhat going to shame, because there is a remake of ""Dirty Dancing"" coming out soon. The originals, of course, are always better. Now I realize you can't remake a 1984 classic starring Kevin Bacon called ""Footloose"", but there you go. I have seen the original and even though I found some scenes slow, the rest of the movie and the dancing scenes were terrific. For Craig Brewer, the director who made ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""Black Snake Moan"", he was a fan of this movie and he wanted to do a remake that would stay true to the original film. For it to be released during the ""Step Up"" era, who would've thunk it that the new ""Footloose"" is a genuine surprise, a remake that is unbelievably better than the original. Some has changed, but not a lot. And the remake doesn't feel slow, it just moves fast. It's simple: Start with a small town called Bomont, Georgia, where the town's council has banned public dancing, teen drinking and music. Enter a kid from Boston named Ren MacCormack (back-up dancer Kenny Wormald) who comes to Bomont in order to shake things up. He makes a friend in Willard (the scene-stealing Miles Teller in the late Chris Penn role) and the sexy and rebellious red-boots-wearing Ariel (Julianne Hough), daughter of Reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid in the John Lithgow role), girlfriend of the stuck-up Redneck Chuck Cranston (Patrick John Flueger). What Ren does is challenge the town in order to remove the law of banning public dancing and music. Only then he realizes that once you make a change, everything you know will start to change you. And there's no going back to that. The remake of ""Footloose"" does have a couple non-fatal glitches into the system, but the dancing (including the Angry Dance, the ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" montage and the ""Footloose"" finale) are awesome and the young actors are terrific, especially Wormald and Hough. They're not Kevin Bacon or Lori Singer, but they sure hold their own and their amazing dancing abilities. Let's leave it at this, this movie made me want to cut loose. Thanks to Craig Brewer for giving us this remake we don't need, but a movie I happen to enjoy."
"saadgkhan","7","2","8","12 February 2012"," Kenny Wormald & Julianne Hough will surprise you
","FOOTLOOSE (B+) The Remake of 1984's Classic had trouble from the beginning. Zac Efron quit the project & then Chace Crawford was shuffled aside along with director. I always thought Chace Crawford was a good choice and when the promos released, I hated Kenny Wormald but after watching the movie last Night, I think ""Kenny Wormald"" was indeed the best part of the movie. Playing cocky is tough because you start hating the character, but Kenny Wormald played cockiness with such an ease & confidence that you would like him to succeed in his mission for abolition of laws against dancing & music. Kenny Wormald's is a born dance and his dancing skills can easily be seen in Footloose. Besides Kenny Wormald, the second surprise is Julianne Hough as I've seen her dancing & music videos but never thought she is so pretty. Julianne Hough looked sweet & damn sexy, she completely radiates through the screen. Not only she is a fine dancer, but a fine actress too. Overall, Footloose is fun flick, with fun country music & dancing. worth watching."

","The original ""Footloose"" is one of those ""time capsule"" movies that captures the MTV pop culture of 1984 in such a dynamic way. It was a huge box office success, with the help of its multi-platinum soundtrack (which knocked Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" off the top of the Billboard charts). It made Kevin Bacon a star, it spawned a Broadway musical... and now, 27 years later, a remake... which is best described as a passionate love letter to the original classic. It treats the 1984 version with much respect... and includes numerous homages that true fans will recognize and appreciate. All of the studios doing remakes of these classic movies should take a lesson from this one. Basically, if you want to feel good... see this movie!"

","I must admit that I was a tad bit skeptical as I walked into the theater to see the Footloose remake. I'm a fan of the 1984 original, in which Kevin Bacon starred, and I couldn't help but wonder to myself how could the new version would stand up against the old. Upon my viewing, the answer was simple; there was no comparison. <br/><br/>Having seen the original a countless number of times, it became quite obvious early on that the storyline was going to follow directly with the previous film. The new version even went so far as to duplicate some of the lines from the original. There was some modernization to coincide with the different eras in which the films take place; such as the kids having iPods and listening to rap, and some of the dancing was reminiscent of what could be seen in the dance film Step Up.<br/><br/>Julianne Hough, best known for her appearances on the ABC hit reality show Dancing with the Stars, does a good job in her first leading role, as Ariel Moore. Hough's portrayal of the rebellious Ariel is a quite enjoyable. Kenny Wormald, making his acting debut, plays Ren McCormack, the new guy in town. Considering the iconic shoes of Kevin Bacon, of which Wormald has been tasked with filling, I'd say he did a serviceable job. It's difficult not to compare the performances to those that came before, so in order to give Wormald his just deserts I'd like to see him act in something using an original script and not something redone. Dennis Quaid as Reverend Shaw Moore and Andi MacDowell as Vi Moore, both do a fantastic job as Ariel's parents. Their performances were on par with the acting done by John Lithgow and Diane West, who played the same roles in the original. The one bright spot in the remade film was Miles Teller, who played Ren's best friend Willard. Teller gave one of my favorite performances in the film. Teller's Ren added a humor which made the film much more enjoyable. Teller's performance out shined the job done by his 1984 counterpart, the late Christopher Penn.<br/><br/>Having seen a screening of the film, I'm not sure I would pay full theater price to see this; If you are on the fence about going, I say skip it. It's a movie that won't lose much in a transfer from the big screen to the small screen; therefore, wait for it to come out on DVD and get it from NetFlix or Redbox. The Soundtrack however, is definitely worth checking out. The music from the movie included some of the songs from the original film; however each song has been modernized. I really liked how the songs were different, but not to the point that you weren't able to recognize them. Save your ticket money and buy the music instead.<br/><br/>Rating: C<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

The story was certainly good enough to carry the movie, but the music and dancing just rage and whoever has any drawbacks on this film just doesn't know how to have a great time. This is the reason movies are made - for people to express every emotion - and this one captures youth, joy, music, fun, and of course - DANCING!!! Shake yourself up and get on down to see this, you will find your feet moving and your body swaying to the rhythm! It was more than cool, and the cast was great, each person fit the part so well.

Ren thinks it's ridiculous and fights it. He also falls for the reverend's hot daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough).<br/><br/>OK--I'm a big fan of the original. I saw it multiple times up the theatre and on cable and got the original soundtrack on vinyl (kids--ask your parents!)and then again on CD. I was dreading this remake but it's actually pretty OK. It starts GREAT with a bunch of kids dancing very well to the title tune and basically follows the original script. Some of the dialogue is lifted verbatim from the original! Still there are plenty of changes--there are plenty of dramatic scenes that weren't in the original, the chicken game with tractors is turned into a race between four buses (!!!), some of the songs are (unwisely) replaced with rap songs and the dancing has changed. ""Holding Out for a Hero"" is heard once in the background and ""Somebody's Eyes"" was used when Willard (Miles Tenner) learns how to dance--but most of the songs from the original were left out. Also there's more swearing here and the fights between the teenagers are pretty brutal (for a PG-13). The acting isn't bad. Wormald is just an OK actor but he can really dance unlike Kevin Bacon in the original. He's a handsome guy too. Hough is beautiful as Ariel (LOVE those eyes) and she can act AND sing:) Everybody else is OK in their roles especially Quaid as the reverend.

","As one of the few people on this earth who has never laid eyes upon the original 1984 ""Footloose"", I came into this version with no preconceived notions or expectations. As such, I was pleasantly surprised, although not outright blown away.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Footloose 2011"" is a typical ""teens vs. adults"" flick. When a car crash (after a night of partying) kills five high school seniors, their community pastor (played by Dennis Quaid) restricts future teenage rebellious behavior by controlling the town with strict laws/curfews. That is, of course, until his daughter (Julianne Hough) meets the new kid in town from Boston (Kenny Wormald) and the town gets stirred up once again.<br/><br/>The prevailing factor in this film experience is that the movie is good at what it does. It provides everything that one expects to see, such as: incredible dancing, popular music, attractive men/women, and teen-centered plots. All those things are accomplished with aplomb.<br/><br/>An ""added bonus"" is the quality of acting from both the youngsters and adults (especially Quaid) in the film. Though inherently a bit hokey, this movie could have diverged into pure cheeseball without such strong performances.<br/><br/>Thus, while I can't give it an enormous star rating because it isn't an outright classic, it is very good at what it does (and if you like that kind of thing, your rating will be much higher). Three and a half stars would probably be a more exact ranking. Simply put, I had a good time watching this flick."

It is very loyal to the original film which brings to mind the question of why remake it at all? Well it has been modernized to suit todays teenagers and it still works well storyline wise.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good, Kenny Wormald is great to watch and is a very handsome leading man who i can't wait to watch again, mighty fine eye candy indeed, the female lead however is horrible, the character is just a detestable b**ch, i didn't like her one tiny bit, her character somewhat redeems herself towards the end but for me it was just too late, but i suppose thats not the actress's fault but still she is easily the most unlikable female character ever in a teen film.<br/><br/>One thing i loved about this movie is it is a dance movie with a country theme, the country soundtrack is excellent, it's nice to see a mainstream film that doesn't use contemporary dance to tell the story, here it's all boot scootin' and honky tonkin'.<br/><br/>The only thing that really disappointed me was the lack of a Kevin Bacon cameo, surely they could've written a small role for him, even just a blink and you'll miss walk on role, oh well.<br/><br/>So if you don't ask any questions and sit back and turn off your mind this movie can be very enjoyable.

","Directed by Craig Brewer (Black Snake Moan, Hustle & Flow) Paramount Pictures and MTV Films presents this ""Footloose"" remake that opens with a care-free and fun dancing scene to the title song ""Footloose"" by Kenny Loggins from the original 1984 version. Tragedy soon follows and suddenly the small town of Bomont (population 19,300) turns into one with strict uptight laws much of which are targeted at the town's youths.<br/><br/>This is the town that Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald), a senior in high school is sent to from Boston, Massachusetts to live with his Uncle Wes Warnicker (Ray McKinnon) and family. The rude awakening comes when he discovers the town is desolate with a lack of technology and strict laws against dancing, drinking, and an 11pm curfew enforced on minors under 18 years all of which came about under the suggestions of the town's preacher who lost his only son in a tragic car accident also taking the lives of four other teens.<br/><br/>Making a decent effort to fit-in, Ren finds an immediate connection with classmate Willard (Miles Teller) originally played by Chris Penn, who soon becomes his non-dancing new best-friend.<br/><br/>Ren is quickly labeled as a ""trouble maker"" by the school administrators and the town's preacher, Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid). Things become extra difficult when Ren and the preacher's daughter, Ariel Moore (Julianne Hough), an adrenaline junkie, have a mutual attraction for each other. Conflict emerges between Ren and Ariel's current car racing boyfriend, Chuck (Patrick John Flueger) and her father. ""We can not be missing from our children's lives. They are ours to protect"" Rev. Moore preached to re-affirm the local laws.<br/><br/>The only way Ren can blow-off steam is to dance in private. Ren decides to start a petition to make dancing in Bomont legal again and argues his case with the help of classmates. Those that saw the original know how the rest of the movie goes.<br/><br/>This remake of ""Footloose"" keeps the core fundamentals of the plot line along with the right amount of simplicity to create the same magic that was in the original. The film makes an appreciative homage to the '80s decade by re-introducing hair band ""Quiet Riot"", country super-star Tanya Tucker, and Deniece Williams' ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"" that famously served as the backdrop song for Willard's dance training montage. As true as the film stayed to the classic, however, was as equally disappointing at the lack to bring it more up-to-date by using more modern-day hits. A little bit of Usher, or Justin Bieber should have been an order to include.<br/><br/>Starring character roles played by Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough were executed on point. Wormald, who is a professional dancer, managed to live-up to the iconic role originally played by Kevin Bacon which made him a star. Perhaps Wormald will command the same reaction? Julianne Hough very well may have super-stardom on her hands once this film opens. In her first-ever break-out acting leading-lady starring role, Hough, also a professional dancer previously on ""Dancing with the Stars"", played Ariel magnificently! The role of Rusty was infectiously revived by actress Ziah Colon (Drop Dead Diva), a part originally played by Sarah Jessica Parker. Andie MacDowell's role as Vi Moore, the preacher's wife seemed to be lessened in this remake. Vi was such a strong Matriarch character in the classic that it would have been nice to have seen MacDowell not get blended-in to the background of the story. Ultimately, the heart of the story is misjudgments on first impressions and about the daughter/father relationship between Rev. Moore and Ariel and their struggles to get over their own hurdles created by the tragic loss they shared of a brother and son.<br/><br/>The young adult viewers were genuinely engaged in ""Footloose"" and expressed their enthusiasm once it ended. If this 2011 version of ""Footloose"" has anywhere near as close of an impact as the first one did, then the movie will do well. My biggest complaint - not enough dancing.

A few years prior, the community was rocked by a tragic accident that killed five teenagers after a night out and Bomont's local councilmen and the beloved Reverend Shaw Moore,played by Dennis Quaid,responded by implementing ordinances that prohibit loud music and dancing. Not one to bow to the status quo, Ren challenges the ban, revitalizing the town and falling in love with the minister's troubled daughter Ariel,portrayed by Julianne Hough, in the process.<br/><br/>After a long night of partying, Bobby Moore and four of his friends drive over a bridge and crash into a truck. His father, Shaw Moore, the reverend of the church of the small Southern United States town of Bomont, Georgia; persuades the city council to pass several paternalistic laws, including a ban on all unsupervised dancing within the city limits. Three years later, Ren McCormack, a teenager raised in Boston, moves to Bomont to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins after his mother's painful death from leukemia. Soon after arriving, Ren makes friends with Willard Hewitt, a fellow senior at Bomont High, and from him learns about the ban on dancing.He soon begins to be attracted to Moore's rebellious daughter Ariel, who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game of chicken involving buses, and despite his inability to drive a bus, he wins. Reverend Moore mistrusts Ren, forbidding Ariel to see him ever again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. After an argument about Ren, Chuck breaks up with and abuses Ariel. Moore initially wants Ren arrested, but Ariel convinces him that Chuck is the real assailant and that she isn't a virgin. She also mentions that he blames everything on Ren just like he did with his son, Bobby, who died in the car crash. Moore's wife, Vi, is supportive of the movement to allow dancing. She explains to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being a good father to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem.Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses, given to him by Ariel, that claim in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, or celebrate. Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. The city council votes against him. Undaunted, Ren convinces the owner of the cotton mill where he works to let them have a prom there; the mill is just outside the Bomont city limits. Ren goes to see Moore, knowing that Moore still has enough clout to pressure the parents not to let their teenagers come. Ren tells Moore that even though they denied the motion to dismiss the law, they cannot stop the teenagers from having the dance. He then asks him respectfully if he can take Ariel.On Sunday, Shaw asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom. Not long after Ren and Ariel arrive at the prom, Chuck and several of his friends ride up, intent on beating up Ren. However, Ren and Willard fend them off. Ren then flings some confetti into a shredding machine and yells, ""Let's dance!""<br/><br/>The new Footloose reboot has more energy as compared to the 1984 original.It also be commended for more energy and vitality.However,the characters, the scenes, the dancing, even much of the dialogue are all plugged into a rigidly prefabricated storyline that treats its 1984 predecessor with praise rather than updating everything for new generation audience.It was expected that the fans of the original who have probably outgrown it will judge the new film instead of the youngster who like a teen-age movie.What's worse,the movie simply can be classified as a TV movie instead of a decent feature film."

","As a child of the 80's I grew up loving the original Footloose movie and was really skeptical when I heard there was going to be a remake. I have to say though I really enjoyed this remake and loved that they found a lot of ways to use some of the original scenes and music scores and put a modern twist on them. There seemed to be a lot more dancing in this version(which I loved) and while I knew Julianne Hough would really shine in the dancing scenes since she is a dancer, I was really surprised by how great Kenny Wormald was. In my opinion he was a much better dancer then Kevin Bacon was and he played the part very convincingly. There was a lot of thought in pulling parts of the original into the remake while still making it stand on it's own and really I loved this one just as much as I love the original!"
"WilderMovieReviews","8","1","6","19 March 2012"," I wanted to really hate this but I couldn't.
","I have always tried to fill my reviews with honesty, so let's continue in this style. I am a big fan of the original Footloose Film! There I admitted it. It is a guilty pleasure of mine. A great uplifting film with a cool soundtrack.<br/><br/>A few years ago I found out that a remake of this great film was announced. My first thought was ""really bad idea"". The film is a classic with one of the best theme songs of all time. This wasn't going to be a re-imagining of the film in the style of The Karate Kid (2010), but a remake of the original. These rarely end up as a good idea and never equal or better the original. How could the new version possibly live up to my expectations?<br/><br/>Before I watched the remake I listened to the soundtrack, and by listen I mean played a few seconds of all the new versions of the classic songs, and by played I mean skipped to the next song in disgust at what I was hearing with every song. It was bad. This cemented my feelings that I was going to hate the new film. With trepidation and a lot of negative thoughts I sat down to watch my new most hated movie.<br/><br/>The film follows the same story of the big city kid having to move in with family in a small town where religion plays a big part of everyday life. After the death of a group of teenagers killed in a road accident while travelling back from a night out drinking and dancing, the town led by the local preacher declares music and dance are bad and they ban them from public use anywhere in the town. The city kid clashes with the authority and attempts to change the towns views.<br/><br/>The new version started off well with the classic Oscar nominated song playing over the opening credits. Once it ended I expected the film to go downhill fast. But I found myself enjoying it! Not just thinking it was OK but really enjoying the film. The characters were good, the story updated and changes from the original worked well. While listening to the soundtrack and hating the new versions of the songs, hearing them in the film they fit and make sense.<br/><br/>The new actors in the film were for the most part as good the original cast. You have veteran actors Dennis Quaid as Rev. Shaw Moore and Andie MacDowell as his wife Vi Moore, they are just as good as John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest in the original. Taking over the lead roles from Kevin Bacon as Ren MacCormack and Lori Singer as Ariel Moore are new comers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough. They are really good and make the roles their own. The film comes to life because of these actors. However the characters of Willard previously played by the late great Chris Penn now played by Miles Teller and Rusty originally Sarah Jessica Parker now Ziah Colon, don't live up to the original. This is not to say they aren't good in the film they are, but the original actors seemed to shine and stand out more. This made the characters a lot more memorable.<br/><br/>The film adds a new introduction and shows us the back story of the accident. This is something the original was missing and it improves the story. There are also a few tributes to the 1984 version. The best is at the end when Ren and Ariel are wearing the same outfits as characters wear in the ending to the original and the same final dance routine is used.<br/><br/>I wanted to really hate this but I couldn't. I liked it almost as much as the original. It really is a fun film that succeeds in modernising the story. I almost rated it 9/10, however right at the very end it went wrong. The final dance routine used a new version of the song Footloose. The song is a timeless classic and the new version just doesn't hit the mark. The film makers should have used the new version in the opening credits and stuck with the original for the films climax. For this reason I give the film 8/10"

","If your foot is loose, you may have leprosy. If you have leprosy, dancing could cause your foot to fly off and kick someone in the face.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the limbs of the youngsters in this drama have been checked for lesions.<br/><br/>When his mother dies, Ren (Kenny Wormald) moves to a small-town to live with his relatives.<br/><br/>Unfamiliar with the town's ban on dancing, Ren runs afoul of the reverend (Dennis Quaid), whose son was killed in a car crash after an unsanctioned soirée, and whose daughter (Julianne Hough) Ren can't stop thinking about.<br/><br/>Intent on cutting a rug, Ren and the teens of the totalitarian township team up to lift the draconian dance laws.<br/><br/>Though it never strays from the original's shadow, this shot-for-shot remake does do an admirable job of including soundtrack standouts.<br/><br/>Besides, if God didn't want us to dance, why would he give us booties?

"mjawa_86","8","1","6","4 November 2011"," remake was a better movie overall
","I'm a fan of the storyline of footloose. not only have I seen the new version but I have watched the original several times and was even involved with a play version at the local theater on Whidbey Island in Washington state. The Pros easily outweigh the cons of this movie. it contains better acting, better dancing, a stronger storyline, and the emphasis of family and friends are portrayed much better, it is also not as racist, and the age of the cast is better portrayed to the characters they play. the reason why I point out that the acting was better is because if you look at the original the cast are just bland in the way they act compared to how they would act if it were an everyday thing. the laws of Bomont are supposed to be considered irregular and yet the original cast act as if nothing has changed. the cast members who do put in emphasis on their feelings go overboard and need to tone down. this movie portrays that not just minor cast members can dance but so can everybody else. in the original one if you watch Kevin Bacon in the Warehouse scene I will be honest but is one of the worst forms of dancing to show his emotions that I have ever scene in a movie. yes he is a gymnast but the scooting back thing he does with his shirt is absolutely unnecessary. in this version Ren has lost his mom to Leukemia and was abandoned by his dad whereas he must go to live with his aunt, uncle, uncle and two younger cousins. in the original he is just a punk kid whining about leaving the big city and not being accepted for who he is. the reason why I feel the emphasis of family and friends is better portrayed is because in this one you see more kindness out of the uncles heart instead of being a jackass for most of the original. he is able to see where Ren is coming from and defend him. in the original one you barely see the cousins or the aunt. now why on earth would the original even think about leaving out family members. the reason why I have pointed out that it this version isn't as racist is because in the original you clearly see everybody in pretty much an all white community whereas in this one the people are consisted of different race and ethnicity. I mean really the original should have gotten over themselves it was in the eighties not the sixties, our country should have been more accepting by then especially in the movies. in the original they couldn't decide between having older kids or younger adults. the girl who played Ariel in 1984 was 27 back then and looked like she was actually thirty compared to the new one she at least looks like she could have pulled off eighteen or nineteen. for my final statement to all those critics who dare dis on the remake get over yourselves one, two if you think your not going to like it don't watch it, three don't actually make comparisons unless you know what your talking about, four let others choose for themselves because everybody has different taste in movies, and finally look at every perspective and detail before judging there is more than you realize putting together a movie. if any of you think you can do better than the directors you can try making a version yourself and then be criticized by millions of people who don't agree with you."
"kazimer66-1","Null","1","6","14 October 2011"," When it was good it was very very good, when it was bad...
","The producers hoped they would give Wormald his ""Bacon"" break, but unlike Bacon who was a good actor who surprised everyone with his dancing, Warmald is a good dancer who really isn't a very good actor. However, this film could easily become the breakout roles for Julianne Hough and Miles Teller. Julianne Hough often carried the film when her costar couldn't.<br/><br/>The film is a respectful update to the 84 classic, often stealing scenes and dialogue verbatim from the 1984 script. Normally I am critical of such ""lazy"" writing, but with this film, I couldn't think of anything better to replace them with. So it's forgivable.<br/><br/>The film did bog down frequently at the worst times. The key to the 84 film's success was the ""economy of words"". Nothing was explained if it could be showed and nothing was shown if it was already explained.<br/><br/>In this film the initial accident was fine, but then became redundant when the reason for the dance laws were later explained to Ren. It is a basic ""either / or"" choice for the story. Bogging the story down with over explained or over dramatized scenes don't help. The purpose of the destruction in Ren's private dance was lost on me.. The idea was to get out his anger in a creative way, not to trash a warehouse! Why the fight outside the dance was extended was beyond me completely. It was never meant to be a pivotal scene, just a short resolution to the Chuck conflict, a blip to amp up the excitement to the final dance sequence.<br/><br/>Many things about this remake /update worked and others fell completely flat.<br/><br/>As I said initially, this film showcased that Julianne Hough has real acting chops, something even I was skeptical about going in. The real break out from this film will be her not Kenny Wormald. <br/><br/>I believe she and Miles Teller will get a lot of work from this film."
"alcantaraj-16594","8","1","7","4 August 2018"," A 5.9 IMDB RATING!? SERIOUSLY!?
","NOTE: I NEVER SAW THE ORIGINAL FILM. <br/><br/>After seeing ""Footloose,"" I already thought of a headline for my IMDB review of the film. It goes like this: ""A FUN TIME + TOUCHING YET SIMPLE STORY AND MESSAGE + CHARACTERS YOU'LL LOVE = ""FOOTLOOSE""."" However, after seeing the IMDB user rating, I changed it to ""A 5.9 IMDB RATING!? SERIOUSLY!?"". I can't believe this movie has a 5.9. Yes, we have different tastes but a movie this good does not deserve a 5.9. Here's why:<br/><br/>FUN TIME - It's an entertaining movie. The dances at the film's start, middle and end were very energetic. <br/><br/>TOUCHING YET SIMPLE STORY & MESSAGE - The film tells the story of the dance-loving Ren who moves into a town that prohibits teens from public dancing after a tragic accident three years prior. The town basically sees dancing as a sin. Throughout the film, you can see teens wanting to dance (like what teens do). Basically saying: ""We won't be dancing when we're older, so please let us dance."" To avoid spoilers, I suggest whoever reads this review to check out the film. NOTHING MAJOR HAPPENS. HOWEVER, you'll feel the message at the film's 3rd act.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS YOU'LL LOVE -Everyone has courage. The teens want to dance and you can see why. The parents don't want teens to violate the law (especially the law against dancing) and you can see why (though, they overreact a bit). You'll love them because you understand them.<br/><br/>Now, the movie is not perfect. There was a useless fight scene at the end and I DID NOT LIKE JULIANNE HOUGH'S PERFORMANCE, but, still, ""Footloose"" does not deserve a 5.9."
"dhardman04","10","1","7","8 March 2012"," Remake of a Classic that Delivers
","I am a die hard Footloose fan and it is my favorite movie. Being only 17, you can find it hard to believe that I love an 80's movie but I do. Also, you may find me biased because I am young and reviewing a modern remake meant for today's generation.<br/><br/>Put that aside and just hear me out. Yes, the story line is cheesy and weird, but it is also interesting and shows how people can be pushed to the limit through tragedy. Many people thought a ridiculous plot couldn't be modernized because it would be ridiculous in today's world. I find the plot to be very interesting and plausible because it is set in a small, religious town.<br/><br/>Now, lets get to the remake. The cast is just as good as the original. Kenny brings Boston charm and delivers. He portrayed Ren very well and his dancing is pretty awesome. Julianne Hough is young, fresh, hot and an excellent dancer. As an actress, she was OK. I believe that she was used as eye candy more than a serious actress, but she acted the part very well and delivered excellent performances in the movies most emotional scenes. Miles was the best out of all the cast. He portrayed Willard very convincingly and brought great humor and southern charm. His dance montage was the best scene ever and payed great homage to the original! The rest of the supporting cast played their parts well. The dancing was what got me hooked for this movie. I love modern dance and they way it looks. This movie delivered a variety of dance techniques that were fresh, tight and skilled. It was very modern and very entertaining. <br/><br/>I also loved that they gave back story and gave a whole new story with Ren's mother. The accident in the beginning was very emotional because it came out of nowhere and shocks you because you don't actually see it coming. With Ren's mom, I was glad and mad that she wasn't there. Glad because they give her a new story, which gave Ren more character development. Mad because that was one part of the original that was important. However, this and the back story truly made it a modern remake. You cannot remake a movie exactly because then there is no point. <br/><br/>Overall, one of the best remakes I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. People bashed this movie before they saw it and even after wards their minds are wrapped up in their biased critique. Remakes are not made to outdo the original, but to modernize it for the next generation. It was truly amazing, nodded at the original and kept it tight. <br/><br/>10/10"
"Hellmant","7","1","7","3 March 2012"," I really enjoyed it a lot because I was expecting so little from it!
","'FOOTLOOSE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>This is one of those movies I really enjoyed a lot because I was expecting so little from it. I never saw the original 1984 Kevin Bacon cult classic in it's entirety (although now I'd really like to) so I'm obviously not a big fan of it and had no unreasonable expectations in that way. I just expected the movie to be light pop teen fare, appealing only to an MTV ADD audience but I was pleasantly surprised. I've read this updated remake is extremely faithful to the original (many critics say too faithful). It was co-written by the original film's writer (Dean Pitchford, who also wrote most of the songs) and Craig Brewer who also directed the film (Brewer also wrote and directed such popular edgy films as 'HUSTLE & FLOW' and 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN'). I can't compare it to the original (nor should I) but this film is definitely a well made crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>Professional dancers Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough were cast as the two leads in the film, rather than actors, and they turn in better performances than most any other young popular stars could in their place (especially the likes of Zac Effron and Chace Crawford, who were originally considered for the leading male role). Wormald plays Ren McCormack, a teen from Boston who recently lost his mother to cancer and moves in with his Aunt (Kim Dickens) and Uncle (Ray McKinnon) in the small town of Bomont Georgia. Ren, being a free spirit, clashes with the ultra-conservative town where several absurd Christian paternalistic laws were put in place three years earlier when the town's popular reverend, Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid), lost his son (along with four of his friends) to a drunk driving accident. The harsh laws include a teen curfew as well as laws against playing rock music too loud and dancing. Shaw's daughter Ariel (Hough) is also a rebellious free spirit who's been sinking further and further into depression since the loss of her brother and absence of her father (on an emotional level). Ren and Ariel hit it off but Ren is of course seen as a virus to the town which begins a moral war.<br/><br/>The movie is very inspiring as well as surprisingly emotionally moving in places. It's also just a great feel good movie thanks in large part to the overall craftsmanship of the film as well as the performances and crowd pleasing soundtrack. Wormald makes an impressive leading man debut and Hough is great eye candy, turning in one of the hottest performances of the year. I know it's missing the Bacon but I think Wormald could be every bit as talented an actor as Kevin (although it's way too early to really tell). Like I said I don't know how good the original was to compare it to (hopefully I soon will though) but every remake should be based solely on it's own merits anyway. This is a good film, it does everything it sets out to do in a quality way. Should please everyone but the die-hard fans of the original.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzFGXKpG30"
"andell","5","1","8","14 October 2011"," Not terrible, but not terribly good either!
","Lets keep this review short: if you go to see this reboot of Footloose, you may like it better if you're completely unfamiliar with the original. To be fair, the original film was a box office hit, but it was far from a hit with critics: having said all of this however, the remake is far weaker than the original.<br/><br/>Kenny Wormald plays Ren, a young man who has just endured the loss of his Mother. This is different from the original, as Ren and his Mother travel to Bomont (Georgia?) following the death of his Father, if I'm not mistaken. In this reboot, there is a more misandristic tone: Ren's Father was a deadbeat, and his Mother was the one who died.<br/><br/>Wormald has screen presence, but he had some huge shoes to fill...and I think this is a case where too much of the original was left in this remake. For instance, there is the scene in the original where Ren (as played by Kevin Bacon) is struggling with the impact of being accosted by his Uncle, harassed by the police, accused by the Principal of the school, teased by Ariel and bullied by Chuck...and he takes out his frustrations in a warehouse. In the original, you can kind of understand why Ren is so angry: he has no outlet for his frustrations, and they just explode.<br/><br/>In this reboot, the warehouse scene is still present...almost in it's entirety...yet we never really understand why Ren needs to explode because he has a fairly supportive Aunt & Uncle, had only one run-in with the law (which the judge dismissed), and even the Principal of the school opts to cut him some slack instead of suspending or expelling him for being caught with drugs! <br/><br/>That in a nut shell is what happens pretty regularly in this remake: it is largely faithful to the specifics of the original, but it just never feels right! Even the fight scene climax, which was so effective in the original, looks so sloppy and poorly choreographed in this remake.<br/><br/>Wormald is likable...he's about the only reason I haven't given this film a sub-5 score. My advice however is this: if you loved the original, wait for this one to come to DVD, and watch it on that."
"hazey","6","1","9","15 October 2011"," Fun To Sing Along With...(may contain spoilers)
","However, a remake of this classic was not needed at all. I was excited to watch this when it started with the title song and was even singing and bopping along to it. The film is predictable and it's new scenes are just exposition that weren't needed. Julianne Hough is great as is Dennis Quaid though. The letting off steam scene was embarrassing. With Ren jerking around and grunting...it was just plain wrong and lost all context of the original. The mix of dance styles throughout, including the classic boot scooting should work to bring the film into a more modern context, however it just seems to make the film more disjointed. Almost like its trying to be another dance film. Wait for DVD. Or just watch the original again."
"nickmesafilms","7","1","10","16 October 2011"," Footloose (2011) - We Have to Cut Loose! ""Foot-loose""!
","Although I have never seen the original ""Footloose"" with Kevin Bacon, the remake helped me quite understand the movie a lot. Before talking about the obvious plot, I would like to say that ""Footloose"" made me entertained by the dancing, the casting, and the true heart, but sometimes not the plot, which goes as follows. After a terrible teenage car crash three years ago, due to dancing and loud music, the court has decided to have dancing banned in their city. Then, some random Boston boy starts to make a change when he tries his best to bring dancing back to the city. Now, that sounds like an interesting and enjoying plot, the only problem is that it's just so unrealistic. Why would dancing be illegal for no particular reason? I have no idea, but here's what I do know, it sounds like a bad idea! But besides that, I kind of enjoyed the movie a lot. The dancing was completely entertaining, and it helped keep the movie alive. The dancing is well-choreographed, and it's staged perfectly to the theme. Kenny Wormald makes a pretty-well portrayal in the movie as Ren McCormack, the boy who tries to bring dancing alive again. I felt everything that he brought to the character, and he dances like a pro. The beautiful, butt-busting Julianne Hough does an even brilliant job in the movie playing the preacher's daughter, Ariel. She does a terrific job acting in this movie, with her full optimism and golden attitude, except in the more emotional scenes where she delivers no feeling of emotion. Dennis Quaid does brilliant work as the preacher, and Andie MacDowell does pretty good work in the movie as well. But another problem with the film was watching all the teenagers finding themselves into deep trouble, acting like complete idiots with abusive boyfriends, and crazy bus races. To me, that was completely silly. Although there's an unrealistic plot to ""Footloose"", there is a realistic, golden heart to ""Footloose"". The movie talks about cutting loose, and teenagers should be let free, and all that realistic humor. Director Craig Brewer has brought a golden touch to this movie, to be traditional to the original classic. Oh, and let's not forget the cool soundtrack, including the song of the same name as the movie that gets stuck in your head, and you don't want to let it go. ""Footloose"" maybe a movie with a plot that's too unrealistic and cliché, but the dancing, the cast, and the heartwarming moments helped me become entertained throughout the whole thing. If you like to party and cut loose, you won't be disappointed with this movie. ""Footloose"", in my review, ""non-stop rocking entertainment, but with no sense of realism""."

","Footloose is a 2011 American musical film directed by Craig Brewer. It is a remake of the 1984 film of the same name and stars Kenny Wormald, Julianne Hough, Miles Teller, Andie MacDowell and Dennis Quaid. The film follows a young man who moves from Boston to a small southern town and protests the town's ban against dancing. Filming took place from September to November 2010 in Georgia. It was released in Australia and New Zealand on October 6, 2011, and in North America on October 14, 2011. It grossed $15.5 million in its opening weekend and $63 million worldwide from a $24 million budget and received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 69% approval rating, and the site calls the story ""fresh for a new generation""."
"stephenabell","7","0","1","22 September 2019"," An Okay Remake... Which Fails Slightly Because It's A Near Duplicate...
","This is pretty much a straight photocopy of the original film, though, with a few extras thrown in and a couple of new ideas.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the opening sequence is similar to the original. Initially, I was a little confused with the similarity but then the twist kicks in. It turns out to be the dance where the teenagers lose their lives and start the No-Dance Law. However, the parallels didn't stop at the start. Though I have to be grateful that the ""Tractor Chicken"" scene was changed out for the bus demolition derby. This added a nice bit of excitement. Though the cover of Holding Out For A Hero was atrocious.<br/><br/>Actually, Craig Brewer's direction is crisper than the first film, though it has less iconic moments as he just duplicated them. By doing this they lose some of their power. For example, Ren's ""Dance-Angry"" scene in the abandoned barn. When Kevin Bacon did it you thought, wow, this guy is angry, look at those moves, and what attitude. Now, when Kenny Wormald does the ""Dance-Angry"", even with the added moves and different camera angles you don't get the same thoughts... you're too busy thinking of Kev - sorry Ken.<br/><br/>This happens a few times throughout the movie. Though ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" was a nice touch. I even preferred this version of the Reverend. Dennis Quaid gives a quieter and more controlled portrayal than John Lithgow (who was brilliant as the over-powering version). Quaid's Reverend is more fitting for this film.<br/><br/>In fact, I liked most of this cast. Julianne Hough's Ariel is a little dirtier and more wild-child than Lori Singer's. Though Singer's and Bacon's on-screen chemistry was better and more believable. The best casting decision was Miles Teller as Willard. He fits the country-hick better than Christopher Penn did. He's also not as wooden as Penn was - a great bonus, as I didn't feel embarrassed for him when he came on-screen. I just have one question though, why did Andie MacDowell take this part. It's tiny and not that important. MacDowell doesn't bring anything to the part. Any other actress could have done better. While writing this review I realised I'd truly forgotten she'd even starred in the film - thank you IMDb for the cast list.<br/><br/>I still prefer the original than this one, though only just. This is still a kick-ass rock-and-roll dance-to-live movie, which I found highly enjoyable. So if you like this sort of thing, give it a try - you shouldn't be disappointed."
"HotToastyRag","10","0","2","31 July 2019"," The best remake I've ever seen
","Hands down, the 2011 Footloose is the best remake I've ever seen. In the traditional definition, a story is re-filmed and re-released. There's nothing in Webster's that necessitates a fresh take, although most remakes try to put their own spin on the story. How often have you gone to see a remake and been thoroughly disappointed that scene was cut, entire characters were written out, the modern time period makes the story inaccessible, or someone in the cast tries to say his or her lines the total opposite of how the original did? In Footloose, every single thing is exactly the same as it was in 1984. You can probably count on your right hand the differences, and they're all very minor. The ""chicken"" game with the tractors is replaced by a figure-eight chase with school buses. See? Not that big a deal.<br/><br/>The script is almost identical. ""Do you want to kiss me?"" ""Someday."" ""What's all this someday s***?"" Every song and sequence is included, and Lynne Taylor-Corbett's original choreography is faithfully stuck to. The costumes are same, too, with the white tank top, the tie on the first day of school, the burgundy tux jacket, the pink fluttery prom dress, and the ""Dance Your A** Off"" t-shirt! This is truly a remake, redoing a film for modern audiences so they can watch stars they know in roles their parents remember from thirty years earlier. Your mom talks about Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer, but you'll tell your kids about Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough. Your mom giggles incessantly and gets a lump in her throat when Chris Penn learns to dance, and you'll do the same with Miles Teller. John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest are replaced by Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell, whom kids today think of as ""parent-age"" instead of young and beautiful '80s stars.<br/><br/>There's only one person I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. If you're that person who thinks a remake is only good if it changes the original and adds its own spin on it, don't rent Footloose. Wait until West Side Story comes out and have your fill. As for me, I probably won't go to the theaters to see the remake of West Side Story. I'll be too busy watching the DVD I just bought of Footloose."

","As far as remakes go, you cannot be much more faithful than this. It takes an absolute classic movie and updates it in all aspects from music to cast. The movie hits all the same beats as the original. So as far as most of the plot it is just as good. The dancing in my opinion is more well choreographed this time but even still there doesn't seem to be that special. I do have to appreciate the fact that they kept in pretty much every iconic quote from the 9184 version. Footloose was already a 4/5 star good movie but this as a remake, while faithful, is not quite as well done (acted among other things) as that original."

","Ren and Ariel dance and fall in love in a town where dancing is illegal for minors! It follows the original ""Footloose"" scene-for-scene in many places but the remake has a lot of energy and the necessary climatic dance scene does not disappoint. Kevin Bacon's charisma in the 1984 original is substituted here for the charisma of Julianne Hough in 2011. Ren's athletic skills as a big-city high school gymnast are again, understated. Basically a ""fish-out-of-water"" city boy becomes the subject of vicious small town gossip and is blamed for just about everything. He is framed for possessing a ""joint"" and gets an undeserved bad reputation as a troublemaker. Most entertaining in a ""Grease"" sort-of-way, including racing action. The critics never get it right and many of the ""users"" didn't like the remake. It's got a pretty-good soundtrack but in 1984, yeah, it was better. In the original version, there was book-burning, and that stupid idea is thankfully not in the remake. Very good dancing by all and most of it is fun to watch with a bit of overacting here and there. It's actually based on a true-life story about a small town that banned teen-aged dancing after a high school prom tragedy. Most of the film was ""made in Georgia"" and at realistic-looking locations. Some will argue that a remake was unnecessary as it was a rather ""minor"" film to begin with. The ""box office"" was exceptionally good, for a remake."

"brchthethird","5","0","3","31 January 2015"," A decent time-passer that should appeal to its target demographic
","I haven't seen the '84 original starring Kevin Bacon, so I didn't go into this with those kind of expectations. The plot is a fairly simple teens vs. adults story, so I also wasn't expecting anything terribly deep. And, now having finished it I would say that my limited expectations of at least being entertained were met. Beyond that, FOOTLOOSE is a very clichéd teen drama that just happens to have good music and dancing sequences. The gist of the story is that a city kid, Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) moves in with relatives who live in the sleepy southern town of Bomont, Georgia. Three years ago, after a tragic accident took the lives of five teenagers, the town council enacted a series of ordinances that aimed to prevent what caused it. Among those was an ordinance banning public dancing for those under 18 years of age.<br/><br/>To me, such a set up is flimsy at best but the film worked with it in a decent, if pedestrian, way. On the surface is functions as story in which the rebellious teens face off against the stubborn, over-protective adults. But, towards the end, they manage to shoehorn a message about parents learning to trust their children. Nice, but a little too late if you ask me. The most interesting aspect of the film to me was the way in which it pits small-town life and values against real-world logic. I don't feel like the film ever disrespected people who live like that, but it wasn't exactly friendly towards them either. More problematic to me was a minister (Dennis Quaid) who wants to protect his daughter (Julianne Hough) against an abusive guy, yet slaps her across the face when she starts mouthing him off. That one scene came as an unwelcome surprise to me, and something which seemed completely out of character.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, nobody was particularly bad. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell came off looking the best, but I wouldn't place what they did here among their best work. As for Julianne Hough, let's just say she shouldn't abandon her singing and dancing careers. Kenny Wormald did fine as Ren McCormack but, like every other actor playing a teenager in this film, was utterly unconvincing as such. In terms of filmmaking quality, the cinematography and choreography was fine but unspectacular. Overall, it was a decent time-passer that was fitfully entertaining. It was a little too predictable for my tastes, and also not targeted to me, but that shouldn't stop teenagers enjoying it for the frivolous piece of entertainment that it is."

I really enjoyed following this newish line of script. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the original Footloose will probably always be my favs - it was the one that we danced to after high school and during college; however, this version is an acceptable version to see, albeit it may never replace as my favorite. <br/><br/>I would encourage the naysayers to give this movie a chance.

","Now I may get eaten for this but I really liked this version better than the first one. It may have been because I watched this one first and to be honest am not that big a fan of Kevin Bacon, but no matter what I really liked this version better. Kenny Wormald (Ren) is an amazing actor, I mean he's good. Oh and he's a good dancer and he's hot-so now I'm just singing praises for him. ANYWAYS I liked the angry dance scene of this one better because of the naturalness and the mistakes (For instance Ren spinning off the car) it seemed so ANGRY and full of raw emotion. Kenny did a superb job with his dancing, it really made you FEEL the emotions. Julianne did a good job as Ariel too because just like Kenny she's a really good dancer and also a really good actor. As you see in the beginning she's too be honest a little bit of a slut but as it passes she starts being beautiful in a simple way and really starts showing off her natural beauty and her really well written personality. There's a song called Holding Out For A Hero by Ella Mae Bowen and the way it's incorporated into the movie showing Ren with the picture of his mom it's really beautiful, to be honest. There are some moments where it's gushy romance and than there's a full out brawl and than there's some sexy dancing. There are many elements in the movie and I fully recommend it to anyone."

","Footloose (2011) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Remake of the 1984 cult classic about a small town who pretty much shuts down all alcohol, loud music and dancing after five seniors are killed in a car crash after a party. Soon a guy from Boston (Kenny Wormald) coming to town and wanting to see things changed. He ends up involved with a troubled young girl (Julianne Hough) who just happens to be the daughter of the preacher (Dennis Quaid) keeping everything under control. There's not a single frame in this remake that comes close to the appeal of the first movie but based on its own merits, this here really isn't too bad and it's entertaining enough to make it worth sitting through once but if you're unfamiliar with the Kevin Bacon version then that's definitely the one to start with. There were a few problems with this version including the fact that the film really drags at 112-minutes. The movie feels quite long at times and especially the final thirty-minutes when things turn a bit too slow. Also, you have to take into consideration that this is pretty far from original as it's basically just a straight remake, although this one here updates some of the music. Still, for the most part I found the story to be entertaining and the characters, while not as good as in the original, fun enough to make this worth sitting through. I thought Wormald did a pretty good job in the lead, although that annoying Boston accent seemed to come and go in ever scene. Hough made for a good good girl trying to be bad. Quaid was fun in his supporting role and we even get Andie McDowell playing his wife. The rest of the teens fit their roles nicely. The music here is another plus as it sticks to some old stuff as well as mixing in the new while also sampling from many genres. This remake of FOOTLOOSE certainly wasn't needed and as I said it doesn't improve on a single thing but it's still an entertaining movie."

","As far as remakes go this movie was purely a trip down memory lane for those of us old enough to have seen the original in it's day. This cuts as a double edge sword to the quality though. It was great and refreshing to see a movie remake that totally follows the original and introduces it to a younger audience, but it also is kind of a let down to not see a lot of updates and an original take that could have made it much more interesting. The acting was sub par at best with the exception of Julianna Hough, who was a great choice in the role originally played by Lori Singer. I give this remake 6 stars because of its nostalgia but most of the cast was a bore, the ""gymnast aspect is too dated ( in 1984 it was an OK aspect because of the Olympic hype following Mary Lou Retton's perfect 10 ). Other than that its scene by scene and almost line by lines dependence on the original just doesn't deliver in this day and age and it is rather boring to watch an entire film that you have already seen many times before.<br/><br/>Depite its lack of an original updated take, it still is a must see at least for us that grew up on the original, and for those of us that have a crush on the All-American beauty that is Julianna Hough."

So it surprised me when I got to liking this one more and more as it played.<br/><br/>Oh, there were things that rankled me a bit, but not enough to destroy my enjoyment of the flick. Why have the lead guy sport a Johnny Depp 80's haircut? Not to mention he and Ariel looked somewhat older than ""17"". And he was supposed to be this fantastic, expressive dancer but I didn't see a lot to impress me. Kevin Bacon had the swagger necessary to sell what he was doing. This guy was just cocky.<br/><br/>I was put off by the conversion to so much country-style music, and the addition of rap-type tunes. Granted, they wanted to appeal to a larger audience but it just made for a haphazard soundtrack.<br/><br/>It was puzzling in that it was definitely a remake, with much of the exact same dialogue and some shot-for-shot and line-for-line reproductions, and even readings, of the original, so why do it? I'm a bit amazed that they even got an ""ethnic"" lookalike for Rusty, the Sarah Jessica Parker character. Dennis Quaid pouts through the entire film, except for one moment where he does flash his trademark grin.<br/><br/>Some of the things I liked: The uncle character was the total opposite of the original, which was a nice surprise in that he actually supported Ren instead of opposing him like most of the other adults.

","To state the obvious there seldom is a need, from the point of view of the audience, to remake an old favorite. But old favorites are remade all the time so let's judge it on entertainment value, without regard to a possible comparison to the original.<br/><br/>The basic story is unchanged, a tragedy that kills a group of high school seniors in a small close-knit community sparks very restrictive laws on how you can play music and where you can dance. Plus a very early curfew. A teenager enters the community from a different background, takes an interest in the local preacher's daughter, then takes it upon himself to challenge the restrictive laws.<br/><br/>The main reason for the remake seems to be to showcase a couple of talented young actor/dancers. Kenny Wormald is Ren , the new guy from Boston. (He really is from Boston.) He likes to work on cars and when he gets frustrated he likes to work it out by very vigorous dancing. (He really is an accomplished dancer.) Julianne Hough, who has done so well with several partners on 'Dancing With The Stars' (a show I don't watch) and who has achieved some success as a singer plays the part of Ariel , the preacher's daughter. She really is a cutie pie, the camera just loves her, plus she has a very nice and natural acting style. <br/><br/>There are also several other good actors, like Dennis Quaid as the preacher, but the story revolves around Ren and Ariel.

I rather enjoyed our Ren and Willard and I am glad they opted for talented 'not so well known' performers rather than handing the roles to over blown celebutards who have middling dancing skills (and no that is not a poke at Kevin Bacon - who was not very well known when he made the original either).<br/><br/>I'll admit to smiling at the little details from the first movie they tossed in, including what looks to be Kevin Bacon's entire wardrobe and yellow VW bug.<br/><br/>Really, the only bad thing I can say about this movie is, WHAT THE HECK was the stylist thinking when they put Ariel in that monstrously ugly pink dress at the end? Thankfully this Ariel has a figure worth looking at (sorry Lori Singer) and they make her wear that? When you see it, you'll get what I mean.

"eytand94","5","0","3","14 March 2012"," Footloose: A So-So Remake
","Of course, when you talk about remakes, you instantly make comparisons to the original. The original 1984 film ""Footloose"" had a ridiculous plot and cheesy acting, but with some neat choreography and classic music, that contributed to its charm. Was a remake of ""Footloose"" necessary? I don't think so. I approached this one expecting the worst. Fortunately, the movie wasn't awful. In fact, at moments, it's quite good.<br/><br/>Boston resident Ren McCormack moves to the small town of Bomont, where everything to the adults is religion and dancing isn't allowed. After a tragedy that occurred ten years ago, the town decided that any dancing or teenage activity is just wrong. Many teenagers are still breaking the rules, including Reverend Shaw Moore's daughter Ariel. Soon enough, Ren leads the pack in fighting to abolish the no-dancing law.<br/><br/>This remake is almost a scene-for-scene, line-for-line adaptation (the original film's writer Dean Pitchford co-wrote the script), so that certainly sets the film slightly on the wrong track.<br/><br/>But it should really come down to how the actors portray their characters, and there are some highlights of disappointment. Newcomer Kenny Wormald as Ren has his benefits, being a professional dancer. He sports some good choreography, especially in what I like to call ""the angry dance"" scene. However, some elements of believability are missing. At times, I didn't believe Ren's rebellious nature, unlike with Kevin Bacon's portrayal in 1984. Wormald seems afraid of his actions, which probably won't sit well with fans of the original. As for Ariel, Julianne Hough falls into Wormald's category. She is also a professional dancer, and her solo work during the film is energetic and entertaining. Her acting chops are decent, surprisingly. But the fact that she is almost 30 years old hurts her performance and makes us think her age doesn't fit the role. Dennis Quaid is still hamming it up in his movies, but actually holds back here as Ariel's father. There are some nice moments of father-daughter confrontation and Quaid's care for his family is a nice icing on the cake. Andie MacDowell's screen time as Vi Moore, Shaw's wife, is minimal. She almost disappears into the set.<br/><br/>The best actor here is Miles Teller as Ren's buddy Willard. Teller is funny and likable, and the sequence where he finally learns to dance is nifty and enjoyable.<br/><br/>And then there's the soundtrack, one of the film's biggest challenges. The original's music is a stand-out and still has people dancing to it. Over four songs from the original have been covered, and since director Craig Brewer (known for ""Black Snake Moan"" and ""Hustle and Flow"") has Southern roots in him, the soundtrack has a lot of country twang to it, but settles for a few hip-hop moments. One cover of ""Holding Out For A Hero"" is quirky and interesting. Blake Shelton's shot at the Kenny Loggins title classic is not bad. But then there are moments when the music falls flat. Jana Kramer's rendition of ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" is missing the stylish 80's funk of the original. And last, we have the classic love theme ""Almost Paradise,"" originally performed by Mike Reno and Ann Wilson. Victoria Justice and Hunter Hayes try their hand at this emotional classic, and the emotion feels stripped away. What was once a wonderful and vibrant ballad has turned into a Disney track.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie does have its strong points. The choreography is fantastic, and the acting sure isn't terrible. But the story of ""Footloose"" is dated by now and remains a fine display of an 80's guilty pleasure. This is just a carbon copy of the original that lacks some of its pizazz. The 1984 movie was cheesy to a hilt, and we love it for that. So why does the remake sometimes take itself too seriously? Pre-teens might find this one a blast. Die-hard fans of the original will be split right down the middle. But since I am a fan, Craig Brewer's ""Footloose"" could have been much worse."
"Bascoda","6","0","2","9 March 2012"," Not as bad as it could have been, but not as good as it should have been.
","In general, I'm not a fan of remakes; if it isn't broken, it doesn't need fixing. ""Footloose 2011"" is ""Footloose 1984"" with a different cast, some additional (and mostly unnecessary) back-story, and a few minor plot changes. Unlike the original score, the 'updated' music was mostly pretty forgettable, even the covers of the songs from the 1984 movie. <br/><br/>In the 1984 version, Kevin Bacon pretty much carried the show, with an able assist from Chris Penn, while Lori Singer was along for the eye candy. Bacon wasn't a dancer (Peter Tramm was his dance double)and Lori Singer's dancing was at best merely adequate, so director Brewer's idea of casting two professional dancers as leads in the remake seemed like a good idea - he was half right.<br/><br/>Kenny Wormald is an excellent dancer and certainly looked the part of Ren, but he lacks the charisma that Kevin Bacon brought to the role. His acting is adequate, but that's about it. I didn't actually dislike him as Ren, but he didn't do anything to make me particularly like him, either. <br/><br/>Julianne Hough, on the other hand, was a very pleasant surprise. She is a beautiful woman, a superb dancer, and (here is the pleasant surprise part) shows real promise as an actor. One of the things that makes her such a delight to watch (besides the obvious physical attributes) is that when she is dancing, she looks like she is loving every second of it.<br/><br/>In reprising Chris Penn's role as Willard, Miles Teller came pretty close to stealing the show a couple of times, especially in the sequence where Ren and his two young cousins are teaching Willard how to dance.<br/><br/>For a movie supposedly all about dancing, there wasn't nearly enough. What there was of it was nicely choreographed, in some cases a step-for- step recreation of the 1984 dance scenes, but shot with a confusing mishmash of close-ups, very awkward mid-range shots and not nearly enough long shots that would actually show the dancing instead of just hinting at it. <br/><br/>When I left the theater after seeing the 1984 film, I couldn't get the music out of my mind, I was humming ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"" for weeks afterward. Sadly, not so this time. <br/><br/>I'll give Julianne Hough and Miles Teller B+'s for their roles. Overall, I give the production a C+."

","I had HIGH expectations. Hustle and Flow is one of my favorite movies from the past few years, and Black Snake Moan was an equally enjoyable affair (although not quite as awesome). I never saw the original Footloose, so I am judging this film and story solely based on this movie (as I feel most remakes should be, regardless). The music is pretty solid for the first half, but almost entirely disappears form the second half. Willard is the best character, and provides most of the film's laughs. The writing and acting are decent and the direction is capable, but overall this just doesn't feel like a movie that needed to be made.<br/><br/>I will say, Brewer is the only person who could pull this off and make me watch the whole thing. His blues tunes in the early parts are amazing selections, and the choreography and geography are ideal for his type of film (music/""gritty"" visual color palette ). The last dance scene is pretty damn solid, too.<br/><br/>The biggest drawbacks were the over-the-top cheesiness of it all and the excessive runtime. This story could've easily been told in 90 minutes. Also, it is absolutely unconstitutional and I understand it has happened before (as in Elmore City), but it is unlikely that, even in a Southern religious town, anywhere in 2011 would ban dancing.

","I am a fan of the original. As THE ORIGINAL IS THE ORIGINAL! Kevin Bacon couldn't dance so what! He knew how to act and that was how the movie was a hit. Due to his charisma and charm. And angst out.<br/><br/>The film was good though not great. I have the CD to the original. The new leads, Kenny Wormald as Ren and Julianne Hough from Dancing with the Stars as Arial. Are OK as they were chosen for their dancing skills, though there were very few dancing scenes in it. But acting wise, they were OK. Though Wormald lacked Bacon's charm and charisma. Hough is a little better than the original Arial, Lori Singer. Though Hough is better than Wormald and if she keeps choosing the right roles, she will only keep getting better at acting.<br/><br/>But the main highlight as everybody and critics say on this board is Miles Teller, as Willard. As he has a huge future ahead of him. He saved the movie with his acting skills and learning how to dance. Along with his wit and charm. That is enough to see the film.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid replaces John Litgow as Rev Shaw Moore. Quaid is likable though he doesn't bring out the firestorm and angst Litgow did in the original. Nice to see Andie McDowell back on the big screen. But she doesn't have much to do. And lacks the presence of Dianne Wiest had more of a presence as Vi Moore, the Rev's wife.<br/><br/>All in all, the new soundtrack is OK and has a country feel to it. But not enough like the original. All in all, the original is the original. Though director Craig Brewer tries his best to keep an original feel to it. The late Herb Ross has the chemistry and charisma in the original we have all known and loved.<br/><br/>THE ORIGINAL IS THE ORIGINAL!"

","Stevie Wonder (Songs in the Key of Life, 1976) remained the Music Maestro even after the King of Pop coronation (Thriller, 1983).<br/><br/>I was 27 when the one-and-only-Kevin-Bacon danced his way into the hearts of the then-still-corny-by-proxy-pop-music-not-rap-not-as-good-as Michael Jackson's 1983 Moonwalk. Just as Michael Jackson was the Moonwalk, Kevin Bacon was Footloose - two different pleasures enjoyed at different times in our lives because music and dancing became the best of friends and the best of lovers.<br/><br/>Stevie Wonder is The First Love. Same goes for Jennifer Holliday (And I'm Telling You), Minnie Ripperton (1981) and Mr. Robert Nesta Marley (1981).... First Love and First Dance. Michael Jackson is the First Dance. Sade reminded us ""Its Never As Good as the First Time"" taking me back to Stevie Wonder and the First Love and if one is very lucky another First Dance.<br/><br/>Footloose (1984) is the Last Dance before the party ends.<br/><br/>There is no point to the party of Footloose (2011), there is no sinner, man."

","Have you ever dragged your heels on something... a movie remake, perhaps... not wanting to give up your old favorite in favor of the new shiny version? And have you ever just taken a peek at the previews of the new version... just for research purposes... to see what the hype was about? And maybe, just maybe, decided to see for yourself if the new version was worth your hard-earned money? You know... just in case you were wrong?<br/><br/>Of course, if this was you, you were fully prepared to hate the new version. It couldn't possibly live up to the original. After all, the original is a classic. No one can improve on a classic, right?<br/><br/>Um... yeah. Yeah they can. Improve on a classic, that is.<br/><br/>My daughters and I just returned from seeing the new Footloose. And from the very first musical note, I was traitorously in love. Yup... the original (classic) was good, but the remake is much better.<br/><br/>I have no problem being wrong here! And I highly recommend this movie. I may have... at some point... commented to my daughters that I was thankful we went for a matinÃ©e and that we sat at the back of the theater because I sort of wanted to get up and dance. (I didn't though. They were relieved.)<br/><br/>The casting was decent. We all loved Willard. He looked just like he was supposed to. And our favorite scene was the remake of his learning-to- dance lessons. They staged much of it just like the original. Those were our favorite scenes then... and they're our favorite scenes now.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the musical choices. Much of the original score was used. Some songs, though, were tweaked a little. My older daughter and I looked at each other during one of the tweaked songs to express our displeasure. Oh well. We couldn't love everything.<br/><br/>One other item for the (very short) dislike column was the inconsistency of the accents. Ren seemed to segue in and out of his Boston drawl. And the Southern wasn't Southern enough... or consistent enough... for me. But again, we couldn't love everything. (And I was the only one of our party of three to notice this. The girls didn't hear it.)<br/><br/>One change that touched me was when Ren approached Ariel's dad about taking his daughter to prom. In this scene, Ren shared about his mother's loss, and the reverend shared about his son. I don't remember this scene in the original. My older daughter said something similar was there, but I can't place it. Either way, whether the scene was new or adjusted from the old, it was a great improvement.<br/><br/>Other improvements included better explanations of certain plot elements: the reason for the dance ban, the reason for Ren's move to town, and the procurement of the warehouse for the dance.<br/><br/>Overall, we are very happy that we spent our hard-earned money on movie tickets and soda (no popcorn this go-round). The producers of this movie kept the classic parts of the original and made some awesome improvements. Check it out.<br/><br/>Confidential P.S. to the Movie Makers of the World: Don't mess with our Dirty Dancing, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller, or Pretty in Pink... unless, of course, you want to hook Andie up with Duckie in the end. We'd be wholly okay with that change."
"lil_cal-ovey","8","0","4","3 November 2011"," Quite Good.
","I thought this film was very enjoyable almost as good as the original, but i wish they put more dance into it, and then it would of been absolutely awesome. This film has a feel good tone to it, i came out of the cinema smiling and dancing with my cousin. The music in this film is absolutely awesome just like the original. The acting in this film could be improved, i thought Kenny, Julianne and Dennis were awesome but some of the back characters were really cheesy, offensive or boring. The three children in the back ground are absolutely hilarious and add so much to the story line. This film is definitely Craig Brewer's best yet.I think this film definitely deserves a higher rank then 5.1 so i would give it a 7."
"raisleygordon","Null","0","4","30 October 2011"," Entertaining, but not necessarily exciting
","""Footloose"" is a pleasant-enough movie as it is, but I think it could have used tougher material and characters with more depth. We don't get nearly enough scenes involving the priest. Even if he is an obvious character, he still could, would and should have given the movie some juice. Ren, the character previously played by Kevin Bacon, isn't as troubled as you'd expect him to be, or as he should have been. With the title ""Footloose"", I expected something more. And I also wanted more dancing, too. The only dancing that's offered here comes during the opening titles, the last scene of the movie, and somewhere after dancing has been outlawed. If this is supposed to be a ""musical"", then the movie really falls short. I was moderately entertained, but not necessarily surprised. On another note, doesn't Ren's girlfriend remind you of Ellen Pompeo? And a little of Jennifer Aniston? **1/2 out of ****"
"k-o-coggs","7","0","4","27 October 2011"," Actually better than the original
","It is difficult for a re-make to stand up and get noticed against an original hit like Footloose, but I found myself really relating to the characters in this movie more than I did the original. Kenny Wormald (who reminded me of a young Johny Depp) as Ren MacCormack did an excellent job of making me feel the frustration he had of not being able to make a difference with his mothers death. Julianne Hough really brought home the self destructive path that Ariel Shaw was on after her brothers death. Students of the original movie will get a kick out of the identical settings, hair styles and other things (right down to Ren's car) that were in the re-make. Miles Teller as Willard was the best character of all. He aced it and was twice as good as the original. In all, more depth of character and better dance scenes made it definitely worth buying a ticket."
"w_bryan_meek","8","0","4","25 October 2011"," One of the best remakes I have ever seen
","I admit that I loved the original Footloose and was not happy to hear they were remaking it - remakes are almost never good. But what a pleasant surprise this was. The update was nice, it stayed true to the original but the update on the music and dancing and the bus race was awesome. I am glad they didn't play chicken with tractors again, that is the right kind of change to a movie. I will say that the only thing I did not like about the movie was that they choose an unknown country singer and a ""Nick Teen Star"" to perform ""Almost Paradise"" - This song is iconic. Ann Wilson is amazing and the new version of this song is really a let down. Also, not that I wanted a movie full of cameos, but I do thing that Kevin Bacon should have played the judge. Just a small cameo would not have hurt. All in all I really did enjoy seeing this movie. I took my 20 year old daughter to see it - the theater was full of people who were around when the original was released. Everyone sang the songs, which was nice, and applauded at the end. People need to do that more. Go see it - it is worth it!"

","Easy to watch fluff movie. You know the whole story from the original or the trailers. Arrive late and you can miss the hard to watch car accident and the extremely sad dead child speech in church. <br/><br/>Fun dance sequences separated by forced drama. No surprises. A tad long perhaps due to the written and directed by syndrome. Could have been improved with more dance and less conversation. Stars dance 9 act 5.<br/><br/>It won't be a classic of the genre or a trivia game without Kevin Bacon. <br/><br/>Well photographed in interesting locations. Enjoyable soundtrack. OK for the kids except for the violence directed toward women, and trucks. Check your mind at the door, and go enjoy the popcorn."
