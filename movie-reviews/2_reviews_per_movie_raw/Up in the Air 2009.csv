","Halfway through this movie I considered it an 8 out of 10 and decently spent money. The second half came as a big surprise. George Clooney let go of all his suave and let his eyes show fear and isolation that real people feel.<br/><br/>There were two things going on in this movie. On one end, we were looking at the people getting fired. On the other end, we were seeing the problems with Ryan's way of life. The interviews at the end with the people who lost their jobs explaining that it was family and support that brought them through bad times hit a perfect note for bringing both parts of the story together.<br/><br/>The title of this film literally explains what it is like to not know what aspects of your life are solid, such as a home or a significant other. Everything going on is simply up in the air. One day, what you thought was one way will turn out to be something else entirely.<br/><br/>Best of Reitman's three. Very much recommend it."
"jaredmobarak","9","273","388","19 September 2009"," I'm like my mother, I stereotype—it's faster  Up in the Air
","Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, George Clooney stars as corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham, who is hired to help ease the transition of long-term employees to the unemployment line across the country. Taking his job very seriously and loving the 290 days away from home—the only problem with that is the 70 days at home in his empty apartment—his world gets turned upside-down when a young upstart in the company threatens to ground the company to fire people via the internet. Not standing for a change in his life, nor the chance for his life goal of total airline miles to end, (""Let's just say I have a number and I haven't hit it yet""), he goes on a mission to prove how personal his job is and how key a face to face meeting can be to talk down an emotionally unstable person and really do the victim a service in an otherwise horrible moment in his life. Along the way, he and the recent college grad, of which the boss loves due to her budget slashing game-changing idea, Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, both find out what has been lacking in their lives and how to become better people, opening up to love, heartbreak, and the need to grow up.<br/><br/>Clooney's Bingham is the loner businessman whose only relationships exist from random meetings with attractive females at the multiple airports he frequents. His wallet of plastic has become his lifeblood—credit cards from airlines that accumulate his mileage, hotel status perk cards that let him cut the disgruntled travelers and go straight to the front, and numerous room keys that never seem to be thrown out, causing him to always use more than one before finally opening his hotel suite's door. Detached from his family for years as the brother that exists but cannot be counted on for anything, he contemplates whether he should, or really wants to, attend his sister's wedding—the little girl of the family and someone he should have been involved with after the passing of their father. A series of style cramping incidents for him begins with a phone call from his other sister and the request to take a cardboard cutout of the happy couple, (Melanie Lynskey and Danny McBride, in a role that might actually show some nuance for a guy that usually flies by the cuff), and photograph it in front of famous places he travels to for work ""like that French gnome movie,""—I love the Amélie reference. Then comes the threat of being taken out of the air, his home for decades, in order to impersonally let go more people more efficiently; the challenge of taking Natalie on his next schedule of jobs to prove to her why the new system won't work; and the addition of a love interest in Vera Farmiga's Alex, a woman who describes herself to him with ""just think of me as you with a vagina""—one of many great lines.<br/><br/>There is a lot of subtlety and intricate weaving of plot lines throughout the story, details and sequences that need to be seen fresh to get the full benefit of the film. What you might initially think is a witty comedy about a jerk of a guy who not only thinks he's better than everyone else, but actually is, that either finds the error of his ways or gets dropped down a peg or two, eventually becomes a tale chock full of heart and emotion. The real success story of the film is a revelatory performance from Clooney who really knocks this on out of the park. He always showed the charisma and chops to play confident and successful, but here is allowed to also branch out and express the pent-up frustration that comes with isolated loneliness, the passion one can have for a job that seems horrible, yet, when treated carefully, is a job to take seriously, and the compassion for humanity on the whole, softening enough to realize that there are people around him that need help besides his laid off strangers, help that only he can provide. The evolution he undertakes is really pretty amazing and I credit Kirn, Reitman, and Clooney for pulling it off with grace and laughter.<br/><br/>Every single actor is unforgettable—even the bit parts like Zach Galifianakis and especially J.K. Simmons as two corporate employees who's jobs have been eliminated. Jason Bateman is hilarious as Clooney's smug boss, fully embodying the take no crap nonchalance he made famous in ""Arrested Development""; Farmiga is gorgeous and competent to be able to go toe-to-toe with Clooney in the detachment and power-hungry attitude of flying in style for half a year or more; and, if George's reinvention of character is revelatory, then Kendrick's naïve Natalie is masterful. This girl was top in her class, able to get a job in her field wherever her heart desired, yet settled for this firm specializing in firing people so as to not dirty the workers' real superior's hands. Young and confused about life in the big world of adulthood—set on a plan for marriage and children to occur as though set times on a clock—her eyes are opened to the intimacy and fragility with which a person's mental state can be affected by mere words. When you put them all together, Up in the Air resonates on so many levels; deserving of any praise and accolades to be bestowed upon it. Hilariously funny every second of the way, it is still unafraid to dig into the dark moments of life and treat them with respect and relevancy, going places you wouldn't think it would have the guts to go. You really can't say too much about the film, a top ten of the year entry for sure. Reitman proving to be a force to reckon with and Clooney that he just keeps getting better with age."
"overcranked","10","149","219","9 December 2009"," Another hit from the Director of Juno, Jason Reitman
","Anyone who has ever been fired must see ""Up In The Air."" Jason Reitman has done again. The director of ""Thank You For Smoking"" and ""Juno"" puts real life out there in an incredible way, where we all laugh and then walk out of the theatre thinking about what is really important. A film with a message that's entertaining: what a concept.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man that flies all over the country firing people for companies that don't have the spine to do it themselves. He is so proficient at it, when he meets his ""expert traveler"" equivalent, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga); he is emotionally drawn to another person, beyond a passing interest, for the first time.<br/><br/>Bingham's travels are a quest to be a traveling legend. When his company takes the advice of young newbie, Natalie Keener (Kendrick), he is grounded, endangering his quest to achieve frequent flier miles that number in the, uh, stratosphere. When his boss (Jason Bateman) assigns him to ""show her the ropes,"" so she can revolutionize the company's firing technology, the resulting road trip is not only riotously funny, it is a self-exploring journey into the three people's strengths and weaknesses. The life decisions they make are the emotionally important message of the film.<br/><br/>The rest of the story must go untold, so you can savor every morsel from your own perspective. For that is what this film does best. Almost all of us have been canned. Sitting across the table, being told we'll be glad it happened, one day. Our participation in the film is subtle, as we sit across the table from Bingham as he cans us.<br/><br/>The film's cast is like the story: they suck you in. Clooney is Clooney, like Cary Grant was Cary Grant. You think he's not acting, that's just who he is in real life. Maybe it is. Vera Farmiga's performance is seductively natural. You've met people like her. You admire her. Then you find out you don't know her at all. She is the mystery you wish you were. Anna Kendrick as Natalie is a perfect, perky, know-it-all that becomes all too human. Kendrick makes her character's transformation special parts of the film, when she could have easily have been regulated to a supporting character. This has become Reitman's trademark as a director. He empowers actors to make the movie their own.<br/><br/>Up In The Air is a movie that is over before you want it to be. You want to get to know the characters better, to follow them around a little longer and make sure everything goes well for them. Another credit to Reitman for his extraordinary skill at taking the common things in life and make them extraordinary. Which makes us all feel better about the common-ness of our own lives.<br/><br/>Written by: Vincent for Overcranked.net If you liked this come read more reviews http://www.overcranked.net/movies.php"
"Katz5","10","256","388","7 December 2009"," A '00s Masterpiece
","So 2009, and the decade known as...(what do we call this decade?), are ending later this month. And there is no better film to wrap up a (frankly) terrible decade (in terms of news events, unemployment, the economy, the media stronghold, the trashing and dumbing down of American culture, technology, narcissism, vanity obsession, a divided nation, violence and hostility) than Up in the Air. The film, the best I've seen all year and one of the best of the decade, captures many of the factors that made this decade the worst one, at least in my 42 years. The 70s may have been bad economically but hey, at least we had Bruce Springsteen and real music on the radio, women still seemed to like men and not only if the men were millionaires, thoughtful movies in the theater, and only five or so TV channels to pick from. Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man with no ""roots,"" (that is, no wife, no kids, and his apartment in Omaha is about as furnished as a room at Embassy Suites), who fires people for a living because the companies who hire him are too cowardly to do it themselves. It is a juicy role for Clooney, who has made a career out of playing easy-talking charmers. The film sounds depressing and in many ways it is, but it is also witty, quietly hilarious at times, and full of pathos when it becomes a morality piece near the middle (and like the best morality pieces, it doesn't shove its message down your throat). It reminded me in many ways of American Beauty, the masterpiece that capped off the '90s when it hit theaters ten years ago. Clooney's character slowly is stripped of the things he only cared about--including a one-night-stand that becomes a ""Same Time Next Year""-like meeting in Hampton Inns and Hiltons in Miami, Detroit, Wichita and other random cities, with another constant traveler (we never know what exactly she does, and that's not supposed to matter) played by Vera Farmiga, who may win an Oscar nomination for her mysterious, slightly passive and jaded, 30something character. The final important character is an eager young Cornell graduate (played by Anna Kendrick, from Twilight) who thinks that a career in firing people is a wise choice now, and in some respects she's not that far off. Her character represents many of the Twitter-obsessed twentysomethings driven for money money money, who live for texting, and has naive and even immature ideals of what makes a relationship work. But she too goes through a transformation, as Up in the Air reaches a ""feel good while feeling bad"" quality of Frank Capra's darker films, like Meet John Doe. One of the most amazing things about this film is its use of real people in the ""firing scenes;"" people who have really lost their jobs several weeks or months before being filmed. Director Jason Reitman combines scenes of these people being fired by Clooney and Kendrick, and their instant responses are wholly authentic. There are a few actors playing the ""firees"" as well, but they blend in with the real folks. I really can't think of a better film to cap off this decade. This one will stay with you. Highly recommended."
"ClaytonDavis","9","189","284","28 November 2009"," Breathes New Air...
","Director Jason Reitman, that has brought us great Indie classics such as Thank You for Smoking and Juno has crafted his most personal and most effective portrait to date, Up in the Air. The film stars George Clooney, also giving his most intimate and beautiful performance of his career, as Ryan, a traveling ""Firing-Man,"" who plans on racking up as much frequent flyer miles as he can. Completely void of human connection and emotion, even from his two sisters, one of which is getting married, Ryan seems completely content with his choice of living. All seems well until he meets his female version in the beautiful and charismatic Alex, played with sexual force and intensity by Vera Farmiga. At the same time, a change at his job makes him acquire a student, Natalie, played with sensitivity and vigor by Anna Kendrick, to learn the ropes of the business before potentially making a devastating change to Ryan's way of life.<br/><br/>The film, based on the book of the same title, is a moving and witty piece of cinema. The line deliveries given are some of the best liners of the year. The adaptation by Reitman and Sheldon Turner is of beautiful and social importance in today's day and age. There was no better time than now, to bring a film like this to the table. Dana E. Glauberman's crisp and precise editing sets the pace as we travel with Ryan in this beautiful account. Reitman's direction shows he's a force to be reckoned with and should be in full blown force for Oscar consideration along with the adaptation shared with Turner.<br/><br/>George Clooney, who's having one hell of a year along with his other comedic turn in The Men Who Stare at Goats, gains sympathy and emotion from the viewer, which up until now, Clooney had always struggled for. The role is right up Clooney's alley and with humorous strength, conveys the pain and loneliness of an otherwise charming man successfully.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga as Alex, is a beautiful as she is dark, and as sexy as she is ugly. Farmiga has finally landed the right role that, in her years of wrong place at the wrong time, should land her a first-time Oscar nomination. Never showing her hand, Farmiga keeps and earns your trust, attention, and admiration. It's one of the most divisive and structurally brilliant supporting turns of the year. <br/><br/>Seemingly not playing with a full deck is Natalie, played most beautifully by Anna Kendrick, who portrays brains don't equal smart choices. Kendrick earns your care and concern for the character, as she follows Ryan around and constantly badgers him about happiness and love, she naïvely and courageously shows the tenderest parts of youth in today's world. Kendrick will likely be sitting along side Farmiga at Oscar's ceremony.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman, playing Craig Gregory, the boss in charge, is amusing in a brief but memorable role. Amy Morton and Melanie Lynsky, who play Ryan's sisters, are valuable and sufficient enough to book end a wonderful tale. Danny McBride, an outstanding comic talent to watch, is as good as ever. And finally, in otherwise cameos, Sam Elliott and the great Zack Galifianakis are uproarious in their respective roles.<br/><br/>This could very well be the crowd and critical pleaser of the year. It has what the 2004 film Sideways lacked, the emotional edge. Long after the film, you take these characters home with you and remind yourself of its authenticity in delivery, poise, and premise. Up in the Air is one of the best pictures of the year. ****/****"
"blogandsqualor","6","161","264","19 December 2009"," Don't Believe the Hype
","""Up In the Air"" is perhaps the most hyped film of the year, and also the most undeserving of said hype.<br/><br/>The story is a simple and predictable one. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a consultant sent throughout the country to fire unsuspecting employees for bosses too cowardly to do the job themselves. He lives for the routine of these trips and the frequent flier miles, spending only a few days at home in a studio apartment too small for a house cat. Enter 23 year-old upstart Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who revolutionizes the process with video conferencing, removing the last human element from the job. Bingham is naturally horrified by the changes and is forced to take Natalie under his wing, teaching her the ways of the force, getting her to loosen up while simultaneously showing her a thing or two about humanity and the wisdom of experience. As his relationship with fellow chronic traveler Alex (Vera Farmiga) heats up, Natalie imparts her own advice to Bingham, helping him to grow a heart.<br/><br/>I could have let the predictable story go if director Jason Reitman had given the audience something else, anything else. But the script is entirely lackluster, full of cheap one liners that even Clooney's usual charm just barely supports. Clooney does his usual Cary Grant routine, which is neither here nor there, not horrible, but not groundbreaking, all sadness in the eyes and slight smile. It is refreshing to see Vera Farmiga as a love interest, a woman over 30 who neither whores herself out or plays the strong ice queen, but exudes intelligence and confidence without becoming a caricature of the high-powered woman. Here, she's entirely natural and beautiful in an atypical way. I'm also strangely attached to Kendrick, who doesn't do anything that impressive, but seems to be trying hard enough. It's in the few bonding moments between Clooney's Bingham and Kendrick's Natalie that the film takes a minute of serious drama and finds a bit of sincerity, but these moments are few and far between.<br/><br/>If the film had concentrated on the superficiality and desolation of corporate consulting, we might have gotten somewhere. Or, if Bingham and Natalie had found themselves unemployed, the film might have presented just the type of irony and schadenfreude we would need to relate. Instead, the film makes an attempt to reach out to the jobless masses of America in the most trite and insulting way possible, the only slight reflection of sincerity found in the sadness of Clooney and Kendrick's eyes as they listen to the newly unemployed lament their inevitable fates.<br/><br/>Many critics have praised this film for its timeliness and Reitman's understanding of the current American situation. It was irritating to sit there and watch Bingham tell a man that being fired was his chance to become a French cuisine chef, after the man had just talked about his expensive mortgage and his daughter's need of health care. After a little smile and pep talk from Bingham, the man is suddenly on board, ready to follow his dreams. It's always helpful to be positive and stay focused, but there comes a point when this sort of clichéd platitude becomes insensitive, and here, Reitman shows himself the king of producing them. The film didn't need this sort of faux validation to draw out the drama, there was already enough there to work with.<br/><br/>For a typical film, Up In the Air is perfectly satisfactory and an enjoyable enough distraction for anyone that gets pleasure watching Clooney do what he does best. But ignore the hype, ignore the awards, and lower your expectations. There's nothings shocking or particularly moving here, unless of course you're one of the unemployed. In that case, it's better to just go see something like ""Avatar"" and escape for a few hours."
"vortex007","7","21","29","13 February 2010"," Subjective reality
","Up In the Air takes us to the story about Ryan Bingham, respective man who flitting from city to city to sack employees, yes it's his job. I've never heard about such job so to my utterly astonishment I knew that some bosses are to gutless to do this themselves, so they hire such guys as Ryan Binghanm to do it. Ryan Bingham is a perfect guy, charming, seductive, smart, well-groomed and real gentleman. He's into juice when it's necessary, likes to talk in sarcastic and trenchant tone, has cynic attitude to almost every things in that life especially love and family. No doubt a lot of men dreaming about such life as he has.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman (the director of Up In the Air) tries to show that it's not right to be such kind of person. Because family and love are obviously the most important things (in his opinion of course). That's the main thing that disappointed me in Up In the Air. I had always assumed that no one knows what's the most relevant thing for every people in this world. If somebody wants to make family, OK no problem! Go on! If you want to be single, OK, go on! And nobody can blame anyone in wrong life attitude, cos it's impossible to prove which attitude is the most correct. Everybody choose his own way and it's his choice. Besides real life already proved that in most cases truly happy family it's a utopia and there is nothing to do with it. <br/><br/>So why Jason Reitman persistently tries to prove that's the only one way is right? Why? Why he shows us that we shouldn't neglect family and love? I don't understand it. If he thinks that everybody who hasn't got family is miserable I'd say he's seriously mistakes. He can't decide for over the 6 billiards of people. Everyone have his own view on happiness. And badly that such idea in dozens of movies brainwash the public and make them to do what they don't want in fact. I'm happy that at least George Clooney's hero eventually remained single and proceeded his travel around US. Surely such move deserves accolade because it's quite uncommon element of Hollywood movies when love story line ends tragically. No expected happy-end, that's the only one reason I loved the film. <br/><br/>Clooney's elegant veneer great as always but it hasn't satiric reflection, his jokes, are quite amusing and make you chuckle occasionally, but nothing special. Comedy is not the strongest side of this work. Anyway it's a good movie to ponder about life in a deep sense of it, but at my point spectator shouldn't instantly take a side of the director here, spectator just need to realize that our life has different ways and nobody can blame if you choose another one instead of typical family path."
"mistarkus","8","93","152","7 December 2009"," A Decent Satire
","We are drawn in by interesting, unique storyline and smart satirizations. About a man whose unique job is to fly around the country to inform people that they are fired. He meets a young ambitious woman that joins his company and who wants to change the system. Her ideas clash with his personal lifestyle choices.<br/><br/>What the movie really is about is lifestyle choices, and relationship choices, choosing independence and freedom versus commitment and well established interpersonal relationships. By taking a definitive stance the movie provides interesting commentary on those that for whatever reason (not necessarily for work) don't stay put. <br/><br/>A Monotone mood is established, that gave a bland aspect as though nothing substantial was happening. Part of the story took a dull meandering at times, however there were unconventional plot twists that made something that was seemingly Hollywood predictable not that way at all. And it was still interesting and entertaining to watch the contemporary witticisms. <br/><br/>The two main characters, although not the most true to life characters ever created, were brilliant satires of people we all know. We are all too familiar with the fiercely independent, non-committal, cockily at ease bachelor and we have also come across the, sharp, type A, ivy league know it all yet with an obvious naivety especially shown with her declaration of the specific laundry list of traits that her partner must have. <br/><br/>There were also some smart satirical illustrations of contemporary times in business, relationships, how people interact and the recession. For example the use of the smart phones in the new techno/relationship world is not simply put in as a momentum mechanism but is used as a symbol to satirize contemporary society. <br/><br/>It is not so much Clooney's acting that is a marvel as the casting, which was perfect. By being so spot on by choosing someone on the cusp of getting a little older yet with plenty of playful, youthful vigor we sense the conflict and the melancholy."
"robert-broerse","5","42","66","15 January 2010"," Blah and then some...
","On the surface, an easy going film with an almost message, semi-memorable characters and a bit of believability. George Clooney's 'Ryan' goes around the country firing people for corporations that don't have the respect or humanity to do it themselves.<br/><br/>There is a love interest here and there is the moderately keen, Miss Keener ready to revolutionize the world of firing tagging along with charming Ryan. But where the film could have said something about human relationships, about humanity, about the real Zeitgeist of our incredibly cut throat Western world with its reliance on child labour designer clothing, Made in China products and our pathetic reliance on technology to improve our lives, it jumps into a banal story about the human heart and learning to let go of control. Once again, another film about a man afraid of the Commitment Monster...<br/><br/>Blah... trite and too basic to be tender, the director had a potential gold mine here but mined the blasé and the overused. A film with such an intriguing idea skips around the Truth and the Heart, giving us a leading man burnt by a woman and living on in a world far too much like his broken heart. Just blah.<br/><br/>And again... what a great idea for a film (based on the book) but everything you'd want to see in it, they leave out...(how lives are destroyed by the inhuman terminations...) go figure... No one is changed in this movie, no one is really touched and Miss Keener gets a great job at the end (leading me to believe she might get fired later by someone like Ryan had this been a good movie)."
"jacklmauro","2","28","43","20 August 2010"," Flying WAY Over Cohesion and Continuity
","What this has going for it: a solid performance by the girl who plays Natalie, a few droll lines, and a twist. But this twist is actually the worst thing about this film. It's worse than the 'Requiem for a Dream' quick-cut repetitive sequences. It's worse than Clooney's relentless crinkly-eyed smile, which I could not take any more, ever, after twenty minutes. It's worse than the cliché parades of fired people and their contrasting reactions, and it's worse than the blatant, blatant, blatant metaphors of travel/solitude/loneliness/baggage. What is it? The twist is when Clooney's character runs from his isolationist preaching gig to find his lady love, only to knock at her door and discover her married and with kids. And this 'twist' took me by surprise simply because the screenplay had made it unthinkable. Had Clooney remained devoted to flying around and the woman an occasional liaison, fine. But LONG BEFORE his dream is shattered by her, he reveals himself changing. He takes her to his old school. He takes her to his sister's wedding. He opens up very, very much. So - her speech to him afterward about his being just a 'good time guy', as well as her anger and confusion, are utterly ridiculous. This made me really angry, that poor writing gets to jump chasms over continuity. All in all, this is Hollywood-as-meaningful tripe. You're better off with the Vampire garbage."
"rangex","5","38","61","31 December 2009"," A self-contradictory take on romance in the (post-) modern world
","Dealing just with thematics and ignoring the fact that, throughout, I found watching the film to be trying (enough in itself, of course, to warrant a poor rating), Up in the Air doesn't work: it's disingenuous and self-contradictory.<br/><br/>Clooney's character is positioned at the outset as sharp and appealing, his ideas apt with respect to the world in which we see him engaged. Yet, contradicting itself tonally and explicitly in terms of its two dueling ideologies (alienation versus connection), pulling the proverbial rug from under its protagonist's feet, Clooney – falsely – endorses his sister's marriage and ""transforms"" into a man who longs for what he previously had with such conviction shunned. Ultimately, it comes down, not to content, but to the way Reitman deals with the material. Many great films laud human connection as invaluable, but Up in the Air doesn't make me buy its central character's arc or its confused conclusion.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (Clooney) speaks with his sister's fiancé, Jim, played by Danny McBride, and effectively convinces him to go through with the marriage with Julie despite Jim's legitimate (and convincing) doubts. The scene is not, as Reitman intended, indicative of some kind of maturation in Bingham – it's a self-contradiction. The scene following this betrays the film's bias and cues us emotionally; the sweet contempo-folk track and the loving kiss and make-up between husband-and-wife-to-be work to posit the marriage as authentic in the eyes of the film-text: it's a necessary affirmation of true love. Reitman plays this scene as warm and sweet; truly, its an acquiescence to the cultural status-quo that clashes with what the film has presented so far about marriage and relationships, as well as with Bingham's character as we've come to understand him. Marriage is ""adult"" and real, says the film, as opposed to Clooney's philosophy, which it dismisses ad hominem as ""childish"" rather than dealing with in any substantive way. Bingham ought to ""grow up,"" says his young co-worker Natalie (Anna Kendrick). Case closed.<br/><br/>So, we're presented with conflicting images: that of Bingham's (and the film's) endorsement of his sister's marriage; and that of relationships in general as transient and contrary to one's own interests (Alex, Bingham's sister, Natalie: all in varyingly failed or unhappy relationships). But nothing is done to either reconcile the tension between these or make any sense of them. They simply exist in the film alongside each other, despite their mutual exclusivity. Additionally, we can't understand why Bingham shifts camps. His sudden move from self-aware, post-modern isolationist to pining romantic is jarring and forced rather than organic. This might have been fixed were there some genuine chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga. A fifty year old man doesn't easily change in a major way how he lives his life, especially when he's as entrenched in his lifestyle/work as Bingham is. Clooney's interest in Alex (Farmiga) isn't enough to be convincing. How can he be willing to change everything on the basic of a few hot nights and some cute texts? (Armond White touches on another crucial flaw with the film in discussing this: ""...this movie looks wretched. The lack of emotional rapport between the actors starts with each one's poor lighting and bad angles."") The film simply makes an arbitrary value judgment without sufficient textual support: marriage and relationships are, innately, more meaningful and important than one's career. Apparently, for Reitman, this is a self-evident fact, needing no convincing elucidation.<br/><br/>The film presents Bingham as having, in the most facile sense of the word, ""matured"" by the film's end. He's rejected his ""empty backpack"" philosophy, but, sadly, can't have the woman he wants. The monologues by terminated employees at the end has one saying something to the effect of: ""In the end, it's my family – my wife and kids – that are what matter to me most."" Rather than being complicated, Up in the Air is simply confused. The first two acts of the film are spent showing (1) how problematic relationships and marriage are and (2) how lucid and believable Bingham's philosophy actually is. In way the film presents his sister's marriage (and with lines like the above), Up in the Air is shown to endorse an institution that it simultaneously shows to be non-functional. Clooney's final words indicate that he's alone for the long haul, forever ""doomed"" to the air. But, if anonymous-terminated-employee as well as Bingham's own sister and Danny McBride can have a meaningful, ""good"" marriage/relationship, why can't Bingham? It doesn't add up. Interestingly, the film begins with him being far more satisfied that he is at the conclusion. Yet, perplexingly, the new ideology (that leaves him less happy) is the one the film endorses, and the lifestyle of alienation (the one that, if not leaving him happy, at least led to his being in some way satisfied – perhaps the best anyone can be said to do) is dismissed offhand as childish. <br/><br/>A better film might have thoughtfully dealt with the tension between a desire for connection and the impossibility of genuine, lasting connection in post-modern, commodified society (a society in which Clooney has very effectively ingratiated himself and of which he has become, through his work, a somewhat fearful, but very real, emblem). Instead, Up in the Air is simply symptomatic of said desire. Because Up in the Air is so bafflingly blind to the relationship-problematics it outlines within its very plot content, it thus fails even to be ideologically reassuring, because, by endorsing what it at the same time show to be false – and disingenuously forcing its protagonist to do so as well – the viewer emerges from the theater confused rather than assuaged. There are films that convincingly and entertainingly deal with the importance of family and romantic love (from just this year, both Away We Go and Funny People), but Up in the Air is not one of them."

","This film is about a man who fires people for a living. His world becomes upside down when his job is radically changed by a newly recruited young fresh graduate.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" is a well made film. The plot focuses on character development and emotional changes of the characters. It is not easy to make characters interesting and memorable, but ""Up in the Air"" does just that. Both the characters of George Clooney and Anna Kendrick have strongly divergent attitudes and personalities, but they have great chemistry and change each other slowly but surely. How they radically shake each others core belief is engagingly told. I enjoyed watching ""Up in the Air"" a lot, as it tells an engaging story of self discovery."
"harbor21usa","8","21","32","8 January 2010"," A Really Good Flick With One Serious Flaw
","01-08-10 ""Up in the Air"" is a thoughtful and satisfying entertainment. I'm a big fan of the team of creative artists who made it happen. It's an amazing work of art from auteur, Jason Reitman. All the more impressive is the fact that he's only thirty-two. All of these kudos notwithstanding, I want to briefly address the character of Alex because therein lies a serious flaw. I'm not confirmed in my opinion, however, so I want to put it out here for possible contradiction.<br/><br/>Early in the second act, Alex (Vera Farmiga) starts showing palpable signs of falling in love with Ryan (George Clooney): her eyes, facial expressions and energy feel to me like a woman not only falling in love, but also a woman actively (although not verbally) seeking a deeper emotional bond and commitment. This culminates in the conversation with Natalie (Anna Kendrick), when Alex talks about the importance of marriage, children and home.<br/><br/>After Ryan and Alex attend his sister Julie's (Melanie Lynskey) wedding, Ryan is seeing clearly the emptiness of his jet-setting life and then, suddenly, he stops mid-sentence during one of his lectures and rushes to Chicago to see Alex; I think there's a marriage proposal balancing on the tip of his tongue.<br/><br/>Was Ryan primed for this change of attitude by recent events? Yes. Were the looks, expressions, energies and statements of Alex an important part of this priming? Yes.<br/><br/>When the big reveal happens, and Alex is uncovered as a committed wife and mother who only wants side-action with Ryan, I thought to myself, as the writer and director, Jason Reitman has exaggerated and simplified the transparency of Alex's feelings for Ryan in order to insure that the big reveal plays as a reversal that packs a wallop. This wallop, I think, comes at the expense of the psychological realism and moral validity of Alex.<br/><br/>Please consider an alternate second act in which the character of Alex is a bit more complicated: If Alex is morally and emotionally sound, and I think the movie wants us to feel that, for the most part, she is, then I don't think she would actively solicit a deepening emotional commitment with Alex without informing him that she's unavailable for marriage. A failure to do so is the self-centered, unscrupulous behavior of a rat. Likewise, denying this moral responsibility with a reference to Ryan's commitment to bachelorhood is a flimsy rationalization. It's entirely possible that Alex finds the force of her emotions such that she cannot help moving towards a deepening of emotional feeling for Ryan. However, as a decent person, I think she would have a deep internal conflict with this emotional trend. Of course this internal conflict and holding back by Alex would be detected by Ryan. Quite possibly, Alex would reach the apex of her internal conflict during the wedding, when she sees Ryan turning away from his confirmed bachelorhood towards a union with her. In turn, Ryan might interpret this behavior as a conflict about Alex's desire to maintain her single lifestyle. From here, the movie might show how Ryan, after the influence of his sister's wedding, flip-flops and becomes the person pursuing marriage while the woman resists. The through-line of cavalier good will and humor would be easily maintained by Ryan because he thinks he knows why Alex is resisting and then - Blam! - Ryan goes to Chicago on impulse and discovers the truth.<br/><br/>With this version, the reveal still packs a wallop, Alex remains a somewhat decent person, the psychology of her behavior remains valid and there's no telltale intrusion by the writer-director."
"cl777","9","46","79","7 January 2010"," Very enjoyable film, funny though the subject matter is serious
","We watched Up in the Air yesterday, by director Jason Reitman (of Thank You for Smoking and Juno fame) with George Clooney and two great female actresses- Vera Farmiga playing George's love interest and Anna Kendrick as his overly zealous co-worker. It was nice to get to know these two new faces. I had not seen Vera in a film before although she looked familiar and you might recognize Anna from the Twilight Saga where she plays Jessica, Bella's friend.<br/><br/>The movie is a very fast paced, excellently written, quite dark comedy centering around Clooney's character and his job which is firing people whose bosses ""don't have the balls to sack their own employees"". The actors playing the ""firees"" are real life people who have been terminated, adding a certain poignancy to their candid interviews. There are some excellent one-liners that come of these which George delivers perfectly ""try not to take this personally"", ""review this packet, I am sure you will find a lot of helpful information in it"" etc. These scenes make for some extremely memorable moments and George excels in the cynical but casual portrayal of his character, delivering each line with a super size heaping of charm.<br/><br/>Vera is fantastic as his female counterpart and quasi clone of him. I was most impressed with Anna and thought she did a terrific job maintaining her seriousness and composure during many of the firing scenes and hilarious interactions with George. One favorite of mine was when he forces her to change suitcases at the airport and to carry on instead of checking in- something he learned saves him about a week of time each year. While his luggage is always extremely neatly packed, each type of clothing having its own compartment, hers is overflowing with loose items and even a pillow. George proceeds to throw out half of her belongings as he tries to initiate her to his road warrior ways. He imparts some more wisdom when he tells her to always stand in line behind Asians, as they are quick and efficient. A pleasant relationship grows between them and it is nice to watch his character melt just a little bit.<br/><br/>Some of the banter between him and Vera is very funny but at times feels over scripted and not quite real, such as when they are comparing their elite status cards at their first meeting. I thought this was a bit overdone but very enjoyable nonetheless.<br/><br/>There is a lot of American Airlines and Hilton promotion but in counterpart Reitman got to shoot a lot of airport, airplane and hotel scenery for free and that's a pretty smart decision so once you know that, the blatant placement doesn't get too much in the way.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very enjoyable film, speaking very much to today's mood and spirit, easy to watch, with many laugh out loud moments. What could me more fun and humorous than to watch a company thriving on the misfortune of others. Things don't end so well for George's character Ryan Bingham however, as the holes and lack of performance in his own life are exposed throughout his journeys- no significant other, no children, weak ties with his family and worst of all, no place to call home.<br/><br/>Fabio and I both definitely recommend this film and give it a whopping 9/10!

"Willie-12","8","25","40","5 January 2010"," Good Movie...But Not Without Flaws
","**Major Spoilers** For about two thirds of Up In The Air, I was thinking to myself, ""this is definitely going to be on my top five list for the year."" The acting is very good. The characters were strong and likable. The dialogue was sharp and witty. There seemed to be the right mixture of both comedy and drama. It felt like a movie that was going somewhere great. Then came the rest of the story. Don't get me wrong. I've seen some films before that were ruined by bad endings. Up In The Air does not fall into that category. In fact, I wouldn't even call the ending bad. It was just not as well done as the rest of the movie. It felt hurried and predictable. I honestly don't think any of the events that occurred at the end of the film were a surprise to anyone watching (including the ""major"" revelation about Vera Farmiga's character). And a few of the scenes felt like they were slipped in out of obligation (i.e. the scene where Clooney's character calls the airline to set up a trip for his sister and her husband, or when we find out that Anna Kendrick's character quit because of the suicide). However, even with all of that, I still liked it. There was still so much that was good about this movie, that it might not be on my top five list for the year, but it is definitely on my top ten."

","Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) works for a company based in Omaha in downsizing business and gives motivational lectures. He travels to other companies to fire people and to give advice to the employee in their next step in their careers. The pragmatic and independent Ryan is completely detached and cool and he does not have any steady relationship and does not believe in marriage. He only dreams on reaching ten million miles in his favorite air company. During a trip, he meets the cynical executive Alex (Vera Farmiga) and they have one night stand; further they schedule a next encounter in Miami a couple of weeks later. When he returns to his head office, his boss has just hired the rookie and arrogant Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) that suggests the use of video-conference to fire people from their jobs and reduce the costs of flights, hotels and meals. Ryan exposes the failures in the proposed system and his boss assigns him to travel with Natalie to learn the procedure. Along their journey crossing America, Ryan has a closer contact with Alex and his family and feels uncertainty in his credo. In the end, he realizes that he is only a parenthesis in the life of Alex.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" is one of the most intelligent romantic comedy I have ever seen. The delightful story is engaging, with witty dialogs, dramatic situations and a charming couple – I am a big fan of the lovely Vera Farmiga, and George Clooney has his best performance in years, showing a wonderful chemistry with Ms. Farmiga. Anna Kendrick is hilarious in the role of Natalie and her attitudes reflect the behavior part of the younger generation. The double meaning of the original title is not possible to translate to Portuguese. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Amor Sem Escalas"" (""Love without Stop Over"")"
"oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx","7","54","97","29 January 2010"," Bring your own wine
","I really liked the movie, it kind of invites you to bring your own wine. There's a lot of probing into modern life and relationships, and it's up to you what you take from the film and what you feel for each of the characters. I was quite grateful for having seen Reitman's Thank You For Smoking (2005) previously, because both movies are really arch in the way they set up people in thoroughly pariah job roles and then get you to warm to them. So it didn't really come as a shock to see Clooney as an HR consultant (Ryan Bingham) whose job is to fire people in redundancy exercises where the management are too yeller, instead it rated an amused and knowing eyebrow raise.<br/><br/>Although a lot of the movie concerns the workplace, the disconnect between the interests of corporates and the interests of society (a link that was present historically in America, but which has been irrevocably decoupled), and how to work in that environment, the interest for me was more to do with relationships. From my male perspective there are some fairly poisonous insights into the female mind (though it may be unfair to generalise), the young Cornell grad Natalie Keener (played by Anna Kendrick) talks about her preconceptions of the man she will meet, the kind of name he will have, apparently the only thing he will love more than her is their ""golden lab"". The slightly older perspective from Alex Goran (played by Vera Farmiga) is that the man should be taller, should earn more, and come from a good family. To go with the aeronautical theme of the movie, the theatre should have provided some sick bags.<br/><br/>The main theme is, for me, pure Frank Borzage, it's about earning the right to love and be loved. In common with 80 years ago when those movies were being made, it's an onus that only weighs upon the male of the species, which makes the film a little hackneyed.<br/><br/>My favourite ambiguity of the film would have to be the backpack lectures that Bingham (Clooney) gives. He has a whole metaphor about everything in your life, the people, the trinkets, all the stuff you can collect, being in a backpack and weighing you down. He says that people aren't swans, they're not meant to be together forever, that they're actually sharks, who have to keep swimming continually, weighed down by nothing. I think there's an element of truth to both poles, I can see both arguments. I just love going to a Hollywood movie and not having an opinion shoved down my throat.<br/><br/>I had a slight problem regarding the level of realism in the film, I felt that the air-commuter lifestyle that was being shown was over-slicked, like I was watching something of a feather with The Consequences Of Love (or Giulia Doesn't Sleep At Night, two of the great modern hyper-stylised films from Italy). Nothing wrong with stylisation, except that I think Jason was trying to go for a film that had a lot of resonance with Recession America. I felt it was awkward to introduce real-life folks at the end, and also realistic looking termination assessments (or whatever they're called when you can someone), when the actors such as Clooney and Vera Farmiga were just so damned suave, as if from a different universe.<br/><br/>And this is to Claire."

Also remember that if you ever lose your job, it's best to do so when you have people depending on you because they will make it so much easier on you, and will be right by your side at the unemployment line supporting you all the way. Don't pay any attention to the stats that show divorce is next on the todo list after job loss, complete with the angry ex spouse and the dysfunctional kids.<br/><br/>Such is the inane message fed to the hungry mouths suckling at the teat of this film, but for me this heavy handed and simplistic message overwhelmed the film, and made what started out to be a decent light comedy, into a self contradictory philosophical mess suited only to a ten year old."

","This is one of the grimmer, unpleasant, and dehumanizing films I've seen in some time. Basically, its also an extended product-placement ad for American Airlines and Hilton Hotels, whose corporate logos are smacked in your face about every 10 minutes. Also its vaguely like the film ""Koyaanisqatsi"" but with actors and a story-line. I think that if the friends that I saw it with had put our heads together half-way through and done a whispered conference, we would have happily agreed to cut our losses and walk out. We wouldn't have missed much, including one of the more predictable plot ""twists"" in recent years.<br/><br/>I've been speculating on how on earth it could possibly win awards, let alone get much attention or praise. I'm guessing that - - Industry-insiders (and some reviewers) know Clooney personally and like him a lot (and they probably also know and like others involved in this production) - Like the main character, industry-insiders also spend a tremendous amount of their lives jetting around dealing with airports, accumulating air-miles which they have no time to use up, and staying in airport hotels.

"oscargeek83","7","42","76","27 January 2010"," Good mix of comedy and dramedy that really makes you think
","Up In the Air Movie Review<br/><br/>I finally got around to seeing the soon to be Oscar nominated movie, Up In the Air today. A lot of critics are putting it on their lists for top movie of the year and I will have to agree with them. This is a very good movie. It's funny and witty and has some good dramatic moments at the end that really hit you in the stomach. It's one of those rare movies that is fun to watch and makes you think at the end. <br/><br/>The movie stars George Clooney as Ryan, his job is to travel around the country and fire people personally and hopefully tries to help them move on with their lives. It's an art form that Ryan has perfected over the years and he is really good at it. I will have to warn you not to watch this movie if you have just been fired, because the movie is littered with scenes of people getting fired. Most of the people react in an angry fashion and it's almost comical in way they show these montages. Then there are people that react with a sadness and desperation that really makes you feel their pain. Ryan explains that he spends some 300 plus days traveling and a miserable 43 days at home. Through his travels he gives speeches at different hotels about putting your life in a backpack and feeling that weight. Your different attachments in life weigh you down. So he believes in having no attachments. <br/><br/>Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga play Natalie and Alex in the movie and their characters provide a challenge to Ryan's way of life. Natalie is a young college graduate with big ideas that will change the way Ryan will do his job. Ryan is not happy about this and thus there is conflict between the two. Ryan's boss, played by Jason Bateman, pairs Natalie with Ryan so that Ryan can show her the ropes. Their totally different personalities and philosophies on life clash and these provides for most of the funny and witty dialogue of the movie. Ryan is an older man who is calm and full of confidence in his job and in his life. Natalie on the other hand is young, naïve, and looks unsure of what to do most of the time. Alex is another business room that Ryan meets on the road and has a fling with. During the course of the movie they keep in contact and hook up as much as possible. Natalie seems to be just like Ryan in life only in female form. Ryan enjoys being with her so much is seems that he is reconsidering his whole theory on not being attached to other people. Is it possible that Natalie and Alex can change his whole outlook on life? That's obviously where this movie is headed.<br/><br/>So what is this movie all about? It's about life. Pretty simple but yet very complicated. There are two philosophies on life presented in this movie. There is Ryan who believes that relationships are the heaviest objects you can put in your backpack. Relationships weigh you down in life. There's too much negotiations and compromise that you have to do. You can't be truly happy with all these attachments with other people. As he likes to say, if you are not moving you are dieing. In a way we can see he is right. Relationships can be hard; you have to work hard at it. It's a drag sometimes. The people you are the closest too end up hurting you the most. We've all felt this at sometime in our life. We see in Ryan's life that he has no close relationships. He has no girlfriends, he has no plans to ever marry or have children, he has no close friends, he hardly has a relationship with his two sisters, he fires dozens of people daily and feels nothing for them, and he seems just fine with that. Natalie on the other hand can't help but being attached to other people. She has fond dreams of being married someday and having children. In fact she believes her life is not complete without this. You also see this when she has to fire people. She can't help but feel very bad for these people and can't detach herself from the situation of seeing these peoples lives destroyed right in front of her. <br/><br/>So at the end of the movie you have to ask yourself, are attachments and relationships worth the effort. The answer I came to be is yes, they are. At the end of the day what keeps you going in life. Is it your possessions or is it the love of your family? For me nothing can compare to the love I get from my family and friends. It's unmeasureable.. As they say you can replace your possessions but you can't replace your loved ones. This philosophy is even more evident in this movie when you think about the people who are fired in this movie. They are devastated by this turn of events but they also realize that they couldn't get through it if it wasn't for their family. You can lose everything but as long as you have a family to go home to you can be happy, you can have hope for the future. Without these relationships you are alone and have no one to help you through the bad times. So I would think about your own life and be grateful for all the people in it. <br/><br/>Grade- B<br/><br/>Rated R- Lots of use of the F-word and other cuss words through out the movie, 2 seconds of nudity of Vera Farmiga, lots of sexual innuendo and vulgar talk between George Clooney and Vera Farmiga."
"andrewroy-04316","7","8","11","9 September 2018"," Amusing and with interesting social commentary, but not an impactful film
","Up In The Air takes a strange premise that could easily feel stale or cold, especially given the perfunctory connotation that airport travel has, but succeeds as a pleasant, if forgettable, movie. Clooney is very good as a detached but thoughtful lead, and Kendrick also impressed, injecting life and uncertainty into the movie. The comedy works well and doesn't feel overdone. The way the travel scenes were cut also showed Bingham's comfort and intimate knowledge of the airport drill in a way that was fun to watch. Reitman does a good job of keeping each scene engaging and is at his best when he uses subtle social commentary. The themes of personal connection and security were amusingly turned on their head by Clooney having to teach Kendrick about maneuvering firing, as she makes the job he loves obsolete. The twist with Farmiga's character was also good and surprising, keeping the film from being a by- the- numbers rom-com. The timing and reaction to the 10 million miles was also well done. It's not a movie that's exceptional in any area and not one that will ever immediately come to mind, but it's a solid, pleasant watch with some originality."

Well, it has a good performance from Clooney as the confident consultant and good directorship, but it lacks true honesty - it sacrifices real integrity for Hollywood feelings and I'm not sure i want to see the top awards going on a film-flam type of film.<br/><br/>Others will say this is honest and strong and entertaining (A tough act to pull off) but even though it is a nice film, well made, strong performances etc; it just somehow is a little trite. Even Clooney, who really can make anything work, ends up a little bemused.

"tedg","Null","8","12","5 January 2010"," The Barrier Around the Seat
","I wish I had seen this back to back with ""The Informant!""<br/><br/>Both are good examples of what I think is a new phenomenon in film narrative. No, not exactly new; rather the techniques are maturing to the point that people don't notice them any more. And that's what you want.<br/><br/>It is a matter of ambiguous narration. We've always had this, even with silent movie cards. For 75 years or so (let's start with Kane), we've had the sliding notion of the narration of the storyteller, the ""voiceover"" narration of the protagonist, and the interior narration of one character to another. This latter is obvious in many bad science fiction movies where the professor patiently explains some key dynamics of the story. We accept that these can meld — have for decades.<br/><br/>But we now have a trend where we like to have narrative perspectives made discrete and explicit because we like to play games with what one knows that another does not, and how one can annotate another. So we have movies like ""Informant,"" whose key hook is in weaving ambiguities among these platforms.<br/><br/>Here in ""Up"" is a more complex and delicate composition. First of all, instead of being built on the great confrontation between the big and little guy, it moves on the conflict between independent loneliness and risk in losing ones' self in another.<br/><br/>It is about love, is modern in the sense that it moves the tension into the narrative structure itself, and is tuned well, because Clooney knows what he is doing. <br/><br/>We have the on screen narrator, Clooney's character Bingham, who knows more than the character does. He narrates to a novice. He also narrates as a living, triggering change in other characters. We hear those characters as bona fide narrators. We hear Bingham to them, to himself, to his apprentice, and to a romantic possibility he finds. Its all about story, each one, and about the dissonances and overlaps among them.<br/><br/>The power comes from some large things and small. <br/><br/>The large device is obvious. The standard fold in films is to have an inner ""film"" of some kind that allows us to enter as participant. Here it is a remote video conferencing for one of the narrative threads, allowing us to fold in to that one only. <br/><br/>The ""small"" narrative device factors powerfully in the film, but the mechanism is somewhat hidden. The template we are expecting is the standard romantic pattern: love is found, lost and regained. This is broken: our guy does not get anything close to wholeness. He goes back to a hell of what both he and we know will be loneliness. The apprentice girl learning about love? Her life is ruined by a suicide that will haunt her, caused by inept handling of false narrative. The effectiveness of the folding device of video conferencing? Discarded as ineffective.<br/><br/>It all turns on our discovery that Bingham is himself a narrative, a distraction, a fabrication in the romantic sense. It comes from out of the blue because there are so many narrators, so many fabricators that we didn't notice the power of this one, Bingham's love interest played by Vera Farmiga. Her power is absolute and breaks everything. This could be a depressing movie if you are sensitive to job loss, suicide and disappointment in love. But it is designed to pass the narrative prerogative to you to handle, so is judged as ""intelligent.""<br/><br/>The inner plot is its own narrative. Two young lovers are getting married. One is related by birth, the other by being a salesman of the artificial. Bingham gives them the happiness he cannot have, that he has to deny himself. (There are hints that problems with his parents is the cause.) He literally at the end gives them his happiness in terms of the credits he has accumulated in his endeavors. This in substitute for their own fabricated happiness (in the form of a fake honeymoon).<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"larfstem","1","29","56","4 January 2010"," From Darfur to Der Fuhrer, Clooney the Chameleon
","The fact that Clooney's coat disappeared and reappeared from cut to cut and scene to scene showed me that making a good, fluid, consistent film was not the goal in, Up in the Air, but the point was to deliver a message and that message was pure propaganda. clooney: 'hey buddy, sure we screwed the economy and ruined your life and the life of your wife and kids and your going to be homeless soon but hey, now you can follow your dreams. don't hate your boss or the efficiency expert we hired to fire you because he is a nice guy like george clooney.' <br/><br/>Next chunk of propaganda came in the contrived scene when Clooney's future brother-in-law(man searching for American dream) gets cold feet about the wedding and Corporate Clooney comes to the rescue with,'hey guy, you're right. marriage is a sham, but you discovered that when you were alone. those thoughts bad. being alone bad. never be alone because you think about bad things. don't think just do.'<br/><br/>Then came the final message when clooney decides he's had enough and walks out of the seminar during his speech to go get the woman he loves and when he gets there he finds out someone beat him to the pot of gold(marriage and kids and house according to film) at the end of the rainbow(they even show him standing by a rainbow drawing when hes giving the alone speech before he has his epiphany). so hurry or you'll miss out on your chance to get married and pop out kids. After almost being discovered his mistress calls him out and says, 'youre just an escape from reality(husband and kids and warm house.) and wheres your reality and what do you want? and you don't know what you want so I'm better than you but call me next time you wanna get laid.' so he feels dejected until the next scene he has given up his revolution and is back at his job and his boss sends him back on the road after clooney successfully lies to his boss about a suicide caused by him and his assistant.<br/><br/>throughout the film he tells the hotshot execs that attend his seminars the analogy of the backpack. the backpack represents people and relationships and the backpack is heavy so drop it if you want to be successful in business. so right before he is about to leave on his last business trip hes at the airport debating whether he should run off to some foreign land on a whim but instead he lets go of his bag, basically saying, 'keep your job...don't get involved in personal relationships unless we fire you and never change.' the morals we're skewed to a fascist viewpoint in this film and i lost what little respect i had for Clooney after watching this movie. the only thing missing was the patriotic music and clooney running off to join the marine corps."
"thealanscott1","1","36","73","20 December 2009"," ""Up In the Air"" is dry, dull, lacking emotion and tries to be intelligent about existentialism
","Heard wonderful things about this film (mostly through the critics) and was looking forward to it but after seeing it at the Arc Light Theater last night I am wondering what all the critical praise is about? Is it coming from the influence of the heavy hitters on the cast like George Clooney, the Reitman father-son combo, or the studio? Not sure, but I am sure that the film is dry, dull, boring and did not move me in any way (and the audience in the theater).<br/><br/>Some summary: Ryan Bingham (played by Clooney)is at home in his infinite aerial travel. He flies to offices where his job is to fire other people out of their jobs in a calm, cool and hazard free manner. He has a great travel routine, preferred rental car and hotel stay and seems to enjoy his away from home traveling lifestyle. He enjoys short flings with women as long as they stay in a controlled routine and do not affect his routine. In his life appear two significant women -- a young upstart (Kendrick) who threatens to reduce his travel with a Computer Chat methodology to fire people and a sexy traveling professional woman (Farmiga) who reminds him of the lack of substance in his life in spite of his concealed need for it.<br/><br/>Well, that summary sounds like the makings of a good film and it could have been but the actuality of the filmic execution was poor. The acting performances of all the characters seemed so held back and unmoving and they are good actors so it must have been the screenplay or the direction. The comedy was dull -- primarily because of the pretentious dialog (look for the Cancer/Can Sir joke in the plane) -- and most jokes fail except for a sympathy laugh that you must give because they are so obviously in need of a reaction.<br/><br/>The camera work as well is boring and when it does pick up it is inappropriate. We see rapid pans and the Steadicams pushes in quick when Clooney is explaining his travel routine expertise and I felt that these camera moves would be better for a ""Bourne Ultimatum"" film or a ""James Bond"" film. The rest of the film has slow dolly moves and traditional framing -- nothing good or bad to say here, just a display of uninspired camera moves.<br/><br/>The screenplay is at best relevant because of the current job cuts and economic climate. The majority of it is an attempt to appear clever and substantial but it pales in comparison to films who really execute this like ""Annie Hall"", ""Sideways"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"".<br/><br/>I usually like Clooney but in this film his performance is too cool, too reserved and unmoving. I suppose the real flaw is in the writing and directing of Jason Reitman -- he, thus far, appears to be a mediocre talent who seems to be getting his way with the Awards and Critics not on merit but on the influence of his father Ivan Reitman and other influential forces.<br/><br/>Some positive notes: I have to say that the Opening Credit sequence was well done and so was the use of purposeful hollow or full fonts in the films inter titles. Also the color correction was strong -- they use mostly cool and clean colors to punctuate Clooney's isolation and only use warmer, richer colors when he is at his sister's wedding falling in love with the character played by Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>This year 2009, so far, unlike last year, looks fairly weak for the Oscar season -- ""Invictus"" and ""Basterds"" seem to be the only strong films; and if ""Up In The Air"" gets a Best Picture nomination or win we will look back only critically at the nomination and forget the film. Maybe I do not ""get"" Reitman's style because I found ""Juno"" boring, over-hyped and definitely not deserving of an Original Screenplay Oscar Win as well; ""Thank you for Smoking"" was passable to me."
"CihanVercan","7","20","39","26 February 2010"," Average story development on an Interesting Plot, processed with Rich Screenplay Components
","Every year there are new film productions copying either independent, low-budget films or foreign language films. It's not always making copycats, but sometimes reflecting the same concept twice, as well. As the first thing to say, Up in the Air, doesn't reflect at all what the novel writer Walter Kirn tries to tell inside his story scoop. Besides, looking at this year's another production ""The Messenger"" , we see the same character models and same story development tools, there. Is it also a coincidence that both Ben Foster and Anna Kendrick are being hired for the same type of work only within a different industry? If it is, the coincidences will continue by having Woody Harrelson and George Clooney as the trainers of our young fellas, and still continue with both Ben Foster and Anna Kendrick throwing in the towel before working their way up in the job. I find it necessary to look for external resources before evaluating a film after my first view. Up in the Air is a bad adaptation, totally messing up with its story; making it look cheerful and smart to the viewer. What's cheerful is making the audience feel sad and curious about the actors, and what's smart is the screenplay just offering a wise motto of life. <br/><br/>The whole movie is actually the answer of one single question: ""What's Randy Bingman's motto in life?"" <br/><br/>George Clooney plays Randy the Mr.Backpack, who lives by means of his mouth. He makes a living with his mouth. From start to end, Randy just does 2 things: He talks and he travels. <br/><br/>Randy's words are like passengers of a plane. When they are unspoken, they are at the gates waiting for their flight arrival. While they are being spoken, they may turn to have multiple meanings. But after they were spoken his words are in our memory: <br/><br/>""I want you to pack your backpack with little stuff you own. Your laptop, your desk, your chair, and your bed, and your room, and your house. Now, I want you to leave everything behind of you. Now, do you feel a bit light?""<br/><br/>""Your relationships are the heaviest components of your life. It's hard to get rid of them"" <br/><br/>Opening with a mocumentary style, George Clooney's confused character Randy introduces himself to us from the p.o.v of the people he sees and talks everyday. His job is his life and his personality. He is hired out to national companies of which managers prefer not to fire their own employees; instead Randy does this though job. He is a Human Resources professional. Awaring of his success, Randy's boss gives a trainee beside him. Thus Anna Kendrick's character -one of the best supporting actress nominees of the year in Academy- teams up with Randy. Clooney and Kendrick are coherent together, this gives us a chance to put ourselves in their shoes; even though their lives are boring and pockets are making huge amounts of paychecks with just talking and travelling. <br/><br/>As the story goes it mostly becomes more boring, longer dialogues, longer scenes, terribly bad editing; very rarely there are important thematic values that offers us lifelong wise advices. On the other hand, the ideological concept is so feminist. Vera Farmiga's character, Alex always finds the right way to do and her acts are always right and she never makes mistakes; just like a super-heroine. Randy falls in love with her, and from her p.o.v it's Randy's mistake to come to her house to explore that she's married. 'Cause being open-hearted is not a proper code of conduct. This concept rules that women have rights to betray their husbands with making cool guys fall in love with them, while men are faulty when they think that marriage is an important decision and it must not be given very quick.<br/><br/>Looking at the filming aspects, the first thing that comes to mind is there are so many directing and editing mistakes, mostly mistakes on the ongoing production phase: Deliberate errors by filmmakers... Crew and equipment visible when Natalie's being introduced due to the reflection in the glass window... Continuity mistakes expose that most of the scenes are reshot over and over again; and when the exterior scene backgrounds change, Jason Reitman's editors doesn't find it necessary to cut those scenes properly. When Ryan gets dropped off after leaving the school, you see him walking inside with the same car still in place, but in the next shot he's two steps behind of himself and the car is gone. During that party at Alex's place, she changes her sweater from satin blouse to black v-neck sweater and back again to her satin blouse in a very short period of time(less than a minute or two). Looking at all the picture compositions, all the qualities are just average; nothing more than that. <br/><br/>Consider the Academy nominations, of all the 6 major award nominations Up in the Air got, it only deserves to win the Best Screenplay award. Myself as an amateur screenplay writer, even though I don't generally like adaptation scripts, Up in the Air is my favourite screenplay of this year. Sadly, the film altogether was nothing more than average. It should have nominated for Best Original Song as well for the song Up in the Air by Rolfe Kent."
"larry-411","8","29","60","24 September 2009"," George Clooney + Jason Reitman = classic rom-com hit
","I attended the World Premiere of ""Up in the Air"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Co-written (with Sheldon Turner), directed, and produced by Academy Award-nominee Jason Reitman from a Walter Kim novel, the film features an all-star cast including George Clooney, Jason Bateman, Anna Kendrick, Vera Farmiga, and Melanie Lynskey.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (Clooney) spends most of his life in hotels, airports, and on planes -- ""up in the air."" When companies need to downsize but don't have the cojones to send in their own people to do it, he's the one they're hiring to do the firing -- hatchet man at-large. It's not a life that lends itself to love -- trees need ground in which to grow. It's a classic rom-com premise that has all the makings of a hit.<br/><br/>The film is primarily a vehicle for George Clooney and he's easily up to the task. There's quite a bit of sadness, though, which was unexpected. But a tour de force for Clooney and a clever script make it memorable. Co-star Anna Kendrick is a star to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" is clearly Reitman's vision and he's assembled a team that executes it perfectly. There are no bells and whistles here -- visuals take a back seat to the performers, and Eric Steelberg's cinematography is observant but not intrusive. Dana E. Glauberman's editing is efficient and economical.<br/><br/>This film is so incredibly mass appeal that I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it. The audience was rolling in the aisles. Jason Reitman does it again with a true crowd pleaser."
"okmaybent","1","25","51","29 January 2010"," What are we rooting for in this movie?
","What did George Clooney's character want? Who knows? At first he wants to stay on the road. But once he goes back on the road with the girl he doesn't seem to even try to prove his usefulness. Then when he gets the phone call from his boss that they are both being called back home he has a ""whatever"" attitude about it. So as an audience what are we rooting for???? The script was flat and boring and the ending was abrupt as useless. There was really no beginning middle and end. Just a lot of mindless depressing muddled middle. Why? What was the point?<br/><br/>A good script has the character striving for a goal. We relate to that goal and want him or her to attain it. However when that goal is absent as in this dreck we disconnect because we are not sure what to root for to satisfy the character. Also good scripts have a ending that satisfies us rather than an open ended ending that just leaves us confused as to why we wasted our time."
"dfranzen70","7","14","26","16 December 2009"," Strong performances, likable script, lack of stereotyping
","As firer-for-hire Ryan Bingham, George Clooney is perfectly cast in Jason Reitman's Up in the Air, and the script, based on a novel by Walter Kim, crackles with wit and maturity. Only a predictable final twenty minutes or so prevents the movie from being a bittersweet classic.<br/><br/>Ryan is what you call a real frequent flyer; he's the proud owner of millions of miles in the air and scores of elite-status cards and chotchkies. His company sends him to other companies for the sole purpose of letting go staff, rather than having the senior staff do it. (Wussies.) Anyway, it pays very well, but Ryan's on the road over 250 days a year. But he gets star treatment literally everywhere, so it all works out okay.<br/><br/>However, Ryan's boss (played by an oily Jason Bateman) wants to try something a little different. A newcomer to the team, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), has the bright idea of firing people remotely. This way road warriors like Ryan could stay at home, thus saving the company travel expenses. Bateman likes it, Clooney's Ryan does not – and why would he? He'd lose all the perks of traveling, probably lose a lot of salary, and have to deal with real life for a change. He pitches enough of a fit that boss Bateman sends him back on the road – with Natalie. You know, to show her the ropes.<br/><br/>Which actually brings us to one of the more poignant parts of the film. We see Ryan lowering the boom on senior management and junior staffers alike, and their reactions (from acting calmly to pouring bleach in the coffee). Reitman actually brought in people who had just lost their jobs, so their reactions are more are less genuine (they were instructed to react either as they actually did when informed of losing their jobs or how they wish they had reacted). The theme couldn't be more timely, with the American economy doing so poorly and so many people out of work. Ryan has to deliver the news professionally and implacably, something that the straightlaced Natalie cannot always do.<br/><br/>A secondary thread has to do with Ryan's relationships, those with his family and those with, well, other people in general. His sister is getting married, but he's so self-absorbed that he can't find time to care much about it. Then Ryan meets cute with a fellow traveler in an airport bar (Vera Farmiga) and falls in lust with what he sees as a kindred spirit.<br/><br/>That's another important theme here, really: the perceived isolation in which Ryan finds himself. Sure, he's surrounded by people all the time, but he has intentionally never pursued any kind of meaningful relationship, choosing instead to put more stock in the elite status that million-mile travelers get.<br/><br/>You might think that because Natalie is on the road with Ryan, the two will inevitably hook up. But this is a more-mature look at relationships than Hollywood is used to churning out. Typically, you'd expect physical sparks to fly, because Clooney is Clooney and age differences mean little in Hollywood if we're talking an older man and a younger woman. But both Kendrick and Clooney are lights-out amazing; Kendrick in particular is tremendously effective as the inexperienced go-getter. Natalie is certainly not perfect, but she's also not a one-dimension prude, either. In fact, the scenes in which she explains herself – whether it's to a group of downsizers or to Ryan himself – are where the picture truly shines. Kendrick's artful delivery evokes both sympathy and envy for Natalie, who's in her situation of her own volition and accord.<br/><br/>And you might also think that because Alex (Farmiga) and Ryan meet on the road and have some fun that their relationship will immediately dissolve into a pool of boring. It's not so. Farmiga – a largely unknown quantity to me – was fantastic, playing Alex neither as another conquest for the Ryan Express nor as the kind of woman who will settle down with someone forever and ever. In fact, she's more than a match for Clooney in the charm department.<br/><br/>The movie loses its way, slightly, near the end, when a twist arrives with as little subtlety as possible. You'll probably be able to spot the plot change from a mile away. That's about the only thing that keeps this from being a superb movie, a sagging denouement, but certainly the three standout performances are nothing to be sneezed at."

In every definition of the word.<br/><br/>The story is borderline pointless, the acting is terrible, and the direction is amateur.<br/><br/>I'll stick with the acting. George Clooney literally is sleepwalking in this movie. Does he even bother to change his accent or mannerisms for a role, or does he think we'll believe anything his horrible self does? Vera Famiga is doing the only good acting in the film. But, her role is pretty worthless, and she gets forgettable in the black hole that is this movie.<br/><br/>And finally, Anna Kendrick. She is HORRIBLE. Her performance is so BAAD, she deserves a Razzie this year. Her accent is uneven (one scene she sounds like she's from Canada), when she cries she looks ridiculous, and finally she doesn't even seem smart enough to play something like this.<br/><br/>Just please, do yourself a favor and don't believe the hype that is this movie."

","This was a good movie but I'm not sure why it's on top of all the movie critics top 5 lists. It seems to push all of the politically correct anti-business buttons in terms of heartless corporations mass firing downtrodden proletariats from their soul sucking jobs in the private sector while enlightening the movie viewer with the redemptive story of Ryan Bingham (Clooney) whose full time job is firing people while bedding down different women along the way. He is a ""termination consultant"" who is contracted by different companies to tell their employees they are fired. There are a number of scenes of him firing people with the predictable tears, violence, suicide threats, and so forth. You see, life in the private sector is really like this, day in and day out. Capitalism is exploitation, property is crime, we are all expendable components of an evil machine that ends up destroying us in the end. No wonder the left wing film critics love this movie.<br/><br/>Anyhow, Ryan falls in love with a fellow business traveler, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) whose soul is even more shriveled than his own. Ryan also develops a relationship with a newbie to his ""firing"" company, named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who eventually becomes disillusioned with firing people for a living. Go figure. Ryan becomes humbled by Natalie's humanity, not to mention his own experience of being used and discarded by Alex. Thus, we are lead to believe, Ryan becomes a better person for being on the receiving end of what he is usually dishing out. This aspect of it wasn't remotely believable.<br/><br/>A good movie, but for my money, the most overrated of the year."

","""Up In The Air"" is about ""Ryan Bingham"" (George Clooney) who works for a human resources consultancy firm which specialises in firing people. ""Ryan Bingham"" has an apartment, but is rarely ever there due to him travelling via plane constantly and living out of hotels 95% of the time. He is a likable character, and we're introduced to a few other characters who enter his life.<br/><br/>""Ryan"" gives a good speech at the beginning of the movie about minimalism as a lifestyle choice, it's a positive speech and as a minimalist myself who does not like to own a lot of things i get where this character is coming from, but his viewpoint is subjective, a lot of people like to have lots of things and there's nothing wrong with that, however ""Ryan"" continues with more great points about how the mind can become emotionally cluttered if a person has unnecessary stuff.<br/><br/>There is not much to this film, the plot is not common which makes a change, but the movie just drags on, it's only about an hour and forty minutes, but it feels more like two and a half hours long, this cine is slow-paced most of the time. I was shocked when i read that this motion picture received critical acclaim and that it was nominated for all these Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards, good grief the film isn't THAT good.<br/><br/>The performances are decent, this is not a comedy movie even though it's half-labelled that, it isn't funny in the slightest, ""Up In The Air"" is definitely a drama and not a very good one at that. Whether it's the editing, writing or directing - it is just not interesting enough to be entertaining.<br/><br/>There is a shocking unexpected plot-twist which is the best part of the entire film, ""Ryan"" is depicted as being a little bit of a player, but we find out by the end that he is the one who is actually getting played. We find out that the lady who he is dating (and not just sleeping with, he takes her to meet his family - sisters and soon to be brother in law) is actually married with kids, during their fling she never once tells him about them (yes the relationship was rushed, but a married person should tell the potential lover of their circumstance being going into a fling) and then she has the cheek to talk down to him on the phone talking about ""don't mess with me or my family!"" excuse me??!! you just strung this poor man along for all this time, met his family and acted like his girlfriend, and YOU have the nerve to get angry at HIM?? she tells him that he is just an ""escape"" (talk about selfish) they end the conversation with her telling him ""as soon as you know what you want, call me"" like he's the one with the problem, it's clear that the movie is about ""Ryan Bingham"", but he is not to blame for every single wrong thing that goes on around him.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit depressing as it's strongly depicted that ""Ryan"" is going to go back to his travel for a living life (because he previously was thinking about settling down with the lady who he thought was 100% serious about him) and it makes him look as though he's a very lonely person. The ending is very misleading, travelling for a living doesn't make you lonely, it's your mindset, there's nothing wrong with being single and living out of hotels, and he may easily meet another lady in the future that's right for him.<br/><br/>""Up In The Air"" is only worth watching once."

The film is a great alternative to Ambien if you're an insomniac. Unfortunately, I viewed it at 7PM, so I was forced to look for other things to do in my house as its non-plot unfolded.

Hello, Jason: if a company needs to reduce its overhead, it surely will NOT spend money outsourcing HR to a guy who travels first class. Now if Ryan had been fired in the first 15 minutes, that would have created some stakes and forced him off the track, but that doesn't happen. Instead, Ryan falls into a road ""relationship"" that is every over-40 male's fantasy: a beautiful fellow traveler named Alex (Vera Farmiga)falls for Ryan's cheesy pickup line in a hotel bar and she becomes his best friend with benefits. The other female character is an overly earnest newbie on the corporate team: Natalie (Anne Kendrick)who is inexplicably taken on the road by Ryan after he demolishes her attempt to do his job in a computer chat environment. Why she isn't pink slipped for incompetence is never explained, except that the thin plot needs her for later developments. Eventually there is an O.

But it's a movie that doesn't hold together very well when you step back and start thinking about it. Vera Farmiga gives a lovely performance as Alex, but her character is the weakest written and doesn't make a lot of sense. She prides herself on being as detached from emotional baggage as Ryan is, and something we learn about her late in the movie proves that she means what she says, but would someone who really wants to keep emotional attachments to a minimum decide to be a man's weekend date for his sister's wedding? And after he crossed the boundaries she explicitly erected, wouldn't she call things off rather than leave open the opportunity to continue on with their relationship? Would there really be an audience for the kind of ""motivational"" speaking engagements Bingham delivers? Would anyone in his right mind even think of building a presentation from the concept of getting rid of everything in your life that has meaning? Too much of this felt like it serviced the plot without ringing true on its own terms.<br/><br/>You can call these things quibbles, and maybe they are.

George Clooney's character travels around the country firing people. The beginning of the movie goes through his fantastic travel rewards? Showing all the corporations he travels withHertz, Hilton, American Airlines, etc.it was like a commercial. Given the United States has the largest unemployment rate since the Great Depression unless you are a masochist the movie is not for you. Then the movie has Sam Elliott from the Big Lebowski narrate how getting fired is at the end of the day not all that bad.<br/><br/>As far as IMDb.com I cannot believe this movie has a 7.9 rating. I trusted IMDb however going forward I will be a little leery. My wife just told me she gets to pick the next few movies and I thought she would like ""Up in the Air."" If you are going to watch this movie sniff some glue first! BAD MOVIE!"
"Irishmonk","5","11","21","31 January 2010"," About as filling as airline food...
","I found this latest offering from writer-director Jason Reitman to be a bland, meandering film consisting of vaguely defined, mostly unengaging characters going through the motions in a threadbare, paint-by-numbers script. One couldn't help but notice the sheer effort in rendering the limp material meaningful and on message enough to give it that cherished Oscar cred. Thus, we have: George Clooney's earnest, resonant intonations about the vicissitudes of life - often provided in handy V.O. just in case we get lost, the use of ""real"" non-professional actor people to portray the characters receiving the corporate axe wielded by Clooney's mercenary outplacement agent, the jangley, twee acoustic ballads that accompany the various ""theme montages"" sprinkled throughout the narrative, and always, always, Clooney's ever-present warm, tender gaze impregnating his barren surroundings with richly detailed meaning. <br/><br/>Now, granted, there are some genuinely funny moments that crop up--seemingly by accident, like they were the itinerant left overs from an earlier ""funny"" draft of the script, presumably written before the Great Recession rendered any comedic treatment of the subject matter unpalatable for Hollywood's delicate sensibilities. These include a delightful Q & A session between Clooney's road mistress (Verna Farmiga) and his young up and coming protégé (Anna Kendrick in an erratic, occasionally annoying performance) regarding relationships and marriage. Another charming moment occurs between Clooney and his very distant potential brother in law who is getting cold feet before his imminent wedding. <br/><br/>It's clear in such scenes that Jason Reitman has a gift for comedy and creating clever, and sometimes touching laughs. But his attempts at serious and topical drama come across as pandering and are too on the nose. All in all, there just weren't enough genuine or engaging moments to dispel the feeling that this whole exercise was an attempt by the director and his creative team to amass the necessary number of theme and message points needed to collect the golden Oscar hardware."

","How can a movie sell so many tickets when it has not a single character about whom a viewer cares? I don't get it. Sure, there were a couple of chuckles, but it was a real waste of my time. If you want to leave a theater buzzing with excitement or feeling good or eager to talk about an interesting plot, stay away from this turkey.<br/><br/>Is George Clooney handsome? Yes. He's never looked better. Is Vera Farmiga attractive? Yes. Is Anna Kendrick bouncy? Yes. Do we care about a single one of their characters? No.<br/><br/>A few cheap laughs are not enough to sustain a movie. A movie has to have a heart. This one does not."
"grahamyounie","6","7","12","25 January 2010"," Not as great as the hype would suggest
","I went into this movie knowing it had a 90% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, and 8.1 here on IMDb, not to mention award nominations galore. So I was expecting something special.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as with a lot of films that are highly praised these days, I thought this was quite an average film made up of some witty moments, but generally, too much of this was dull and un involving and not nearly as moving as it could have been.<br/><br/>George Clooney is good in the role of Ryan Bingham, a man very content in his life and jet setting job, a man who doesn't appreciate change. George is on screen for almost every minute of the film, and he does well here but it's hardly a stretch for him. We've seen him do this kind of thing before with slight variations of character in films such as One fine day, Oceans 11, 12 and 13, Intolerable cruelty and Out of sight. The rest of the cast are also good, no real standouts, but a cameo from JK Simmons made me sit up.<br/><br/>The script has some amusing moments, none are laugh out loud, merely amusing, a chuckle here and a chuckle there.<br/><br/>What disappointed me most was the lack of emotion I felt whilst watching this. For a film thats 2 hours long and has only its characters talking to keep us glued, the lack of emotion I felt whilst watching was a huge letdown.<br/><br/>To summarise, it's a witty film, along the lines of Sideways and About Schmidt. It's very talky and not a great deal happens. It's focus is on George Clooney, who's character, by the end, doesn't seem to evolve as much as expected. Nor did I!"
"Simon_peters","1","10","19","20 February 2010"," Down in the dumps at Up in the Air.
","At an hour and forty minutes, but feeling like 3 hours, this film is at least an hour too long. The film is made up of wodges of interminable dialogue, with a largely static camera focused interminably on Clooney's vacant grin. The action is inter-cut with air to ground shots of the various cities featured in the Clooney characters never ending flights around the country. These shots do not illuminate either plot or location, and one suspects they are a handy way of stretching thin material. <br/><br/>Almost every character in the film appears to have been cast for, at best, plain looks, and at worst for ugly. Whether this is a sop to the vanity of the lead, or whether the director believes this lends some sort of realism to his film is unclear. Either way it is no incentive to like or care about anyone one sees on screen. I am not, by the way, referring to the hapless workers whose sackings are the background of the film. Anna Kendrick who plays the new girl at the company is ferret faced and unengaging, with a peculiar one dimensional performance. But then one cares not a jot about anyone in this cheerless, dreary, depressing film.<br/><br/>Why it should have been nominated for any award except Turkey of the Year is a great mystery."
"Danusha_Goska","3","18","39","25 December 2009"," Skip This; Watch ""The Apartment"" Instead
","Skip ""Up in the Air,"" and watch Billy Wilder's 1960, black-and-white, Academy-Award-winner ""The Apartment"" instead.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" is an okay movie, but it never gels. George Clooney is gorgeous and suave, but you already knew that. Vera Farmiga is as sharp as a samurai sword; it breaks your heart that we don't have scriptwriters or audiences able to take full advantage of her skills. It's a bit awkward, because Farmiga's performance is more powerful and intelligent than the script itself. She's a shark in a guppy pool. I could never get past the feeling that Anna Kendrick was in the Amy Adams part that Amy Adams didn't take.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman, the director, has made a big thing of including real people who have really lost their jobs in ""Up in the Air."" Their appearances in the film remind you why acting is a profession. Real actors probably would have conveyed desperation, rage, and despair better than these real people trying to recreate, for the camera, their own reaction to having been fired.<br/><br/>The film is a mishmash of vignettes interspersed with awkward silences. Some are completely unbelievable. Some are clichés. The scene where the tightly-wound woman who keeps her hair pulled back finally loses it and bursts into tears is both, as is the scene where the motivational speaker has a moment of truth at the podium and Just Can't Go On Any More.<br/><br/>There's a sequence where Ryan (Clooney) travels to an unglamorous, family wedding in suburban Wisconsin. Clooney and Farmiga dance. Mealy-mouthed, acoustic, singer-songwriter music plays on the soundtrack. This sequence is so out-of-place, and such an obvious set-up for the movie's one plot twist, that I wanted to phone Amnesty International and report myself as a torture victim. Actually, there really isn't enough of a plot to twist, and you'll see this twist coming a mile away. The ""surprise"" scene is just a cheap attempt to jolt some life into the audience and make us feel bad for ever having felt good during a Hollywood ending.<br/><br/>Reitman struggles hard to make a funny, acerbic, astute, timely film about work, family, ambition, the economy, and America's soul. He fails. Watch ""The Apartment"" instead. Though almost fifty years old, and created when America was at the pinnacle of its power, it still says more in its every frame, its every character, about the punishments and rewards of capitalism and the merchandising of human integrity and the human heart than any film made since."

","So glad the producer (Ivan Reitman) has such faith in the director (his own son, Jason) and his ""creative vision."" What were the odds? LOL. Whatever skills Jason has as a technician, the philosophical thrust of this movie is as phony as a $3 bill. Wow, disconnectedness? Wow, everybody needs somebody to love? Wow, having casual sex is ultimately disappointing? This is glib commercialism at Hollywood's typical worst, disguised as a movie with meaning and now being hyped as Oscar material on all fronts. The audience for this flick would presumably be comfy white folks earning six-figure salaries, who can relate to all the emptiness that its lead character is striving to overcome. So who do we pity more--the director who thinks this message needs transmitting, or the dumb saps who will watch it and think it's really meaningful? (The latter, actually, because the director's getting rich off the movie, and the saps are giving him their money.) A manipulative piece of nonsense, which, at its core, is as naive as they come about real human issues. If you've paid to see this one, you've already been duped."

","I watched this movie because it was cited in all of the major award giving lists as a contender for Best Picture. All its stars, George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick, have been nominated for acting awards. Therefore I watched with high expectations. And once again, the hype left me disappointed.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough. And somehow, I think I just saw a variation of this same story recently in ""The Messenger."" It involves a man Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) with the unpleasant job of firing people from their jobs in different cities around the US. A new upstart colleague Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has come up with the idea of firing people through the internet, instead of in person. So Ryan brings her along with him on his job to let her experience the human drama involved firsthand. Along for the ride is Alex (Vera Farmiga) who is essentially Ryan's kindred spirit in a commitment-less affair. Events unfold that cause Ryan to question the very lifestyle which he had been used to for so many years.<br/><br/>OK, it was fine, mildly entertaining, with some pithy dialogs. But for me, it was just alright. Nothing that special as a whole. George Clooney is good, but I felt he was better in ""Michael Clayton"" than here. His movie star aura really gets in the way of his role as a lonely person, making it difficult to gain the audience's empathy. Anna and Vera are proficient, but nothing spectacular in their acting.<br/><br/>So, you may want to catch this if you like wordy movies about loneliness, rejection, and emptiness. But do not bring too much high expectations when you do decide to watch, because frankly, I did not really see what the big Best Picture fuss was all about."

Not only does this movie offer nothing we haven't seen before, but it inflicts so much pain on the audience that by the time the end credits start rolling, you'll be wondering why you hadn't gauged out your eyeballs with rusty spoons instead. <br/><br/>As is widely known, the acting in this movie is just flat-out atrocious. George Clooney hasn't been this dreadful since Michael Clayton, and Vera Farmiga hasn't skewed out something this awful since The Departed. Unfortunately, neither actor is capable of humanizing their rather one- dimensional character. <br/><br/>As the movie drags on, audiences will realize that Reitman's rather boring and unconvincing narrative provides little to no substance. The movie ultimately is a mess, transitioning with one incoherent scene after another. <br/><br/>Simply put, there are just too many cuts and transitions to make this movie effective.

This movie's six Oscar nominations do not reflect it's greatness, but reveals the Motion Picture Academy's failings. This predictable, slow moving yawn fest totally missed the mark. The most alluring feature of the movie were the termination interviews by Clooney and his young rookie wunderkind. Out of the one hour and forty five minute movie they managed to squeeze in 4 minutes of the interviews. Sam Elliot received early movie credits.....his 50 second segment was forgettable.

"jstetz","3","9","17","14 March 2010"," Fuming about this movie for the second day in a row!!
","The only reason I registered on IMDb is so that I can fume about this movie. My girlfriend and I (together for a reason it appears) both hated Up In The Air, not even so much for its trite content, but for the fact that we LOVED the first half of it, and were so rudely let down by the second half of it.<br/><br/>The premise was so great - here is a guy, living a free life - no needless commitments, compromises, fights, promises, negotiations, relationship baggage, financial obligations, or everyday mundane existence of the 8 to 5. I loved the free backpack existence idea. This is something so many people desire - to ""just get away from it all,"" haven't we all heard or said that at some point in our lives? Here we were expecting to see how it could be done and live vicariously through George Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham. The carefree hook-ups in hotel rooms, the travel, the unattached existence, the individuality of it all was intoxicating!<br/><br/>Then came the conflict - Ryan Bingham was to be ""grounded,"" and his existence as he knew it - his carefully structured life in the air - would come to an end. What will be the resolution? What will happen? Interesting all the way up until now.<br/><br/>After this moment the movie just took a dive for me. Really, Bingham is to start having second thoughts now? Really, is the plain married, ""tied down to earth"" life that millions of Americans live out every day SO appealing to the audiences? What's the great artistic innovation here? And, what's up with Vera's character? How laughable that on one hand, there is this entire sappy thread in the movie that tries to show that it is good to have a family, to have someone that you can wake up next to every day, while Vera's character is cheating on her husband with Bingham? Isn't that the ultimate joke? <br/><br/>It seems the plot did not leave any room for the ""in between"" crowd - it was a battle between always up in the air, or fully grounded. There are thousands of people who enjoy both a committed relationship and the high life of business travel. According to the movie, there was no place for those people? Why couldn't Ryan and Alex BE in a relationship, and yet enjoy the life in the air? Why couldn't the story support that premise?<br/><br/>The end result was a sappy rom-com, which had a great premise, and gave hope that we could get away for at least the duration of the movie and dream about the freedom that so many of us desire. Yet, it left me disgusted with how given such an interesting beginning, the plot completely disintegrated into yet another Hollywood sap with contradictory conclusions and scattered, unoriginal ideas about life.<br/><br/>Ugh."

","This movie is really disappointing. The story is weak. It's about very little - a corporate downsizer and a boring little affair.<br/><br/>The praise and nominations are really undeserved. Everyone hardly has much acting to do. George Clooney is his usual self with that little half smile. Vera Farmiga is attractive but she really doesn't have much to do. Anna Kendrick's much lauded performance as Clooney's young colleague is adequate but again there isn't a lot required of her. The story is not moving or interesting. The ending is predictable and you feel that nothing happened at all.<br/><br/>If it wasn't a Clooney movie and heavily marketed I don't think it would have even got any nominations at all. It isn't even interesting enough to be a made for TV movie of the week maybe less."
"quarterwavevertical","1","5","8","10 September 2018"," Lukewarm, Lacking In Substance
","The title of my review says it all. This movie is, on the whole, bland, uninteresting, and unexciting.<br/><br/>Let me sum up the plot, bland and uninteresting as it is. George Clooney plays a professional axe-man, someone who works for what used to be known as an outplacement firm and makes his living by firing people as well as giving motivational speeches on the side. He does a couple of things to make himself look good and then continues as if nothing happened. The end. I just saved you the time and trouble of having to see it.<br/><br/>And that's one of the things that's wrong with the movie. His character doesn't change.<br/><br/>He's proud of what he does to the point of smugness, but he's an empty shell. His only real joy in life is being able to accumulate traveller points so that he can get priority service in fancy hotels as well as being a member of the elite club of credit card holders. But he has no soul, emotion, or, it would seem, conscience. He cold-bloodedly tells people that they're sacked and then makes some insultingly cloying statements about them having a bright shiny future because they were canned. The fact that he's helped destroy their lives has absolutely no effect on him.<br/><br/>But the other main characters are equally as unlikable.<br/><br/>He meets someone else who's also away from home a lot on business eventually becoming attracted to her. But she turns out to be not what he thinks she is.<br/><br/>His junior colleague is an immature, inexperienced millennial snowflake. She doesn't appreciate that what she does affects people, though she finally gets a hint. The audience is told that second-hand; the movie would have been better if it showed her reaction.<br/><br/>His boss isn't any different, having the personality of a frozen kipper.<br/><br/>It's a mystery to me how this movie managed to earn several Oscar nominations. There's nothing of substance in it. The actors seem to be bored with their roles and their performances appear to have been mailed in. Many of the scenes are redundant and could easily have been cut because they don't show anything new. In addition, the musical soundtrack is annoying.<br/><br/>This movie is a complete waste of time."

But I also found parts of it, where Clooney's character succumbs to the charms of the wife-and-two-kids life after giving no indication that he was unhappy with his single life, too unmotivated. At least the end was not a wife-and-two-kids end; I liked his decision to take off on his own.<br/><br/>What I found most striking were the short scenes with the middle-aged individuals he was firing. Being a middle-aged individual threatened with the possibility of losing my job of 25 years, I hooked right into those. A closer study of their plights would have been a different movie, however.<br/><br/>In sum, an enjoyable two hours, certainly, but not a movie that I have any desire or need to see again."
"ssvikas","7","5","8","23 February 2010"," Crisp script and comical moments are its miles!
","In times of recession, a movie about a guy who fires people for a living is not exactly anyone's idea of entertainment! But, the devilishly charming Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney just does that, making things oddly comical. Enjoying around 300 days on-board, at lounges and hotels, he laments the 40 days at home between trips. <br/><br/>When he isn't firing, Ryan peddles his 'Baggage free' ideals at motivational lectures and occasionally has a 'good time' with fellow travel buff, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who hit off on a common ground of loyalty card vanity. As Alex calls terms herself as a feminine version of Ryan, the twosome often plan their sojourn across America.<br/><br/>Things change when greenhorn Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) leads his company to a new policy of firing people via internet. Ryan is grounded and dismayed at the prospect of missing his secret ambition of 10 million frequent flier miles. Adding to his woes, his boss Craig Gregory puts Natalie under Ryan's tutelage to lean the business! <br/><br/>Natalie and Ryan are opposites; while the former hates airports and loves to get back to 'home and family', Ryan loves his unreal life but wants to fire people 'with a personal touch', allowing the story its exploratory flight-path of mutual self discovery of emotional connections, love, family and propriety. While it is easy to portray such themes in gloom, Up in the Air is light hearted, sprinkled liberally with humor while keeping up its pace.<br/><br/>Though, at first, it comes across as a movie on Ryan and his miles, it's not! His conflict is rather within himself, his fear of intimacy, family and commitment. Clooney actually makes you feel for the middle aged and lonely Ryan who fires people but is really not a grown-up within. To their credit, the filmmakers have worked well to create seemingly unreal characters but still leaving enough to imagination and things to relate to! <br/><br/>Natalie and Alex have their issues too. While the Anna Kendrick plays a pretty, uptight and ambitious girl whose nervousness is situations is comic relief. Poor Natalie is eventually dumped over an SMS. Vera Farmiga as Alex adds her own shades of grey; she has a stable family but seeks out some fun. Do our characters get what they want? Typical to Hollywood style, some answers are direct while some are subtle. <br/><br/>To bring out the best from those 'fired', the filmmakers actually cast people who had recently lost jobs! Their brief was to look into the camera and say what it felt like being 'fired'! Portraying multiple locales without actually filming there was intelligent production design. The Airport scenes were crisp and realistic. One of the best scenes is Ryan's slick passage through the security check, portraying a seasoned business traveler.<br/><br/>Coming from the Oscar nominated directed by Jason Rietman of ""Juno"" fame, Up in the Air, adapted from a novel of the same name by Walter Kim is worth watching!"

","Ryan Bingham (Clooney) works for Omaha based Career Transition Counseling whose contracts are in corporate downsizing. His job is to meet employees face to face and subsequently fire them. Ryan flies around the US over 320 days of the year, which he feels is the best part of his job. A secondary job he has is to give motivational speeches on relieving one's life of excess physical and emotional baggage. Ryan's life may change when the company hires Natalie Keener, a young overachieving woman who recommends that the company change the nature of the work by conducting the ""firings"" via remote computer access. Ryan believes that Natalie does not fully understand the nature of the business, and as such, their boss, Craig Gregory, suggests that she accompany Ryan on a business trip. Ryan is also trying to protect his way of life, which now includes meeting up with a woman named Alex Goran whenever their flight schedules mesh. Like Ryan, Alex, who he met in an airport hotel bar, is constantly traveling for work.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is a well made, entertaining and quite enjoyable film. There's no doubt about that. It's poignant, quirky and balances extremely well comedic moments with more dramatic scenes. However, it's not a spectacular film by any means. And although it touches some pretty interesting subjects, the film is predictable and quite conventional following the same formula and using the same gimmicks that so many other films use. The message of the film is clear; Man need connection, people need other people in their lives, we need significant relationships to be happy. No matter how happy Ryan thought he was in the beginning of the film, leading his independent and carefree life, he eventually comes to the realization that, like everyone else, he too needs meaningful connections, either if it's a lover or a sister, doesn't matter. The performances were all extremely solid with Clooney being very charismatic as always and newcomer Anna Kendrick showing quite a bit of potential.<br/><br/>And yes, the film also has a certain ""extra"" relevance due to today's economy. There's millions of people loosing their jobs and the films shows a bit of how corporate America works and how ruthless it can be. There's no question that this is a film that deals with the real world, but again, there's nothing that impressive or striking about the film. And let it be perfectly clear that I enjoyed the film very much but, having said that, I would expect a film nominated for 6 Oscars to be outstanding. And I could address the fact that today the Oscars are nothing but a joke but that's a completely different subject. In conclusion, Up in the Air is a well made film, with a good script and solid performances. Just not what it's made out to be.<br/><br/>7/10"

Seeing a can of soda unmentioned on a counter or Reeses pieces on the ground is one thing, but this film went too far and movie goers seem to be stupid about it. Keep going, and we'll just have more and more of this junk. The acting was OK, particularly Anna Kendrick as the role of the new kid on the block trying to change the way the game is played then having a change of heart when she learns from the seasoned master of dismissal, but if you take out the commercials, how long would this film really be? Clooney was typical Clooney in my opinion, hard to watch him without remembering who he is throughout the entire piece. Meryl Streep can bring you into a character so much that you forget it's Meryl on the screen, Clooney may be totally charming, but he seldom has me forgetting it's him rather than allowing me to get lost in the character so I can enjoy the film more."

(For a long time, I thought this was a service that did not exist in the real world until I was an African safari and met two gentleman who delivered this kind of service in South Africa.)<br/><br/>The title has a double meaning: Bingham is in the air virtually the entire year and has no significant connection to his residence. He has accumulated all his travel miles on American Airlines and he stays only in Hilton Hotels, so he has all sorts of privileges that only an elite handful of travelers ever achieve with these travel service providers. So, he is literally ""up in the air"" in the course of doing his job.<br/><br/>However, he is ""up in the air"" metaphorically. He has no roots to any community. He has an affair with a fellow frequent traveler, extremely well played by Vera Farmiga. He has no long-term, serious relationship, even with his own sisters. In fact, one of the great pieces of acting comes when Clooney/Bingham has to figure out how to coax his sister's fiancé to go through with the wedding. Clooney/Bingham finds this exceptionally difficult to do because he has never been close to having a relationship that would lead to marriage. <br/><br/>The most interesting part of the film is the juxtaposition of Clooney/Bingham's status as a receiver of very generous ""loyalty"" rewards with the role he plays in denying employees of many companies the reward for the loyalty they have shown to their organizations. He gets extra-special treatment, especially from American Airlines, but the employees who have given the best 30 years of their lives to their companies are brutally ushered out the door. <br/><br/>To me, this is the most thought-provoking and unique part of the film. This is not a remake of a 1940's or 1950's film, or even a 1980's film, because the sophisticated rewards programs from which the Clooney/Bingham character benefits did not exist. In fact, they were just being introduced into the marketplace in the early 1980's. <br/><br/>There are other great performances and subplots, including the mentoring relationship Clooney/Bingham has with a young professional very well played by Anna Kendrick. Jason Bateman seems quite authentic as Bingham's ultimate boss.<br/><br/>However, the center of gravity of the film is the character George Clooney plays, as only he can play it, and the many ways in which he presents a complex, multi-dimensional portrayal of someone who is ""up in the air."""

","I don't neglect the virtues of this universally acclaimed Oscar nominee. I cannot. No, sir. It has perfect editing, superior narrative fluidity, well written dialogue, a leading man so charming that can sell you a concentration camp as a lifetime vacation in the Caribbean These seem to be enough to get you an Oscar nod these days. This excruciating film by most recent keeper of the American faith, Mr. Jason Reitman, of the Juno reputation (another freak example of Midwestern voice with a coastal accent), chooses its hero to be a man who enjoys firing people of their jobs and coveting air-travelling mileage. The second gets reasonably resolved; the first seems to be perfectly OK with the filmmakers. People are disconnected in our fragmented times, they are in a continuous transitory state, metaphorically ""on air"" each and every moment. We don't criticize; that's just how things are – who wants to be accused of didacticism anyway?<br/><br/>Furthermore, an unbearable filmic transition from the purity of physical attraction to the life-altering joys of domesticity takes on gradually. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against companionship, family love, whatever. It just is not the case for everyone. Let me phrase it otherwise: I enjoy Nora Ephron films; this one can be Ephron-cute. I adore James L. Brooks films; this one has Brooks'-dialogue sparkles and character intonation. I deeply admire Alexander Payne; Up in the Air would have a distinctly different ""up in"" conclusion in his vocabulary."

","The story is about Byran Bingham who works as an outside consultant who fires people for a living because their own bosses don't like firing them. So he makes his living flying from one place to another firing people. The story picks up when they hire a new college graduate, Natalie Keener who is to use the internet to fire people to save money by not traveling. This causes Bryan's own zone of comfort outside down and faced being grounded and thinks that Natalie doesn't know the details of what it is like to fire people. Also along the way, Bryan meets a women Alex, who has the same personality of traveling as he does. Unfortunately I won't mention how the story ends, but it has a couple of loose ends, for instance, during the marriage of one of his sisters, the groom asked him about his own married life, and ask him ""what's the point?"" to which he responds that he needs a ""co-pilot"" and his life is about getting rid of excess baggage in his life. The story I believes ends being ""pointless"". It would have improved the plane have crashed, got fired, and had sister to support him that he realized that there is more to life then just flying and firing and people are simply not excess baggage and can be as important to you as your hands and feet. At least this story I prefer to end as less then pointless. There's no spoilers here, just my own alternative ending. I feel the story is somewhat empty."

","Given the relentless marketing that accompanied this movie into theaters, expectations are necessarily going to be high. Unfortunately, for me those expectations set the bar too high for something I might have found more enjoyable absent the hype.<br/><br/>Part of what made it hard for me to enjoy this movie was that virtually every character was over the top. On reflection, I see that that they were, in fact, caricatures and not meant to be believable characters. However that satirical aspect was a bit too subtle and they all came across as simply ""jumping the shark"", as it were. It wasn't billed as satire, it was billed as a tour de force for George Clooney and, as such, it falls somewhat short.<br/><br/>Seen in the right frame of mind, I think this movie could be an enjoyable diversion. However, if you are expecting the movie of the year (or a feel good movie), you'll likely be disappointed."
"Turfseer","3","7","13","20 March 2010"," Heartthrob Clooney can't save turgid, uninspired tale of corporate downsizing
","With the plague of 'corporate downsizing' now reaching its zenith, such a social phenomenon is bound to come to the attention of Hollywood's top name producers. Hence, Jason Reitman, son of famous Hollywood producer/director Ivan Reitman, has been given the reins to address this very issue. It also helps to have heart-throb George Clooney in the role of corporate down-sizer Ryan Bingham, who flies around the country as a sort of 'hired gun', informing various downsized employees that their services are no longer required.<br/><br/>Soon a young upstart, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), comes up with the brilliant idea of firing employees via a computer video linkup. One wonders why Ryan's company hadn't embraced this method years before, since obviously it is much more cost effective. And it's also hard to believe that a new employee such as Natalie, who is just out of school, would be the one introducing the new prototype as these video linkups (as just pointed out) have not only been around for quite some time but it's more likely a more experienced person would probably be responsible for developing or customizing it. <br/><br/>Somehow Ryan convinces his boss that 'face-to-face' firings still are much more preferable to firings via computer and that Natalie needs to understand the value of the 'human touch'. Ryan's boss puts the video project on hold and allows Ryan to keep jetting about firing people in person as long as Natalie accompanies him. This of course allows 'Up in the Air' to become something of a 'buddy' picture with Ryan and Natalie 'duking it out' over the nature of relationships. When Natalie finds out that Ryan has been having a casual affair with Alex, who he is constantly meeting up with while on the road, she castigates him for not getting involved. Let me add that Natalie only becomes emotional over this issue after she has been dumped by her own boyfriend (via text message). For the most part, she is a one-note cold fish who soon learns the delicate art of firing people face to face, under Ryan's tutelage.<br/><br/>Not much happens during the 'second act' of 'Up in the Air'. Director Reitman spends too much time presenting cameos of real-life people recreating their reactions to the news that they've been downsized. Was it necessary to 'pad' the film with these cameos? Basically one minute of the fired employees would have been enough to convey the despair of these hapless people. There are additional repetitious scenes with Ryan, while moonlighting as a motivational speaker, utilizing a backpack to illustrate his 'life philosophy' to an audience of self-help junkies at various hotel conference rooms. Reitman wastes additional time with a scene where the three principals attend a corporate party, culminating with a 'heart-to-heart' talk between Alex and Ryan on a corporate yacht.<br/><br/>You would think that the big 'Act Two Climax' would have something to do with the relationship between Ryan, Alex and Natalie, but it doesn't. Instead, there's an awkward subplot that pops up involving Ryan's sister's fiancé who gets cold feet just before he's about to get married. Ryan is called in by his other sister and uses his 'motivational speaker' skills to convince the errant husband-to-be, to go ahead with the wedding—which of course he does and the couple live happily ever after.<br/><br/>The wrap up of Act Three is decidedly a downer—and thoroughly unconvincing to boot. Despite the fact that Alex attends Ryan's sister's wedding and seemingly is now ready to become more involved with him, it just doesn't turn out that way. After giving up his motivational speaker gig, Ryan somehow finds Alex's home address and knocks on her door—only to discover that she is a married woman. Since Alex only wanted a casual relationship, it would have been much easier for her to simply tell Ryan that she was married and there would have been no hard feelings. But since the film's screenwriter was desperate to create some kind of drama (and there is so little of it in this film), we're treated to the unlikely scenario of Ryan being deflated when he discovers the true nature of Alex's marital status. As for Natalie, she quits the company after learning that one of the downsized employees that she had fired, killed herself. It appears that both Ryan and Natalie did not heed this particular employee's pronouncement while on one of their firing jaunts, as the woman did indeed explicitly state that she was going to jump off a bridge. Inexplicably, Ryan's boss puts the computer video link program on hold despite the fact that the communication between Ryan and Natalie and this particular employee, took place face to face!<br/><br/>Up in the Air is a slow-moving 'dramedy' with an underdeveloped plot. While it's a very nice-looking film, the actors can do very little with their parts due to the weak script. Clooney basically plays himself (as he usually does) and offers up an only serviceable performance. On the basis of director Reitman's last two films ('Juno' preceded 'Up in the Air'), it's likely we'll be seeing uninspired, mediocre films from him in the future."

","What a depressing, unspeakably rotten piece of idiocy. So, the script was hatched in a Malibu palace and everyone present thought it was killer? There were about 10 couples in the theater at the 5:05 feature when I saw the film. And it got A's and B's from the establishment critics? Oh, I forgot. They were in the palace, too. I went home and watched David Zelnick DVD just to wash my brain clean of the residue. The issues of immersion in one's career to the exclusion of everything else, the abysmal sadness of being fired, the callousness of corporate America, using people solely for one's own sexual gratification, the complexity of modern telecommunications/credit card gymnastics--all of this was an accurate reflection of reality. That said, the hollow-man syndrome so ubiquitous in the corporate realm should have had a denouement other than the hollow-ending one."

","*****Only minor spoilers***** Ryan Bingham has a job that has him travelling around the country firing people. He lives out of a suitcase as he travels around most of the year & he seems to love it in the air. But, when his company plans to ground him, Ryan isn't happy. He takes Natalie Keener, an extremely vibrant, young woman under his wing to provide her some insights to his work before they can ground him permanently.<br/><br/>It deals with the sorry state of the economy last year. How it affected so many people & their families. This film works well on so many levels & the Oscar nominations for George Clooney & Vera Farmiga were well deserved. Even though Anna Kendrick did a very good job in playing Natalie, I didn't think that she deserved a nomination. Don't hate me for that. I love the Twilight films, this has nothing to do with her in those films. The background score really fits the movie well.<br/><br/>I loved Ryan's character. Who wouldn't want to be like him (but just for a while though, you do want that someone special with you as you grow up). Jason Bateman also does a good job as the boss of Ryan. Jason Reitman has written & directed a wonderful story about a man who doesn't want commitments in life, who doesn't want to grow up, who thinks of himself as being a free bird. This is one of Clooney's better performances. The film can be watched again & again. I'm glad I watched ""Up In The Air"". This is about family values, how one shouldn't get afraid of commitments & one must be ready to have their hearts broken at some point in life. Vera Farmiga plays Alex, the woman who wants a casual thing with Ryan Bingham. Ryan & Alex are both funny, smart, don't want to be in a serious relationship & just seem to us, as an audience, the perfect people for each other.<br/><br/>The one scene I really loved was when Natalie breaks down at the airport & starts crying & Ryan was just so unsure of what to do. I didn't think Anna Kendrick was a good actress before this, but she's absolutely an amazing talented actress. Each scene stays with you, long after the film has ended. The whole thing is good. This is one of those films which has to be in your collection.<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>-Girish, 20"

The movie was entertaining from the opening scene to the rolling credits. I did not find myself bored at any point of this movie there were no unnecessary scenes. The dialog was 5 stars, and the whole concept of the movie was original. This film reminded me of a great book, with excellent characters and a great plot development. George Clooney really blew me away with his character and delivery of Ryans performance. I do love George but he has played the same type of roles in the past, as for this role it took him to another level. Vera was a perfect compliment to George's Character , and Anna Kendrick really impressed me with her short career she was on point with her performance.

"Skriptman","3","6","11","7 January 2010"," Watchable... but disappointing
","Like many of the other comments posted here, I felt the film was okay, but hardly deserving of all the buzz it has generated. First of all, it went on for WAY too long. Scenes that went nowhere (breaking into Ryan Bingham's old high school to faun over his old basketball photos; the excruciatingly long and fairly pointless party scene where Ryan, Alex and Natalie crash a Tech Convention gala; the beat-it-over-your-head-so-you-don't-miss-the-point termination scenes where Ryan, or Ryan and Natalie, fire people from their jobs in cities all over America; and even Ryan's ""What's In Your Backpack"" presentations - which seemed to come out of nowhere, btw - were there only to reinforce information about Ryan's commitment to uncommitment that we already knew) were liberally peppered throughout.<br/><br/>Director Jason Reitman seems to be attempting to doubly imprint his style on his projects by the choice of music. Regrettably, I found many of the songs inducing the ""Brechtian effect"". Lyrics, intended to underscore the gravitas of the scene (I assume) tended to pry my concentration from the story in order to listen to the song. It's as if these little musical intervals are intended to force you to remember that you're watching a movie. That's fine if it's done for a reason, not so fine in a film in which the overriding goal of each song is to manipulate me into feeling some sort of emotional connection to the characters. Hey, if the story and actors aren't doing it, the music becomes just an added distraction.<br/><br/>I'm usually willing to buy into any premise as long as the premise is adhered to throughout the film. I felt cheated that the Alex character - Ryan's equally adrift (literally and figuratively) lover - is not that way at all. Her ""reality"", from which she uses Ryan to escape, is a secure nest with hubby and kiddies. I couldn't help but groan aloud at the late reveal... and, again, feel unfairly and dishonestly manipulated.<br/><br/>All that said, it's still a watchable flick - and likely to cause a good deal of after-film discussion... which is never a bad thing."

","Every character in this film defines much of their personal worth around a corporate job or a superficial relationship, and when they lose the job or the romance, they act aggrieved and devastated. In real life there are people like this, but there are also people that have established enough self-esteem that they can handle change without being a victim of it. If just one of the later type of person had showed up in this film, it would have been a much more meaningful story.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, the screenwriters have a couple characters attempt to share that their families are what's most important, but it comes across as an escape hatch in a film that established its cynicism in the first 10 minutes."
"PWNYCNY","6","9","19","22 December 2009"," Good and not so good.
","How does one go about firing someone? What is the best way to get rid of a worker? These questions are the basis of this movie which highlights the precarious nature of our existence. George Clooney gives a strong and convincing performance as man who lives his life according to certain principles and when he abandons his own principles winds up paying the price. This movie is rather offbeat and in some ways reminds one of the kind of movies made by John Cassavetes, with his semi-documentary style that emphasized reality over conventional story telling. For this movie is based on a theme that we can all relate to, namely the unpredictability of life. Whether this movie succeeds as an entertainment piece is questionable, but as a social commentary, it does have merit.<br/><br/>There is a saying which goes something like this: know your limits. This movie completely ignores that maxim and the results are, not unexpectedly, a poorly crafted movie. While an attempt to explore the human condition is a commendable project, it may be asking a bit much for a Hollywood production company to do the job. Let's face it, Hollywood is good for churning out assembly line fluff but please, don't ask it to get into something as deep, serious and profoundly puzzling as the meaning of life itself. That is just being unrealistic, yet this movie, this Hollywood production, attempts just that, and not only does a poor job of it, but makes their effort even more embarrassing by trying to make light of the subject. You have a guy who basically lives in hotels and travels around the country doing corporate dirty work and we're supposed to expect that he has something serious to say? That he knows something that we don't already know? Yeah ... right. The theme of the rootless man was already treated in the movie Trains, Planes and Automobiles with far better results because whereas this movie is heavy handed and flat, at least John Candy and Steve Martin brought some comic relief to an otherwise droll topic. George Clooney is an excellent actor for certain roles but he's no John Candy so don't expect the laughs that Mr. Candy would have elicited playing the exact same role. His acting is wooden, his demeanor flat, his persona null. It has to be his worst performance. There was a time when Hollywood had the creative capability to produce credible cinematic works that explore various aspects of the human condition but those days are gone, a relic of history, replaced by glossy special effects extravaganzas and dominated by the stunt men who are now the real stars. Let Hollywood do what it's good at and leave it to others to create more substantive work. After all, it's only a movie."

"kennychaggerty","10","5","9","30 March 2010"," The Best Film of 2009
","Whenever I watch a movie I attempt to put myself in the main character's position. In the case of Jason Reitman's Up in the Air I pictured myself as a person who makes a living traveling from place to place releasing people from their jobs, in which the majority of time they have at least ten years experience and have done nothing to deserve being let go. For me it would be an impossibility because I personally have a hard time being the bearer of bad news. However, for Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) firing people is simply a job, in which he believes is a necessity. Most people have been fired at least once in their lifetime, and for Bingham he attempts to make the experience of being let go as painless as possible. There are many people who believe movies should be created purely as a means to escape reality. If you are one of these people I would recommend avoiding Jason Reitman's Up in the Air, a film that prides itself on depicting realistic situations, characters, and relationships. I for one believe that in this modern time period our society can benefit from such a movie, because it explores the same individual and societal challenges most of us are experiencing presently. Up in the Air is a character study of a man who chooses to avoid relationships with all people because he has discovered that being alone is better than the complications that come with romances and friendships. However, after meeting the woman of his dreams he has a tough decision to make. Relationships are the cause of true happiness, but they also have the potential to produce misery. Perhaps a life a neutrality is the way to go. Up in the Air is not a movie that supports the actions of a particular character. Instead it simply presents realistic relationships and allows the audience to decide for themselves who is right and who is wrong. This is what makes Up in the Air so clever. This movie is one of the smartest movies I've seen in years, which for me makes it one of the best films of 2009."
"mcsheehey","10","6","12","16 January 2010"," First-Class Dramedy
","""Up in the Air"" manages to be funny, poignant, and troubling, often all at once. It's a film about people, jobs, and the fulfillment that these things do or do not bring. It's also director Jason Reitman's most mature and even film so far in his career.<br/><br/>Protagonist Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) constantly flies from city to city to fire people. When a boss is too cowardly to let his/her employees go, Bingham steps in with his sleek suits and ominous ""new opportunity"" brochures. Like Aaron Eckhart's tobacco spokesman in Reitman's ""Thank You For Smoking,"" Clooney's Bingham is superb at what he does. From his cleanly efficient airport behavior to his awe-inspiring firing routines, Bingham is a force of nature; Clooney captures his bravado perfectly.<br/><br/>The plot really opens when Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a young upstart, introduces a new system to Bingham's company; firing sessions will now take place through a Skype-like video conferencing system. An outraged Bingham has no choice but to take Natalie along with him for his next round of sessions, so that he can ""show her the ropes."" The plot lifts off at this point, with some turbulence and some twists along the way.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" works primarily because of its performances and its script. Clooney sells Bingham unquestionably as a loner who loves to travel. Bingham seeks fulfillment through the collection of Frequent Flyer miles and premium membership cards, but his vision becomes cloudy when a love interest enters the picture. As Bingham's potential soul-mate, Alex, Vera Farmiga is bold, funny, and mysterious. She has a Lauren Bacall sensibility, along with a unique sort of beauty. Yet, the heart and soul of the film is Anna Kendrick. As the film's most dynamic character, Kendrick is totally convincing and compelling. For Bingham, she becomes a wrench in the works. She seems to know her character so well that she truly becomes her for 100 minutes.<br/><br/>For its first seventy minutes or so, ""Up in the Air"" is a charming romantic/career/teacher-student- comedy. It's hilarious and smart. The rest of the film is a bit darker; it forces characters to step out of the terminal and confront reality (that's as specific as I'll be). While there are still funny moments, the movie becomes more of a drama. Both the mostly-comedic and the mostly-dramatic segments work wonderfully, and the tonal shift feels wholly organic and inevitable.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" is a great film, with great dialogue and great acting. It bodes well for Reitman and its three stars."
"Qanqor","7","6","12","27 December 2009"," Comedy?? This movie is a tragedy.
","I just got home from the theater. I'm still not entirely sure what I think of this film. But one thing I'm clear about: this was a very sad movie.<br/><br/>But not because of all the firings. Somebody else here expressed it perfectly: the firings are the backdrop for the movie, not the theme.<br/><br/>I've always been in accord with the maxim that if you want to know what a movie is really about, look at what's different at the end from the beginning. Apply that to this movie and you'll see why I consider this a tragedy.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, Ryan is living his dream life. He loves living in the air and having no roots and hates the 40-odd days a year he's forced to be at home. He doesn't believe in marriage or relationships or commitments or entanglements. He believes in this philosophy so strongly that he actually gives seminars on it.<br/><br/>So in the end, what's different? Almost nothing: he still has the same job and life in the air. He still has no close friends or family, and no romantic relationship. He still has no commitments or entanglements. His backpack is still empty. The only difference is: he no longer believes in this philosophy. He's come to see it as empty and lonely. But this is the life he's stuck with. That's profoundly sad.<br/><br/>So I'm agog at people calling this a comedy, or talking about it being hilarious throughout. I have no idea what movie they were watching. Yes, there were a couple laugh-out-loud lines and moments. But hardly enough to call this a hilarious movie. A good movie? Yes. On the whole I thought it was well done and I liked it. But I really didn't like the ending. Just too sad for me. I really liked the protagonist, and really felt the scene in Chicago like a kick in the groin. The chemistry between the two characters was so good, I was certainly pulling for them to get together. Certainly that's good movie making.<br/><br/>But again, in a nutshell, this movie is about a happy man who finds out in the end that he isn't happy after all, even though his life is identical. I liked the character and wanted something better for him."

","George Clooney regularly plays that guy many of us secretly wish we were: suave, well-groomed, handsome, charismatic, confident - in other words, the Oceans Eleven Clooney - or for that matter, simply that general image we have of George Clooney with those aforementioned qualities, devoid of any discernible weaknesses or personality flaws. Certainly he has also played roles where he is paranoid, troubled, even 'kooky', but regardless of the odd exception which has seen him gaining weight or growing a beard for certain parts, there's that marked disconnection between the audience and him and his characters - where its particularly difficult to even picture him wearing anything other than a suit or even just with a different hairstyle. In fact I've often wondered whether he's been 'doing a Hugh Grant' this whole time by simply playing himself in most of his parts - where the on-screen Clooney is almost inseparable from his celebrity persona.<br/><br/>In Up in the Air it comes as no surprise when he initially appears to fit the bill again - a sharply dressed, handsome, confident, silver- tongued devil. But as we delve deeper into this character of Ryan Bingham - a 'corporate downsizing expert' who has prioritised professionalism and self preservation above all else and has micromanaged to a clockwork efficiency every little last detail of his working life spent mainly at airports and within planes and hotel rooms and who is, as a result, completely detached from remorse and emotional reality - we see something we haven't seen before; the polar opposite of what George Clooney stands for and what that overall image of George Clooney is. A vulnerable human being.<br/><br/>Bingham comes across as very similar to the character of Nick Naylor in Thank You For Smoking, also directed by Jason Reitman, the former a professional firer of people with zero empathy and the latter a pro- tobacco spokesperson, the both of them unscrupulous champions of capitalism who we ought to really hate but somehow, through those innate snake-like charms of theirs, manage to win us over with a surprising likability. The main difference between them is that in Up in the Air we catch a glimpse of the life Bingham has left behind and the pain caused by the ramifications of his choices, concealed behind that all- too-familiar smiling Clooney exterior.<br/><br/>This is a film many of us can relate to. It deals with the pursuit of a career and the security of a salary versus the dreams that may not pay off and which we may well never achieve. It explores the trade-off between excelling in what you need to do and not doing the best you can in what you want to do, and vice-versa. We are confronted with that awful fear in the back our minds that there is an extremely high probability that our lives will probably not turn out the way we wished, and how powerless we are to truly prevent ourselves from harm. We see human fragility in the face of love and pride, where a compromise needs to be made and where something usually needs to be sacrificed.<br/><br/>All of these worries are present in the characters in Up in the Air: dreamers and cynics, sometimes a bit of both. Bingham's love interest in the film, Alex, shares the almost exact same lifestyle but ends up affecting him profoundly. The young hotshot Natalie Keener believes in true love and the importance of seeking it, refusing to even imagine life without it and disagreeing with Bingham's outlook and the emotionless prerequisites of the horrible nature of their work. These characters impart their beliefs on one another, but the one who 'learns' the most from it is Ryan Bingham who, as a downsizer whose life philosophy all along has been to reduce the load of his own emotional baggage while reaching his life target of 50 million frequent flyer miles, eventually comes to terms with the harsh reality that he has, consequently, made redundant his own opportunities of truly living. The scene where he is required to give a potential future brother-in-law advice on the importance of marriage - a decision he has up until then personally staunchly opposed - exposes a hypocrisy he can't help but self-deprecatingly acknowledge and yet, through this, we feel a strange empathy for him, a character who is seemingly heartless, and see how even the most rock-hard stubbornness can still be swayed. Bingham is heartbroken in the end, but the fact that his heart was able to be broken at all really solidifies his character.<br/><br/>And that's what really got me in this movie. Far from being depressing, there is a hope that's revealed through Ryan Bingham: the moment he accepts the flaws of his own beliefs and comes to terms with the pure fact that life cannot be lived alone coincides with the audience's discovery that, instead of constantly being that guy we wanted to be, this time round George Clooney is playing the guy who kind of reminds us of ourselves. We might not have that exact same external charm or the trademark grey hair or display such confidence in public speaking but inside, we all feel the same things, and that's what makes Up in the Air hit home so convincingly and accessibly on a human level."

","Whilst I will agree with many reviewers who say things like ""'UP IN THE AIR' is a very well made insightful film that hits all the right notes and every one of those notes ring true."" I cannot agree with all of this.<br/><br/>The acting is spectacularly good. Clooney has settled into a rich vein of form where all his more recent roles seem to fit him with the ease of a favourite cardigan. Vera Farmiga delivers a nicely sassy performance. But for me it is Anna Kendrick that makes the movie tick. Her character's rigid shell is systematically excised and Kendrick delivers a finely nuanced performance, that should be worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination.<br/><br/>For me though the movie fails to address in sufficient detail the soullessness of the role that Clooney's character portrays and defends. The individual characters' personal battles are well handled. But the fact that there are such corporate 'guns for hire' was itself an angle that went unaddressed. Surely in this climate, this would have added a level of connection for white collar audiences.<br/><br/>At least the pilot termination agents were based in the US. Outsourcing this termination by Skype to India would have been all too much to bear."

","It's hard to exactly put into words just how great this film is. After observing Jason Reitman's rise to fame with such very good films as Thank you For Smoking and Juno, this film clearly cements him as one of the top directors working for intelligent adult audiences today.<br/><br/>What Reitman actually accomplishes in this film through his screen writing, directing, and editing pretty much puts 95% of the other directors in Hollywood to shame. Unlike most Hollywood films that are made for marketing purposes to cater to a wide demographic in order to make cash, it's clear that this film isn't trying to please anyone or any studio executive. It never talks down to its audience by telling them how they should feel or what they should think, and never gives the audience any hint as to where the story is headed. I saw this film with my dad the other day, and he said that he was disappointed by the second half of the movie because it didn't have a message or any kind of clear resolution. I replied back to him...well that's what elevates this film beyond 95% of the mindless drivel out there in Hollywood these days! It's called originality. It's called allowing your audience to ponder what the movie was about, who the characters really were as people, rather than just going through the motions of a recycled, cliché-ridden plot (Avatar, anyone?). I also overheard a few women leaving the theater who thought it was OK, but were kind of disappointed that Clooney never got to fall in love and marry one of the women at the end! Oh no! God forbid Hollywood screenwriters and directors avoid romantic comedy clichés and actually tell us a realistic story about human nature and human behavior! (sarcasm) <br/><br/>It's unfortunate that IMDb limits the number of words that I can use in this review, because I would like to write 10 pages explaining the greatness of this film. Where to start? 1) the movie is completely character driven, with all of the characters developed as 3-dimensional, likable, yet flawed people who are seen as very human and easy to relate to. Even Vera Farmiga's character, who we find out near the end is somewhat devilish, is seen as a human and likable person who doesn't know she is hurting someone else. The film doesn't care one bit about some kind of plot or climax, much like recent films ""Sideways"" and ""A Serious Man."" The characters just go about their daily business and we focus on who they are as people. 2) the humor and dialogue are outstanding because they focus on verbal wit and intelligent flirting/jousting rather than on stupid physical/slapstick gags. The ""R"" rating also allows the film to take risks with its dialogue because it can dare to go places ""PG-13"" films can't go. Most of this dialogue moves at a blistering pace, so you really have to pay attention to keep up. However, what really elevates this humor above that of other films is that it is so witty and based on normal human behavior! The 3 main characters all get a chance to shine comedically, but all of their comedy is based on realistic human behavior and genuine conversations people might have. 3) the film doesn't talk down to us an audience or preach to us about its message, but rather explores big ideas about work obsession, evolving technology, interpersonal connections, human desires, moral vs. immoral behavior, and lets us ponder them ourselves. The film especially focuses on these issues in its 2nd half, when the film suddenly stops being a laugh-a-thon and instead decides to become more dramatic and emotional. Some viewers may not like how the tone suddenly changes in its 2nd half, but I see it as a masterful move. 4) It's rare to see a romance between a couple that is older than the typical Hollywood romantic couple. Clooney - 40s and Farmiga - late 30s, and they are busy flirting and having as much fun as kids in a candy store! If there is one thing romantic movies these days usually tend to discriminate against, it's age. 5) Jason Reitman is working with very delicate material here, and the scenes with people being told they are fired are pretty emotional. Given today's economy, these parts may be a little too much for some viewers. Clooney's loneliness and search for a relationship are also pretty sad, but Reitman balances these emotions with the humor and wit wonderfully to not make the film either too humorous or too somber. <br/><br/>The audience in the theater I saw this in was packed and about 2/3 female (I am a male), who were probably mostly there to see a romantic comedy starring Mr. super hunk Clooney. Yes, this film does have plenty of great comedy and plenty of romance. However, it is far different from your typical Hollywood romantic comedy that focuses on clichés and one-dimensional characters. It is much more of a thought-provoking, Sociology-oriented film about people's individual needs, characteristics, and motivations, and is especially relevant with regards to our current culture and society. In fact, most of the content of this movie should be of great interest to men, since at its heart it's about Clooney's sense of masculinity and how he allows his nonstop work schedule to act as a crutch to avoid any kind of deep, meaningful relationship he might have with a person. This is much more of an artsy, independent film than a typical Hollywood blockbuster aimed at making cash. With the 200 or so mainstream films released in America every year, only 3 or 4 of them are ever on this level of greatness. Adult audiences with intelligent brains who hate being preached to at movies should see this puppy 2 or 3 times to improve its box office profits. I know I am going to."
"dbborroughs","6","5","10","10 January 2010"," Good but profoundly sad story of a man who just travels
","(SPOILERS- I talk in a roundabout way about the ending) <br/><br/>The co-front runner (with Hurt Locker) for the Best Picture Oscar this year concerns a man who flies around the country and fires people for a living. He meets and begins a relationship with a woman who also flies the country. Meanwhile his job maybe changing as a young hot shot has come up with a way to fire people via video conferencing.<br/><br/>I found this to be a good but not really great film. I know it wasn't quite what I expected going in. Certainly I didn't expect to find the film so incredibly sad. George Clooney's character is a very sad person. He's incredibly happy that he lives out of suitcases and simply travels from place to place., or so he thinks. And its kind of heart warming to see how he comes around but that makes the ending so much more sad. As the film ended I kind of wanted to step into traffic.<br/><br/>I'm kind of at a loss to to figure out why the film ends as it does, what is the point? What is the film trying to say? That we shouldn't try to move out of out cocoons? That perhaps we are all better off just traveling? Maybe that we should go with our first instincts and never know if there is anything better out there? I'm not sure. Sure Clooney is a bit of a jerk at the start but its also a defense. As the film goes on and Clooney's defenses are stripped away he finds himself not really better off, but more empty and much more aware of what he is missing. Its like the world showed him everything he could have and then took it all away. It depressed me. Sure life is cruel but even karmicly Clooney doesn't deserve what he gets.<br/><br/>I know the fine line between comedy and tragedy.<br/><br/>As I said I'm at a loss to explain it and I think director Jason Reitman is too.<br/><br/>Its a good film, its just not a great one."
"chuck-526","6","5","10","1 January 2010"," Two stories in one
","The acting, cinematography, production values, and editing are first rate. There are gobs of good one-liners, even for more than one viewing. There are plenty of stellar views of flyover country, including those round irrigation circles in a square landscape. I've never seen so many different recognizable cities from the air. The shot of an airplane landing from the point of view of the airplane itself (not from the side of the runway) is even better than being there. <br/><br/>Lots of fairly detailed strands of different subplots are woven together very well. It's sorta a comedy, but sorta serious too. It's one of those where after watching the ambiguous ending you leave the theater laughing, but at the same time thinking ""hmm..."".<br/><br/>I was disappointed though that it's two different stories at once. There's the movie about the rootlessness of the frequent flyer, the connoisseur of tricks for faster boarding who uses his many club membership cards as a pick-up technique. There's also the movie about firing people, about sudden unemployment and what it feels like from both sides of the table. To a reasonable extent the two come together thematically: the emotional underpinning of the rootless frequent flyer is an awfully good base for firing people. As a former traveling software support person who became redundant, flying, computer technology, and layoffs all resonate personally with me. But those resonances don't dovetail in my mind like they do here; I'd prefer to see separate movies."

"MBunge","6","3","5","27 December 2010"," Simplistic but very entertaining
","Up In The Air is one of those movies where the parts are much better than the whole. It has a lot of pieces of good-to-great storytelling, but none of it adds up to anything at the end. This film is like a lovely house that's been perfectly painted, expect the painters weren't paying close enough attention and each side of the house is a different color. Each side looks great on its own but when you step back and look at the whole house, the overall affect is unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a modern nomad, living out of hotel rooms and his travel case as he flies from city to city, firing people when their own bosses don't have the stomach for it. What would be a hellish existence for many people is a joy to Ryan. He's so happy living his life constantly in motion and unencumbered that he's built up a side business giving corporate speeches on ""emptying out the backpack of your life"" and freeing yourself from the demands of both possessions and relationships. Ryan's even managed to land himself a pseudo-girlfriend in the smart and sexy Alex (Vera Farmiga), another constant business traveler who hooks up with Ryan at various hotels whenever their schedules coincide.<br/><br/>Ryan gets thrown for a loop, however, when his bosses decide to stop sending him all over the country to fire people and just do it over the internet. At least that's the plan put forth by Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), the very young and very smart new girl at Ryan's company. Feeling that his perfect life is threatened, Ryan pokes enough holes in Natalie's proposals that he's assigned to take her out on the road and teach her the basics of the termination business. As Natalie learns that taking away people's jobs is a bit more involved than she thought, Ryan begins to reconsider his unattached reality. But just as he decides that maybe life is better lived with others, he's staggered by a series of surprises and challenges that leave him right where he was at the start of the filmbut with a completely different outlook on things.<br/><br/>There's a lot to love about Up In The Air. George Clooney is as charming as ever and he has his equal in Vera Farmiga. Their characters are wonderful together and both performers look like they're having a lot of fun. They could have made a really nice romantic-comedy about Ryan and Vera just by themselves. Anna Kendrick as the professionally and personally naïve Natalie is a great prism through which the strengths and weaknesses of Ryan and Vera's lifestyle can be seen and examined. Being the third wheel in a script in never an easy role, but Natalie is more than a servant to the Almighty Plot Hammer.<br/><br/>The film's examination of what it means to people when they lose their job is also a welcome perspective. The wrenching, defeating and humiliating experience of being fired is conveyed through real people who were actually laid off, talking to the camera as through they were speaking to the person who fired them. Into that genuine pain, the fictional character of Ryan is introduced and he is exactly the sort of person you'd want to be the one telling you you're out of a job. Ryan talks to these people about how losing their job is an opportunity to do something better with their lives. And here's the important thing, the movie shows us that both Ryan and the people he's firing know that the ""opportunity spiel"" is a load of BS...but that in that BS is a kernel of truth. All Ryan can offer is cold comfort and he truly wants it to be the best comfort he can offer, but he also maintains a professional distance. He's like a surgeon who's performing a dangerous but necessary operation and can't let the death of a patient emotionally derail him and stop him from doing his job.<br/><br/>For all of the good, though, Up In The Air crashes and burns at the end when you realize there's not been a point to anything you've just watched. You can literally boil down the entire dramatic and thematic core of this movie into two sentences. They are<br/><br/>1. A man who doesn't want personal relationships changes his mind and wants personal relationships.<br/><br/>2. The End.<br/><br/>I'm not joking. All the humor and social observation in the rest of the film is nothing but decoration for that simplistic and ungratifying gist. This isn't a story about how there's something wrong with Ryan that made him choose a disconnected and solitary existence. Ryan is shown as being perfectly capable of having meaningful relationships. He just starts out not wanting any and then he does. This also isn't a story about how there's something wrong with Ryan's lifestyle, other than that it's unusual for someone his age to enjoy such a peripatetic state of being. It isn't even a story about something being wrong with Ryan's job. There really is no overarching or unifying argument underlying this story. That's not the worst flaw in the world, but it results in an quite entertaining movie finishing in a very unsatisfactory way. When it ended, I felt like there should have been another 15 or 20 minutes left in the film.<br/><br/>Because these filmmakers apparently never considered what this movie was supposed to be about, the audience is left to relish the individual parts of the film without them ever fitting together in any greater way. I like everything about Up In The Air, right up until it left me disappointed and a bit confused. That's a lot more pleasure than you'll get out of most movies, so I can certainly recommend this film. Just don't expect it to make a lot of sense."

As for the directing, not sure what to make of it cos I really liked the Juno movie.<br/><br/>I know what its like Tobe e out of work, fired and to fire someone, we can all relate to the role play within this film both from the work standpoint and from the relationship standpoint as well also as the 'flying' standpoint.<br/><br/>The title of the film carries a triple meaning - to do with flying too much, to be uncertain about relationships so 'up in the air' and to be up there when you re out of work.<br/><br/>The idealology of the film is terrific, I just don't think it delivers and I might go along that Tom Cruise opr even Brad Pitt would have been better suited to the role than dear Mr Clooney who seems to want to grab all these types of roles for himself these days.<br/><br/>Will be a travesty if Clooney wins Oscar for best actor. This film is very over-rated, slow to take-off, slow to land, predictable in many ways, not enough punch lines for a dramatic comedy .<br/><br/>Even though boring, it IS enjoyable but I enjoyed Cloonety in 'Goats' so much more and Juno was definitely funnier.

Then is the person who follows Ryan around and the poor writing makes it sound like she's never been to a hotel before!

It was bad enough throughout the film but in the climax, it through me out of the film. Then we find that Alex is married with kids which drove me crazy with how much that makes no sense.

One the whole, I liked this movie, being unexpectedly less predictable than it sounded, it gets to mix seriousness and fun with intelligence, above all thanks to a good script, never forgetting the tragic background it is rooted on. Good acting is delivered by the three main characters: Clooney has always that adorable but sometimes annoying (highly tolerable annoying, indeed!) face, but he delivers a really good performance, on the whole. Vera Farmiga, all refinement and enigma, plays her part in a perfect way. In the end, after one million of flight miles, the movie reminded me of a travel quote I once read on a plane while coming back home from a journey, it sounded more or less like this : ""No one realizes how beautiful it is to travel until he comes home and rests his head on his old, familiar pillow."", and I would add, until he rejoins those true dears who will listen to his travel account and will accompany him along the everyday journey of life."

Hooray for modern technology. Clooney's character being an old dog and not interested in new tricks is offended by her presence and even though it's his new position to show her the ropes he feels this is absurd and that HE will show HER how it's really done and the reason their company even has a business, that you cannot trim the fat on firing people.

","""We are all Keynesians now."" - Friedman <br/><br/>There are currently almost 14 million unemployed persons in the United States. The chieftains of three of the four largest economic schools of thought (Marxists, Keynesians, Monetarists and the Austrian School) view these numbers in wildly different ways. For Marxists, such numbers are intrinsic to capitalism, a constant pool of unemployed keeping wages down and workers in perpetual fear. Guys like Milton Friedman, however, believed in a natural rate of unemployment; an acceptable and necessary rate. The Keynesian goal, in contrast, has always been ""full employment"". Keynesians work toward this dream by bolstering a fallacy: the notion that pumping money or fiscal stimulants will result in more jobs and a ""healthy"" economy. But these are temporary fixes which, for a range of reasons, merely results in the problems occurring again, magnified, further down the road. Friedman himself believed that such Keynesian stimulants would result in unemployment and inflation steadily climbing, forming the twin monster which Paul Samuelson dubbed ""stagflation"", which is what the United States is currently experiencing.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" begins by throwing us headlong into the United States' current economic crisis (the late 2000 financial crisis). Thousands of white collar workers have been fired from their jobs and so are busy bemoaning their predicament. ""This is what I get after 30 years of service,"" one man says bitterly.<br/><br/>Enter Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a ""transition specialist"" who is hired by corporations to inform employees that their employment has been terminated. Like the lead character in Reitman's ""Thank You For Smoking"", Bingham's a charismatic con-man. A smooth talking corporate spin-doctor, Bingham stabs you in the back and then convinces you that the knife's a smart career move; a chance for personal reinvention. Reitman's point: corporations are sneaky, cold, inhuman, impersonal, and don't care about you. ""Don't take this personally,"" is Bingham's motto.<br/><br/>The film's title has a double meaning, referring both to the status of America's employees, their jobs ""up in the air"" and subject to whimsical market fluctuations, and Bingham's lifestyle. Perpetually airborne, Bingham circles the globe, firing anyone who stumbles into his cross-hairs. In between jobs he delivers motivational speeches to corporate audiences, urging the attendees to empty their ""emotional backpacks"" of possessions and personal connections. ""Your relationships are the heaviest components in your life,"" he says. ""Drop them. We are not swans. We are sharks."" <br/><br/>Of course Bingham gradually begins to reassess such cold thinking. When the drive to maximise profits begins to encroach on his own job (he is being replaced by a computer), Bingham begins to empathise with those he fires, reconsider everything he previously deemed to be ""of value"", and understand that one should be part of, or responsible to, a larger community. The film itself constantly clashes ""career relationships"" and the perceived joy of being a ""valued member of the corporate family"" with more meaningful connections. The point: corporate families are not ""real"" families. You and your welfare are not important to the corporation. You will be ejected.<br/><br/>What makes the film particularly bleak, though, is that when Bingham casts aside his old corporate life and makes an effort to reconnect to both his family and an attractive woman, he gets supremely burned. He finds no value in marriage and the woman he loves is revealed to be already married; she was simply using him, treating Bingham as a dispensable object, exactly as he treats the hundreds of men and women he lays off. So what's surprising is that the film critiques Bingham while proving his cold world-view ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. Humanity outside Bingham's aloof corporate sphere is seen to be already inhumane, narcissistic, self-obsessed, and selfishly motivated. Where then is Bingham to go? <br/><br/>The film's topics are timely and interesting, but Reitman's not strong enough an artist to push things further. The film nihilistically accepts ""inside"" and ""outside"" the corporate sphere as being devoid of hope because it accepts that greed and self interest are intrinsically dominant in man (rather than nature being contingent). This is a form of circular thinking; so long as man exists in an system that promotes the worst aspects of mankind, that rewards greed, violence and self interest, this is how he will act. Reitman's perfectly understandable pessimism (""There is no outside"", ""there is no alternative"", ""that's just the way it is"" etc) was common with 60s and 70s directors, and is starting to become common again. Academia is caught in a similar dead-end. The task is for artists/thinkers to dream/think harder.<br/><br/>The film mostly ignores the machinations of its vague, off-screen corporations. Capitalism is a wealth-concentrating system. If you concentrate wealth in a society, you concentrate power and breed an increasingly psychopathic organism. Indeed, if corporations were ""persons"", their mental condition could accurately be described as pathological. And as democracy is undermined by power, capitalism and democracy may be said to be mutually exclusive. In the film, the corporations are simply seen to be coldly pragmatic. And you're made to accept this as being both understandable and a necessity.<br/><br/>The film gets right the cultural logic of postmodernism (overall commodification) and somewhat touches upon commodity fetishism (an emphasis on the abstract value of commodities conceals the underlying social relations of their producers), but looks away from more traumatic truths. Audiences don't like looking at real work and real employee plights. That's too messy. We like debonair movie stars and sexy jobs. Cue Clooney.<br/><br/>The film tries to paint Bingham's existence as being empty/hollow, but Clooney too heavily oozes movie-star charm, glamour and sexy non-committance. In a way, Reitman's serving a contemporary take on Huxley's ""Brave New World"", in which a futuristic society suffers the effects of dehumanisation, spiritual and familial deprivation, misused technology and obsessions with narcissistic, personal pleasure, but he can't quite tap into such things. Still, good mainstream dramedy.<br/><br/>8/10 - Worth one viewing."

","Why was Up in the Air so widely acclaimed by critics and award ceremonies? It's the kind of movie that's so over-hyped that it makes me want to give it a lower score than it deserves. Because the fact is it's not a bad movie - it's just a decent one. I have nothing against Jason Reitman or his filmmaking style, but both Juno and Thank You For Smoking - flawed though they were - had freshness and originality that this one doesn't have. Reitman drew brilliant and surprising performances from Ellen Page and Aaron Eckhart; in Up in the Air, George Clooney plays the most stereotypically Clooney-ish character imaginable, and charming though he is, he doesn't seem to be putting enough effort into this. The writing is witty, the production is slick and the soundtrack is fantastic, but other than that it's a very mundane piece of cinema."

","I like George Clooney...really. I mean, he's good-looking, great camera-presence, plays many different types of roles. But, I've never (and I mean never) seen him in a good movie. Don't know what it is. Must be a talent of his; and this movie fits right in...Incredibly Boring...slow mundane talking. Reminds me of books I was forced to read in high school; would read a couple of pages, then couldn't (for the life of me) remember what I just read...just like this movie. Very disappointed, considering the good reviews. I only know this: a good movie captures your attention, makes you think, makes you laugh, etc. A great movie, all the same, except you are also willing to watch it over and over again, no mater how many times you've seen it.

"J_Charles","Null","2","3","22 February 2011"," Overrated dramedy - spends too much time ""up in the air""
","It's tricky to make these ""Dramedies"" - part drama, part comedy. You either have a lot of humorous but not funny incidents that don't get enough laughs. Or you don't get your audience fully engaged in the storyline or characters and they wonder where the drama fits in.<br/><br/>For me this movie unfortunately fit both descriptions; neither funny nor dramatic. The plot is wafer thin. It's the recession, people are getting laid off everywhere. So why not outsource the firings and have a bunch of professionals flying around the country telling people they've been let go. It's a very dark premise and given today's situation, perhaps one that hits too close to home. So immediately, for much of the audience, you've probably lost a lot of the intended comedic irony from that situation.<br/><br/>then you have the characters. None of them is particularly 'like-able'. Clooney is a ""character"" but not one who is charming nor engaging. His character is meant to be trying to distance himself from others, but again, his success in portraying that is a detriment to the audience actually getting connected to his character. So he fails for being successful. Anna Kendrick, the young go-getter is primed to fill that void as the film's heroine but her project - firing people by webcam to save the company money, also reeks of insensitivity, or at best naivety. And Vera Farmigiana, well, she looks good in a tight black dress.<br/><br/>And there you have it. The funny scenes are more ""droll"" than funny. You get it. It's humorous. But it's definitely not 'laugh out loud' funny.<br/><br/>the characters are hollow, empty, and floating away on a sea of misery, largely of their own making.<br/><br/>4/10 - I've watched it once. And that's enough."

","Up in the Air<br/><br/>In this dilapidated economy, I wouldn't be surprised if commercial airlines had to start making some major in-flight cutbacks. For example, reducing snack-size pretzel portions or implementing a ""no flush"" rule in the lavatory. Fortunately, for the frequent-flying corporate downsizer in this dramedy, things haven't deteriorated that drastically.<br/><br/>Drawing closer to ten million frequent flyer miles, Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) solitary life of constant travel, confrontation and anonymous sex is interrupted when he must show a rookie, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), how to do what he does.<br/><br/>Polar opposites when it comes to relationships, Natalie questions Ryan's emotional seclusion, causing him to confront his feelings for fellow friendly-flyer, Alex (Vera Farmiga).<br/><br/>A fitting tale for our troubled times, Up in the Air captures the economic climate and its vile repercussions, but, regrettably, its mawkish moments and unsavory characters make it hard to love.<br/><br/>However, I do advise that you never fire a pilot while they're working. (Yellow Light)"
"jemps918","7","2","3","15 February 2010"," a toss-up between keeping lofty dreams and discovering the empty reality
","Jason Reitman directs Up in the Air, a story he began writing in 2002 with Sheldon Turner when the US economy was thriving. It was supposed to be his first feature, but he ended up making Thank You for Smoking (2005) and Juno (2007) first. With the onset of the economic recession, the delay in Up in the Air's release became timelier.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)'s job has him flying around the country as a professional firer. He enjoys his lack of attachment and even moonlights as a motivational speaker to spread his philosophy of having no baggage, concretized by a convenient pseudo-relationship Ryan has with his lady equivalent, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Despite this, he successfully empathizes with the difficult, emotional turbulence firing people takes; he takes no joy out of this but he does have a secret wish: to rack up 10M frequent flyer miles and attain the ultimate elite card. So when his company takes on young upstart Natalie Keener (Twilight's Anna Kendrick), who proposes a cost-cutting measure by firing people online instead, Ryan has a lot more convincing to do, which could challenge the very core of the philosophy he preaches.<br/><br/>I laud the way the characters are written because they are all complex. Clooney's role is so eerily reflective of how he portrays himself in real-life (being the eternal bachelor) that it isn't a stretch to see him play Ryan. However, his performance also allowed audiences a glimpse of his vulnerable side, which his usually cocky demeanor never shows. While Oscar Best Actress nominee Farmiga did her usual disrobing, the surprise this time is that she used a body double, having just given birth. Performance wise, her muted expressions were the perfect blend for the grand reveal her character delivers near the end. 1998 Tony Best Actress nominee Anna Kendrick was able to hold her own beside the two stars as Natalie; she successfully gets you to admire her, hate her and feel sorry for her all at once.<br/><br/>If the clips of the people reacting to being fired makes you flinch at its rawness, it may be because they were real people who were recently laid off. They were reportedly asked to look at the camera as if it were the person who fired them and reenact what they did, or say what they hoped they had. Juxtaposing that with images of vacant office spaces made the scenes feel real for the audience, an effort that effectively translates genuine emotion on screen.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a different ending, perhaps one that ties everything up neatly, but if the objective is to stay truthful, then life never really turns out to be that simple. We already know that we won't always get what we want, but in the off chance that we do achieve it, it sucks to sometimes realize that it wasn't what we expected; it's a toss-up between keeping lofty dreams and discovering the empty reality."

","This is a very engaging film with good, sharp dialogue by the three main characters and well placed humor. It is also a sad story too. Ryan is really a sad and isolated character. He has structured his life around flying over 300 days a year and living out of hotel rooms with his small carry-on bag seeking the mythical ten million air miles mark. He prides himself on all the earned travel perks he has acquired and his ability to travel with maximum efficiency. He has ignored his siblings and does not have a family of his own. His tiny studio apartment in Omaha where the corporate HQ is at is barren and sterile looking as a hospital room. His attractive neighbor in his apartment even turns him down for a date given how seldom he is at home, if you can call it home.<br/><br/>When he finally begins to come around to his situation, mainly as a result of his new female co-worker who does not buy into the isolated lifestyle he lives, his new love interest (Alex) and his sister's wedding, it comes crashing to a halt when Alex rejects the idea of a true relationship with him. Ryan thought it might be love but it is just a diversion for her as she is married with children. His new co-worker then quits the firm and moves and Ryan is alone again in the air alone again. Even his finally reaching the ten million air mile mark becomes a hollow accomplishment. Not a happy ending to this film. Clooney absolutely shines in this film."

"ElMaruecan82","9","1","1","17 November 2019"," Firing people, a business that knows no crisis... in fact, it counts on it!
","""Up in the Air"", from 'hip' director Jason Reitman, takes us back to that traumatizing year of 2009 where the future couldn't look any grimmer and anyone with a job felt like belonging to a Forbes club. I'm talking from experience, following that hypocritical euphemism, P&G ""let me go"" at the end of 2008 and for six months, I couldn't count how many jobs I've applied to, how many fresh alumni friends I reached out to, and the same answer kept popping up: right now, we don't hire. I finally got me a job but that was a close call and it wasn't in Europe anyway; the crisis hadn't spread yet to North Africa.<br/><br/>But how about Ryan Bingham's job? Surely one that was begging for a film adaptation: his mission is to travel all around American big cities... to fire people! Their bosses don't have the guts to do the dirty work, it might seem ludicrous but it's not that easy firing someone, it means a lot of paperwork, many legal ordeals, the kind of stuff you'd better leave to a specialist with a smile as polished as his briefcase. And that job reminded me of a gag from the ""Simpsons"" episode when Bart's ""Angry Dad"" was published on the Internet; realizing the company went bankrupt, he's socked that ""Bubbles can burst"" and one of the workers who came to collect the furniture say ""It's a Golden Age for the repo business"". In the worst financial crisis after a certain Black Thursday in 1929, Bingham's company is living a real Golden Age.<br/><br/>The merit of Reitman is to deal with a very unpleasant subject, one about people's lives being ruined basically in a rather tactful manner, and still making Ryan's job exciting to some degree, after all, it's not exactly life and death situation (although...). The film starts with a visually delightful opening sequence showing many air-view landscapes of American cities, the sequence provides the sort of dreamy imagery that might even cure someone who's got fear of flying (including myself). These are the sights Ryan enjoys on a daily basis, spending more days aboard planes under cotton-like clouds than Irish people under a rainy sky. The sequence provides us comforting images before we discover what the game is about.<br/><br/>The film opens with various documentary-like reactions of people seeing their existential edifices collapse, It's touching and poignant but never pathetic, a sequence with Zach Galifianakis sets up the job in a didactic way, it's all about selling the same speech, telling people that anyone who ""build an empire"" sat in a similar place and that's what strengthened them. Looking at these people's devastated faces, we know they don't buy the line, but somewhat they accept it because they're at such a low point that anything cheerful is welcome. In another wonderfully written scene with J.K. Simmons, his character says at one point ""you're supposed to cheer me up"". Bingham knows he's got to deal with adult and rational people but in a very irrational and emotionally fragile situation. It's a tough job and he takes it very seriously.<br/><br/>And one thing for sure, after the first expositional act, we get the idea; Bingham travels across airport check-points as smoothly and confidently as Henry Hill taking Karen from the side-entrance to the restaurant in ""Goodfellas"", it's his territory, his reason to be, as he says ""to know me is to fly with me"". Hotels are his second domain, in one of them, he meets Alex (Vera Ferniga) a woman whose job is never explicated, but all we know is that it exposes her to the same routine than Bingham. After a few introductions, they compare their bank cards and their experiences with car rentals and hotels and Bingham reveals his lifelong dream, collecting one million miles, and the dialogue in that scene, with all its double entendre is one of the film's delights. There's a reason Clooney was perfect for that role.<br/><br/>There's a lot of 2009 Clooney in that competent man but estranged to his family or the very notion of family living occasional romances with no tomorrows. It's a hackneyed sentence but it fits him perfectly, he's the man ""married to his job"". But one woman might contradict this plan, a pint-sized ambitious newcomer who came up with a new idea: in-sourcing. Why go to the extent of travelling all around the world when everything can be settled through videoconference? The boss (Jason Bateman) finds the idea interesting, but Bingham finds the right way to tell her that technology isn't exactly the best way to handle human relationships and suggest an initiating tour so she can understand the real intricacies of the business. As Natalie, Kendrick plays the opposite of Alex, she goes from confidence to disillusion while the more mature Alex is confident but resigned. In many aspects, they're the most human characters of the film and the indirect triggers to Bingham's hidden humanity hidden under his cynical armor.<br/><br/>There's a little running gag involving a miniature picture of his sister and future husband he carries in various places like that gnome in ""Amelie"", but it takes the relationships with both Natalie and Alex to grasp the emptiness of his life. Natalie's idealism might be shaken but never turn into cynicism, as for Nathalie, a scene had me scared: when Clooney left one of his darling conferences about his 'backpack' metaphor, racing across the airport, I was afraid it would be one of these contrived 'declaration' scenes but it's fascinating the way the film tie the two themes together: love and jobs.<br/><br/>The final montage shows fired people saying how they went through it thanks to their family or their beloved one, it's not just a light of hope but a challenging ending after a fascinating character study: can you live without a job? Or without love? One is for a living? But is living possible without the other?"

Okay, he hit his mileage goal, and helped Natalie with a new job. But beyond that, I see no change. Besides, was it just me who expected something else between Natalie and Dave ?! He seemed to fulfill all the prerequisites cited by her minutes before the scene where they met. I can't complain about everything too.

","Ryan Bingham's a corporate down sizer; an expert whose expertise lies in firing people from their jobs, with a disdain of swatting a mosquito. He's a gladiator who swings the club of unemployment at hapless ""resources"" to entertain their bosses. For someone who who shoves the proverbial last nail, his karma does look pretty good. He lives out of a suitcase, travels business class and furtively saves up flyer miles by the million, to make it to an elite club of patrons. That's the closest romantic aspiration his dispassionate life lets him have, till he runs into Alex. Like him she's a shallow soul- looking to sidestep reality - , judging people by the names on their plastic money. She lights up the first time, when she runs her hand on one of his cards and gets told that it's made of graphite. One thing leads to another and soon they find themselves canoodling naked beneath a rummaged bed. That's the closest Ryan's goes with excitement of the human kind. By own admission, he comes alive during transit and decays at home. He constantly finds the urge to be on the move. He calls the terminals his home and is content with the stimulated hospitality, a perk of being a loyal patron of the airlines.<br/><br/>A petite surprise awaits him back at work in the form of a new recruit, who's there to administer his own medicine to him. She's there to digitize the entire shebang, to bring about a huge cost saving to the firm. But he sees it as an initiative to clip his wings. He belongs in the sky and this means gravity. He gets territorial with her, even tries and manipulates his boss about how his personal touch brings dignity- to people about to be dropped like a bad habit -that might virtually be compromised. He's not concerned about the employees who're about to go off the deep end, as much as he is about himself. He's worried about the idea of a permanent home, a life without the leverage of escapism.The escapism which let him feel accompanied in a moving crowd.<br/><br/>To pilot her rather radical initiative, he accompanies his young colleague to shop on the battle field. He mentors her. Becomes her reality check, gradually getting her into becoming the headlight before deer, office after office. Often than not he sugarcoats his condescension with tongue in cheek sarcasm. Every time she tries to humanize the process, he reiterates to remain mechanical. They find themselves locking horns; trying to call out each other's bluff. But at the end of this symbiotic love hate relationship, the protégé begins to endear.Just as her warmth fizzles in his cold, he begins to melt down to her warmth.<br/><br/>Over the course of the film, his character metamorphoses organically like a butter melt through sunshine, without turning to cinematic hyper boles. Take for instance the scene where he sheepishly asks Alex to be his date to his sister's wedding, from the precincts of his cocoon of self-banishment. Be it that scene where he surreptitiously regrets his offer to walk his sister down the aisle being turned down or the one where he's stumped when he comes face wards with Alex's reality. Clooney dishes out this conundrum beautifully, crafting vulnerability into Bingham's fault lines. He makes the parallel thoughts occupying his head space palpable, making us moon for this inglorious gentleman.<br/><br/>Eventually Ryan does get the crown he yearns for, but one that is made of thorns. Irony has the last laugh with his entry into the elite flyers club coinciding with his loss of zest to fly. For what does the open sky mean to a sitting duck. He tilted hopefully to the very permanence he had run from all his life, to only be left behind with a permanent scar, in the place of an embrace. As the rug gets repeatedly pulled from under his feet by providence, he gives up the hopeless will to pursue a life different than before.His is an ordeal of an eagle who was at peace with the river's current- when it believed itself to be a duck -till its first flight. That first flight brought with it, equal measure of pleasure and pain, with pain leaving a far bitter taste behind; for it to ever take to the skies again. Unperturbed it now swims in the same river, with the awareness of an ability to fly and the discretion given by the pain it brought."
"dgriggs6","8","1","1","2 May 2016"," Just had a flashback while watching this
","I just watched this movie again tonight (5-2-16), first time since right after it was released. I am VERY interested and knowledgeable in economics compared to most folks. Part of the success and impact of this movie is that it is one of the very best to capture the vast amount of despair that was going on in USA in 2009. VAST numbers of people, the vast majority of whom had done nothing wrong in their jobs, were fired because of the near Depression that hit then. I am 65 yrs old. By FAR IT WAS the worst economic downturn in my lifetime. ""Up"" showed how different people can react to different awful news that is a life changer. That and the scenes at the wedding of Ryan's relative are what linger in my mind. Shows that personal relationships for most people are the most important things in life. <br/><br/>About the SHOCKING revelation that Alex is not only married but has kids. Now that I have seen the movie a 2nd time, I consider this the one substantial weakness in the movie. Would a married mom with kids go with Ryan to his family wedding? Keep her private life completely hidden, without even warning Ryan to never, ever just show up at her home? I didn't and don't buy it. Earlier scenes should have been handled differently. BUT I still think this is a wonderful movie. And the acting was great by the 3 primary characters."
"phoenixwings-08676","6","1","1","29 April 2016"," Up in the air movie review
","Up in the Air: Film Review<br/><br/>Firing people now-a-days has become more and more of a hassle as the economy jumps up or falls down. This is the arena where Ryan Bingham, George Clooney, shines. He is a part of a business that goes from business to business doing the dirty deed of firing employees they cannot keep. This plays to the general theme about the idea of the movie that nothing lasts forever. This theme theory plays upon the idea that he rarely sleeps in his own home while on the move between plane rides, has his heart played with by Alex Goran who is played by Vera Farmiga, and also how he fires people for a living. He wants to find love, but believes that it will not pan out. Throughout the film, Ryan has to bring along an associate to get her used to the firing business and it turns into a hilarious eye opening experience for him. Her name is Natalie Keener, played by Anna Kendrick, and she brings up story plots items that affect the outcome of the movie such as: losing her boyfriend, helping play match maker for Ryan and Alex, introducing a new way to fire people that could jeopardize Ryan's way of life, etc. That is enough of the storyline without spoiling the fun, next we discuss the stars of the movie and mechanics of the film at work. (Reitman, 2009).<br/><br/>As addressed above, George Clooney plays the main character of Ryan Bingham, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick play the secondary characters of Alex Goran and Natalie Keener. After these three, the film has many famous actors that you have seen around in many of today's modern films, or may not have become popular yet until long after, such as: Jason Bateman who plays Craig Gregory or Ryan's boss, Zach Galifianakis who plays the small background role of Steve who is being fired at the beginning of the movie, Melanie Lynskey who plays Julie Bingham, and J.K. Simmons who also plays a small role of bob who is also being fired by Ryan. Other notable actors are Chris Lowell who plays Kevin, Sam Elliot who plays Maynard Finch, Amy Morton who plays Kara Bingham, Danny McBride who plays Jim Miller and many more. (Reitman, 2009). This movie is filled with montage work addressing how Ryan lives on a day to day basis towards the beginning, the relationship blooming between him and Alex Goran, and during his visits to hotels and jobs. This also involves a lot of jump shots throughout the film when there are not montage bits due to the fact that we do not want to watch the whole plane rides, or them constantly checking in and out of hotel rooms or the airports in general. This movie is very, I guess you could say, focused on the nothing lasts forever theme. The lighting generally feels brighter and welcoming when he is in the airports and on the move. The lighting is dimmed whenever he is forced into a spot for too long or he is in hotel rooms alone. This implies that he is getting tired of being alone, and keeps moving to keep him at his feeling of being home. These all tie into this relevant theme idea. The movie has its merits and a large cast of big name actors, the only downfall I have for this movie is its sudden ending with questions being raised. This also, though, may be a part of the theme with things being Up in the Air. (Petrie & Boggs, 2012).<br/><br/>References Petrie, D., & Boggs, J. 2012. In The Art of Watching Films 8th ed.

"mistoppi","5","1","1","28 April 2016"," I feel so miserable now
","I was just browsing Netflix when I stumbled upon Up in the Air. I hadn't heard about it before, but I decided to watch it anyway.<br/><br/>First of all, is that a real job? Can someone's job actually be firing people in other companies? It might be a better system for the employers, but that must suck for a) employees and b) the person who has to fire like hundred people in a month, if not more. Yikes. <br/><br/>While it might not be the main point of this film, Up in the Air can show how annoying it might be the employees when everything is computerized. Sure, some co-workers of Ryan Bingham may enjoy how they don't have to leave their hometown and all that, but Bingham is used to travelling. He points out that the airport is his home. And let's be honest, firing people through computers might be extremely alienating, when they can't even be in the same room with the person who is telling them their position is no longer available. Also this kind of job would be more interesting if you can actually see ""the world"" (mostly the U.S. but still) while doing so. <br/><br/>Also the main character's philosophy is interesting. It's basically telling you to give up everything, because every commitment you have weighs you down and stops you from going forward. He makes me think of a weird version of Tyler Durden, except Ryan Bingham isn't running a group of terrorists. Ryan Bingham is an interesting character, considering many people have probably dreamed of a life like that: you don't have to contact your family, but you're not alone, because you meet new people every day. You're alone in the sense that you don't have to commit to relationships, but you're not actually lonely. But when you see the film, you start realising how empty Bingham's life really is, and that gets to you. While some people certainly could be satisfied by Bingham's life choices, you start wondering what if you couldn't pull it off? <br/><br/>Because of that this film makes me think of Alfie. In that film, a womanizer Alfie is so happy with his life, but eventually he realises how empty his life is. I think Bingham has the same kind of realization. <br/><br/>During most of the film the viewer feels miserable. It's like nothing good happens. The part that's supposed to be happy - Bingham's sister's wedding - is completely drowned in a melancholy music, which makes it seem like even then Bingham isn't actually happy because he is missing all of that, and that's... It feels faux. And because of most of the latter part of the film is so melancholy and miserable, it makes you think if there were any kind of happy moments in this film.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment in this film has to be the soundtrack. The first song is extremely good, but the actual soundtrack is lame. It does it's job, but you wouldn't listen to the soundtrack when you're doing something else. <br/><br/>Up in the Air is a good film in a way - it makes you think about life and all that. But still if you fell completely miserable after the film, and not even in the really sad way that makes you want to cry your eyes out, what's the point? It doesn't give a really good feeling about the film. I had the same experience with Alfie, and I haven't touched that film since. I doubt I'll be seeing this movie ever again."

","The movies story is about a guy who's job it to fire others from theirs.

I believe it offers a brilliant experience to those who feel the same.<br/><br/>The main character is separated and has isolated himself from everyone that should care about them, leaving him as someone who is never there for them. In the end, he comes back and becomes apart of their life once again. This happens in a very motivational way by helping out with the problem in one of his family members marriage. I do believe this movie is extremely powerful and you can learn a thing or 2, but this just wasn't for me.

Vera Farmiga was sexy and likable most of the movie... till an unexpected reveal at the end. Anna Kendrick did not really impress. George Clooney was his usual likable self, but did not bring anything special to the character. If it was not a George Clooney movie, I doubt I would even have heard about it.

But you are wrong! It's only a mirage, and the man gets back to his old ways in a split second. Now with a sad look on his face though. So without the passion that characterized the first few minutes, he continues traveling and he travels, and travels<br/><br/>On the flip side, you get to see many aerial views of USA cities.

"antoinebachmann","4","1","1","17 June 2015"," Totally un-surprising, rather boring
","So George Clooney, for once, is a bad guy: he flies from city to city, and each day he does the dirty job of firing people, so that the HR people don't have to do it. He has a huge experience and knows how to manipulate everyone so they don't negotiate, protest, you name it. A real bad guy.<br/><br/>Of course he has no time for any life. So he lies to himself that this is his life, and wouldn't want to be married, have children and all. Says he is happy occasionally seeing the same woman. Totally classical, totally un-surprising plot. Very boring.<br/><br/>As time goes by, and because he gets influenced by a new hire perhaps, he starts thinking a bit more than usual, about whether it might not be nice to marry one day perhaps. So at one point he tries his luck surprising his lover at home - only to find that she is married with children, and he is just her toy boy. Again, totally expected, un-surprising, boring plot.<br/><br/>So well what can he do, he goes on with his life. Of course there is still a small nice side to him, so he writes a superb recommendation letter for the new hire, so that after several weeks of firing people with him in many cities, she can finally get a real, noble job.<br/><br/>The acting is boring. Booooring. Clooney is supposed to be surprising in a role where he is not a good-looking doctor, or a good-looking and fun thief, but a bad guy - but he's not that good at it. The young new hire is OK but also rather boring. The lover is probably doing the best job but is not seen enough.<br/><br/>The photography is dull, of course it's probably by design? But it's still rather dull. Except perhaps some close-ups on the people getting fired.<br/><br/>And really, the story is so un-surprising, weak, that it's difficult to bear until the end without going preferring to go to the fridge for some ice-cream, or just zap to another movie."

Vera Famirga i wouldn't say, I liked her role but she looks gorgeous in this film, i don't know if it's just me but there's something with her in this movie.

"bkoganbing","7","1","1","27 January 2015"," Lack of commitment
","Seeing the character that George Clooney plays in Up In The Air reminds me of George Peppard in The Carpetbaggers. If you remember Jonas Cord was flying all over creation in his private plane developing and supervising his many enterprises. Just like Clooney here, Peppard had some deep seated issues about settling down even though unlike Clooney he was already married.<br/><br/>Clooney has an interesting job that really keeps him moving. He works for a firm that specializes in aiding fired workers make a transition. I can testify myself that getting fired can be traumatic. In my case though my firing lasted two months and I went back to my old job and stayed there until retirement.<br/><br/>Clooney's boss Jason Bateman has him going all over the country. He says that he spent only about 43 days in his sparse apartment in Omaha. It really is sparse the various hotel rooms look more homey. But a woman who also spends a lot of time traveling on her job Vera Famiga and a woman who is being trained by Clooney, Anna Kendrick help him see that maybe his life and lack of commitment isn't the best thing for him.<br/><br/>Nor is his stated goal of gaining 10 million frequent flier miles. He spends so much time in the air that all the airline personnel on all the airlines know him on a first name basis. That's one significant accomplishment. Maybe Clooney should have taken up with a stewardess.<br/><br/>The characters are drawn well in this script which got one of several Academy Award nominations, in this case for adapted screenplay. Up In The Air also got Academy recognition for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Clooney, Best Actress for Famigia, and Best Supporting Actress for Kendrick. I thought Kendrick was especially good as the young lady who sees a career treadmill she doesn't like and gets off.<br/><br/>Up In The Air is an intelligent and modern comedy with some characters I think we can all identify with."

His boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) forces him to show Keener the ropes.<br/><br/>Clooney and Farmiga have a fun cerebral chemistry. They flirt well together. It's too bad that they can't be on screen more often. Kendrick is great at playing the uptight cute girl. She has a good fun mentor relationship with Clooney. It has some funny moments. The best is when the three leads finally get together. Kendrick in that scene is hilarious. Jason Reitman deftly handles these three characters beautifully. I'm not as enamored with the wedding section. It comes after Kendrick having such great scenes and then she's gone. Farmiga is back but the wedding takes too much attention away from her. The movie reaches a high point with the three leads coming together. I think the movie should have kept up that pace and the wedding took some of the steam out."

Poor George Clooney worked his acting/looks/talent butt off to make this lot work, but with two of possibly the most unappealing female co-stars in Hollywood to work with, the charisma was all his and the first 40 minutes of the script. Then I think the script writer ran out of clues, humour and forgot why he was writing and went out and got drunk. The two female co-stars... please never let me see them act again. From plain to plain whiny, with insipid oozing from every pore. I can only imagine what good editing and two good co-stars may have made this sad little one-winged bird of a movie... I think it could have been great but by the time they headed into the land of weddings and running out of an opportunity to give the talk of a lifetime to include sentiment, schmaltz and sheer stupidity, I was past throwing popcorn at the screen and cursing the liars who'd given the thing great stars and ratings and the liars of the century."

","I found plenty to like in the film, up to about the last 10 minutes. (spoiler) We learn that Alex, Ryan's female love interest, through all of her romancing and her seemingly sincere 'down home, family ways' during the wedding they attend together, has been a huge fake, with a husband and children in Chicago. So Ryan, who was already through a transition from cold-and-on-the-road to relationship-ready, decides not to change after all, and stay on the road. If I were writing, Alex would have had a child at home (no husband), concealing that fact because she feared that Ryan wouldn't find her attractive. Finding that out, Ryan (being so much less superficial now) would have found that OK - even more charming, actually, and we could have had a happy ending that resolved with people actually changing for the better. Instead they opted to leave us with the unsatisfying 'I've been duped by a fake character' trick and ducked out with the cheap trick ending. Bad move."

","How to be sympathetic towards a man who fires people for a living? Well, there is just no way. It's a dirty job, someone has to do it, or so it is stated, but that doesn't mean you should make him a main character in a big film with George Clooney. If you do choose to do it, don't make him this sympathetic, as if this man is some kind of saint... But that's just me, I guess. Having said that, I did stay interested in how he did his work and how the 'new way' would or would not work, and, of course, how the rookie would or would not pull things off.<br/><br/>And the film is certainly enjoyable in other respects; Clooney and Farmiga play well and newcomer (for me anyway) Anna Kendrick is a true revelation in this comedy that never becomes a 'laugh-out-loud' production, but is rather subtle and gentle, and at times I was even reminded of 'The Office' (you know, the - US - series); certain scenes likes the party-crash and the wedding had almost a documentary feel to them, and I liked that. The aerial photography is simply eye candy. All of this is topped off with a really nice soundtrack, so the only thing wrong with it... I mentioned that earlier.<br/><br/>The twist (she's married) came as a surprise to me, and was an interesting one. But then the ending seems to be saying: 'find someone to partner up with, or you'll be miserable and lonely at the end of your life'... which is such a relative thing if you take a good look at real life.<br/><br/>Let's make it 6 out of 10, because all in all 'Up in the Air' is worth a watch."

","Many touches of real life in today's world are arranged very well in this film. Moreover, they are very relevant -- you could be like Clooney, locked in his way of solitary life and withholding his twisted philosophy about work versus life, both engineered by the treads of corporate responsibilities and traveling; or you could be like Vera's, a female version of Clooney (I can imagine a powerful female CEO) with a twisted, sly way of fulfilling her needs of escape; or Anna's, a naive young smart employee who finds herself, after stepping into the world of career focus and all, eventually confused with the real world versus her ideals; or simply any one of those employees where the possibility of getting let go is uncertain. It is one of those films that serves as a reminder or where you will feel a whole lot wiser after watching it. The only few flaws are i.e. Vera's willingness to be his date for the wedding (which may place her reputation in grave danger), crash parties? (the orgy boat scene is over the top, i mean they are in the middle of work not holidaying), Anna's acceptance into a company (which she herself rejected earlier) just by a recommendation letter?? that is total bullshit that does not work anymore in a world of fierce competition, strict bureaucracies, over-qualifications and vast unemployment."

It looks good, the script is decent, and any film with George Clooney has to be at least mostly good. He is one of the great actors of our time. And the ""twist"" was predictable yet redeeming to such a standard romance. Heck, I even appreciated the political message of what it is like to be unemployed.<br/><br/>But I found the mix of comedy and drama to fail, especially because the drama was so boring compared with the comedy. The balance was off. A few good moments -- with Sam Elliott and Young MC -- did not make up for the lazy romance, Anna Kendrick's atrocious acting, or the awful soundtrack.<br/><br/>I still have to give it a good rating because, heck, it is still a good movie.

And just because he's been named the most handsome man in the world (NOT) all his movies highlight his lack of personality on the screen. <br/><br/>I finally watched this one on TV last nite and I'm always hoping this time it'll be a good movie but after sitting in front of the TV waiting for something interesting to happen, well it never does in George's movies.

","A very strange film that proposes no way out in the crisis situation which is part of everyday life in the USA: firing and getting fired. Today quite a few businesses have outsourced the processing of these firing procedures. So a business specialized in firing people comes into the picture to do it properly, to make limbos presentable and hell palatable, heaven-like if you want, with some nice words and a lot of mind manipulation.<br/><br/>These professional firers are plane people who can fly nearly 320 days a year and spend exactly 7 times 24 hours boarding planes in one year. They have very strict requirements about traveling light and traveling on light and flexible wheels. Home is airports all over the USA, some day all over the world. And they learn how to live with light sushi, and accepting or refusing a ""cancer"" when the stewardess proposes them ""a can, sir"".<br/><br/>They thus learn how to wrap up horror and death on a slow fire and so many other evils in the shiny suits of rebirth, a new beginning, an opportunity to excel in a new field of creativity. They forget the suffering they are going to create or even the death they are peddling day after day, be it jumping from a bridge, or slow poisoning on alcohol, or just triggering some fire arm.<br/><br/>But on the other side the younger ones out of Cornell University or some other high-rise higher education schools are just developing a new technique based on the Internet and communication tools and technologies to dehumanize firing by making direct contact, even be it only eye contact, impossible since two screens, two cameras, two mikes, two modems and a telephone line are between the firer and the firee. That's what they are told and taught in these deluxe schools that can wrap any crap in gold to make us think it is a nugget or a piece of chocolate.<br/><br/>But Clooney brings another dimension in his airport ever perambulating home: that is to say just not being alone. Of course in those terminals and in those planes you can always find some human contact, be it purely professional and paid for, or be it some person casually met in a bar or restaurant, or for the more deprived be it only a chambermaid, or as for that a chamber-""valet"" or plain janitor. But he shows us how at one moment in this life the traveler will want some more permanent or regular contact and meeting. But that is nothing but an appearance meeting an appearance and hell it is for the one who believes this appearance, on this side or on the other side, is the real thing. Harder will the fall be, and harder is the fall.<br/><br/>A small film showing the total artificiality and somewhere absurdity of that civilization based on transience and mobility and rootless-ness and professional distance and non-empathy.

"tnrcooper","6","1","1","14 November 2010"," Sum not as good as the whole of the parts
","So Ivan Reitman is a very talented director. The film has a lot of good lines. If someone can make you empathize with someone whose job it is to fire people, you wouldn't be surprised that George Clooney was that person. Vera Farmiga as Alex Goran is exceptional and takes full advantage of the rare role for a woman over 35 who is not simply a bitter, lovelorn woman or simply a woman who is simply a woman married to her career. She has a fantastic, nuanced part and she takes full advantage of it. Anna Kendrick is excellent as bright, naive recent Ivy league grad Natalie Kenner. The supporting cast, including Melanie Lynnskey, Amy Morton, Jason Bateman, and Danny McBride are excellent. The subject material is topical. The soundtrack is great. There are some great one-liners. <br/><br/>And yet...and yet...in spite of these wonderful attributes, I found myself very disappointed in some aspects of this film. The use of the images of real people reacting to their termination seemed in some ways exploitative and even if this is only a minor critique, I don't know how this makes the film any more real. The film is not real. It's why we watch. Personally I was not comforted to see pictures of my fellow Americans showing how they felt at being fired (newsflash: it sucks!). <br/><br/>I found the didacticism of the conversations between Clooney's and Kendrick's characters cloying and naive. I found the notion that Clooney was so detached from his family, considering that he is the same character who counsels Kendrick that she shouldn't expect a lot of understanding from people who are being fired, a little difficult to take. Yes, Clooney's character is obviously a lone wolf to some degree, but he seems to have an exceptionally light touch with people and it seems hard to believe he is so remote from his family. If he enjoys the road, well, more power to him. Also if Reitman wishes to make the point that marriage is more desirable than the single life, he then undercuts his point when he counterposes Jack's living the footloose and fancy- free single life against that of his sister Kara (Amy Morton) who is in a trial separation from her husband. They are depicted in stark contrast initially, but ultimately, it would seem that her decision has not necessarily been for the best.<br/><br/>I found the tired preachiness of the counsel that Bingham should connect more with people simply a more polished version of more hackneyed counsel that one might see in less sophisticated, more mainstream fare. It might be more polished, but it's the same old preachiness simply wrapped up in a new package. In the same vein, the metaphor of the backpack which Bingham finally rejects (reminding me of the scene in ""Traffic"" when Michael Douglas as drug czar is unable to stomach delivering his own canned speech one more time, finding it doesn't mesh with the thorniness of real-world problems) seemed similarly preachy. Reitman has a wonderful ear for razor-sharp humor and dialogue, but his naivety (in ""Juno"" he seems not to understand the seriousness of a teen having a child) is on full display here in his hackneyed counsel about relationships. Ultimately I found this film disappointing because in spite of Reitman's obvious and prodigious gifts as a director, his naivety undoes him."

","It was good until the wedding part. Before this I wasn't really thinking about the movie, because til that point it was straightforward entertainment, a comedy with maybe a slight romantic twist and a touch of drama.<br/><br/>Then came this fairly drastic change of tone and my mind started wandering. I began to really think about the movie, scenario, characters and the fact that once again comes a highly praised Hollywood movie where I can't seem to connect with anyone.<br/><br/>I started wondering if the movie itself turned sour, or is it just me who doesn't understand what's going on. Then I had a piffany with Clooney when he was giving his pep talk to a guy having doubts about his future as a married man. <br/><br/>It struck me that the movie seems to take for granted that you are not happy with your life and that most people are craving for something that they don't have. It assumes that you need to have some kind of an adventure or danger all the time to feel alive. If you are happy or content with your life, you are probably a cheater or otherwise senseless. To me it's pretty depressing.<br/><br/>But.. there would be nothing wrong if the movie actually made a point about any of these things. We have movies like American Beauty which really are social commentary, while on the other hand we have movies like this which are disguised as feel good entertainment. You cannot be 100 % sure if it's a big commercial for, well, a couple of hotels, airlines and car rentals, but also the American way of life.<br/><br/>Actually this whole movie and it's success (best movie of the year nomination, really?) got me really confused. I've felt the same with a lot of Hollywood movies lately. Most of the characters actions and thoughts were well beyond me. Were they meant to be jokes, social criticism or thoughts that people can connect with, I truly don't know.<br/><br/>The movie is not all bad, it's well made (altho some characters seem to come and go pretty arbitrarily), well performed, funny and hits a few thoughts here and there. It's propably the context as a whole that I have difficulties swallowing."

","Yet again, George Clooney plays the devilishly good looking old-ish man, who can pretty much get into any girls' bed, but will never find the one he will settle down with, it's Doug Ross all over again! This movie wasn't good, it probably got a lot more praise than it should, but then again, what else was around when this movie was released? Twilight? Avatar? The movie wasn't excellent, and probably wouldn't raise too many eyebrows, but it isn't like a torture chamber, like Twilight was, and it was sort of original, which Avatar really wasn't.<br/><br/>It really is a pity, because George Clooney is really a great actor, I believe he really is one of the last 'actors' around, these days, they only reason men go into showbiz is for the sex and for the love of making sequel after sequel of the same crappy movie.<br/><br/>Good Night, Good Luck and The Good German is proof enough that George really is a great actor, but the world will forever see him as Doug Ross.<br/><br/>Final review, 7/10, it's good, without setting any hearts on fire though."

","Oh boy, another Clooney movie to show off that fake and overused ""cute"" smile of his (which I sometimes find myself mistaking for a nervous tick). Now, don't get me wrong, Clooney can sometimes force out a good performance, but one can only do so much with a character who's depth is dwarfed only by his 23 year old ""life virgin"" supporting character who tries to muster the odd half cocked rant to possibly stir up some sort of emotion from the half asleep audience.<br/><br/>At least there was one solid character in this movie, Alex, who somehow has us (the ""unsuspecting"" audience) feeling ""sorry"" for poor Ryan for getting a taste of his own medicine. I found myself feeling more sorry for Clooney himself for playing such a lifeless role, than for getting his character's ego stomped by the ideals he's lived by his entire lack of existence thus far.<br/><br/>And if it weren't hard enough to sit through the monotonous and terribly acted ""firing"" scenes throughout out the movie, they play MORE at the end as if the director thought they were well done? I mean do I really want to watch underpaid actors trying to audition for a crying scene? I could almost feel myself in the casting director's shoes screening for these actors, leaning over to the producer and saying ""lets just pick these ones, then we can up-size our rooms to the jacuzzi suites for the entire shoot, no-one will notice""... I mean how can anyone take it serious enough to feel one iota of emotion for these people? <br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie going into it, which for a terribly done chick flick is usually a good thing, but this one left such a void in my life that I continue to lament the 108 minutes that it has taken from me, a day later.<br/><br/>*GONG* <br/><br/>I've been seeing movies loyally for 20 years, and they do this to me?<br/><br/>Do they understand what they did to me for almost two hours? <br/><br/>What would my children think if I went to this movie? <br/><br/>How can I face my wife after seeing it? <br/><br/>I think I am going to go jump off a bridge."
"trescia-1","10","5","12","27 December 2009"," Another Great Film About Men
","There are are a lot of movies out there about machismo. About a million of them. But there are very few about masculinity, and only a few of them are really good. The thing is, these films are difficult to review because people tend to get emotional about them. They hit us where we live. Men (and women) just get all worked up about them. They cause normally reasonable people to go all weird. <br/><br/>The most recent examples of the genre are ""There Will Be Blood,"" ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Up in the Air."" These are movies that explore the dark side of masculinity with flinching. They illustrate aspects of being male that have been, almost always, glossed over with macho nonsense. They explore what it means to be masculine.<br/><br/>What makes ""Up in the Air"" different from most other films of this type is that it is very, very NOW and features a lot of cool technology. But the story is the same in that it is about what is going on inside the mind of a man--in this case a man who has found a new way to to be an isolated, alienated man. He's found a home en route to somewhere else. He is perpetually going somewhere. So much so that his home is in the air.<br/><br/>This is not so different from other men who choose to live as ""lone wolves"" but in his case he's managed to integrate it into a high-paying career. What a country! But the film is not about how a guy can just travel all the time on the company dime, it's about being a predator and living, literally, like a wolf and loving every minute of it. As my wife said, it's the ""hunter thing"" again. Guys like to hunt alone and kill stuff. Is it really so surprising that the guy in this movie likes to travel alone and ""terminate"" people? The fundamental question-- ""what is home?"" is asked again and again. As the film develops, it becomes clear that a man is only as stable as his home--whatever that may be--and if you throw a man out of his home--even if it is in the air--even the ""coolest customer"" may panic and behave irrationally until the ""stable home (in the air)"" is restored.<br/><br/>A masterwork, highly recommended. But not for kids. In fact, I wonder if you really need some gray hair and to be a little condescending to younger people to really ""get"" this movie.<br/><br/>Sorry if that sounds condescending..."

Why would someone plop down $8.50 to see a film about a guy who racks up air miles and fires people? You can go to the airport or financial district and see that for free. You have George Clooney in the main character role doing his usual leading actor thing, that is basically the same thing he does in all his films. A word of advice to your career George...bust out break out of this leading man role prison that you and your representation have sculpted for you. The Alex Goran character played by Vera Farmiga was very likable and funny, but although her character pops in and out of this film, it still doesn't make it fly.

"moviesleuth2","7","4","9","20 December 2009"," Terrific Adult film
","""Up in the Air"" is a rarity; a film specifically aimed at adults. The content and maturity level are aimed at people in the business world. There are no unique special effects or sound ques to alert those who wouldn't otherwise get the joke or understand the dialogue to get the picture. While that may eliminate the most lucrative audience (teenage boys), for those in the film's target range, it makes it more special and fulfilling.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a man whose job is to go all around the country and ""assist companies in transitioning their clients."" In his words, he's the guy bosses hire to fire their employees. Ryan spends about 90% of the year either in a plane or in a hotel room, and that's just the way he likes it; this eliminates his need for companionship. But when a new employee, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) develops a new way to fire employees over the internet, he shows her the ropes in order to avoid having to go home to an empty apartment. However, she opens his eyes to why human companionship may actually be really worth it, and he begins a romance with a fellow full-time traveler, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga).<br/><br/>This is a standard order romantic comedy/drama. Plotwise, there are no real surprises, so in order to fill up the void, the film must rely on smart dialogue and terrific performances. ""Up in the Air"" has both. The characters are richly developed, and some scenes are laugh-aloud funny.<br/><br/>This is easily George Clooney's best performance; another Oscar nomination is a given fact, and a second win certainly isn't out of the question. Clooney has a reputation for playing guys who do their own thing, regardless of whether it makes sense (or is legal). Ryan Bingham is no different, but Clooney works hard to add a few more dimensions to his character, and it works. Anna Kendrick is wholly believable as the Ivy League yuppie who opens his eyes to why staying single and alone maybe isn't the best thing. She also opens some of the film's funniest sequences. Vera Farmiga is also great as the woman whom Ryan begins a romance with. Clooney and Farmiga have terrific chemistry together, and co-writer/director Jason Reitman develops their relationship slowly and carefully. With romances where circumstances require the lovebirds to be away from each other for most of the picture, we only really want them to end up together in the end because the movie tells us to. This is not the case here. Once Ryan figures out that he really does want someone to spend the rest of his life with, the film focuses on the relationship between Ryan and Alex. This romance, which has already begun to burn is now allowed to catch fire and burn up the screen.<br/><br/>The only real problem with the film is the ending. The film throws a one-two punch at the viewer, and while it's not typical, it's been done before. Sometimes this kind of ending can work, but I'm not sure it does here.<br/><br/>Still, ""Up in the Air"" is a wonderful film and highly recommended for corporate world adults."

"sashank_kini-1","10","3","6","26 June 2012"," Timeless Treasure
","Ryan Bingham's tricky job involves trimming any additional fat ('fat' here synonimizing employees) from companies; he spends nearly three-quarters of the year travelling via air, dropping off at various locations to occupy one of the two seats in an isolated room, the other being alternated by the unfortunate workers who are to be sacked. His skill involves handling the situation tactfully and ensuring that they get the booklet that supposedly will bring them hope. And he is certainly a pro at his job, oscillating between multiple offices and seminar rooms to deliver his trademark 'baggage' lecture. He believes in 'advancing' at all times, and therefore rejects the prospect of marriage and family. His sister bluntly tells him that he doesn't even exist to them (the family). But Ryan seems contented with his lifestyle, and can't help dishing out his philosophy to anyone he meets. <br/><br/>This egoistic ways of Ryan are punctuated by the arrival of two women who unconsciously bring a marked change in him. Natalie Keener is a young, sweet, confidant girl who has been recently absorbed into the company Ryan works in. She impresses the company's owner Craig Gregory with her cost-cutting idea of conducting the termination process via web-chat, something that irks Ryan for two reasons: (i) it seems crude and impractical and (ii) it would ground him to a place (of course, he doesn't disclose this personal reason to Craig). Craig instructs Ryan to take Natalie along with him and teach her the tricks of the trade. While journeying with the tyro, Ryan's initial animosity gradually depletes and it also acts as catalysis for his change. Natalie on the other hand is impresses with his convincing skills while rubbishes his bulls—t philosophy. The other woman is Alex Goran, a woman possibly in her thirties who indulges in sexual liaisons with Ryan and isn't squeamish about expressing her fervent hunger for lust. She can be called the female counterpart of Ryan as both seem to share not just similar opinions, but also similar gestures, facial expressions and movements. With Natalie's help, Ryan momentarily sees his life in a new light with Alex until his visit to her home.<br/><br/>Prior to seeing the film, one assumes it to be a love triangle between the three characters from a glance at the poster. After watching the movie, one is very impressed with the outcome of Ryan's character while is disgusted by Alex's selfish behavior. Only with subsequent viewings can people truly appraise the true wealth the film possesses. Roger Ebert says laconically: the movie is about our times. I would instead say the movie is timeless, just like those grey-white clouds that hover above us as life goes. The most crucial question it puts up is: 'What is the point?' and ventures to search for an answer. The deeply philosophical and metaphysical concepts that it alludes to gradually leads to no concrete answer but makes us clearer about the essence of existence. Up In the Air does this without compromising on its mainstream appeal, thus making it accessible to all audiences. <br/><br/>The movie is set up in the financial downturns in America due to the surplus lending by financial institutions. When the economy collapsed, a majority of the 'surplus' employees were given the pink slip. The affected had their families and fiscal burdens to worry about, and their unemployment aggravated their misery. These victims are one of the four important characters of the film. The second is Ryan himself, whose immaculate career record and self-perception is derailed by two ladies. The third is Natalie, whose burgeoning career and youthful confidence is affected by harsh realities she witnesses. The fourth is Alex, a highly misunderstood character who is being denounced as a b-tch by some viewers. I'll tackle Alex first: listening to her interactions, it seems her reaction at the climatic sequence was a form of snappy self-defense that was caused by the love she has for her kids. In a previous scene, she seems to discourse her opinion on ideal marriage with hint of sadness in her tone. This maybe because she felt happier with someone like Ryan but didn't have the courage to leave an unhappy marriage; rather than antagonizing her, I pitied her fragility. Vera Farmiga brings out these shades in her character effortlessly; she creates this flawed woman without making her last scene one-dimensional. The second one I'll take is Natalie. Look at her opening act itself and you'll see the put-on self confidence in her character as she effectively tries to convince her seniors. In the office scene with Ryan and Craig, she again tries to maintain her composure when Ryan questions her but then her anxiety gets the better of her. A wonderful performance from Anna Kendrick (sorry but just can't watch those Twilight series of yours) who retains the girlish charm (Never. Ever?) while molding the important aspect of the character as well (which is to show maturation). Clooney was absolutely tailor-made for the role; he can give us a poignant and memorable character even with his handsome face and mischievous eyes better than contemporaries like Brad Pitt. It's great that he manages to represent the movie as his character without letting his star-power consuming the movie's value.<br/><br/>The last here I'd speak about are the fired employees. Despite the initial shock, they have their families to fall back upon. If Ryan Bingham has a fall, he has nobody to support him while Alex lives a perilous life that could potentially destroy her once the skeletons tumble out to everyone. In this case, only Natalie has the strongest chance among the three to build a life that would keep her happy and financially secure. The montage of the fired employees towards the end suggest living a stable life, down on the ground. The movie says: it's your life. Would you be up in the air, above all, or down on the ground, with all?"
"iheart_ny","10","3","6","26 May 2010"," Definitely a film for the times.
","In movies recently, American audiences are fed a lot of crap, frankly. We get the inevitable Saw VI, Alvin And the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel, and other tripe that American film goers seem to flock to. Rarely are we shown a movie that shows people for what they really are, and life, for what it really is, and even less frequently do audiences actually acknowledge it. And, for this holiday season, which is more or less a dumping ground for Oscar nominees and hopefuls, we are shown a bright, intelligent, fresh, witty, hilarious, yet depressing picture from some of the best in the business. That picture, my friends, is Up in the Air. <br/><br/>Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man named Ryan Bingham, a ""corporate downsizer"", who goes from town to boring town, to fire employees, for businesses who don't have the guts to do it themselves. He's never had a real human connection in his life until he meets another frequent flier named Alex, lovably played by Vera Farmiga, who showed real, gutsy, raw talent in the criminally overlooked horror flick Orphan, earlier this year. Alex shares a lot of emotional stamina with Ryan, they click almost instantly. The chemistry that these two actors share is worth the price of admission alone. <br/><br/>Later on, we meet an ambitious young worker named Natalie (a beautiful star turn by Anna Kendrick, who had a brief part in the Twilight movies), who has an idea to cut costs by conducting employee layoffs from the internet. <br/><br/>After so many films a director makes, something of a trademark begins to appear, and Jason Reitman has his trademark down. And it's not a bad trademark like other directors certainly have. He has a knack for making emotionally relevant, and hilarious, yet deeply poignant and insightful films that are extremely watchable, and separate themselves from the usual Hollywood dreck that we're so used to. <br/><br/>His last film, 2007's Oscar hopeful Juno did kind of the same thing. It gave us that salty- sweet combination, and a lot of memorable dialogue. I could only imagine what this picture would be had Juno's Diablo Cody written it. But Reitman, writing alongside Sheldon Turner, whose previous credits include 2005's remake The Longest Yard, which I didn't particularly care for. As I've said, the writing here is witty, hilarious, and completely realistic. <br/><br/>Up in the Air is a very timely picture as well. Its major themes are corporate downsizing, and budget cuts. There's a scene in the movie where Natalie's boyfriend breaks up with her over a text message, and that's something that I know well, and I'm sure everybody else does as well. It brings up issues about how impossible love is if you're a member of today's generation, and that's part of what makes this movie so exciting. <br/><br/>Up in the Air is a difficult movie to describe. It's not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, and there's romance, but it's by no means a romantic comedy, or a romantic ""dramedy"". There's triumph and tragedy, laughs, and tears. But what's so amazing to me about it, is how closely it relates to real life. It's real, and rewarding, and a movie I'd certainly recommend."

","Ryan walks into the classroom, sees Jim reading the Velveteen Rabbit. Ryan asks about Jim having second thoughts about marrying his sister Julie. Jim replies, "" I started thinking about the wedding and the ceremony, and then us buying a house, having a kid, another kid, Christmas and Thanksgiving, spring break, football games, then they get jobs, get married, and now I'm a grandparent, retired, losing my hair, getting fat, and then I'm dead. What's the point? What's the Point?"" Ryan stands there, doesn't know what to say. Ironically, he's a motivational speaker and preaches everything Jim just said. He tells people not to get married, but to live a more isolated and independent life.<br/><br/>The movie Up in the Air is a depressing comedy of sorts, I think their called dramedy's but I don't use words highlighted in red as soon as you type them. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a professional Terminator, who flies all around the country to fire people. He also works, as I mentioned, as a motivational speaker. He is Up in the Air (pun intended) for over 300 days a year. The airport terminals, the planes, the hotels, and even the employees who greet him with the same dull line every time he flies, has become Ryan's home. As he put it, to know Ryan one must fly with Ryan. However, for about 50 days a year, Ryan comes back to his other home in Omaha, Nebraska. It is here where his life is threatened when new employee Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) has a cost cutting idea of terminating people via web cam. Ryan points out the obvious flaws of the system, what if the employee walked out, he becomes violent, breaks the equipment, etc... but the boss (Jason Bateman) loves the cost cutting idea, and wants to give it a shot. He teams up Natalie with Ryan to educate her in the ways of Termination.<br/><br/>This is two learning experiences, as Natalie learns how deep and personal firing someone actually is, and about Ryan and his life of isolation, which she simply does not understand and does not want to even believe exists. Ryan, meanwhile, becomes more involved in Alex (Vera Farmiga), a fling who also flies around the country. Alex is, as she says, Ryan with a Vagina. Ryan begins to form a connection with these two, and begins to question his life of isolation.<br/><br/>The performances steal the show. George Clooney is charming as usual, but it's a deep performance. He is cold and distant, but through out the movie he learns that maybe his life of isolation isn't good for him, and there is this confused vulnerability to his character. Should he let these people in? Should he ignore them? Vera Farmiga is very strong as Alex, there was great chemistry between George and Vera throughout the whole movie, and Vera does not back down one bit. The repartee between the two was really something to behold, you just don't see it anymore. Anna Kendrick almost steals the movie. She is hilarious, but her character is not a joke. Natalie is determined, strong, smart, but the most vulnerable of all the characters. Just coming out of college with a psychology major, she had this grand plan and her life was going to be perfect, but life is never perfect. Anna plays the part beautifully, she hits all the notes. When Natalie is first there she has this peppy positive outlook, and then she gets kicked in the face by reality, but remains strong.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman, who wrote and directed this, deserves as much praise as the actors. These are his characters and he tuned the actors to play the parts perfectly, something I feel is forgotten about directing. The tone was, I thought, worked beautifully with the film. The very first scene, a man is getting fired, doesn't know what to do, and Ryan gives him packet, and says ""Anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it."" Immediately the guy feels optimistic about him being let go, doesn't know if everything will work out, but it has a chance to work out. This film takes us down the exact path, a dark tunnel with a light at the end, and this is where the film takes the most criticism, The end.<br/><br/>I won't give away to much, but you might be like a lot of other people, and feel as though you were fooled. I can understand where people are coming from, and I'd agree to a certain extent. The film does trick you, but I felt as though it gave me clues about the trick through out the entire film. The trick, works for some, and doesn't work for others.<br/><br/>You should see Up in the Air. You might be left with this bitter taste in your mouth, but it's still worth a taste, and you might really enjoy it."
"dsa_ca","6","3","6","29 January 2010"," 'Up in the air' sweeps across America and fleets away
","Jason Reitman is a wonderful director and one of my favorites. He can take on the most serious of issues and turn it around to make us smile and enjoy a movie about the issue without deviating away from reality. He has managed this with Juno and one should appreciate the morals of his story telling that however flawed the characters of his movie are from the outside for the society, there is simmering humanity in all of them. Jason has brought the same style of storytelling back in his latest 'Up in the Air'.<br/><br/>'Up in the Air' is about Ryan Bigham played by George Clooney, who is a downsizing expert, which in today's corporate job scenario means Satan's messenger. His job is to travel around the country to various corporate offices firing workers on behalf of their employers. He lives a life in a suitcase and travels across the country for almost the entire year. Due to which he has a fractured relationship with his near ones which in this case are his sisters. But he cherishes his life away from home and has a playful time flying in the air counting his record touching flying hours across United States.<br/><br/>As opposite to leading a lonely life, he actually relishes the idea of meeting new people and has a transnational love affair with a fellow frequent flier 'Alex' played by Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>Things start to unravel when his company hires a rookie with an innovative idea 'Natalie', who succeeds in selling her idea of firing people across the country through web conference calls. Anna Kendrick's 'Natalie' comes out as arrogant and she is of the opinion that there is no humane way of firing someone hence the company should not bother about the human factor about their jobs. This new idea becomes a confrontational point between the Company Boss Jason Bateman along with Natalie and Ryan who now is assigned to take Natalie on a cross country tour displaying her company's job profile i.e. firing other employees. How the experience of their jobs affects these characters is what forms the rest of movie. Well Almost!<br/><br/>'Up in the Air' starts well and has an innovative way of telling stories. His usual first character narration is solidly given by Mr. Clooney, but the topical issue of corporate downsizing needed a touch of reality which Jason provides by casting real employees who have lost their job during the economic meltdown. Viewers are able to feel the eventual guilt in the characters eyes about their job profile.<br/><br/>But the movie at its rear end loses its credibility and drifts away from the central topic to focus on Ryan's personal story. His sudden about turn at the airport to go at his sister's wedding along with a date with Alex is filmed with excruciating detail that covers third-fourth of the movie's final reel. The movie fails to lift itself away from a sudden Romantic comedy drift to end the movie with a certain incomplete agenda. Jason fails to conclude anything substantial from his story other than the conclusion of the movie's romantic track, which also shows some shocking predictable sequence.<br/><br/>'Up in the Air' can be said to be Mr. Reitman's most real movie to date after the dark and sarcastic 'Thank You for smoking' and the sugary coated 'Juno'. But it fails to elevate itself to be a movie of any social importance."

","There is a dangerous to adaptations, especially when some of the substance is left behind; then there's the issue of casting choices... ""Up in The Air"" has been receiving plenty of critical attention for what it has to offer. As a member of the paying audience, I have to go in with raised expectations and run into the dangerous situation of being disappointed by overzealous professional reviews. In the case of ""Up in The Air"", I fell into the ""wish I had seen the same movie... category."" For starters, there seems to be a perception that if a movie is neither a comedy or a straight drama, it is special. Take away some of the lighting or underexpose the film, and now we have a serious movie. Throw in some clever dialog, and you are hitting high marks. Well, unfortunately, a good movie should connect with us in the audience, as it delivers its message and connects to our universal truths. It's hard for me to sympathize with any of the characters of the film, except for those at the end of the firing squad, and they become a bit monotonous half way through the film.<br/><br/>Clooney plays the jaded business type, who for most of the film gets by with its suave demeanor. Other than his business suit, I found him hard to believe, especially as the type who wants to prove others that he might have the answers. There are moments of brilliance in his performance, in the last 10 minutes, as revelations become clear to him, but I couldn't see any other person but the star, most of the time. Unlike Harrison Ford, who doesn't resort to make up or major costume changes to create new characters, Clooney appears one dimensional most of the time. Then there is the Alex character, played with wonderful depth and richness by the amazing Vera Farmiga. She is the total opposite of Clooney, rich, sensual, mysterious, powerful, and very determined, played with such perfection that the twist at the end is solid, not ever feeling like a cheat.<br/><br/>The film tries hard to reach the heights of ""Juno"", a much clever and better written, directed, and developed presentation of the complex nature of people's behavior. The film is a series of events loosely connected by a trio of characters, never really explaining what makes them tick, and it tries to convince us that we know something by them uttering a few key lines in the big scenes, to ""reveal"" their motivations.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a small film that might have been better shown in more detailed complexity, as s TV series, with more developed, better presented situations to give us a clearer picture of where these people have been, where they're going, and what their most likely outcome will be. Somehow, the only thing clear is that the package must be sold, and Clooney makes for some great, first impression, but the box is unfortunately, half empty, and most of the stuff that is missing is the stuff that really matters."

","you hope it's going to be a movie as good as this one.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman puts together a superb cast, a polished production crew and some terrific writing, cannily, with a film premiering at a time when 10% of the American workforce is without a job. It's a movie about a ""terminator,"" a man who is employed for difficult situations when someone needs to be fired. It's a lucrative profession, and Ryan Bingham (another sensational performance by George Clooney) loves his work. Not only does it afford him a life in travel, but he has the notion that he cares for the people he's employed to fire, letting them down easy so they don't gopostal.<br/><br/>While the performances are perfection, it's the screenplay that shines. Without apology, it meanders over and through (deeply in some cases) many aspects of modern life, scoring bulls-eyes each time. One part of the film is a romantic comedy, another a treatise on how to tolerate a difficult coworker, but it all adds up to the toll that modern life has taken on our emotional lives, effectively neutering all feeling and interpersonal joy for the good of the ""the company."" And as soon as you become irrelevant, you're tossed out and left with a packet of instructions on how to put your life back together againon your own, someplace else.<br/><br/>While the audience may be ahead of the script in some instances, how it's all played is just off center enough that every twist is enjoyable. Clooney gets amazing support from Vera Farmiga, a seductress who makes you believe you're doing the seducing, and Anna Kendrick as a thick-headed youngster who we watch both learn a few things about living as well as teaching her elders about what is really valuable at the end of a workday.

","This is a film full of characters that I absolutely despise in real life. I still watched it though, as I currently have no life and was reeeeeeally bored. Yes, I see the irony in that, as it is about people without a life laying other people off. This film is a self-fulfilling prophecy that way, as watching it will make its purpose come full circle. If George Clooney would have come up to me and said any line which he says in the movie, I would have punched him square in the face. You probably would have to out of reflex, if you have any dignity. Anna Kendrick's character acts like nothing but a helpless strumpet in this film, and Vera Farmiga's character is just bitter, uninteresting, hollow and miserable. There is nothing likable about any of these characters or even any of the environments they lay about in. Even the parties they go to in this film are miserable. I mean, the entertainment for the party is named Young MC. Who in the name of holy f*** would ever applaud anything called Young MC? They all talk like people I hate, they all look like people I hate and they all act like people other more consistent people usually would f*** in prison. There is nothing successful about these elitist misguided people. If I ever end up like one of them, I honestly pray to God that someone will throw me off a bridge. What in the lord's name is the point of this movie? Is it a warning? Is it the wake-up call George Clooney is referring to?"

","Why did I like this film? I'm trying to get my head around what exactly made this film so lovable. Was it the romance, the drama or the comedy?<br/><br/>An intriguing characteristic of this movie is that it doesn't seem to really find itself in any specific category of film. It's neither a romcom nor a drama....it's just a story. However to simplify this film is failing to do it justice, especially to a film packed with complex moral undertones and nuances of ever-growing characters, both which create a solid foundation for Clooney's brilliant performance. The characters are all flawed thus relatable and the story is told with such flair and pace that one never seems bored.<br/><br/>I offer perhaps a biased view when it comes to George Clooney – as I tend not to take him wholly seriously, and, for this reason was somewhat dumbfounded by the way he showed he does indeed possess an all-round acting talent – I guess reaffirming that what he achieved in Michael Clayton was not a total fluke! Clooney begins 'Up in the Air' showcasing his typical brand of performance that we have grown to associate him with, contributing to the first 25 minutes resembling an extended version of his recent 'Nespresso' adverts – of course once you watch the film, you'll see that there is nothing wrong with this as it fits the bill of Ryan Bingham rather well. As the story progresses you witness an incredible transformation in the acting; with Clooney slipping from the perfect man to a lost soul in the most subtlest of ways, subtle in a way that makes it believable. <br/><br/>Finally the supporting cast is much more than supporting and there's no surprise that Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick have been nominated for Golden Globes in this category. Neither is it any coincidence that all the best/memorable scenes involve the character of Natalie Keener – who, ultimately gives 'Up in the Air' the necessary X-Factor to be Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>8.4/10"

","I attended an industry screening in LA on Nov 24, a small group, 30-40 people. I was surprised by the lack of excitement at the end of the screening. It didn't seem like anyone was bowled over with the film. I enjoyed it, always enjoy George Clooney, and I think he did an excellent job on this film, particularly when he portrayed some vulnerability. I didn't particularly care for the two female leads. Competent actresses, but I didn't spark to them or their characters. I enjoyed the plot and appreciated how the subject matter fit into today's economy even though based on a book and with a script that was written prior to the economic free-fall. I guess I just expected to SUPER LOVE this film, and I merely liked it. Maybe on second viewing, I will like it more. So far, Thank You For Smoking remains my favorite Jason Reitman film.

","hmmm I'm a bit confused right now cos I may be posting this review for the wrong movie. This one is about Up In the Air, starring George Clooney. I have a feeling this is not the same film that most other reviewers saw.<br/><br/>This one is about a corporate American dude whose job is to basically tell people they are fired, in a way that leads to as little drama as possible. Apparently it's a job that pays pretty well, and also requires him to travel around the country from firm to firm. Now of course this lifestyle isn't really conducive to having a settled family and kids - unless you are interested in living a dual life - one on the road and one at home.<br/><br/>OK, so does this film tell you anything you don't already know? Nope, nada. Fair enough, but there are many classy movies without an interesting message that can still entertain you for 2 hours. Is this one of those? Not a chance. Nothing and nobody interesting or engaging.<br/><br/>Work sucks. Working as a professional in America sucks big time - in the air or on the ground.<br/><br/>If I had a job like that, I'd be with a different woman every night. One needs their escape.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 and I'm in a generous mood."
"TheExpatriate700","7","3","7","4 January 2010"," A Good Black Comedy
","On the whole, Up in the Air is a good dark comedy about the financial crisis and the corporate world in general, in particular its production of a peculiar, airborne life style.<br/><br/>The film benefits from strong casting and, for the most part, good writing. George Clooney turns in another excellent performance, while Vera Farmiga's turn should cement her stardom, as she gives a sultry yet complex performance. Her magnetism and charisma are among the high points of the movie. All the major actors make their characters believable.<br/><br/>However, in its last third, Up in the Air suffers from an attempt to impose a moral on a dark comedy, blunting its satiric edge just as it should be plunging the knife in for the kill. More importantly, the personality shifts in certain characters are less than believable, and seem designed more to convey a ""good"" message than out of faith to the story.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film is well worth seeing, and stands out in a film season known for overly sentimental fare."

","Up in the Air, based on the book written by Walter Kirn, is a solid masterpiece and my favorite movie of the year. It perfectly shows how our economy is affecting people's lives.<br/><br/>The film follows Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) a man who works for a company that other companies around the world hire to let go their employees. So he has to fly all around the country to do his job. His main goal in life is to be the 7th person ever to get 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles. Then, a young woman named Natalie (Anna Kendrick)who works for the company brings up an idea to Ryan's boss, saying that it would be easier for them to fire people using video chat. This, of course, upsets Ryan, as this will mean he won't be able to get his 10,000,000 miles. He brings up to his boss that he doesn't think it's a good idea, he is then allowed to fly around the country firing people again, but this time, he has to bring her with him. He then meets a woman along the way named Alex(Vera Farmiga) He begins to fall for her, but always dismisses that fact when he is pestered by Natalie to find somebody to love.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is a phenomenal film. It really shows what life is like right now for some people, and it has a great message about what is important in life. Definitely see this movie. I can assure you that you won't regret it."
"Quinoa1984","9","4","11","25 December 2009"," about an ""issue"", but also about the characters and a bittersweet lot in life
","Jason Reitman is a filmmaker that cares about the issues of the day, or of some day or other. But I don't think he consciously goes out of his way to make a ""statement"" about lobbyists and tobacco with Thank You For Smoking or about teen pregnancy with Juno. Such as the case with Up in the Air, I think he was attracted first, from the book his film is based on, by the characters and the story of this particular guy with a very uncomfortable, morally repugnant but somehow available job of being sent across the country to fire people, personally, and send them on their merry way. Yet right now, even more than teen pregnancy or the demons of lobbyists, unemployment is hitting many people, everywhere. In Detroit, a city that's featured in one particularly disturbing scene in this film, the unemployment level is somewhere between 30 and 40% depending on the time of day.<br/><br/>So it's bound to strike a chord with people, not least of which because of Reitman's usage of real people who have been fired featured in the film, spouting off to Clooney's Ryan Bingham, angry or teary or berserk or, in one most troubling case, perfectly calm. And yet what makes Reitman a strong storyteller is not that he cares first about hitting the hammer on the audience with the message (he's not, say, Paul Haggis with his dramatization), but that he wants to tell this story of a guy who we might not even know actually exists, until that moment he steps into a room and fires someone. Or, perhaps, one sees in a hotel reception room giving a presentation about ""How to Backpack Your Life."" It features a sharp screenplay that's wise about the nature of human connectivity, the lack of it in this character, and his realization of what's missing in his efficient but cold life.<br/><br/>What's also clever in the story is how Ryan Bingham, played by an as-always cool and witty and very slightly vulnerable George Clooney, is also not entirely safe with his own job. His work of going out on the road, which he does more than 3/4 of the year, is threatened by young upstart Natalie's 'fresh' idea of putting a computer-cam link up so people can be fired right over their monitors. She goes out on the road with Ryan, however, and sees how it's really done, the actual humanity that goes in the process of telling someone they've been let go (not to mention the equally unsettling task of handing a booklet over on starting over). It's through this road trip that we see Natalie's own weaknesses revealed, but more-so she brings out some of the ambivalence of Ryan, too. Mostly as Ryan has a fling with a professional woman also on the road (Vera Farmiga), and what really unfolds from a seemingly safe, long-distance romance.<br/><br/>Oh, there are one or two little scenes that do get in the way of it being truly phenomenal (there's one scene in particular, as Ryan and Natalie, charming and shrewd played by Anna Kendrick), argue on a pier, where she lays out everything wrong in Ryan's life, and it's too-spelled-out for the audience when we know what's wrong or conflicted already). But these shouldn't get in the way of what is another success for Reitman as a filmmaker. He navigates this tale of this man who is so comfortable with the ritual of travel, of hitting that impressive and pathetic plateau of ten million frequent flier miles, that he can't see any change ahead, either in that or in how he views his life with his family or his potential love interest. I won't reveal what happens between Ryan and Alex, but it's easy to say that it's not an easy turn out to the story. Just when you think Reitman's starting to get a little too comfortable with his characters and pleasant situations (i.e. wedding scenes), he pulls the rug out, and it makes sense completely.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is funny, but completely disarming in equal beats (sometimes equal scenes) by it's tragedy. It's bound for Oscar contention and it deserves it, for its intelligence and observation and performances, all top notch. It's of and for our times without forcing it."

","This movie shows the generational gap that exist between older working Americans and American youth concerning relationships, work ethics, and confrontation. It also shows the vulnerability of a traveling single man who falls for another traveling woman, who is honest in her relationship. I do not recommend this movie because it glamorizes adultery, unfaithfulness in marriage, youthful intemperance, and lack of morality among Americans at the expense of a single white male. Moreover, it dehumanizes the firing process of employees by using interactive networks to inform employees that they are no longer required (i.e. fired). I do not recommend this movie."
"sazzad_h_akm","10","2","4","6 May 2012"," An Excellent movie with some severe reality
","Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a HR Executive. His work is to fire employees of other companies around the States who don't have the courage to fire their own employees. He fires employees in a motivating way so that they can cope with life after losing their jobs. Director Jason Reitman expertly portrays how difficult it is to survive in the USA. People like us who live in a third world country have a spurious belief that USA is a supernal land. But after watching this movie this belief will be altered. The idea of the US being supernal may only hold until you are fired randomly by your employer without any apparent cause. If they are determined to fire you, they'll do so, throttling you and giving you no chance at all. And George Clooney makes no mistake here representing a 'cruel employer' character, Ryan Bingham, with all his expertise, charisma and, of course, most importantly, with his foxy smile. <br/><br/>This movie also gives us a sad but true realization of recluse life. We were taught in high school, ""Man can't live alone, and he needs company."" Ryan Bingham believes in single-hood and detests commitment, most of all, marriage. In love with his mobile employee-firing job, he jets about meeting girls at different cities or airports, forging only temporary relationship. He is also detached from his family. At last, he understands the value of relationship. George Clooney is masterful in representing this playboy-like loner Ryan Bingham.<br/><br/>Natalie Keener(Anna Kendrick) is a talent novice employee at Ryan Bingham's company who proposes a new firing technique by which employees will be fired through the Internet so that huge costs in traveling will be saved. As her proposal conflicts with Ryan Bingham's hobby, Ryan tries to prove that the new firing technique is not pragmatic enough. So Ryan's boss sends Natalie with him to get practical experience. For the entire movie, Kendrick displays amazing acting skills and is also pretty hot(mostly in the later part of the movie). The crying scene she was in at the airport was the best scene of the movie and reminds me of my 8-year-old niece every time I watch it. She believes in love too much and in love with someone. She tries to convince Ryan about love & marriage throughout their journey together. She had better job offers but took this firing job just to be with her lover who dumps her later via text message. Kendrick was superb here representing today's typical younger generation. They have much to learn from her character. <br/><br/>Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) is the female version of Ryan who works in an airlines company. She meets Ryan in an airport and as they have many things in common, they quickly develop a sexual relationship. Later Ryan falls for her and finds out that she has a family. I don't think it is common of a married airline female worker to have affairs like Alex did. This negative portrayal will put husbands in doubt about letting their wife work in airline companies. Whatever Vera did there, she did it spontaneously. <br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis (as Steve) & J.K. Simmons (as Bob) are fantastic in their brief but witty roles as is Jason Bateman (as Craig Gregory, Ryan's boss). I was amazed to know that the Fired Employees who acted in this movie were real life fired employees, fired just a few months before the movie was filmed. <br/><br/>I gave this movie 10 out of 10. Highly recommended to all movie lovers."
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","11 February 2012"," Subverts the genre a little with a sharp edge to be enjoyable but not worthy of the mass praise it got at the time (MASSIVE SPOILERS)
","I don't remember if it won anything or even what categories it was getting buzz for, but I do recall that when Up in The Air came out the film was highly considered awards-material and there were lots of reviews gushing about how timely it was in regards its subject matter. Not sure why it took me several years to watch it, but it did. What I found was a perfectly likable little indie comedy/drama that delivers a rather traditional message but does it in a way that slightly subverts the genre. The theme of redundancies is not really as important as many reviewers claimed, but it also sort of props up the traditional message.<br/><br/>The way these films usually work is that we follow our main character through a life of glossy awesomeness and then join them in a sort of self-discovery where they realise that this superficial awesome life is, well, superficial. They usual then trade some of this awesome for a bit less superficiality – this is a revelation they normally make while running to the arms of the woman they could have treated a bit better while being awesome and superficial. This is normally how it works and this is basically what the film does and it does it more or less with the pacing and style of the genre. For this it should not be overly praised but rather just enjoyed because it does it pretty well – although it does what you expect. What helps it is that it does have this rather clear eye in the presentation and it is also a little harsh in tone; in particular, while our character makes the revelation and we are shown the importance of family – he doesn't get to benefit from it and he carries on the way he was, albeit with his enjoyment of the superficial awesomeness notably reduced because of how aware he is of the superficiality of it all.<br/><br/>This is a nice touch and I felt it made the film better and complimented my impression of the rest of the story. In the telling we are given comedy and drama in a nicely wry mix and for all its genre stamps, I did really quite like the flow of it. Clooney is a massive part of this as he comes over so natural and human – so yes this is maybe something he does easily when it is early in the film, but he never comes over as smug and we still like him despite his job and thus we are with him when he equally convinces towards the end. He is well supported by Farmiga who is his plot device but is also as good as him. Kendrick is solid and it is nice to see Bateman, Simmons, McBride and Elliot in small roles.<br/><br/>The theme of redundancies was made much of when the film came out because it supposedly captured the heart of the period or was searingly relevant or other such rhetoric but to me it did no such thing. The film doesn't really feel for the people and it certainly doesn't comment on their plight or feelings; it does allow them space at the end of the film, but this is only to allow the film to emphasize the point about the importance of roots and family – but this is a point that does not only apply to bad times, so for me it wasn't like this film was really hitting a moment in time – just that its plot device was topical, there is a difference.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is a genre movie where our hero learns a life-lesson in regards the importance of family and reality in a life – it is a good example of this genre as it subverts it nicely and has a consistently good mix of comedy and drama. It isn't quite the amazing film that the critics at the time claimed, but it is still very good and Clooney is as good as he is well cast."
"lomaran-1","5","2","4","21 March 2011"," Could be a GREAT movie, but the end is crap.
","If you like the traditional 'happy ending', do not bother with this movie. Run from it. <br/><br/>It starts out with George Clooney, a very selfish man who travels for a living. He travels to fire people. That is his job, and he loves it: not necessarily the firing part, but he loves to travel. He really loves his life - so much so, he hates being home. I guess we are supposed to not like him but oddly, we do and it is for this reason that the movie doesn't work. We WANT him to end up happy.<br/><br/>He starts off with a barren apartment. It is nice and clean but clearly just functional. You can see he spends very little time there. He states he flew 322 days in one year. He has no real roots, other than his job, and no close friends. He travels so he isn't even close to people he works with and although he has two sisters, it is clear that he has been just as distant with them for he barely knows them, either. Yet, we are soon to discover that his younger sister is getting married and it is partly due to this that he starts to rethink his life; this and his meeting a fellow traveler, very much like himself, in the female form. <br/><br/>He and she hit if off right away and decide to hook up whenever their flight paths cross. She is likable too so you really want to see these two end up together. He invites her to his sister's wedding, shows her his high school and then he talks his future brother-in-law into going through with the wedding when he starts to gets cold feet. You can see it coming. He is thinking that having someone special isn't such a bad thing. <br/><br/>THIS IS A BIG SPOILER. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW THE MOVIE ENDS, STOP READING HERE. <br/><br/>A day or two after the wedding he decides to throw his old lifestyle away and he goes to the woman's home. He has decided that love and marriage are good things and that maybe he could, or should, give them a try. We are glad to see it. We're hopeful and yet, my husband and I were both thinking the same thing as he approached the woman's house - what if she's married... and she is. She even has kids! Talk about feeling defeated! The rest of the movie gets no better and we're left feeling totally cheated. <br/><br/>I'd like to ask, why couldn't this have ended happily? Why couldn't he go to her, and she run to him, and have it all end the way most people want? Yes, I know there will always be a few who will disagree, but I do believe that there are less of them. We like him, we like her. They seem perfect together. Get it people?! Get them together! Leave your audience with a good feeling - but no, not our modern Hollywood. They have to leave us with disgust, and we wonder why movies suck today? This is why. <br/><br/>Hollywood refuses to give the audience what they want. 'They' know better what entertains, right? WRONG! We don't need to be taught that sh-- happens, we live in the world too yet years ago when Hollywood could write, movies delivered what they were meant to; pure escapism. Where are the Ingrid Bergmans, the Cary Grants? Even comedy today stinks. Writers knew, back then, how to write SCHTICK and it was funny. The Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello! Toilet humor is all we get now-a-days and I for one am sick of it. <br/><br/>Give me the CLASSIC movies of the 1940s. They knew their trade and when you walked out of a theater you didn't feel like you were throwing your money away. You invested your hard-earned-dollar and your time into something that delivered. UP IN THE AIR could have been a great movie but modern Hollywood ruined it just like most of the trash made in Hollywood today."
"jpschapira","8","2","4","15 February 2010"," ""What do you want?""
","What do we want? Sometimes our life isn't enough to answer that question. We live day by day and we don't have the time. Ryan Bingham is asked, two times by the same person in Jason Reitman's ""Up in the air"": ""What do you want?"". He can't come with the answer. He travels through the world firing people for a living and doesn't have trouble sleeping; we hear his voice-in off saying the air is his home, the airports a reminder that everything's fine; we listen to his conferences that are all about leaving any luggage (literal and metaphorical) behind, and yet he seems unable to decide what he wants. He lives by a philosophy. And it appears that it's something he chose and defends, we can tell in conversations with the two women that get in the middle of his systemic, comfortable life. Well, not everything we choose is necessarily what we want.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham is played by George Clooney as the kind of man you wouldn't want to mess with. It's not the most appropriate thing for his line of work, but Clooney has that ability to make us believe he's the best at what he does and that's what we think of Bingham: unstoppable, flawless, cold hearted man with a perfect smileAnd classy too (you know, we're talking about George Clooney here). He did almost the same thing in ""Michael Clayton"", except for the smile. In fact, Bingham is so confident that he falls in love and is sure that everything will work out fine.<br/><br/>I think ""Up in the air"" is a very good movie because Reitman makes sure that we never leave that place. He presents a character and provides him with a 'turning point' that any Hollywood movie would end up in plain happiness –in fact, his own ""Juno"" did just that- and decides to put everything on hold. Every time Bingham is on the ground, whether it is for a family wedding or a job meeting, we can sense that the air is calling him. It's something the movie makes us feel with elements: a melancholic music filled with acoustic guitars, some looks from Bingham, some smiles that don't seem completely right. The trick is that this doesn't have to be something sad. It's just what it is.<br/><br/>We listen to the sound of backpacks closing, magnetic cards beeping, cell phones ringing. That's how it is in the air. A woman, Kate (Vera Farmiga) arrives and sounds like the perfect mate for that safe, suspended life. She seems to share Ryan's philosophy. Then another woman, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), younger, impulsive and willing to learn, sounds like cheap psychology –she has a major in psychology- and promotes, with and without intention (because she's young and impulsive) a version of a ""real"" life, the life of married couples and kids; the life that seems planned out; the life Mark Loring was so scared of and the life that more than one character in this film don't feel prepared forYet the life every man and woman that Ryan fires treasure.<br/><br/>The contradiction is obvious, and it's Ryan's ""turning point"". But the characters in Reitman's films are never obvious. They are smart, quirky, sometimes weird people capable of resolving contradictions. The script by the director and Sheldon Turner, based on a Walter Kim novel, is insightful and powerfully dramatic without any melodrama. The employees getting fired suffer and speak the truth, we listen to every one of their words and we empathize.<br/><br/>But we empathize with Ryan too, because we can see him wondering. The conversations he shares with Karen on one hand, the (mostly) discussions he has with Natalie on the other, and one particular three-way talk about life and love, are the moments the movie needs us to pay attention the most. The moments without music, the moments in which Ryan hardly says something that doesn't belong to his philosophy, but at the same time the moments in which he thinks or, at least, he's left with something to think about. We can see it in his eyes, even though the conviction of the performances by Kendrick and Farmiga help to generate this effect (performances that, if anything, confirm Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner should have had more chances in the Awards period with ""Juno"").<br/><br/>Does Ryan need a second chance? Does he deserve it? Of course ""Up in the air"" offers more questions than answers, and I don't think that the journey of its main character has anything to do with redemption. With the risk of analyzing something that might not even be suggested by the movie, I think that Ryan Bingham's journey ends once he finds out what he wants. There are a couple of scenes that show people truly delighted and joyful when thinking about the things they want. One involves the perfect J.K. Simmons; and the other one a map of the world with a lot of photographs. I've always believed the world would be different if everyone did what they wanted because I've always known that it's not what happens most of the time. I don't know if it would be a better world, but differentDifferent is good."

","Up in the Air is a drama, comedy, and romance all packed into one. Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney, fires people for a living. His coworker, Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, comes up with the idea to fire people remotely to limit the amount of traveling for Ryan. Ryan decided to take Natalie with him, to show her how important it is to be face to face with the person you're firing. While helping Natalie, Ryan begins hooking up with Alex, played by Vera Farmiga, who is also always traveling for work. He later realizes the connections he's lost with his family and how it's has made him view things. This film sheds light on the theme of struggles of work travel and the personal connections Ryan has because of it. Similar to the idea of On the Road (2012), this film shows the unknown of what will come to Ryan as he travels, like maybe a plus one?!
The close up shots of Ryan later on in the movie on the plane bring out the sadness he feels for barely having connection with his sister that is about to get married. Long shots are used to show the lack of personal connections Ryan has with his family. They show how far away he's really been from them. In opposition to that, close ups are used to show the emotions Ryan has when he feels connected with his family vs. when he doesn't.
Lighting also helps portray Ryan's mood. In the beginning of the film, like when he met Alex, most places he goes are dark. By the end, most places are bright, like at his sisters wedding when he's dancing and having a good time with Alex. This seems to show the progress he's made, just by being with his family for a short period of time.
I believe this film is trying to show the viewers that traveling all the time for a job can be difficult and it can diminish many relationships, but at the end of the day, it is still possible to be close with family and have healthy relationships, if you put in the effort."
"shivangi-goel","8","0","0","24 April 2020"," Charming, with an important takeaway
","This movie has given me a lot of food for thought- but let me write out what I deplored in it first. For starters, it uses societal expectations and norms to constantly shame out the protagonist from a perfectly logical, alternate lifestyle. Why can't someone genuinely just like travelling and working without attachment?
Secondly, it does not leave much space for non-romantic relationships to exist and thrive in conception of what the storyline perceives to be the sole result of choosing to be without a partner-loneliness.<br/><br/>And yet, this movie is quite beautiful in it's charming portrayal of Clooney as a corporate guy. Midway through the movie, I was swooning over how relaxed and happy he is. By the end, I was appreciating how nuanced a character portrayal has to be to highlight how the things we think another person does not realise are great about them are actually what they have based their entire lives out.<br/><br/>I also liked the less conventional ending of the woman he connected with actually being married. A less conventional and sexist assumption would have been that she was waiting just for him.<br/><br/>""By the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like you're settling."" I was rooting that this was the truth for the couple in this movie. But I got a more realistic lesson: connections are transient, life is not a rom-com, and you should not let society dictate the normal for you, or even get panicked and abandon it midway."

","Fairly short review here.<br/><br/>The story is fine, but nothing to write home about. The film certainly has a rocky start in the dialogue department - main character Ryan Bingham (played by Clooney) has some head-scratching quotes with a key moment of the film revolving around his speaking engagements encouraging people to.. not have relationships? I also had a hard time buying the executive treatment for someone who's entire job could be replaced with an email (so I guess the video-call element of the plot makes sense) and it broke my immersion with the movie at several points throughout.<br/><br/>Either way, the movie certainly course-corrects halfway through and ends with a nice mix of unpleasantly pessimistic yet realistic imperfection and a clean ending for most of the characters.<br/><br/>Great performances by George Clooney, Anna Kendrick, and Vera Farminga.

","With a fantastically executed story, some great direction, and some wonderful performances from Clooney and many alike, Up in the Air proves to be more than what could have been a simple dramedy film and achieves the high goals it needs on nearly every level. The script is mapped out beautifully, with such definition and complexities for each character, you can't help but feel at least a little bit for everyone, and with the story's journey throughout- its so incredibly entertaining it will simply feel too good to be true at times. Clooney is fantastic as Ryan Bingham and brings his total A-game to capturing this performance in the most human way possible. Other standouts include, but are not limited to, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick, who also prove their acting skills to unforeseen heights before. The film is quite funny at times, but never at times where it feels too forced or out of place, the timing seems perfect. The pacing feels this way as well, and the emotion conveyed is almost stunningly perfect. In the end, Up in the Air is truly one of the best films of the 2000's and displays the best of all talents involved.

","Ryan Bingham is a middle-aged man who fires people for a living. He works for a company that corporations hire to perform mass layoffs, a soul sucking task that managers often prefer to offload to third parties both because it's easier and for legal and workplace safety reasons. The movie takes place in 2009 during the economic aftermath of the 'Great Recession', a boom time for his industry.<br/><br/>If you've ever had the misfortune to live through one of these layoff events, you'd recognize that the movie gets a lot of the details correct. The carefully orchestrated image of calm professionalism, the coolly empathetic attitude calibrated to make it clear that they understand what individuals are going through while still making it clear that it isn't a negotiation or debate, the standard scripts dictating the flow of the conversation and acceptable euphemisms, the absurd insistence that they will assist you in ""transitioning"". You get the idea.<br/><br/>It would, frankly, be extremely easy to make you hate the people who do this for a living. Performing that kind of work requires people with muted empathy; they can't afford to care too much about the people they fire or the emotional weight would crush them. As the characters allude to in conversations amongst themselves, getting fired is, emotionally, akin to a death in the family. It's serious trauma, and they simply can't afford to feel it.<br/><br/>Which makes portraying Ryan, a man uniquely suited to his job, a difficult task, even for someone with as much charisma as George Clooney. Ryan prefers a life without the burdens of things and people; he even gives seminars that extol the virtues of caring about only what you can carry in a backpack. He views the road as his home and despises returning to his apartment even for forty days a year. His preference is for the sanitized comfort of the corporate world: hotel rooms, airline and car rental loyalty clubs, credit cards and points. All of his life goals and ambitions are built around those things.<br/><br/>Ryan's comfortable world is turned upside down when his employer hires a young ingénue named Natalie Keener who has proposed making the industry more efficient by doing their work via video conferencing instead of in-person. Thinking of the money to be saved, Ryan's boss insists Natalie's vision is the future of the business, but Ryan convinces him to at least have her accompany him to several job sites so she can get a feel for how the process works in real life. Along the way, Natalie's infectious humanity gradually begins to make Ryan question some of the rules by which he leads his life.<br/><br/>What's particularly interesting about the movie are the ways in which it subverts expectations. Traditional storytelling would suggest that a man who neither wants nor needs deep human connections and enjoys his job firing people should be shown the error of his ways, ala 'A Christmas Carol'. But Ryan is actually very good at his job, to the point where others routinely steal his lines and approaches. He's good at reading people and knowing when they need to re-contextualize what's happening to them, when they need to just vent, and when they need to have their shattered egos rebuilt. And his lack of human connection isn't complete; we see eventually that he does in fact care about others in meaningful ways. He just prefers to do it from a distance.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say that there aren't tragic aspects to Ryan's character, as detailed beautifully when he achieves a long-standing goal of his and is asked during a celebration in his honor where he's from. But the sense isn't that he's a tragic figure so much as a new type of creature uniquely adapted to an environment most of us would see as inhospitable. We see him and shiver at the thought of his life, but also come to realize that he would do the same thinking of ours.<br/><br/>The movie ends on this note, almost abruptly. Ryan has visited humanity and observed their ways, even tried living as one of them, but ultimately found their world confusing and distressing, and returns to his natural habitat. Though he bears us no ill will, we will not see him again save for the occasional postcard and by the taillight of his home in the night sky."

Thus, a journey of self discovery begins, one which will put them into unexpected situations which might end up changing their perspective over their own life.<br/><br/>It's a movie which brings an interesting plot, complex and pretty much unpredictable.

As we follow the main character's quest, multiple diverse and also interesting characters join the action, each of them influencing the protagonists one way or another.<br/><br/>It features plenty of well thought dialog which brings sense to each sequence and also adds depth to everything that happens. It also manages to generate much drama through this simple mean of expression, making the experience one of a kind.

You also can expect some irony and even humor along the way; nothing impressive but its still worth mentioning. The artistic direction bring an important contribution by itslef, as it shows some unique angles and ways of presenting its events.

The photography is wonderful with unique aerial shots, the cinematography captures a naturalness and gorgeous, authentic looking reality-movie experience that doesn't usually seemed staged. Oddly enough, this surprisingly predictable movie doesn't require sharply new material, only the fresh approach to real life that most audience members can relate to.<br/><br/>The fascinating question here is whether or not this timely and period relevant movie in this era of the Great Recession would resonate as mightily during periods of prosperity. Perhaps the lingering memory of this era might permit the emotional empathetic and visceral connection to continue for several decades to come. Whether this movie could stand the test of time over a century is another matter. Nevertheless, this movie released in 2009 depicted the intensity, misery, and depth of emotional turmoil of the times with compassion and dispassion.

","I watched Up in the Air because I'm a big fan of Anna Kendrick and wanted to see the role she has earned the most praise for in her whole career. I must admit that it did not disappoint. Apart from the great performances by our 3 leads, one of the things I loved about this movie was the directing. Jason Reitman, who also co-wrote the script, has a really great way to capture intimate and tender moments between characters. The story is all about connection, and the directing of the movie captured that. There is particularly one sequence at the end, the wedding (for those who've seen it), that was shot beautifully. That whole sequence wasn't about getting those cinematic artistic shots, but about capturing the emotion the actors are showing. The only problem I have with this movie was that I believe the ending could have been fleshed out a little bit more. The resolution to the arc of our main character wasn't really there for me.

","I looked up dark comedy in the dictionary and it had ""Up in the Air"" by it. There isn't much plot to the movie, yet it keeps moving. It makes a statement about following your dreams, family, and goals as Clooney's words somehow always come back to haunt him. I had to laugh at loud when Sam Elliot came back to talk to Clooney about joining the 10 million mile club. Shades of ""The Big Lebowski."" I kept expecting him to call George ""dude"" and tell him he was his father. The movie is bittersweet at times and sad at others, although not a tear jerker. I was confused about his occupation. He is paid to come into an industry and tell the workers they are laid off. Doesn't HR fire people? Do they really hire an outside company to do that? The irony of a man who fires people for a living speaking at a conference called ""Goalquest"" is a bit Orwellian. The best line in the movie was during a firing that he allowed his young assistant to do. She got into trouble, so Clooney the master ax man, steps in and says, ""Do you know why kids love ball players?"" The old man says ""Because the make a lot of money and have sex with beautiful women."" Clooney responds, ""No, that is why we love them.

It all hangs together very well. Clooney's somewhat against type here, playing a fairly unlikable character, but hell if he's not charming nonetheless.

","I really like this movie. At first I found the locations -- airports, airplanes and boardrooms -- jarringly clinical. But I guess they do serve to make a point. Here is a world in which humans are expected to detach from their real world and from their soul and family and act like robots in the service of company profits. The acting is great but it's the script and direction that shines. To me, the scene that sums up the movie is when George Clooney's character, the businessman who flies around the world firing people, is ecstatic to finally meet his goal of massive frequent flyer points. And all he wins are a few trinkets, and a meeting with an airline executive clearly amused at how anyone would be excited by such a feat. It's obscene how meaningless the achievement is. Yet many of us pursue such marketing trifles as meaningful goals in our lives. Hilarious, when you think about it. The George Clooney character has charisma, and he is smart and resourceful and yet he has this horrible job that devastates people he doesn't know, and he is a master at repressing any empathy, at not seeing them as human beings. And the move shows how he pays a heavy price, personally, as well. But does he, himself, realise that? The final scene, to me, is a masterpiece, because it shows how he does have a choice in this bizarre world. And what is he going to choose? It's a choice all of us have -- to engage with the world, or detach from it. To act ethically or unethically. To try to put down roots, or stay up in the air."

","Jason Reitman has again done something smart and skewered the zeitgeist. Clooney, who has two hits and a miss out right now (this, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the misfired Men Who Stare at Goats), is at the top of his game, and his performance here shows everything he can do; his limitations fit those of his character.<br/><br/>If this is a comedy, it's a depressing one. Even with a gloss of wit and perfect timing, Up in the Air delivers a pill that's hard to swallow. Its blend of cynicism and uplift is at best confusing. It's a puzzle picture.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is a slickly shallow man whose job is delivering corporate layoffs (obviously an action of supreme relevance during the current Great Recession, but hardly a new thing). He flies round the country and his greatest goal in life, a rather abstract one, is to earn ten million miles of flying time. He works for the blandly amoral Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), whose staff zips around the country telling employees they're being let go and must clear out their desks, so their bosses don't have to have blood on their hands. If you have to have your dog killed, you take it to the vet's; this is the same thing.<br/><br/>While Ryan celebrates what he sees as an easy life full of enjoyable perks, this movie is full of pain. It richly details the reactions of devastated employees who have just learned they're fired, or tell the camera what it's like to be out of a job after 15 or 20 years with a house and a wife and kids. The terrible anguish of this experience is made clearer by the fact that actual fired persons have been used for many of these vignettes.<br/><br/>Ryan knows he is doing damage, and his focus is on being cool and businesslike about it. This could be compared to the job of the euphemistically titled Casualty Notification Officers in Moverman's The Messenger, who tell families their next of kin have died in Iraq, except that instead of the grim determination of Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster, Clooney's character goes about his work with brio, and seems to find life out of a suitcase hip and chic.<br/><br/>Ryan celebrates non-attachment (a value to Buddhists, but in their case not linked with cruelty). He even gives motivational lectures in which he advises success-seekers to get rid of unnecessary stuff in their lives, just as he pares down his necessities so he can travel anywhere with only a carry-on bag. In one version of the talk, he hypothetically fills a backpack with all the people in his life and then empties it out. He likes being up in the air; it's where he lives. He's even given up keeping a permanent apartment in Omaha, his company's headquarters.<br/><br/>Ryan is a teacher whose pupil learns a wiser lesson and who has to wise up himself. He meets his equal, Alex Goran (Vera Formiga, in a nicely modulated performance), in a bar and they become lovers. She explains to him later he should think of her as ""you, with a vagina."" We don't learn what she does, but she perfectly appreciates the prestige of Ryan's plastic cards that open doors or get him right on a flight or into a good rental car. She talks about the unknown size of his mileage as if it was the size of his penis, and ""it must be huge."" An iconic moment: their face-off after their first roll in the hay, laptop to laptop, finding a date when they're both free and in near enough airports to stage another rendezvous.<br/><br/>Danger of the same fate he's doling out comes to Ryan when Craig calls the entire staff back to Omaha for a meeting at which they learn they're going to be grounded. Craig has listened to a cold ambitious young women called Natalie (Ms. Kendrick), fresh out of business school, who's convinced him he can save tons of money by having his people do their hatchet jobs from headquarters via video hookup. Ryan is sent out with Natalie to test the new technology by firing people, first in the old way in person, then via video screen. He teaches her the elements of pro travel -- dumping unnecessary baggage, following Asians through security because they're organized and fast and wear slip-on shoes, and so on -- and then how to deal with angry, violent, or suicidal people they've just fired. That lesson she's not so ready for.<br/><br/>The irony is that being fired by an outsider is downright warm and human compared to having it done by somebody on a computer screen. Meanwhile Natalie's boyfriend fires her from their relationship via text message. She took this job and came to Omaha to be with him when she could have had a better job in San Francisco. Things get complicated with Alex for Ryan, and when Natalie meets Alex she challenges Ryan's complete unwillingness to accept commitment.<br/><br/>The movie gets preachy when Ryan and Alex attend his sister's wedding. Eventually the message is E.M. Forster's ""only connect,"" and it's clear Ryan will become a very lonely guy if he doesn't reform. The sophistication of Alex and Ryan and their slick shared gamesmanship become hollow. They might be a couple out of the great age of Hollywood studio comedy -- except they aren't funny, and aren't meant to be. The trouble is, we only care about George Clooney when he's being a charmer or getting the better of someone and when his character is being shown up, he can seem shallow, tarnished. His gloss isn't invincible like Cary Grant's. What Reitman's doing here is complex and interesting, but the screenplay is weak in various areas. The focus wavers too much between being about job loss and corporate wising up, and the movie's too sophisticated to wind up so reliant on cornpone wisdom."

"cultfilmfan","10","3","9","3 January 2010"," Up In The Air
","Up In The Air is about a middle aged man named Ryan Bingham, who works for a large company who has hired Ryan, along with many others to professionally let people go of their jobs. Ryan, will fly all across America and is paid by other companies to do their dirty work, which in this case, is letting go of employees. Ryan has been doing this for years and feels he has a certain technique and style to it. He also doesn't have a place of residence other than a hotel room and otherwise most days of the year he is on airplanes, travelling and in various assorted hotel rooms. Ryan also does professional speeches on how to lose baggage (for example relationships and stress that goes along with it). Ryan seems like the perfect person to deliver these types of speeches because he has not one bit of baggage. He has never been married and has no real emotional connections and claims to like it that way. Things change however, after he meets a woman while at one of the hotels. Her name is Alex, and after meeting a couple times, Ryan starts to decide, whether or not he should eventually get over his fear, or dislike of commitment and finally do something in that area of his life. Another part of the story focuses on Ryan's new co-worker named Natalie, who is an overly confident young woman, who goes on the road, or should I see in the air, with Ryan to different destinations to learn how to fire people properly. At least that is what Ryan calls it. The film looks at many different kinds of relationships and characteristics of these characters and also is right on time with it's back story of letting go of employees due to the current financial recession being felt all over the world. Up In The Air works for several reasons. One, I think is the well layered characters here. For example, Ryan the main character. He comes off as quite sure of himself and what he is doing and many people seem to think he is quite happy with his lifestyle and the choices he has made. However as we watch the film we start to realize that maybe that is just a front he is putting on and deep down he is a sad and lonely person and perhaps scared to commit to any kind of relationship, perhaps out of fear and because he is so used to his lifestyle and change is never easy. Alex and Natalie are well developed characters as well and we get to see more about them through the film and it is just as intriguing and interesting to watch as with Ryan's character. All of these characters are brought to life by great performances by George Clooney (Ryan), Vera Farmiga (Alex) and Anna Kendrick (Natalie). They are deep and layered performances and we feel as if we have gotten to know these characters quite well after watching them, but on the plus side, there is also some mystery left to them, which leads the viewer to some intriguing thoughts and deconstruction of the film after being viewed. Count on Oscar nominations for all three acting performances. The film's script is also a winner blending in comedy, tragedy and real life melodrama. Not once does the film feel unrealistic, or sugar coated and it is one of the more believable and realistic films dealing with relationships in the past little while and because there are no easy answers to these characters, or their situations, I think the way they are handled is very appropriate. And again the depth and layers to these characters plus some good dialogue and occasional humour lead to a sure to be nominated best adapted screenplay as well as best director for Jason Reitman. Up In The Air is a powerful film in many ways. I think for many it will leave us reflecting on our past, or present and think about the situations and current times we are in. It definitely leaves an impact on the viewer and will have you thinking, which I think a great film does. It blends sadness and humour quite well and makes for an intriguing watch. One of the best films of 2009 and will continue to be a winner among the awards circuits and for good reasons too."

","After all the critical raves, I was really disappointed. As a confirmed Clooney fan, I thought I could enjoy anything he was in, but this is the second test where that theory failed, the first one having been ""Syrianna"" (which was far worst than this). The movie could have used substantial editing - after all, how many times did we really need to see individuals getting the ax? Or listen to the entirety of Ryan's stump speech? I found myself bored during most of it because nothing much ever happened and what did happen did so at a glacial pace. The whole thing was salvaged by the magnetism of its three stars. Clooney does find his match in both of these two very watchable actresses."

How this film has already won so many Critics awards, and may win Golden Globes and Oscars is stunning to me.<br/><br/>Before I saw this movie, I heard raves about Anna Kendrick in this role. Whatever for? I can see the whipper-snapper Cornell college graduate thinking she knows more about how to terminate people than the ""adults,"" but there's no way someone at that age has enough life experience to be advising George Clooney about how he should be living his life, as well as all the other countless insights and observations her character gave. I felt like I was watching ""Juno"" all over again."

","George Clooney stars as a man who spends most of his life up in the air, flying throughout America. His profession: a man who fires people. Companies hire his company to send experts in to ease laid-off employees through their transition period. It's pretty loosely plotted, but the biggest events are his hooking up with fellow frequent flyer Vera Farmiga, with whom he builds a nice, no-strings-attached relationship that becomes about the only set thing in his life, and his training of young Anna Kendrick, a hotshot Cornell grad who hopes to revolutionize the industry by introducing teleconference firing. Clooney, of course, objects, partly because he thinks he should be there when he's terminating employees (the personal touch is needed), and partly because he hasn't reached the fabled 10 million mile mark. And he doesn't want to be home in Omaha. The film is basically an examination of a fleeting and lonely lifestyle. It actually manages to make it look kind of romantic, even with the loneliness (Hell, one can be just as lonely when they're stuck in one place). I think some of the later parts of the film, especially the whole sequence where Clooney attends his sister's wedding, a tad weaker than the flying bits. I don't think the film really has much of a coherent theme - the lay-off parts seem to me just a gimmick to set the film in the present, to give it a contemporary feel. The airport lifestyle remains the bulk of the film that is most memorable, and it's quite wonderful and sad in its way. It's also quite funny and charming. I don't think it's an especially memorable film, but it's a pretty darn good one."

","""Up in the Air"" is a vastly overrated movie. In spite of the undeniable charms of George Clooney as Ryan Bingham, this tale of a man flying around the country to fire people their bosses are too cowardly to confront in person does not deserve the honors or the admiring adjectives that have been heaped on it. Clooney plays slightly against type, and I presume that was seen as a mighty mark in his favor. But he has done far better in other films and attracted much less praise. Bingham, the rootless 10-11 months a year flier living out of a suitcase, finds a bed mate in another frequent flier, Alex Goran, played by Vera Farmiga. Alex, however, turns out to be quite rooted when Bingham realizes the emptiness of his life and thinks about settling down. The third principal character in this film, Natalie Keener, played by Anna Kendrick, joins the company Bingham works for and comes up with the idea of doing all the firing by teleconference. Although Bingham makes the case that it is much more humane and consoling to do the firing in person and hauls Natalie around the country to prove it,these plot elements don't matter much and the complexities which round out the script matter even less. Ms. Farmiga is a beautiful woman and Anna Kendrick is good looking young woman, but neither of them deserved the best supporting actress awards for which they were nominated. This film is an idea that should have been grounded early. The comedy isn't funny, the romance isn't very romantic and the dramatic parts of the script aren't at all interesting. While this may not be one of the ten worst films of 2009, if belongs on the list of the ten best, then it proves how lean a year it really was."
"secondtake","8","2","5","6 March 2010"," A lightweight serious look at a jet age nomad, with Clooney his natural best
","Up in the Air (2009)<br/><br/>Working with a witty, contemporary script and a casting a great leading actor seems like an easy enough bartender's recipe. And for a third time, director Jason Reitman pulls off a movie that is fresh, crisp, and sometimes touching. Thank You for Smoking was a kind of Luke warm warm up, but next came the fabulous Juno, a hard act to follow. Up in the Air is somewhere between the two in sentiment and success, not a bad place to be. It's a terrific movie at its best.<br/><br/>I mention all three films because they have a consistent flavor. And they all build around a very serious kernel, in this case, about the loneliness of a business traveller always flying from city to city. It gets exaggerated here, but not with comic excess (as with Smoking). Clooney's Ryan Bingham is just this side of believable. When he meets a Alex (played with perfect energy by Vera Farmiga) who seems to be his female vagabond counterpart, and they hit it off, it looks like we know the arc of the movie ahead. (We don't.) <br/><br/>The more obvious plot, about a firm that turns to iChat (computer screen conversation) to fire people, is laced with tragedy, but it is a set up for a series of laughs, too, and in the end isn't the most important element at all. (The timing is great though, talking about firing people left and right during high unemployment.)<br/><br/>No, the real point has to do with Bingham's existence as a jet age nomad. Up in the Air lacks any sense of visual art, for me. The camera-work is professional and undistracting, but lacks some of the effective elements of, say, Lost in Translation, which has the one similarity of a the traveller in another place without possessions and with nothing really to do outside of work. Up in the Air hints at bigger potential here at the end, with Clooney in front of the departure schedule, and the camera suddenly seems to contribute in this host, and the next, which reverses direction, and then for the ending, and its surprising, cool, almost tragic certainty. A great ending.<br/><br/>The music seems a carryover from the light, folk-tinged singsong pieces that made Juno really special, but it makes no sense here. This isn't a movie about highschoolers, or about innocence, but about either being very adult (Ryan and Alex) or about becoming an adult (as we see in the quirky and complicated third character played with precision by little known Anna Kendrick). The third thread in the plot(s) about Ryan's sister's marriage is more useful than moving, and more for comic effect than really building any depth, but it does give us a chance to see Ryan think out loud. And change. And confront loneliness."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","5","21 February 2010"," Extremely Charming
","Up in the Air (2009) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Wonderfully charming film in the same tradition as many Frank Capra movies has George Clooney playing Ryan Bingham, a man who believes in being by himself as his job takes him across the country the majority of the year where he must fire people. When a new woman (Anna Kendrick) enters the picture with plans of changing the company, Ryan takes her on the road and shows how difficult the job can be and why simply firing someone over the Internet isn't going to work. Ryan also finds himself getting involved with his family for the first time in years and a relationship (Vera Farmiga) that might change his views on life. This film blends comedy and drama unlike too many films I've ever seen. The laughs are never loud ones and the drama is never earth-shattering or something devastating. I must admit that the gentle nature of this film is what really grabbed me and wouldn't let me go as we've seen this type of story before yet the performances here are so fresh and the screenplay so sharp that you'll feel as if you're seeing this stuff for the very first time. Taking a cue from Capra and throwing in current political drama, the film takes a real look at unemployment and the drama behind such events but this is used to just make our three main characters a lot stronger and I thought this back burner story of this really added a lot to the movie and something we wouldn't normally see. The screenplay stays an a neutral tone from start to finish and even though there are funny moments, serious moments and some rather sad moments, the movie keeps everything at the same level and I really found this tone to perfectly fit everything that was going on. It should come as no shock but Clooney delivers another very strong performance as while watching him work it dawned on me that there's not another actor alive that could have played this role and made it work so well. Clooney has a certain laid back charm that perfectly fit this character and you can't help but fall for this charm while watching the film. He works extremely well with the two female actresses and I'd probably say that the romantic side to all of these perhaps gives us some of the best chemistry of any film of the decade. The stern Kendrick perfectly fits her role as she's so naive in some of her thinking that you can't help but like her. Farmiga is really becoming one of the best actresses to watch in today's cinema and she once again delivers a very memorable performance. The sexual chemistry between her and Clooney is quite erotic and the charm they give off really makes the film something special. We also have Jason Bateman in a nice supporting role as well as Sam Elliott in a brief part. This type of film isn't easy to pull off by director Reitman handles it all extremely well and makes something pretty special. Even though the movie was pushed as a Hollywood film, it's certainly far from that as there are certainly a few twists and turns that you wouldn't expect."

","Well, would you believe it? A Hollywood film that takes its' time, does not flinch from showing what it is like to have the American Dream kicked from under you, and does not have a happy ending. Um, after the absolute rubbish of 'Avatar' some one is still trying out there on the west coast. The story of a single corporate man busily maintaining his isolation and professional objectivity (Clooney) as he busily fires people very professionally as a sub contractor, is a sombre (but lightened by some comedy) theme. It harks back to Frank Capra and sixties European art-house with 'a man in search of his own identity' - indeed the final shot of Clooney standing in front of an airport departures screen is almost a replica of Marcello Mastroianni at the end of 'La Dolce Vita' staring at the huge fish on the beach. The script does not play too high but reels out comfortably. It does not quite have James Stewart or Jack Lemmon to really give it oomph, but George Clooney gives it an understated quality that works quite well. The supports are okay, but the plot for the last forty minutes as things are tied up and characters find their redemption or not feels forced and jerky. Vera Farmiga's character would seem to have as many if not more issues than Clooney's - or is the message that women in the USA can have it all - family, career and great sex on the side? But it just about keeps going, even if you feel a little cheated at the end. There's even enough for Anna Kendrick's character to semi-triumph and the 'real' unemployed to give a message of hope to Americans that all is well in the great country - when it patently isn't. As I say, after the numbing clichés of 'Avatar' and the tosh now being served up in the multiplexes, this is a refreshing and welcome movie."
"MOscarbradley","9","2","5","21 January 2010"," The year's smartest, most intelligent American comedy
","Before ""Up in the Air"" Jason Reitman was the smart new kid on the block who made a smart comedy about corporate greed, (""Thank you for Smoking""), and a better one, (""Juno""), about real people with real feelings coping, quite magnificently, with the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that life throws at us. Now he has combined the two disparate themes; ""Up in the |Air"" is the year's smartest, most intelligent comedy. It's let down, ever so slightly, by a smidgen of sentimentality but picks itself up again to be at least realistically dour in its resolution. (The film's 'happy ending' isn't the unlikely one we might have predicted).<br/><br/>It's about the ultimate corporate man, Ryan Bingham, (a never better George Clooney), whose job it is to tell others they no longer have one. It's a dirty business but Ryan is basically a nice guy whose charm goes some way to softening the blow. What he tells the poor suckers getting the chop may be a load of bull but he has the knack, most of the time anyway, of making it sound like a life opportunity. He does this by flying all over America, spending over 200 days a year away from his drab apartment, living in plush hotel rooms with all their perks. He's happier in an airport lounge than most people would be in a palace. One of the perks is Alex, (an equally superb Vera Farmiga), another frequent flyer he meets in an hotel bar and with whom he starts a no-strings relationship. (They are turned on by each others plastic). And then one day it all threatens to come crashing down when the company hires Natalie, a young whippersnapper, who has designed a programme that allows people to get fired on-line thus eliminating 'the personal touch' and the very expensive travel costs. Ryan's life threatens to implode and he's given the task of taking Natalie on the road with him and showing her the ropes. What happens, of course, is that in the process these two corporate killers manage to humanize each other, or rather find within themselves the humanity that was always there.<br/><br/>This mature, grown-up comedy is easily Reitman's best film to date. If the analogies with Capra, Hawks and Billy Wilder seem a trifle premature there is no doubt that Reitman is someone to watch. There is nothing fancy about his style of direction; he relies on the quality of his script, (in this case co-written with Sheldon Turner from a novel by Walter Kim), and the ability of his actors to deliver. As Ryan criss-crosses the country his journey, from one city to the next, or rather from airport to airport or hotel to hotel, is introduced by aerial shots of the landscape. This is about as show-offy as it gets. ""Up in the Air"" may be the title but this movie has its feet firmly planted on terra-firma and is all the better for it. The three leads, (newcomer Anna Kendrick as Natalie is another name to watch; think Amy Adams without the cute factor), are all superb and there is a lot of talk, all of it good. Here, at last, is a mainstream film aimed at an intelligent, adult audience, funny and sad in about equal measure and very much like the way we live today."

","Sometimes karma can be a real b***h. Take Ryan Bingham, who works for a company that specializes in firing other companies' employees. Yet, despite the harshness of what he's paid to do, Ryan genuinely loves his job and the confirmed-bachelor lifestyle it allows him to lead. He loves being away from home 270 days out of the year. He loves flying on planes - to the point where he's about to crack the magical 10 million-mile mark on his Frequent Flyer plan. He even loves the place he officially calls home: a sterile motel room in Omaha where he barely gets time to shower and shave and unpack his bags before heading off to another destination.<br/><br/>The problem is that all these business trips are placing an onerous financial burden on the company. The solution the bigwigs have come up with is to simply remove the human-contact element from the firing process altogether and replace it with the impersonality of the dreaded teleconference. For Ryan, this means that his days of flying the friendly skies may well be numbered. Before that happens, however, Ryan is determined to make one last stand with his boss, agreeing to take Natalie Keener, the young woman who came up with the idea, on the road with him to demonstrate just how crucially important the ""personal-touch"" can be when terminating an employee. Meanwhile, despite his avowals about how much he loves the bachelor life, a crack in his armor may be starting to show, for Ryan may in fact be falling for Alex, a 30-something fellow-traveler he meets in a bar one night and with whom he begins an initially ""casual,"" typically no-strings-attached romance. But will it stay that way? <br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" is the latest work by Jason Reitman, the director who gave us ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno"" in recent years. Like those earlier efforts, ""Up in the Air"" is a subtle, thought-provoking comedy/drama that explores not only the complexities of romance and human relationships but the destructive effect rampant corporate downsizing has on the shell-shocked individuals who are its victims and on the fabric of society as a whole.<br/><br/>Reitman is scrupulously evenhanded in his depiction of the protagonist. Ryan may not crave an ongoing relationship with that one ""special"" individual, but he doesn't inflict his values on other people and doesn't expect everyone to agree with how he lives his life. For Ryan, living alone is simply a lifestyle choice that seems to be working for him. He isn't even particularly callous in the way he treats those he's in the process of lowering the employment-ending boom on. Ryan knows that someone has to do his job and it might as well be him. It certainly beats doing it in the new highly impersonal way Natalie has come up with. The cosmic question becomes is Ryan's eternal bachelor mindset truly endemic to his personality, or could he find true happiness with another person if he just gave it the old college try? Reitman's wryly humorous screenplay (co-authored with Sheldon Turner and based on the book by Walter Kim) explores Ryan's relationship - one platonic, the other not - with two women: the brash but actually quite naïve Natalie who, despite her seeming emotional detachment, believes in happily-ever-after storybook endings and long-term marital bliss, and the more seasoned Alex who has few illusions about what life has to offer in either of those two regards. The movie hears out all sides on the issue without casting judgment and without settling for easy answers. For that very reason, the movie also earns points for refusing to cater to the audience's expectations for a stereotypical, copout ending.<br/><br/>As Ryan, George Clooney really makes his rugged good looks and laid back charm work for him in this role, and Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga, as the two women in his life, match him every step of the way in their performances.<br/><br/>Given the hard economic times in which we live, ""Up in the Air"" could not be more topical in its treatment of unemployment and the devastating effect it has on the people who suffer the ravages of it. The movie may not blow you away as other social dramas do, but it will get you to thinking about your own life - and provide you with a few good laughs to lighten the load."

","There are some movies you see because you want to, and some you see because you have to. Little did I suspect that ""Up In the Air"" is both.<br/><br/>""What's in Your Backpack?"" is the motivational speaking sideline of Ryan Bingham, the 'termination engineer' played by George Clooney in this movie, which deftly comes disguised as a romantic comedy – right down to a pivotal wedding scene- but really challenges us to consider what is in OUR backpacks – that we ARE all bogged down both by 'stuff' and by commitments to people. As Bingham preaches, we can chose not to be weighed down. As Bingham comes to realize, we can also make choices to refill our backpack with the things we want in our lives. We may all die alone, as Bingham points out, but it is how we enjoy the journey that is the central puzzle of life, and the object of this film.<br/><br/>Nothing in this film is pretentious or preachy. It is tightly crafted. Though it is a tad heavy with exposition early on, there is significant action – in Bingham's hotel beds; at a party; at a wedding- to entertain. There is humour and melodrama, done lightly – I barely teared up before the wedding, and then again towards the end.<br/><br/>The principal actors – Clooney, Vera Famiga, and relative newcomer Anna Kendrick as Bingham's foil, who demands that he consider whether his life has more meaning than accumulating 10 million American Airlines frequent flyer miles- all become their characters – never once do you see them acting. Kendrick is an especial surprise, playing a character who grows through the narrative, and convincing us of the transition.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the plot surrounding Bingham's job as a travelling harbinger of employment death – the film does not skip lightly over this reality, but, as he did in Juno with abortion and adoption, Jason Reitman folds this theme neatly into the mix.<br/><br/>In a decade of big explosion movies and computer animation, this human scaled film about real life is a rare treat."
"janyeap","6","4","16","4 December 2009"," George Clooney charms, mesmerizes... the film is George Clooney!
","Jason Reitman's film is clever, mesmerizing with numerous scenes succeeding in stirring up laughter, and has a host of memorable images of very expressive faces of characters ... at least for only the first 30 minutes before it gradually glides into tediously silly sub-plots. Luckily, the film does have George Clooney to keep the audience's eyes glued to the screen from scene to scene. In the same way Ellen Page's charming presence took over literally every scene in Reitman's Juno, George Clooney is built into every scene to charm the audience. Every other character is merely playing second fiddle to his screen prominence. <br/><br/>Clooney is marvelously captivating throughout the film. Indeed, he is the film. Yep, he's the Cary Grant of the 21st century and does deliver style, confidence, elegance, and phenomenal acting talent! Yes, he appears so iconic, immaculate and savvy in his suit! His stylistically, suave and handsome Ryan keeps the audience's eyes glued to the screen, and immensely charmed by Clooney. Clooney is Ryan, and Ryan is Clooney! Everything else, including the out-of-place and silly subplots, like the wedding scenario, and Reitman's awkward cameo scene, becomes secondary. Yep, Clooney holds the responsibility to make or break this film!<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga's Alex (at times, reminding me of Leelee Sobieski.) does try hard to steal the limelight from him, but fails. Her character is unconvincing and superficial, her moods and expressions pretty one-dimensional. Her acting performance hasn't changed much since her Madolyn in ""The Departed"", The interactions between her and Ryan seem too theatrical even with her flirtatious ploy, and there is no convincing chemistry between the two. It does make me wonder if that is meant to be a hint for predicting the story's ending. <br/><br/>Anna Kendrick's Natalie is an oddball, marvelous when exhibiting her peculiar and oft times, bizarre behavior. She is the only character in the film capable of stealing the momentary limelight from Clooney's Ryan. In a strange way, the camera seems to be focusing consistently on her set of teeth, at different angles, to make me wonder if they are meant to arouse laughter, or that they are elements relevant to her performance. Overall, the Natalie character is not very interesting. I doubt I'd miss her if she's written out of the script. Maybe, her character is meant to be there to pose challenges to Ryan's career security? Hard to tell! <br/><br/>CLOONEY DOES DESERVE AN Oscar NOMINATION. He is the story; he is the film, and he grabs the viewer's attention from scene to scene, allowing them to overlook any brouhaha, the tedious and slow pacing of events, and the silly subplots with little bearing to the film's initial 30 minutes of plot and themes. I was very glad for the film's ending before Clooney's Ryan starts to lose his complete poise and savvy disposition, and sinks to the same silliness exhibited by Natalie. <br/><br/>Clooney is fabulous; the film/storyline, overall, is mediocre."

But in this movie this guy doesn't feel lonely.He is very happy with this lame existence and even gives speeches about it.He doesn't want a connection and is on the defensive when others criticize him for it.

","""Up in the Air"" is ""The Accidental Tourist"" light. A charming con man and road warrior (George Clooney) with, inexplicably, nothing to live for besides accruing frequent flier miles on a major airline eventually finds something (Vera Farmiga) to live for. Or does he? <br/><br/>That's it, and it's not much. Fortunately, getting there is at least half the fun. Until Clooney's character experiences his epiphany, the audience gets to enjoy the smooth illogic of his perverse sales pitches, the comedy of his office politics, the comedy of his sister's wedding preparations, his sophisticated banter with Farmiga's character (""I'm you with a vagina,"" she tells him) and her body double's well-equipped rear section, the angst of employees let go in a bad economy, Sam Elliott's increasingly face-dominating white mustache, and a couple of dozen high-definition shots of American cities taken from the air. If you like traveling by plane, you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>If truth be told, ""Up in the Air"" isn't Oscar material. As airplane movies go, it trails far behind ""Airplane!,"" ""Airport,"" and ""The High and the Mighty."" But there are enough pokes at hospitality industry loyalty programs, motivational speaking programs, and corporate business strategies and other laugh-out-loud lines to be worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Clooney, whose real-life aversion to establishing a family is eerily similar to his character's, is fun to watch. He is a star who works in pictures as often as star system actors ever did. The other actors handle their material well enough. ""Up in the Air"" is from the director who brought us ""Juno."" There is some of the same wild premise and hip stoned sufferance here. It's a silly premise, but once you buy into it, it makes for a pleasant comedy and maybe a chick flick with a twist."

She's more than great in everything else I've seen her in, and this performance may only be a hiccup for her. Oddly enough, it may be Vera Farmiga's excellent work in the supporting female role that overshadows Kendrick.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie hits home. It could hit you even harder if you're a single male. The movie dives deep into the day-to-day activities of Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham. Even given the name of the movie, you'll never guess what the story will be, and it twists enough to stay interesting.<br/><br/>To sum it up, although being great in its own right for today, Up in the Air may not stick with you for a lifetime, therefore, scores only a 7 out of 10.

","George Clooney plays a clean-cut, suit-and-tie guy who wings around the country via American Airlines delivering the bad news to sacked employees because their bosses lack the intestinal fortitude to fire them. He is really good at his job and he has gotten to liking what he does because there is an art to telling people that they are fired. He also likes to give speeches to inspirational speeches to audiences about how to live without things. It is his back-pack speech. He is a bachelor who lives a frugal lifestyle and takes all the advantages that flying American Airlines offers. Along the way, he meets a delicious looking doll Alex Goran(Vera Farmiga of ""Orphan"") who flies all over, too, and they strike up an occasional romance with no strings attached. Corporate boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman of ""Extract"") calls our hero into the main office in Omaha and announces that the company wants to cut expenses by firing people on the Internet. Of course, Ryan (George Clooney) thinks that this is a bad idea for several good reasons. The individual who came up with this bright idea is a newbie Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who likes to use some of the lines that Ryan wields in his interviews. Craig decides to let Ryan take Natalie out to show her the ropes. If you have ever flown or flown as much as Ryan has, the endless scenes in airport terminals will seem familiar.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" springs several important surprises that may catch you blind and irony plays an important role in the narrative. Essentially, this movie is rather like the western movies where the veteran gunslinger teaches the green gunslingers all the tricks of the trade. J.K. Simmons of ""Spiderman"" movies, Sam Elliot, Danny McBride, and Zach Galifianakis of ""The Hangover"" all put in cameo appearances. Clooney is his usual polished self. ""Up in the Air"" is a good movie but it does not have the sarcasm of director Jason Reitman's previous films ""Thank You For Smoking"" and ""Juno."" This is the first movie that recognizes a fad where people have pictures of themselves taken in places that they have not visited."

We are not swans. We are sharks."" Ryan Bingham <br/><br/>Up in the Air is a slick, modern American film with drama and humor and a few social issues to make it a nearly perfect holiday present. Jason Reitman has now established himself as one of the brightest young directors if you consider his achievements in Thank You for Smoking and Juno prior to Up in the Air.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney at the top of his game) is a professional terminator, whom corporations hire to do their firing. Along the way, he accumulates ten million frequent-flier miles, a babe or two, and the freedom to be private and happy. However, happy people are prime dramatic targets, and Bingham is no exception. Besides falling for Alex (Vera Farmiga), who is a female version of his non-committal self, Ryan must face the change to electronic dismissals and the dismal job itself of altering for the worse every employee he severs.<br/><br/>Current high unemployment and uncomfortable flying circumstances with airlines cutting back on flights and services make substantial topics covered in this film with a depth uncharacteristic of American comedy dramas. The montage sequences of real employees and actors responding to the news that their jobs have been eliminated are powerful reminders that no one is immune in a Great Recession and no one, not even smooth Ryan is actually successful at making anyone feel good about being fired. Such frustrations make Clooney's performance that much more powerful because if someone as gifted as Bingham can't stop the bleeding no one can.<br/><br/>The sub theme of virtual firing, created by new college grad Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) makes multiple commentaries on the impersonality of all electronic interfacing and the persistent need to humanize an almost inhuman practice. This theme parallels the impersonality of Bingham's personal life; again a montage of him neatly arranging his items for his roll-on bag drives home both the fascination we can have over someone so organized and free and the distaste for such inhuman efficiency.<br/><br/>""Make no mistake your relationships are the heaviest components in your life.""

","Up in the Air follows Ryan Binham (George Clooney) as he is sent to offices to fire their workers. George Clooney gives a wonderful performance as he dwells into the loneliness of his character. Also, Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga give their Oscar worthy performances as Natalie Keener and Alex Goran respectively. The cast is rounded out by memorable performances from Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Sam Elliott, Danny McBride, and Zach Galifanakis.<br/><br/>One of the other reasons why this film is one of Reitman's best is the personal nature of the story. Reitman used clips of real people being actually fired, and this helps add to the sincerity of the film. One of the most memorable aspects of the film is the theme of friendship and family. The fired workers talked about how their friends and family helped them through the tough time, and even Bingham himself admitted his most important moments in life included other people."
"classicsoncall","7","1","2","22 March 2018"," ""What's in your backpack?""
","I had to wonder while watching the movie if there really is such a job as a corporate hired gun to fire employees, sort of a reverse headhunter if you will. There probably is but I never heard of it, and the way Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) role was positioned in the story, it looked like a lot of companies would take advantage of the the skills he possessed. It's kind of weird though, to think that a company's personnel executive wouldn't have the courage or fortitude to dismiss employees who were either unproductive or unskilled to meet new challenges. Clooney's character was ideal for the job, harboring no illusions of compassion for those he was sent in to dismiss; I'm sure he made a pretty good buck at it.<br/><br/>The main reason I picked this film to watch when I did was because I was about to take a plane flight the next day on a vacation trip. Not that that had anything to do with the substance of the film, but it made the connection a little more personal. I'm retired now, so there were no thoughts about getting fired while I was away. So then I began thinking what it would take to fly ten million miles and for me, that would be about a thousand years. After Ryan Bingham made it, I thought the gesture of giving his married sister and her newlywed husband a trip around the world was pretty generous, but five hundred thousand miles? The circumference of the Earth is twenty five thousand miles, so you could make that trip twenty times, but who would want to? I thought that was a minor hitch in the script. <br/><br/>Anyway, Bingham learns what it's like to partake in the 'having loved and lost' game after years of noncommital relationships. Personally, I didn't get the chemistry between Bingham and Alex (Vera Fermiga); some reviewers thought she was gorgeous but I didn't think she photographed well at all. The encounter when Ryan made it to her home and realized she had a family was a real kick in the privates for a guy who had a one track mind about finally settling down. As for the character portrayed by Anna Kendrick, it was the perfect representation of a young millennial upstart who knows everything about everything until they meet the real world head on. What was awkward about her role in the story was the way she disappeared for a while when Ryan and Alex did the family wedding thing. <br/><br/>In retrospect, I don't get the Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. The Best Actor/Actress noms also didn't make sense to me, even if Clooney and Fermiga were competent in their portrayals. The story didn't seem to offer much in the way of consequence, but I did take away a few tips on packing for a short trip. I'll have to use them the next time I fly."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","2","24 February 2018"," Up In The Air lures you in with its witty humour, and then smacks you in the face with depression.
","Much like a plane, this flies past at a speedy pace and somehow takes loneliness to refreshingly elevate it to atmospheric levels. Such an easy watch, thanks to competent directing and writing from Jason Reitman. An experienced employee from a firm who is hired by companies to fire individuals is tasked with training a young rookie. During this process, her perspective of life and maturity slowly changes his attitude where loneliness and worthlessness are fragmented in his mind. A surprisingly meaty narrative that is executed decently. Receiving an opportunity to chase your dreams after getting fired, evoking opportunism and optimism. Generational communication which involves describing idealisms regarding love and life. The thin line between casual encounters and conjuring up a romance, provoking paranoia and jealousy. The disadvantages of living on the job having to travel constantly where luxuries and class overcome family and friends. Advancing technologies replacing the need for physical employees in the quaternary sector. All of the above are interesting aspects to a consistently engaging plot. Reitman's scripts allows dark humour to seep through cracks and enhance the characterisation of the film. And what a script this was! The juxtaposition between Natalie and Ryan provided witty banter and sarcastic debates, they felt relatable and their chemistry was conveyed naturally. A script that contains the line ""a cocoon of self-banishment"" is a winning script in my book. Acting was solid all round. Clooney was pretty much himself but Farmiga and Kendrick were electrifying in two very nuanced performances. Going from location to location does feel slightly repetitive, and the twenty minute wedding scene does slow down the pacing. But the small heartbreaking twist at the end was worth it. A thoroughly entertaining drama which provided both laughs and sentimentality."

","I wasn't expecting Up in the Air's last fifteen minutes to hit me like they did. But writer-director Jason Reitman's film packs a punch. The film follows Ryan Bingham, a corporate ""downsizer"" who spends the majority of his time traveling from city to city. Contrary to what one might think, Bingham enjoys the constant traveling. His Omaha apartment is bare and the 43 days that he had to spend there the year prior are described as ""miserable."" One night in Dallas, he meets Alex Goran, a traveling businesswoman, and the two immediately hit it off due to their similar lifestyles. George Clooney is in top form as the cynical Bingham, whose career has insulated him from human contact. His chemistry with Alex is palpable, exemplified by the twinkle in their eyes when they look at each other for the first time to the way that they interact when Bingham gives her a tour of his old high school.<br/><br/>Reitman's writing establishes the connection between these characters but Clooney and Vera Farmiga bring it to life. Farmiga herself delivers a performance that rivals Clooney's, magnificently capturing the sensuality and tenacity required to make her character work. And as a recent Cornell grad named Natalie Keener who has big plans for the future of the company that Bingham works for, Anna Kendrick delivers her best work to date. Keener accompanies Bingham on his travels in order to learn about the difficulties that he faces in telling workers that the company that they are working for has decided to unemploy them. In the process, Kendrick captures Keener's naivety remarkably, and we watch her wide-eyed enthusiasm fade away because of the draining task at hand.<br/><br/>Reitman succeeds brilliantly at transporting the audience right back to the late-2000s, bringing memories of the economic downturn back to the forefront. In a stroke of genius, Reitman interviewed dozens of recently laid-off workers and included segments of these interviews in the film. While they don't take up too much time, they do touch on the bitter realities of unemployment and the recession. However, the film is primarily a character study focused on Bingham, with existential undertones and moments of genuine hilarity. Because of his relationship with Alex (and to a lesser degree, his relationship with Keener), Bingham begins to let his cynical exterior fade away and falls in love, despite his aversion to marriage and lack of human connection. I suspect that it's this subtle shift in character that Reitman and Clooney so expertly portray that allowed for the last fifteen minutes of the film to land with such a brute emotional impact.<br/><br/>Up in the Air proved a more difficult watch than I was expecting. Not because it requires superior intellect to decode its jokes or anything of the like, but because it's deviously complex. The relationships between our three leads are one thing, but Reitman's willingness to comment on mass unemployment and human connection, all with an existential touch, is something else entirely. And all the way up to its unexpectedly moving (and somewhat devastating) conclusion, the film manages to delight and entertain.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 (Great)"

","Ask most people what they would do with an unexpected sum of money, and this answer will likely pop up quite a bit: travel the world. Well, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) gets to do exactly that...for his job.<br/><br/>Bingham, while ""up in the air"" 322 days out of the year, makes a living by firing people at the request of major corporations who would rather not do the dirty deed themselves. He seems to live a blissfully happy life, unburdened by the responsibilities of home & family, and enjoys his routine immensely. Until, that is, he meets someone just like him...Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Throw in spunky new sidekick Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), who sets out to change the way he does business, and Bingham is forced to re-evaluate all of life's priorities.<br/><br/>What really makes this film work is, much like Gran Torino, the unbiased nature of the storytelling (making it the exact opposite of a film like Avatar). Viewers are treated to two completely different sorts of life (both on the road and settling down at home) with all the pros and cons included, and must (through Bingham) come to their own conclusion about which life is more satisfactory.<br/><br/>The acting is also terrific, with Clooney doing what he's done for years and finding a good thespian match in Farmiga. However, it truly is young Kendrick who nearly steals the show with her energetic performance. Her character superbly represents the thoughts and feelings going through the heads/hearts of the viewers, questioning Bingham on nearly ever decision he makes. I don't say this too often about young people in the film business, but the sky is the limit for this woman based on this incredible performance.<br/><br/>Finally, a little anecdote about why this movie may touch you as it did me:<br/><br/>When I was five years old, my father played a little trick on me. He said he had a ""magic pill"" (a common vitamin, of course!) that would make me stay ""five forever"", allowing me to go to school and play with my toys ad infinitum. I took the bait hook, line, and sinker, but only after swallowing the pill were the consequences brought to my attention, such as seeing all my little friends grow up, always having to take naps, etc. After a bit of contemplation, I then chose the ""antidote"" to set things right again.<br/><br/>Filmmaker Jason Reitman operates under the same concept with ""Up in the Air"". We are first given a glance into the seemingly wonderful life of the man on the road, but only upon deeper introspection do we discover the true nature of his often lonely existence. What makes things interesting, of course, is the fact that his decision is much more meaningful than from some five year old.<br/><br/>Thus, I strongly recommend this to film fans of any and all kinds for its deep story and incredible acting. If, say, Avatar turned you off by its overly black-and-white themes, this is the antithesis."

","Up In The Air is directed by Jason Reitman, is based on the 2001 novel of the same name, written by Walter Kirn, and is so severely underrated.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) travels more than three hundred days a year going to companies and firing the people within them. His job and his airborne lifestyle are jeopardised by Cornell graduate, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), who seeks to revolutionise the industry through replacing the face to face interactions of laying off people with a web chat system. Clooney is tasked with introducing Natalie with the nature of his work.<br/><br/>Bingham's life revolves around distance; his job, where he delivers the bad news but without connection or care for the consequences; his constant flying from airport to airport; his lack of a home or family or friends; his cynical dismantling of the idea of marriage; his fixation on flying miles; even his use of text messaging and avoidance of phone calls. There's something ironic in how he cherishes 'Loyalty' to frequent flyer clubs but not to individuals.<br/><br/>The bubbly, optimistic Anna Kendrick and the professional, pragmatic George Clooney have a great dynamic contrast and great chemistry too.<br/><br/>The melancholy soundtrack complements the superficial nature of his life. The acoustic guitar and the almost moaning quality of the singing can be forlorn and tragic. Alex (Vera Farmiga), Bingham's love interest, reveals to him in more ways than one that he may enjoy life with somebody else. The vibrant scenes of the sister's wedding have warm colours and a hand-held camera which brings excitement and fullness to a life contrasted with coldness.<br/><br/>In many of the scenes where Bingham was 'doing his job' Reitman had non-actors, who were recently laid off themselves, share their emotions on screen. One million Americans had lost their jobs the previous year - people treated distantly by companies they had devoted their lives, their loyalty to; people whom others relied on and who relied on others to survive these trying, turbulent periods in their lives.<br/><br/>This film is about the value we put upon our relationships. Through it, we see what it would be like if we '...decided to live hub to hub with nothing, with nobody' (Jason Reitman). It may seem thrilling at first. In reality, unlike what Bingham says in his seminars, we humans are not sharks who live in solitude. We survive on support, love and loyalty. Bingham begins to realise this as he explains to a man considering to follow a similar path, that the memories we cherish are often ones we have shared."

He encourages first to let go of your things in order to move more freely, and next tells them to forget about their personal relationships, because they only anchor them down.<br/><br/>Ryan's lifestyle and personality don't allow for any long term relationships, and his job is centered around short bursts of human interaction, which he is good at. For instance, he meets Alex, a woman who is very similar to him in his lifestyle. Their first dialogue together shows their compatibility and they begin to meet every month or so. It is then a huge surprise when a new girl in his office named Natalie Keener presents a plan involving Internet video calls in which they fire employees in order to cut costs. This threatens Ryan's lifestyle of constantly moving, and the irony here is that despite how much Ryan moves around in his life, he can't handle a change to his system. <br/><br/>What he begins to realize through his travels with Natalie and his meet ups with Alex is that he shouldn't be alone. What currently drives him the most is his goal of getting 10,000,000 miles, but perhaps he finally found someone he can spend his life with. In many shots, Alex is shown above Ryan, as someone Ryan looks up to, unlike everything else in life, which he views from his comfortable chair in the sky.<br/><br/>He brings Alex to his sister's wedding, whom he barely knows, and he reveals a need to keep a meaningful relationship with his sister by asking to walk her down the aisle, but her fiance's uncle is already doing it. He doesn't realize that he is practically non-existent to them. He wants the positives of a long term relationship, but the lifestyle he's chosen has consumed him. Alex is the only person he has a chance with.<br/><br/>When Ryan is giving his speech to a room filled with people, he suddenly has a revelation. Unlike the past 2 seminars we have seen, the focus this time is not at all on the audience. The camera slowly closes in on Ryan, and before he can deliver his line about burning the backpack, he stops. When the camera cuts to behind him, his audience is completely out of focus. He is not there. He leaves and goes directly to Alex's house, finally realizing she is the one thing he doesn't want to let go.<br/><br/>She, however, has a life beyond her vacations. She has a home and a family, and is grounded by them. Ryan is her escape. Ryan, however isn't grounded by anything. He finally gets his 10 million miles, but it's not nearly what he expected it to be. It's ultimately more meaningless than marriage, which, while hard, is worth it. It keeps people motivated, while Ryan's 10 million mile goal was just a goal. Still, it's too late for him. He's gotta keep moving at this point, whether he wants to or not. The sad truth is that even if he wants to settle down, he can't catch up with those around him.<br/><br/>Natalie leaves the company, because, ironically, she can't handle goodbyes. This is why she detaches herself through video chat and text. Ryan remembers her however. He gives her a recommendation for her new job, but he must once again let go of his baggage and continue to move."
"SquigglyCrunch","10","1","2","25 August 2016"," Some of the Best Performances I've Seen in a While
","Up In the Air follows a man, Ryan, who fires people for a living. Then one day a young woman, Natalie, shows up with ideas to change the company. When she receives Ryan's disapproval, his boss sends the two out to work together so Ryan can prove to her that the old way is the best way. <br/><br/>This movie surprised me. I haven't been really impressed by any of the three main actors in this movie before (although I haven't seen many of their movies either). And after seeing Anna Kendrick in Twilight it was refreshing to see her in a role that she both fit and excelled in. She pulled off probably the best performance of this movie. She plays the uptight fresh-out-of-school top-of-her- class girl who thinks she can change the world without experiencing it. I've seen plenty of characters like this, but Kendrick tops them all. She manages to bring humanity to her performance, and makes her very professional character seem very real. It's actually quite refreshing. As for George Clooney, I think he's okay in the movies I've seen him in. And yet he fits this character perfectly and performs it just as well. As for Vera Farmiga, she's also great. It's hard to talk about their performances as much as Kendrick, but trust me. They're great. Every other performance was solid as well, just not as good as these three. <br/><br/>The relationship between Farmiga and Clooney is, while not developed a whole lot, very natural. They have fantastic chemistry together, and their characters clicked with me and with each other right away. So normally when I would've felt their relationship was rushed, I instead felt the opposite. <br/><br/>The characters portrayed by these actors are great. Their well- written, interesting, and like I briefly mentioned earlier, human. These characters are built somewhat around stereotypes, but the writing brings humanity to these stereotypes. The dialogue is realistic and extremely well delivered. <br/><br/>Generally I don't really like conventional movies, specifically ones that are overly happy. But with Up in the Air it doesn't matter because everything else is so great and the happiness actually works and makes sense with the story. <br/><br/>I particularly loved the ending. It's pretty emotional, and I felt myself starting to tear up a little. <br/><br/>To top all that off, the soundtrack is pretty good. At least I thought it was. It fit the movie pretty well too. <br/><br/>My one and only problem was with Jason Bateman. It's not that he wasn't good in this movie, but more that he was kind of out of place for some reason. I don't know why. His role is very small, however, and it didn't affect the movie at all really. It was more of a personal thing than anything else. <br/><br/>Overall Up in the Air is a pretty perfect movie. The actors are extremely competent, the writing is great, the characters are great, the movie is happily conventional with reason, the soundtrack is great, and it's got a great, emotional ending. I could list it's praises for ages, yet it's problems are pretty much nonexistent. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, your missing out."

","Up in the Air!!! The movie is about a man whose job is to travel across the country 24/7 and fire people from their job.

They travel together and what is movie really talks is about the being lonely, relationships, lifestyles and the choices we make in life. We all, at some point of our lives, crave for a partner, a companion, a friend who sticks around during the thick and thins. Ryan Bingham too is not an exception and feels the same for a person he meets in one of his travels. Alex, she is pragmatic yet subtle and somewhat matches to his lifestyle. They carry on a casual relationship. On the other hand, Natalie is quite stereotypical and doesn't agree with Ryan on his thoughts of a relationship. There are interesting dialogues in the film. But the climax is a little melancholic. He has a dream of making ten million miles and meeting the pilot personally and when he reaches to that point, he loses the excitement. Much to his dismay, he finds out"
"tahlerelizabeth","Null","1","2","24 April 2016"," Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) shows some powerlessness as Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) come into his life in two completely different ways.
","George Clooney plays the role of Ryan Bingham, who is a blunt, career-obsessed, uncommitted, single guy. He meets Alex Goran who is played by Vera Farmiga, at a hotel lounge and they begin noticing all of their similarities. She impacts Ryan's life and eventually helps him change his way of thinking. Then, Natalie Keener, played by Anna Kendrick, comes along. Natalie is hired in at the same company Ryan's works for to make some changes. These changes are the last thing Ryan wants to deal with.<br/><br/>The theme to this movie is whether or not a person can be truly happy with themselves and their life without having interaction or commitments with loved ones and friends. The film proves that people get carried away with their career and sometimes do not even notice how it can be affecting their life. The main character, Ryan, was so used to traveling for his career that he learned to love it. He didn't think he would ever want it any other way. It was all he was used to. His way of thinking started to change as he was faced with many new obstacles in a short period of time.<br/><br/>There are special lighting effects used for brief moments in the film. The scenes in the hotel have a dark background. The main focus is the looks on Ryan and Alex's faces. We are reading their minds a little by watching their facial expressions when the two talk in the lounge. Another example of when the lighting in dark is when Ryan is giving his so-called motivational speeches. The moods in these scenes are set by the way the lighting is. <br/><br/>Another technique in this film is angle. I noticed right away that Ryan looked so small walking through the airports. These are not home for him although he says he might as well call them his home. The camera was always facing down on Ryan to make him look small. When Ryan is firing people or giving his speeches, the camera angle made him seem taller and bigger. He was in charge in these scenes.<br/><br/>Being able to make changes and take chances in life are very important. Making commitments in life are also necessary; whether it be with family, relationships, or with a career. Unlike Ryan's motivational speeches in the film, the more commitments a person has, the more their life is fulfilled. Humans need other human interaction. This theory was proved to be true in this film."

"DavidLuo","10","1","2","9 April 2014"," I'm From Here:A Mid-life Passage
","""I'm from here."" When I heard Ryan said this line in the later of the movie, I recognize that this is a similar story just like Lord Of War or Breaking Bad, where toward the end of each story, the protagonist will always say something like ""I just good at it"", or ""I just like it"", meaning: acceptance of himself, no more fancy theories.<br/><br/>Just like those guys who are suffering from a life problem, Ryan tried as well to solve his own, but in a wrong way. He's really professional at work, however, he thought he's quite different than other ordinary people. He gave himself an air millage target, he developed a theory to motivate himself and gave speeches, which actually and ironically, is the source of his inner conflict, e.g., no marriage, no children, etc, etc. This inner conflict let him act twisted. He cannot accept firing people through internet, he felt funny when nephew wanted him to take photographs without being there herself, he thought being grounded is suffering.<br/><br/>There are three stories there. (1) nephew's wedding (2) meet with Alex (3) The ""B story"" with Natalie. Through all these stories, Ryan found that people actually do care about the solid face to face relationship. Natalie felt sad when her boyfriend broken up with her via text message. Ryan's boss felt offended when Natalie quit her job by text message. Alex did what she meant (honestly, sad to say that), not like Ryan, he himself didn't mean what he said at first place in this relationship ...<br/><br/>Finally, Ryan let go his fancy theory of back-package, gave up some of his millage, he understood that this is the life style he wanted. He choose to accept who he is. He understood he will cherish face to face solid personal connection, no matter if it's a failure (Alex), or even a disaster (employee committed suicide). He wrote a recommendation letter for Natalie in the ""old fashion"" way. He solved his inner conflict, he reaches the airport and will continue his life.<br/><br/>The theme of this film is a little bit subtle, and I admit that I was expecting some other type of story when even reach the mid point of the movie. From the start, I thought it would be a story something like ""a guy who lives on firing other people got fired himself"", (you know, like other popular themes such as ""save a sinking soul on a sinking ship"" Titanic, or, ""to manipulate someone else's dream when his own dream is in a mess"" Inception, or, ""there's no magic in a magic"" The Prestige....). If the theme goes that way, it will be a totally different story. I guess some people may be misguided by these popular themes and therefore they may have missed a great movie.<br/><br/>This is a thoughtful movie. The characters are well built. Dialogues are great. It's a movie worth viewed twice or more. I recommend it."
"mjcfoxx","8","1","2","1 August 2013"," It's Lonely Up There
","There's a lot of people out there that are so afraid of being alone, or feel so pressured to aspire to certain merits, or just feel the most comfortable meeting someone, marrying them, and making a family. Then there are other people out there who prefer isolating themselves, keeping their emotional connections tenuous and living in the perfectly controlled world of zero social responsibility. They work, they love their job, and they fulfill vaguely relationshipy things that eventually fade out. George Clooney (who is either terribly unhappy or just really enjoys acting sad in his movies) is Ryan Bingham, and Ryan Bingham has a backpack he wants to burn and a pink slip he wants to give you. He has women in his life: those he avoids because they represent too many emotional connections, and those he sees casually they come and go with the wind. It's a certain one in particular, a new coworker played by Anna Kendrick, who knocks him off his rhythm and inadvertently forces him to ask questions he's been avoiding all his life. She's an idealist: young, brilliant, and horribly naive. For all intents and purposes, she essentially ruins his life. It's by pure accident and we essentially watch him give birth to himself. It's beautiful and messy and it's rather unfortunate that the film ends with the baby in a basket, so to speak. But a sequel to this film would end up being a Hallmark Movie of the Week, and those are too gushy for this cynical, bittersweet piece. Vera Farmiga is delicious in this movie up until a random point that, while well told, I don't agree with. Anna Kendrick is adorable as always and Clooney manages to once again skirt that line between godlike and everyman that just leaves you in tatters. He's like Cary Grant with just the perfect pinch of Gary Cooper."

","Corporate America is verging on collapse with the housing market in turmoil, automotive industry in free-fall and no veritable option for recovery in sight. Life couldn't be better for high flying Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who spends some 320 days per year traversing the country being paid heavy cash for firing people. Living out of a suitcase the ultimate goal for Ryan is collecting 10,000,000 frequent flier points at American Airlines (already being a Concierge member) to receive the vaunted privilege of being only the seventh person ever to reach this total. Loyalty is never cheap, and Ryan offers his to various programmes, never to people, only ever entering into casual on-road relationships, like with Alex (Vera Farmiga). When confronted with the niggling possibility that his line of business will become stationery due to tele-conference technology forwarded by young, but brash new recruit Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), Ryan must confront his lifestyle with the reality of whether having an empty backpack truly brings him satisfaction.<br/><br/>Since ""Thank You For Smoking"" and ""Juno"" Jason Reitman's witty, if sometimes dry humour has brought him to the forefront of comedic-drama directors. However his first features, however blessed with undeniable charm, lacked a conscious moral backbone, which brought together the story and incorporated a clear message. ""Up in the Air"", filmed on the basis of the same-titled novel by Walter Kirn, borrows the premise and is contextualised by the author's work. The Reitman brothers script helps focus the attention and introduces wry wit to create a cohesive story attacking key aspects of human life, aspiring to answer questions of what is important, what is true happiness. Maybe somewhat of an overreach and the philosophical credentials of both source material and Reitman aren't notable enough to attack these issues with intellectual gusto. Nonetheless the movie takes on meaning of life questions with true emotional intent, never relenting and rarely dropping focus.<br/><br/>Clooney gives a powerful performance, as the cool self-centred man in the clouds, detached from possessions and stability, instead dedicated to ever soaring: living requires movement. Opposite her are offered two stances. One of a middle-aged female, for which travel is a mere escape, not a way of life - no strings attached, frivolous and meaningless. The other of the youthful Natalie, who lacks experience, but never fervour to change. Her person is key as she indicates a starting point (of Alex and Ryan 15-20 years in the past) - full of hope, exuberance and lack of perception in regards to the bigger picture. Despite her career push Natalie is burdened by her emotionality and lack of control or understanding of human needs. Meanwhile the wiser Ryan, despite reneging on leading a life 'hampered' by objects and persons, has a wider outlook, in someway deciding to live a vagabond life in order to never having to be the 'person on the other side of the table'. He escapes a so-called stable life, understanding how all-engulfing commitment is and how painful it can be. Both Natalie and Ryan have there points - the movie offering a meeting point somewhere mid-way, far from a fairy-tale and easy options. The outro of real-life interviews with people losing their jobs offers a substantial culmination - life may not be a bed of roses, but all in all when memories of happy times are brought about a second person is always involved, not frequent flier miles or computer screens."

","Up In The Air is a comedy/drama film that stars George Clooney,Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick.It is a story about a corporate ""downsizer"" Ryan Bingham and his travels. The film follows his isolated life and philosophies along with the people he meets along the way.It was directed by Jason Reitman and co-written by Reitman and Sheldon Turner based on the novel of the title that was written by Walter Kirn.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (Clooney)makes his living personally handing out pink slips -- he's the top hatchet man at a company that other companies hire when they are downsizing. And since business is booming, his job keeps him on the go constantly. He flies all across the country, staying in a series of nice hotels. And although this itinerant lifestyle prevents him from having any kind of stable, regular life, this doesn't bother him in the slightest -- he's thrilled to be a boy in a traveling bubble. During one particular layover, he strikes up a conversation with Alex Goran (Farmiga), a fellow savvy traveler. They bond over the ins and outs of various airlines and hotels, and quickly fall into bed. By morning, they are figuring out when their schedules will allow them to meet up again, even though they both make it clear that there are no strings attached. When Ryan arrives back in the home office, he meets no-nonsense career- oriented twenty-something Natalie Keener (Kendrick), a fast-rising up- and-comer who wants to change the company's practices and save millions by having the staff fire people remotely via web cams. Furious at the thought of losing a lifestyle he's grown quite comfortable with, he convinces his boss to let him take Natalie on a few trips so that she can learn what it's really like to fire someone.<br/><br/>George Clooney is thoroughly likable as the amusingly callous Ray.Watching him at the heart-breaking job of terminating folk is fun and gives the film its heart.The other women - Farmiga and Kendrick - also provide memorable performances.<br/><br/>What makes it a wonderful film is the fact that it succeeds because it doesn't take itself that seriously and it shows a moment of fundamental change in a man's life that every viewer could probably relate to as he/she have lost a job which happens to be a common thing especially with the United States experiencing an economic downturn.<br/><br/>Overall,the movie delivers and a classic in the making."
"estreet-eva","6","1","2","5 December 2011"," Except ""The Blind Side"", the least of the Best Picture Oscar noms.
","During late 2008 through 2009 the unemployment rolls swelled so much that 1 out of 10 Americans were out of work, a number that understates the problem because it leaves out those who have given up and either stopped looking or took low level hourly work. The most relevant number is more like 1 in 6. Against this backdrop, Jason Reitman's drama about a professional corporate hit-man couldn't be more topical, unfortunately this relevance has lead a lot of critics to overestimate the film. My major issue with the story is the ""Sixth Sense"" twist near the end. George Clooney's Ryan Bingham's torrid romance with a similarly transient Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) is portrayed as very intimate (the film's R content comes largely from a single full dorsal nudity shot of Vera) so without spoiling the ending, shouldn't Ryan have seen some evidence of the twist. Also, given the constant interruption of cell phones, how was this secret held through the extended time they spend together at the sister's wedding. Also the critic's comparisons of the dialogue to old Billy Wilder movies (although this film reminded me most of ""Desk Set"" with was a Walter Lang film) seems a little generous. When it is talking about the business of firing people and travelling to do it, there are a number of sarcastic laughs and sharp insights but otherwise the script often drifts. Also, Ryan has a side business as a motivational speaker where he urges people to drop their burdensome attachments (something he has done to the point of hermetic airborne isolation). Doesn't real motivational speaking involve trying to get people to assume burdensome attachment? Having whined for about 300 words, I will say that the story's cynical and world-weary view of human relationships as we enter the teens very much as ""Sideways"" (among my favorite 3 films of all time) captured the earliest parts of the millennium's zeitgeist of over-indulgence, self-deception and unfulfilled dreams. In summary, I would say urge anyone over 35 to see the movie and warn anyone younger against it -- as far as you know your marriage will hold, your employer will take care of you when you get older and technological progress is always an improvement. You can wait to find out there is no Santa Clause."
"rpennyw","9","1","2","7 March 2011"," An exceptional film that hits home for many viewers
","I find myself thinking about this film quite often since I first saw it months ago. Ryan Bingham's job is to fly all over the country and fire employees for companies who do not want to deal with it themselves. Bingham prides himself on the amount of flight time he has logged over the years. He avoids returning home if at all possible, and because of this, has little social life to speak of. He is a loner and prefers it that way. Then he meets a woman on his travels and begins to fall for her.<br/><br/>I think my fondness for this film comes from the fact that it hits home so hard for me. My life is nothing like Bingham's, but the overall themes of his experiences mirror my life, and I believe, the life of most anyone who would watch this film today.<br/><br/>""Up In The Air"" exposes Bingham's fear of attachment, and his lack of trust for other people. In today's busy world of ""get there first"" I think many people can relate to this, as so many people seem to only take note of another person if he/she can use him/her for personal gain.<br/><br/>In perhaps the hardest hitting message of this film, Bingham finds out the woman he has fallen in love with is married and has only been using him for an escape. This echoes an all too sad truth of today's world, where love seems to be a forgotten emotion. With constant pressure to do more and experience everything, people don't seem to have the time to truly love anymore. BIngham lets down his guard for a chance at love and gets burned.<br/><br/>This film speaks true and I highly recommend it."

","I'm not sure what percentage of movies are about the complexity of meeting the right person in this day and age, but it's got to be 30 percent or more. I find it interesting how these kinds of films have evolved over the years, from the simplistic, hyper-romantic films you got pre-1970s to movies like Up in the Air and Love and Other Drugs, both of which are good movies.<br/><br/>Recently I saw When Harry Met Sally again and loved it, but what made that film interesting at the time was the non-traditional way the two main characters came together, first disliking each other on a road trip, meeting in an airport and then finally becoming friends despite Billy Crystal's relationship law #1 that ""men and women cannot be friends."" I loved When Harry Met Sally, but it's amazing that in just 20 years that film's dated that story's plot now seems when compared with Up in the Air, which follows the life of Ryan, a professional hit man, who flies from city to city firing people instead of killing them.<br/><br/>He's good at his job and enjoys traveling all over the country, amassing frequent flier miles while easing people out of their jobs. At some point along the way, Ryan (played by George Clooney) he meets the character played by Vera Farmiga, a fellow business traveler. After a nice little fling, they decided to synchronize their schedules when possible so they can continue their ""casual"" relationship whenever they can. But as the story moves along, you see Clooney's character start to question his philosophy of life (it's easier to travel with an empty backpack than a full one) as he begins developing a deeper interest in Farmiga's character, something he eventually decides he wants to pursue beyond the limits of hotel rooms. It's a nice, subtle film that's well acted and scripted, painting what I think is a fairly realistic, yet entertaining, picture of the complexity of white-collar relationships.<br/><br/>I'm guessing Love and Other Drugs, UP in the Air and 500 Days (of Summer) simply reflect back to the audience the changing nature of relationships. If you liked any of those films, DO NOT SEE the movie It's Complicated, one of the worst and most predictable films I've seen in years. Trust me on this."

","So, do you want a movie that has a nice tidy ending where everybody lives happily ever after? How about a movie where promiscuity is demonized? Or a movie where corporate America is the bad guy? OK, maybe one where the protagonist (ie hero in most movies), has an awakening and ends up better off for it? Sorry, this movie is not for you. But do you want a movie that mostly is a slice of real life, with people facing real problems, and reacting to them like people in the rest of the country do? Where everything is not nicely tied (or tidied) up like most Hollywood fantasies? Maybe you want a movie that gets you thinking about relationships, and what having a job - or losing it - means, and how important families can be.<br/><br/>Or maybe a movie showing the disengagement too many people are having in the early 21st century as the workplace and jobs go through monumental changes.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, an employee of a third party company that is hired to fire people and flies around the country doing so, so the the company actually responsible for the firing can keep their hands clean of something they know in their hearts is very dirty business. (I've been through that process) He's a professional and goes about it professionally, meeting people face to face, gauging their reactions and changing his delivery depending on how the person is taking it.<br/><br/>A new kid on the block shows up in the person of Natalie Keener, a recent business school graduate who wants to depersonalize the firing (if it isn't already!) by using internet virtual meeting rooms and web cams to do the firing, which will put Ryan out of a job.<br/><br/>Ryan only does two positive things in the movie, he talks his future brother-in-law, who gets cold feet on the day of his wedding, to go through with it, and he writes a letter of recommendation for Natalie which sells her to the company she applies to after quitting her job at Ryan's company, because she thinks she somehow failed. And that's about it. The rest of the movie is a study in mostly disconnected relationships and how people cope.<br/><br/>***spoiler here*** At the end of the movie, Ryan is back doing his job, because he is really good at it, and he knows it. And he is wanted because of it.<br/><br/>There's a love interest, played, to me anyway, quite well by Vera Farmiga. She knows exactly what she wants out of life, and exactly where Ryan's character fits (). And it's obvious some reviewers feel uneasy about an independent sexually active woman who is not somehow made to be villainous.<br/><br/>Not a 10 by a long shot, but a decent little movie about one slice of life. And guess what? Most of our lives and future seem to be up in the air more than we would like."

This is a question that we all ask, and a question we all have different answers to. ""Up in the Air"" has an idea of what that answer may be, and unfortunately, our protagonist, Mr. Bingham, isn't able to figure it out.<br/><br/>The story begins with a rapid pace, showing the everyday life of Ryan Bingham-- a man whose only goal is to reach 10 million sky miles. This is a goal that keeps his motivational clock ticking and gives him a sense of purpose in a world he believes to be full of people clinging to ideas that just don't make sense.<br/><br/>He is able to attain this goal because of his job. He fires people for a living. He flies from city to city and does the job that his boss is too passive and insensitive to do.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the story, Bingham actually believes he is happy. He believes this because he doesn't know any other way. He has lived his life from hotel to hotel and from plane to plane for so long, he considers it home. He meets a woman named Alex that has similar ambitions and style. They flirt and have a one night stand and decide to continue the casual relationship.<br/><br/>His boss calls all of the termination specialists into the head office to discuss a change of pace. A new and young employee by the name of Natalie Keener has proposed an idea to fire people via video chat on the Internet. This immediately frightens the heck out of Bingham, and he does not want his home snatched away from him like that. The boss suggests that Bingham show Keener the ropes of firing.<br/><br/>Bingham's relationship with Alex continues to grow and he seriously starts to feel emotional even though he brushes it off consciously. Keener starts to confront Bingham about his lifestyle, and Bingham claims to not care about emotion or love. Keener's words seeped into Bingham's subconscious because he suddenly decided to start following his heart for the first time in his life.<br/><br/>It's almost like Bingham is in high school and is experiencing all of this exciting emotion for the first time, but we feel it too. We see a certain skip in his step and a smile in his formerly stern face. Unfortunately, the world isn't so gracious to Ryan Bingham, and he finds out who he is, and who he used to be.<br/><br/>The film seems to be a stereotypical love drama for the first half or so. Then it turns into something else. It turns into a film that makes you think about where society is at this point in time. It's a film that makes you wonder how cruel and hopeless the world can be. The story ends on a bittersweet note though, with Bingham staring at the destination board at the airport. We don't know where Bingham is heading, but I have a feeling it's not to fire someone."

Brings to mind an intro Neil Young once gave, in concert, before starting the tune 'Don't Let it Bring You Down'. ""This song starts off kinda slow, and then fizzles out altogether."" If you have recently lost your job, or worse, think you're about to... Do NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Or, at least remove razor blades, shotguns, and horse-sedating barbiturates from your home, first.<br/><br/>Clooney and the cast do an admirable job, but it's not a 'fun watch'. And the ending... Jeez, guys. I mean... did you have to actually... ummm... Nevermind. Watch only if you've just won the lottery, or been told by the Dalai Lama that your karma is running no risk of running over your dogma. Back in the 60's, I believe we would've called this move a ""bummer"". Oh yeah..."

"diac228","7","1","2","9 June 2010"," Up in the Air is a decent flight with an extremely rough landing
","There is nothing pretty about the current economic crisis out here in the United States. For whatever the reason (and this will be a totally separate argument), most of your small and big businesses are dropping people like unwanted flies, and at a very dangerous rate. To find any sort of charm or humor in all this is extremely difficult, yet Up in the Air manages to loosely pull it off. This film is a charming little adult movie about a man's job and his unique lifestyle. The third film from Jason Reitman is entertaining; full of great acting, but like Juno stretches the running time just a bit much. Slicing a major portion of the movie aside, Up in the Air is fun to watch, and provides a lot of insight into today's cruel business world.<br/><br/>Up in the Air follows a businessman (George Clooney) whose job is to fly to different parts of the country, to different businesses to fire people when the actual bosses do not have the guts to do the job themselves. This sort of life requires cynicism and a lack of personal connection. But, his boss (Jason Bateman) hires a young and up-and-coming businesswoman (Anna Kendrick) that develops a way to fire people without all the flying. Before the new technique of terminating people takes place, Ryan takes Natalie on a tour of how his business life is. Along the way they run into a beautiful older woman (Vera Farmiga) that starts a casual relationship with Ryan. Based off of a novel by Walter Kirn, this movie's screenplay was written by the director as well, with some added touches by Sheldon Turner.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman's best ability as director is pulling excellent performances out of his cast. Whether the roles are small or large, every actor and actress did a fantastic job in this movie; and let's not forget the sympathetic performances of the people that were fired in real-life. George Clooney once again shines in his new-school Cary Grant-like performance as a man with a lot of vulnerability, but hides it in his charm, suave cockiness, and winning smile. Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick are strong female leads that went toe-to-toe with Clooney and did not disappoint. Kendrick, being so young, was the more impressive of the performances by remaining very likable in spite of her tough personality. Keep an eye out on J.K. Simmons for his fantastic few moments as a father of two getting fired.<br/><br/>In adult dramas like these, the writing is pivotal in propelling the acting performances and the realism of the entire piece. Bateman heads back to the typewriter after directing someone else's decent script with Juno. Just like in Thank You for Smoking, the plot was simple, but dwells much deeper into the motivations, mannerisms, actions, and reactions of all the characters involved. The dialogue was great, some of the conversations were slick and hilarious and not one work was put out of place. Up in the Air also has a share of great one-liners and monologues.<br/><br/>The directing of this movie was nothing special, but gets the job done. There are some wonderful shots of the cities featured and wonderful sights above the skies, but the directing is mostly focused on human emotions and pacing of the conversations and revelations. In the first two-thirds of the movie, it works out well. The movie paces itself nicely, and was entertaining, even when some scenes were heartbreaking (Firing someone always leads to emotional moments). And then came the final third.<br/><br/>Falling into the trap of most decent movies that have trouble wrapping up (Cast Away being my personal favorite example), Up in the Air begins to stumble in the later scenes when Ryan tries patching up old wounds. These elongated scenes slowed the pace a bit, lost its clever bite, and even contradicted itself a little in terms of content. When the career didn't become the focus of the movie, it became a bit jarring and stale. Then by the time the plot shifts back to the career, it becomes very rushed, and the ending appears right around the corner. The resolutions fly in out of nowhere and before you know it, the credits are rolling. Some of this might be exaggeration, but in a movie where dialogue runs rampant and action is limited, off-screen major events was not expected.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Up in the Air was fun, entertaining, lightweight dramedy for the adults. That is, until the final third when the movie shifts a little, and then bolts towards the exit. The only blame for this change of pace was the editing team and the writer—which happens to be the director. Movies do not have to run two hours, excellent 90-minute movies can indeed occur (Up, the best movie in 2009, was a mere 96 minutes). If Up in the Air had paced itself to be such a length, it would have been a much better film, supported by slick dialogue and fantastic acting, with a hintage of subtle criticism and clever commentary on current events. Unfortunately, we have a misguided third act that was a fraction as good as the first two acts. Overall Up in the Air is a decent film, but nothing fantastic or Best Picture Nominee worthy."
"callanvass","7","1","2","4 May 2010"," Honestly? I didn't get what all the fuss was about, even if I did enjoy the performances.
","Up in the Air is a well made movie, it's acted wonderfully it's just a lot of time it just seemed to be very bland for my tastes. For starters I didn't really feel satisfied with the whole story set up and in the end it didn't really go anywhere either. Ryan Bingham's character isn't that easy to root for. He fires people on a daily basis doesn't seem to show really any remorse from it, and he seems to be quite self-centered until Vera Farmiga's character shows up. The movie itself is very cold, watching all these decent people get laid off from their jobs wasn't very fun at all to watch, it's just a very depressing movie in my opinion. While George Clooney isn't a favorite of mine, he can be quite a good actor when presented with the right script, but it just seemed to be trying too hard, and I had trouble getting into all the hype. Anna Kendrick is by far the best hidden thing about this movie, and her performance was absolutely fantastic. Up in the Air is yet another major Oscar contender that has disappointed me, I just didn't see the point in it all, even if it had its moments.<br/><br/>Performances. George Clooney's charisma is enough to get you by the movie, but his character is distant from the world, and he is really hard to garner sympathy for. Vera Farmiga is good when she's on-screen, but her actions at the end disgusted me. Anna Kendrick is adorable plain and simple, her character is the reason I was able to enjoy a bit of this. Lots of famous faces appear like Sam Elliot, J.K Simmons, Danny McBride.<br/><br/>Bottom line. I know I've not given more criticism than praise to Up in the Air, but that does not mean I think it's a bad movie, it just left me feeling very cold. It's well worth a viewing just don't expect an Oscar worthy one.<br/><br/>7/10"
"dromasca","5","1","2","22 April 2010"," Thin Air
","I fail to get enthusiastic about 'Up in the Air'. It may be because corporate life is no strange thing to me, it may be because romantic comedies or professional dramas are not my piece of cake, it may be because I was starting to develop so high expectations about George Clooney that seeing a film where he is just good, and not better than in a previous one comes as a disappointment.<br/><br/>Or maybe it is the subject. Firing people from their jobs ('terminating' them as the euphemism goes in this film) is no laughing matter and even if it was unavoidable that it becomes subject to a major movie some day, the intermingling of this theme with a few other (like life of the big corporate travelers addicted to their frequent fliers programs, or the romantic theme of the eternal bachelor facing mid-life crisis and catching the opportunity to make a change towards the conventional track) did not really work to me. The story of corporate job terminator Bingham (Clooney) facing the termination or at least radical change of his own job because of the appearance in his own company of rookie Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who tries to revolutionize the business endangering his jet style of life while his personal life seems to be at pick when he meets his female mirrored image in Alex (Vera Famiga) combines several conventional threads, and cannot make out of the combination an original movie.<br/><br/>I do not have anything special to say about what director Jason Reitman does for most of the time - he does a fair job but having Clooney in the lead role is like coaching a soccer team with Messi in the opening squad. Actually Clooney although well cast does not do anything special, he just plays his own role - enough for a good performance, disappointing if we consider how well he changed skins in most of his films lately. Famiga is OK, and only Anna Kendrick succeeds to break the ranks and to bring to skin an emotional ingénue which crosses the screen in a sincere interpretation.<br/><br/>The best part of the film are the one shot scenes of people being fired. It is here that Reitman had his touch of genius. He put an add in a St. Louis newspaper and gather real people who lost their jobs recently, and enacted their feelings and emotions in the moments when they received the hit for the camera. These are the moments when we feel the true life, these are the scenes when we can understand the dramas that take place at the personal level, part of the bigger picture drama of the economic crisis that engulfed America. This is actually the best cinema in this film, the rest is just Hollywood wrapping."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","1","2","12 April 2010"," Likable bastards galore
","The four main characters in ""Up In The Air"" are all bastards. George Clooney's job is to fire people. He works for a firm run by Jason Bateman. The firm is hired by companies who don't have the guts to fire their own employees. Anna Kendrick is a new employee who comes up with a new method of doing the firing which is even more heartless than the way the company has been doing it. Vera Farmiga is a woman Clooney meets in a hotel bar while on the road.<br/><br/>Clooney is likable as the heartless bastard who has no family, no real permanent address and whose goal is to reach a multi-million mile travel mark with the airlines and the rewards that it brings.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman is the likable bastard who runs the firm.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is the cute, perky, likable,heartless bastard whose new idea is even more cruel than the firm's original way of working.<br/><br/>The movie is entirely watchable and makes its point. But it is definitely without much substance. You enjoy it while watching it but when it's over there's nothing to think about. In most ways it makes being a heartless bastard look like a viable career choice. After all, it is Clooney who has a good paying job and the firm he works for certainly looks prosperous. Whose side is this film really on? It appears to be a message movie with the obvious message that corporations are so heartless they can't even fire their own people and have to hire some lackey to do it. But it portrays Clooney's life as actually kind of cool. He never has to pay for anything out of pocket, he has a gazillion company credit cards, he doesn't have to wait in long lines at the airport like the rest of us, and he meets sexy women like Vera Farminga along the way. <br/><br/>I'll take Clooney's job."
"treeline1","Null","1","2","9 April 2010"," ""Your position is no longer available.""
","Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) job is to fly around the country and fire people for companies who don't want to do it themselves. He likes his work and his life, which is uncomplicated by relationships or domestic demands. On one stop-over, however, Ryan meets a female version of himself (Vera Farmiga) and sparks fly.<br/><br/>The success of this movie must be due entirely to the charm of its leading man, because it is in no other way unusual or special. Clooney is indeed quite likable playing a handsome, confident, smooth-talker while Farmiga is good in an undemanding role (but not worthy of an Oscar nomination, in my opinion). The plot is pleasant enough, but hardly memorable, so I don't understand all the hype. It was just okay for me."
"colinrgeorge","8","1","2","6 April 2010"," ""Up in the Air""
","The problem with films hyped as award vehicles is that you watch them differently. I didn't have the opportunity to see Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" on the festival circuit, so my interpretation comes pre-masticated by critics who heralded it as the film to beat come Oscar season. Those accounts peeled back the layers of genuine surprise I might have felt in the theater, warping the profound into the expected, and left me with the pit. Forgive me if I'm playing catch-up.<br/><br/>It's not that Reitman's third film, following ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno,"" is outright disappointing. On the contrary, ""Up in the Air"" has vivid characters, fine performances, and a timely, good-humored recession-oriented story. In short, I agree with most of the praise the film has garnered, so why do I have this inclination to shrug it off as merely 'good?' I think because it simply failed to surprise me. So in the interest of salvaging the opinions of future viewers, I intend to part with as few hard details as can be spared in the following paragraphs. I hope for this analysis to be the perfect mediation between your expectations and what is often a frank and charming, if formulaic, comedy.<br/><br/>The pieces are all in place. You know what to expect from a George Clooney performance, and with ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" still playing theatrically, you needn't look far if not. He plays Ryan Bingham, a jet-setting corporate lay-off guru whose cherished lifestyle is threatened when an overeager young businesswoman (Anna Kendrick) devises a revolutionary video-conferencing system that will allow Bingham to work from the last place he would ever want to--home. The screenplay presents a straightforward, nearly transparent story, which is fortunately vitalized by the likes of Clooney and his love interest (Vera Farmiga), under the amiable sway of Reitman's direction. The narrative rigidity jiggers with the pacing later on the film, however, with false endings and climaxes that betray the structure of the rest of it. But unlike the Coens' ""A Serious Man,"" which easily shoulders a jackknife narrative that keeps its audience entertained and guessing, ""Up in the Air"" doesn't feel like a deliberate build, it feels, maybe appropriately, lost.<br/><br/>Regardless, to harp only on its structural shortcomings is to ignore the film's most important aspect: its timeliness. As a cinematic snapshot of 2009, nothing else really comes close, and that's a big reason why it's a front-runner on so many best-of lists, my own (probably) included. What does it mean to lose your job? What does it mean when the guy who told you that you lost your job might lose his job? These are the themes scratching below the surface of ""Up in the Air,"" but which unfortunately never penetrate in any immediately meaningful way. Rather, they render the film a shorthand for our recession, our attitudes, and our relationships now.<br/><br/>Ironically, it gets to a point where I have to agree that this is the film to beat come Oscar season. I'd like to say that slathering it with superlatives on the merits of cultural relevance alone would be like giving ""Crash"" an Oscar just for addressing racism. But oh, wait.<br/><br/>It isn't just social context that makes ""Up in the Air"" look like a best picture to-be. Like 2007's ""No Country for Old Men,"" or 2008's ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" Oscar will love Jason Reitman's latest because it's a safe, inoffensive choice. I'm gonna go ahead and call it. It's not as violent as ""Inglourious Basterds"" or as contentedly anti-commercial as ""A Serious Man,"" and though I would not be so pretentious as to suggest any of the above winners are unworthy of consideration in a discussion of great film (except ""Crash""), the important, polarizing masterpieces that challenge convention are rarely, if ever, afforded cinema's highest honor. It's the broad strokes of vague emotion and unanimous praise, however reserved, that means pay dirt.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" is a perfectly fine film, well above average, smartly cast, and consistently enjoyable. It never sticks more than a trembling finger outside of the box, but does well with an established formula in painting a postcard of America at its least assured.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it a great film, but it's a significant one, and one I fully expect to hear read aloud this coming March 7th. But then again, it has one last chance to surprise me."
"manicman84","8","1","2","25 March 2010"," smarter than your average dramedy
","While it doesn't achieve the status of masterpiece, this is another very solid dramedy from Jason Reitman, a gifted filmmaker who proves not to be overshadowed by his father's persona any more. Up In The Air is far from being hysterically funny, yet its clever script happens to be timely due to the economical crisis. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is one of the top employees of the agency that dismisses people. Thus, he is always on the run flying to different parts of the US. During the course of time he meets two women who are about to change his viewpoint on becoming involved in the romantic relationship. The story is fluidly told and never ceases to be gripping. Reitman superbly balances the two subplots concerning dismissing people and Ryan's affair building to the climax that involves a surprising, well-calculated twist. George Clooney is graceful, if slightly underwhelming delivering some over-intelectualized lines even through voice-over. Once he gets criticized for it by his new co-worker Natalie Keener played by splendid Anna Kendrick. Both she and Vera Farmiga as Clooney's love interest are both amazing displaying unique characters with totally distinct features. Although Reitman's direction is always compelling, he still overuses sloppy indie music I dislike so much. Overall, Up In The Air lacks the edge and controversy to be classic in my view. It's still way smarter than your average dramedy."

This was because of a needless weak song score, especially the opening credits, 'My Land is Your Land' should never be done to a rock melody, The song is a patriotic song & should be played & sung as one.<br/><br/>I really doubt there are firms such as depicted in this film.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","6 March 2010"," Three themes / story lines
","Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) has the worst job possible, not physically (such as autopsy assistant) but mentally – he flies to any US city where a corporation needs a professional expert to fire its employee(s) face-to-face. Well, physically too for people who abhor flying, as this job requires spending a huge amount of time on a plane. To Ryan, however, this is paradise. He enjoys living out of a suitcase; a flight cabinet is home to him. He also has the mental maturity and toughness to handle, sometimes on an hourly basis, people in all sorts of emotional distress, breakdown or outburst imaginable. While to lesser beings this sort of experience would be devastating, to Ryan it is just a day in the office. So he carries on merrily, until two women enter his life, separately but almost simultaneously.<br/><br/>My summary line mentions three themes. I'll start with the least significant, the modern lifestyle of frequent flying. As mentioned, Ryan enjoys everything about it – his own efficient system of packing and getting through security lines, as well as the special attention he gets at air terminals as a frequent flyer. His one big ambition is to reach 10 million miles when he will become the 7th person (if nobody beats him to it) in the world to receive that special, elite card, delivered by the captain during the flight right at his seat (hope the co-pilot is good). He also shares a special empathy with people in the same boat (sorry, should be same plane), one of whom is Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), a charming, sophisticated, intelligent avid business woman met in a chance encounter (in a hotel lounge) which develops into in series of romantic rendezvous whenever their schedules reveal a convergence in a city. This is casual, sophisticated, no-string-attached romance that both enjoy.<br/><br/>Another theme is the cruel corporate reality of letting people go. When the economy gets bad, Ryan's boss Craig Gregory (a pitch-perfect Jason Bateman) beams. But the company faces the problem of steeply rising travelling cost. In comes Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), Stanford fresh grad and overachiever, with a revolutionary proposal of doing all the firing over the computer. Craig recalls all his people on the road to hear her presentation and wants to give it a try. Ryan manages to convince Craig that despite her psychology major, Natalie may not understand the business of dealing with people face-to-face. Craig's reply is to send Natalie out on a road trip with Ryan. So there is the other woman who stumbles into his life. While there is no romance in this relationship, it is not unlike the mentor-protégé rapport between Russell Crowe and Rachel McAdam's characters in ""State of play"" (2009) that starts with animosity but gradually evolves into mutual respect.<br/><br/>The last of the three themes brings to mind another movie, ""About a boy"" (2002), the no-man-is-an-island aspect of it anyway. In that movie, Hugh Grant's character locks himself up in his own castle of a home, enjoying his own secluded existence. In a way, Ryan is like that – although he has more than an average share of daily interaction with other human beings, his is emotionally an island. After observing the romantic undercurrent between Ryan and Alex, Natalie accuses him of hiding in his ""cocoon of self-banishment"". He is, however, not a complete island. He has two sisters with whom he still has infrequent contact. The wedding of the younger one brings about a family reunion to which he invites Alex to go as his date. From this wedding subplot comes a plot development that is predictable but also a small twist.<br/><br/>Strung by the motifs of satellite shots of a parade of cities in the US, the three story lines develop in parallel and also criss-cross. Wisely restraining from over-dramatization, the movie lets the story tell themselves. Clooney, who in his maturity has come to resemble more and more Cary Grant, turns in a performance that is good enough to win him about half-a-dozen minor awards (but not the big ones like Golden Globe or BAFTA). While nominated, he is unlikely to win Oscar when there is a strong front-runner like Jeff Bridges. Both Farmiga and Kendric have done exceedingly well and earned well-deserved nominations in Oscar (as well as Golden Globe, Screen Actors' Guild and BAFTA) but will probably share Clooney's fate. As mentioned, Jason Bateman is marvellous in this movie. Other supports include veterans such as J. K. Simmons and Elliott."

","It's smart, satiric and thoroughly engaging. Writer-director Jason Reitman broadens his tonal range with the follow-up to the unwanted- pregnancy comedy, Juno (2007).<br/><br/>Adapted from the 2001 bestseller of the same name, Up in the Air tells the story of a management consultant (Clooney) who specializes in giving the pink slip to employees of companies that are downsizing.<br/><br/>Jetting around America on a daily basis, the serial sacker is more concerned about accumulating frequent- flier miles than forging any lasting emotional bonds. He even gives motivational lectures extolling the virtues of living with minimum material baggage.<br/><br/>However, he has to re-assess his own priorities when confronted with a sassy fellow jetsetter (Farmiga). His nomadic lifestyle is further threatened by a new recruit (Anna Kendrick) who proposes to terminate jobs via video-conferencing. For once, the female characters aren't mere fodder for the male protagonist.<br/><br/>While there's no doubt that Reitman and his co-scenarist Sheldon Turner can write acerbic dialogue, the momentum does tend to sag towards the climax. A pep talk about the joys of marriage is uncharacteristically sappy. Consequently, the film never quite regains its verve."

","This is a good film. It's certainly not a ""wow!"" film, but does OK. The women are marvelous. Farmiga was already great in ""A Moment of Truth"" along with Kate Beckinsale. However, Clooney...mmm. I still don't get what is it with Clooney! (Do his head tilting and eyelashes almost feminine waving have something to do with?) He must be one of the most unexpressive actors, probably only surpassed by Bill Pullman or Bill Murray. Jason Bateman is pretty unexpressive too (his face simply won't allow him to grab any strong (boss) character unless disguised with lots of make-up and special clothing). C'mon!. And then, I don't think this is a ""comedy""...no, no, no. (It does contain some witty and sour humor). This is a great (dramatic) portraying of a guy who wants to hang out and have sex with women without getting emotionally involved, taking advantage of his continuous flying job. He despaires when finds out he did fall for this one, particularly for the one whose game rules where just exchanging sexual pleasure with no strings attached!, and was shocked to actually see her in her family context (husband, and her children running along through the house, etc.)."
"RNHunter","8","1","2","4 February 2010"," Good Movie, Somewhat Unique
","I tend to seek out movies that maybe have a unique theme, a theme that has not been overworked by Hollywood. This movie has a fairly unique theme - with George Clooney Road Warrior. In the business world, a road warrior is someone who travels a great deal, which today mostly means planes,rental cars and hotel rooms. A good number of people have lived that life, including me (but not to the extent as George) and it was great to see it as a movie subject. If you have traveled a lot, especially for a business, you would likely smile at his inside knowledge how to get through airports fast and comfortably and dealing with life in a 10 by 15 foot hotel room most of your life. Nice Portrayal.<br/><br/>That is part of the movie, and another part I feel was a fairly serious portrayal of relationships. Business relationships to be sure, but also personal relationships of singles and married folk. Since these are relationships, perhaps not all will always like how things turn out, but I felt it was a fairly deep portrayal that does bring you into the feelings of the movie characters. The acting is good or better than good, the movie has both a light feel and a very serious one both at the same time - which gives it depth."

This isn't anything new; it's a newer unfortunate trademark of many recent movies. Equally annoying is blatant product placement - more gratuitous than even castaway - thanks Hilton, Hertz, and American Airlines for paying George Clooney's salary.

","As you've more then likely seen in the movie's trailers, George Clooney plays a fairly established employee at a corporation that basically fires people from other companies for a living. He is very satisfied with his job and loves the air travel. However, when his boss (Jason Bateman) hires an up-and-coming employee just out of Cornell (Anna Kendrick), George Clooney's character's livelihood is threatened. Her revolutionizing idea of video conferencing to fire the employees instead of face-to-face via flying doesn't sit well at all with George Clooney's character. After a ""ride-along"" in which she travels with George Clooney's character to see how he does the firing she starts doing some firing on her own. She ultimately cracks when one lady tells her she plans on jumping off a bridge once she leaves their meeting upon hearing she's being fired. Clooney's character gives her a quick pep-talk and they continue firing people. ***BLIP #1: While in Detroit, the first person she's assigned to fire (57-year old man) leaves his adjacent conference room and when walking by the conference room Clooney and Kendrick fired him from there is a clearly visible pro-Union bumper sticker in the window. Obviously it was seen during the filming and chosen to be left in the final cut. My problem is: if the director doesn't like unions--that's his opinion--BUT, it has to be understood that unions protect their members from this exact thing happening (BEING FIRED). So, obviously, the company they were at was NOT a union company.*** After firing the round of people they were assigned to fire, Clooney's character is told via a phone call that the company is going through with the video-conferencing idea through their office headquarters in Omaha, NE. After a unsuccessful protest from Clooney's character, he gives in to the idea and Clooney's and Kendrick's characters both go to the airport to return to Omaha. At the airport, Kendrick's character flies to Omaha while Clooney's character flies to Milwaukee to attend his sister's wedding after picking up his female ""friend"" in Las Vegas to bring along as a ""date"" (this is a completely separate part of the movie). Clooney's character then flies to Las Vegas to present a motivational speech at a convention center, after saying a few words at the beginning of his speech he has second thoughts and leaves abruptly to fly to Chicago (where his female ""friend"" lives). She answers her front door and Clooney's character is surprised to learn she has a family of her own as he watches her kids running upstairs (after coming off as single during their previous encounters). ***BLIP #2: Again a minor issue but still: WHY DOES VERA FARMIGA (Clooney's character's female ""friend"") USE HER BIG MOVIE ROLES TO BASICALLY SHOW HOW MUCH OF A WHORE SHE CAN BE AS AN ACTRESS??? OK, just wanted to put that out there, if you don't get what I'm talking about then go watch The Departed--you'll soon get it.*** After the awkwardly silent 15-20 seconds standing at her door the husband questions her for who the person is knocking, she says nobody... just someone who's lost and proceeds to close the door. Clooney's character flies back to Omaha and while traveling receives a call from his former female ""friend"" questioning why he decided to show up unexpected at her front door and chiding him for risking her ""real life"" in the process. He then questions her for not being honest and up front with him about her status (obviously not single), she replies by asking what exactly he wants... he doesn't answer... they both hang up. After returning to Omaha, his boss (Jason Bateman) informs him the employee that was fired by Kendrick's character (the one that told them both she was going to jump off a bridge) did in fact jump off the bridge. Upon learning this, Kendrick's character quit and went home to San Francisco, CA. Clooney's character denied any knowledge of the employee's intentions while she was being fired after being questioned by his boss. The movie then cuts to Kendrick's character being interviewed back in San Francisco and the interview concludes with a letter being mentioned that the interviewer shouldn't hesitate in hiring Kendrick's character. The letter was written by Clooney's character in order to help Kendrick's character due to how she took the harsh news of the employee she fired eventually following through with her intended suicide. Finally, Clooney's character makes his way to the Departure/Arrival screens at an airport and the movie ends with him staring at the screens and his voice is heard explaining how most husbands will be coming home after a day's work to their wife or girlfriend or kids or even dog meeting them at the front door while he will be high above the clouds with the light on his particular plane's wingtip shining a bit more then the rest of the stars in the sky. (I was waiting for the bat symbol to be seen in the clouds to complete the movie with a tongue-in-cheek low blow to Clooney's casting in the Batman movie from the late 90's.) In the end, the movie was good... but Vera Farmiga's casting as the tramp type is getting old, almost as bad as Michael Cera's soft-spoken and predictable character--that's bad class to be in."
"doctorsmoothlove","Null","1","2","8 January 2010"," Up in the Air
","The recent economic downturn has spawned an ungodly amount of corporate corruption documentaries. Ethics chapters have been added to nearly every course in business programs. Pundits of both sides will site lack of religiosity or genuine kindness as explication. People continue to attempt to dissect the situation but not analyze it. Individuals are removed from consideration in favor of large occurrences. For sake of argument, what is to be thought of someone who is part of the thriving business world (yes it still exists)? Does his willful inclusion categorize him as an evil person? The new Jason Reitman film Up in the Air is the most complete evaluation of what happened that I've seen. From both perspectives, the one we are part of and that other one, Reitman paints a portrait of sentimentality that pervades its characters. The interactions between people are all negatively affected by their occupations. Like their external cash flow, they can't keep them in check.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (perfectly played by George Clooney) is a professional carrier of broken dreams. His job is to fire people and he is good at it. He can casually walk in a room, tell you some of the worst news imaginable, and walk out for martinis. He keeps himself in perfect shape by having few personal attachments to other people or things. Things would continue like this forever until a new hire, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), suggest that people be fired electronically. Bingham accurately remarks that Natalie has no idea what firing someone is actually like, so he takes her with him on his next duties. She doesn't understand how to distance herself from the people she works with, and realizes this when her boyfriend dumps her via text message. While traveling, Bingham begins an affair with flight attendant Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Their affair escalates to real love which ends when it is revealed that Alex is married. Natalie understandably finds other means of employment.<br/><br/>Recently laid off workers were hired as extras in scenes where Bingham fires someone. Our inability to recognize them gives the film much needed authenticity. People shout, cry, curse, or demonize Bingham for his work. He isn't affected by it at all and goes so far as to give motivational speeches on how to be detached from the world. I find it quite ironic how the Eastern ideal of isolation has been legitimated in the West and applied. The film is like a modern day version of Siddhartha, and, like its counterpart, the protagonist ventures into both lust and love with someone before his world crashes on his face. I was terrified when Bingham visits Alex's home. Had he been able to continue his relationship with her, I wouldn't have recommended this film. Quite thankfully, they don't end up together. Extreme success in the corporate world requires some sacrifice of personal emotional fulfillment, even if the person involved is aware of the compromise. Reitman plays this to great comedic effect when Bingham tells Natalie about his ideas. Alex even chuckles in agreement.<br/><br/>In both Juno and Up in the Air Reitman creates self-aware protagonists who find themselves in difficult emotional situations and persevere because they accept reality as is and move on. They do not, in the conventional sense, have to entirely alter their personalities. Both parts of these films necessitate an actor who is capable of trauma yet still humble enough to realize his or her shortcomings. Both films are made for Ellen Page or George Clooney and both characters have insightful things to say with or without Diablo Cody."

","The words of the songs are perfect, but the sound is all wrong. The strident ""music"" of ""This Land Is Your Land"" over the opening photo montage and credits is totally against the mood and gave me a headache. If I hadn't been at a screening with a friend, that music might well have driven me out of the theater. The voice of the person singing ""Be Yourself"" (first song over the end titles) is harsh and annoying and jangles the nerves.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was excellent - stridency of tone in some scenes there was appropriate. I found the 3 main characters very believable, and the overlapping layers of the film very satisfactory.<br/><br/>The sound of the music over the opening and end titles jars the audience – and I see no reason that it should. The closing song, ""Up in the Air,"" calmed my nerves somewhat, but I'm still irritated by the sound of those songs – it ruined the movie experience for me.<br/><br/>I would have given the movie a 9 if it weren't for the way those 2 songs sounded."

(This is 2009 -- why not just make your pretend holiday with stock photos and PhotoShop?)<br/><br/>The ""counsel the groom"" scene was simply cringe-worthy. <br/><br/>There were few laughs, a few moments of sympathy -- but I was left feeling ""how shallow!""."

","I rated this not as high as some people because i was a little annoyed at the constant American airlines plugs (as well as the Hilton) for this movie. I know that they got free stuff from them in exchange for advertising like for their production but still it's a little annoying. kind of reminds me of the Tom Hanks movie, Castaway which was a big Fedex commercial. <br/><br/>That aside, it was generally a good movie with an interesting message. Basically the message is if you have a no family or significant others than you have a no happiness and no life. Maybe that could be partly true but a lot of us out there just cannot find the right person so sue us if we are still alone with no family- <br/><br/>I wasn't clear on why vera farminga was nominated for awards on this film since her character was more of a minor character and while I like her as an actress in past films i don't see how her performance here is award worthy. <br/><br/>This is a timely film based on the recent economic downturn so I think it is a revalent film for many people who have actually gotten laid of and let go. It definitely makes you sit back and think about your own job and your loyalty and why you are doing it. I myself, am stuck in a 9-5 entertainment job which i would readily flush down the toilet if i was given a chance and if i was laid off i think i would probably celebrate.<br/><br/>so my review of this film is favorable but again i don't think the constant commercial plugs were necessary and took away from the storyline and purpose. I think it was a bit over- rated."

With this much charisma and cinematic brilliance, Up in the Air has the potential to win in the major groups such as 'Best Picture, 'Best Director' and most certainly 'Best Actor'. Here George Clooney plays his part of Ryan Bingham to perfection. Clooney resonates power as well as charm in a role that will, without doubt, be treasured for a while.

"blanbrn","10","2","7","26 December 2009"," A movie that's cold and shows harsh reality. Yet it's a drama that tries making a sharp connection, plus it captures the current times really well.
","Without a doubt Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" is one of the best films of 2009, as when watching it you see it really connects and shows the current times really well. As it's themes though cold and harsh are now an everyday reality like layoffs, corporate downsizing, and the firing of people everywhere across this great land of ours. Still aside from the picture's timely themes it's blended with enough vivid characters and a sharp love story that make it an instant classic to never forget.<br/><br/>George Clooney(in one of his most standout roles)is Ryan Bingham a lonely corporate downsizing executive who's life is flying in the air around the country to fire people. Ryan goes city to city company to company and gives people the harsh and straight news that they have no longer been needed and Bingham is good at it too he doesn't seem to miss any sleep. Ryan also has an obsession with frequent flying miles it's his goal to break the record.<br/><br/>Only Ryan's boss Craig(Jason Bateman)wants to tame it down some and keep Ryan out of the air and keep him grounded and change the game up some. Those new ways happen to be more high tech firing by conference calls of the internet and sugar coated meetings. And much of this rest on the newly hired young gun the bright and sassy new partner of Ryan's that is Natalie Keener(Anna Kendrick who's character shows such a fragile state behind her cruelness). Along the way as they journey together along the cities and conference rooms a lot is learned as Natalie sees she just isn't made out for this harsh world as she's taught lessons by the old pro Bingham which will open up doors for her in a new direction.<br/><br/>The biggest dilemma for Ryan is he must choose between his goal of flying miles or a connection to his heart with another frequent traveler Alex. Ryan meets an attractive and elegantly sexy lady named Alex(Vera Farmiga in a nice sexy role)one night at a classy hotel bar for traveling executives they both hit it off as the chemistry is just right. It leads to a one night stand romp in a hotel room, as a connection is made right then as Ryan feels lust has captured his heart. Along the way on more travel both Ryan and Alex have more romantic encounters that Ryan feels is becoming more and more unexpected love which has him at risk of settling down. Only Bingham will find out a big surprise with Alex as she has hidden secrets and looked only at him as escape.<br/><br/>Overall great film that along the way tried to change the central character of Ryan Bingham, yet in the end he rightfully stayed put as he belongs up in the air to make a living and that's his life. Most important it was good he was at least able to make some romantic connection along his journey even though if it wasn't meant and his influence in some way was used to change the life and attitude of the movies wild card Natalie(Anna Kendrick)showing her she was meant for a more sensitive job task not one like his of life flying and firing people. Really ""Up in the Air"" is a movie that will be looked upon for many years to come as it captures the mood and economic recession times of downsizing just perfect as when later and newer generations look back to see how a majority of people were living in 2009 they will look back to this film as it captures the harsh reality of the current life. ""Up in the Air"" is now a remembered instant classic."
"bobsgrock","10","2","7","23 December 2009"," The story of life up in the air.
","Jason Reitman's third feature is the most personal-feeling of the three and perhaps the best. After exploring the life of a tobacco lobbyist and a quirky pregnant 16 year-old, Reitman turns to a more global issue and one every human can relate to: employment. At first attempting to make a film on the booming economy earlier this decade, the tone changed completely and now this is a downward, somewhat depressed and bitter look at the situation we face as Americans today; more relevant now than ever before.<br/><br/>George Clooney gives the performance of his career, even better than his offers from Michael Clayton and Syriana. He portrays Ryan Bingham, whose job is to tell others that their working days are over. He travels for a good 2/3 out of the year and is never more happy than when he is on a plane, going through safety inspections or walking through the airport. He knows all the rules and ways to sidestep and save time, travels lighter than most ever will and has all of life in perfect order. His life is turned upside down when his no-nonsense boss (Jason Bateman) announces that a young, perky up and coming employee has created an idea to do their job over the Internet and with computers. Played by Anna Kendrick with fierce tenacity and focused determination, she is taken on the road with Ryan to be shown the ropes of how this job is done; and there are definite rules on these things.<br/><br/>What is so interesting about this movie is the way in which co-writer/director Reitman so easily and fluidly weaves together the alleged comedy and the unmistakable sadness and bitterness. There are scenes in which we chuckle or maybe laugh out loud at a one-liner, but then there are heart-wrenching scenes of people getting laid off and no one cannot feel sorry for each and every single person. It isn't important to know what they did or who they are; simply that they had a job and now they are gently being shoved out the door.<br/><br/>To counter these scenes we get the more personal story of Ryan's life, which basically consists of his suitcase, its belongings and traveling until he comes across a woman who shares his interests and his lifestyle; Alex played with incredible charm and class by the lovely Vera Farmiga. Together, they laugh, hang out and basically try to hang onto one another amidst the turmoil all around them. Ryan's relationship with his young protégé, Natalie, is also intriguing because he at first despises her idea since it undercuts his lifestyle, but soon he warms up to her and sees beneath the rough exterior someone who is still very much afraid that her life is over before it began.<br/><br/>There are also scenes with Ryan's two sisters; the only family he has and seems even cold to them. However, with a little push from Alex and Natalie, he starts to realize that perhaps he has missed something important this whole time and needs to get involved now more than ever.<br/><br/>Beneath the cynicism of America's current economic status, there appears a glimmer of hope but it is not pushed to the forefront like so many other movies. Rather, Reitman lets sit there and lets us see the whole picture. The acting brings everything into focus with Clooney showing a reserved, relaxed man with all the answers but also a side of vulnerability he never knew he had about his job and the way things work. Farmiga is eager and able to go toe-to-toe with him and Kendrick needs to get away from those awful Twilight films because this role shows she has real potential to be a real actress. And Reitman's screenplay covers a lot of ground and material, but never too much and sheds just enough light on everything so we catch it all but aren't overwhelmed.<br/><br/>If nothing else, this is certainly one of the best films of 2009. It further shows Reitman's ability to find humor in the saddest and strangest ways and does it with such class and distinction. Perhaps what this is saying is what the people who were fired had in common was that there was someone in their life with them to take the impact. I had a somewhat drab feeling after leaving the theater but I realize that it wasn't because the movie was sad so much that it was right."
"oscarxp25","9","2","7","21 December 2009"," A movie with so many layers
","Just like a memorable song or book, a film could be a representation of a certain time period. ""Up in the Air"" is not only a masterfully written, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed picture, but it is one that is extremely layered. Look past the basic premise of the film and you will see that it shows how the world is changing through relationships, business, and technology. There is a film society called ""National Film Registry"", which films that belong to it are significant to a time period. I could not think of one better than this film to show future generations what was going on in the start of the new century. This is a film that you can seriously have a great conversation about with a friend. Isn't that what great art does?"
"EUyeshima","9","2","7","20 December 2009"," Incisive Look at Life's Emotional Baggage Through the Journeys of a Corporate Hatchet Man
","As someone who has both laid off staff and a year later, became the victim of a layoff after twelve years with the same company, I had a personal interest in seeing how director/co-screenwriter Jason Reitman (""Thank You for Smoking"", ""Juno"") was going to adapt Walter Kirn's smart, unsettling 2001 novel. Even though eight years have elapsed since the book's publication, the filmmaker - along with co-writer Sheldon Turner - manages to deepen Kirn's themes in this wry, emotionally resonant 2009 dramedy and make them even more relevant with the pervasive downsizing of corporate America. The movie also manages to surprise even when certain plot turns seem evident before they occur. Initially, there is a veneer of cynicism that makes you think the story will be an abject lesson in the impermanence of life, but instead, it evolves into one man's journey into the heart of the emotional turbulence he had been careful to avoid. Toward that end, Reitman seems to be inspired by Alexander Payne's equally perceptive road movies, ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways"", films that reflect a similar storytelling style.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on laser-sharp corporate layoff consultant Ryan Bingham, a man who regales in the impermanence of life by traveling 322 days on the road, informing targeted employees that they are about to lose their jobs. There is a necessary callousness in his approach, but he knows it's necessary to be present and honest when it comes to conveying the unpleasant news. Bingham is also a motivational speaker who espouses unburdening one's life of possessions and fitting everything essential within the confines of a backpack. Proving his case, he lives in hotels, airplanes, and airport terminals with his one life goal being the seventh person to collect ten million frequent-flier miles. If you can get past the Spartan one-bedroom apartment he keeps in Omaha for the 43 days he is forced to be at home, the hatchet man appears to lead a charmed if rather solitary life. Complications, however, ensue on both personal and professional fronts.<br/><br/>Bingham meets a fellow transient traveler named Alex Goran in an airport lounge and assesses that he may have found his soul-mate, so much so that he invites her to come to his estranged sister's wedding in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Bingham's boss wants to introduce a new strategy proposed by a fresh-faced, post-grad school upstart. New hire Natalie Keener suggests using remote teleconferencing to perform the layoff notifications. Since the new technology is the antithesis of Bingham's one-on-one method, he brings Natalie along on the road to show her how it can't possibly work. In a role that feels custom-tailored to all his strengths, George Clooney plays Bingham with an emotional precision that complements his charismatic persona which pivots between swaggering and self-effacing. On one hand, it's his most definitive movie-star role, and yet Clooney has never revealed as much about himself on screen.<br/><br/>The always watchable Vera Farmiga (""The Departed"", ""Down to the Bone"") is sexy and confident as the woman who seems perfect for Bingham, even though their adroit compatibility could not possibly sustain an actual commitment. Their interplay is fun to watch because there is a Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell-level rapport that keeps both on their toes. Anna Kendrick (""Twilight"") is winning as Natalie even if her character's naiveté feels a bit manufactured at times. Jason Bateman (""Juno"") has a field day playing Bingham's smarmy boss, while Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey (""Heavenly Creatures""), and Danny McBride (""Pineapple Express"") plays their accustomed types with aplomb as members of Bingham's immediate family. In cameos, J.K. Simmons (""Juno"") and Zach Galifianakis (""The Hangover"") sharply play two of the victimized employees, but for the rest, Reitman uses non-actors replaying their recent experiences of getting laid off. As usual with Reitman's films, it boasts an eclectic soundtrack that works really well with the storyline."
"mspyderl01","9","2","8","24 December 2009"," If you like Ernest Hemingway
","People for the most part, like this movie. I love it. For those who don't love it, I feel like they are not fully appreciating the themes presented here. Perhaps because some of the user comments I've read appear to be from a woman's perspective (feminine user names such as melissa%*@#$ or am I stereotyping?), the main character being Clooney, a male, provides a more masculine approach to life. I could be sexist in presuming that stoicism is a masculine approach to life but that is the theme I most appreciate. I view Ryan Bingham as a stoic man much like Hemingway's Frederic Henry. He is a man's man of his own design and lives life unabashedly, stoically, and albeit efficiently tackling life day to day. People may view the movie as a whole or just the ending as ""depressing"" but I see it not as unapologetically realistic, but rather optimistically realistic. It very subtly highlights the kind of personal strength one needs to carry on through life with the connections they carry. I praise Ryan Bingham for the way he courageously carries on his life at the end, living not completely detached to humanity but at arms length. The apparent vulnerablness Clooney exhibits only adds to his character's emotional realism unlike Frederic Henry who could be viewed as maybe a little too unemotional but that's a whole other discussion.<br/><br/>On a side note, I thought the ending monologue was reminiscent to Cowboy Bebops when Laughing Bull tells of the passing of a warrior. Love it! I guess being written by a guy, this is definitely a movie that has more appeal to men rather than women.<br/><br/>On a quick note, I think the backdrop of the story being about laying off people was really just that, a backdrop and I feel that may have detached people from the real themes. Though I may rail against commercialism from time to time, there's a reason why commercialism works. But I digress. I believe this movie is a solid piece of work and deserves to be unapologetic, even for the times."
"edwagreen","10","2","8","23 December 2009"," Up in the Air Hits Cloud Nine ****
","Something very different has hit the movie screen and it's ""Up in the Air.""<br/><br/>What an appropriate film to deal with how people are directly affected when they lose their jobs. <br/><br/>This is about the best movie role that George Clooney has ever had. In a part that would have been Cary Grant's years ago, Clooney plays a suave guy who goes around telling people that they've lost their jobs. After doing this for so long, he has become immune to their responses, and frankly, he couldn't care less.<br/><br/>When his life-style is threatened by a newcomer to the firm, he brings her along to show her how he does his job.<br/><br/>Of course, the best part of the job is the rude awakening that he faces by the woman he has chosen to play around with.<br/><br/>Clooney's vulnerability and indifference to others is extraordinarily done. To say that he is callous earlier in the film, that's putting it mildly. Some would say that he got what he deserved by acting in the way he does.<br/><br/>This picture is destined to become a part of Americana, especially if the economy doesn't turn around soon. It definitely serves as a wake-up call."
"Hint523","10","2","8","21 December 2009"," Timing, Timing, Timing
","It's not often that I watch a movie and I really do not want it to end. When I was watching UP IN THE AIR, it felt like a long movie, but I loved every minute of it. I could've watched it all day. They say, ""Location, Location, Location"" about selling things, but for movies, it is ""Timing, Timing, Timing"". Slumdog Millionaire was successful because it came at a time when we needed to see that underdog story and we needed to know about the poverty in India. Although ""City of God"" is the superior film, it's timing was poor and meant that it wasn't as well received and most people have never heard of it. Up in the Air could not have been more aptly timed. It tells the story of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man who makes his profession by flying around the country and personally laying off employees in the masses. He loves it – he's excellent at it, he has been doing it for so long he is incredibly efficient. At that cost, he has no ties to anyone, spending all his time on the road and not communicating with most of his family. His whole life shakes up when a young college grad Natalie (Anna Kendrick) enters the workplace offering to start doing the job via video chat, thus reducing the cost of flight, as well as shaking up Bingham's lifestyle that he has mastered. Their boss (Jason Batemen) instructs Bingham to show her the ropes and take her on his next trip. Jason Reitman has been 3 for 3 now with his movies. Thank You For Smoking was an excellent satire of consumerism, Juno was a fantastic comedy that reminded us that good dialogue alone can make a movie hilarious, and now comes Up in the Air, a much more mainstream and much more ambitious project. His direction isn't noticeable, but he certainly knows how to pick the right projects to work on. I talk a lot about how Do The Right Thing excels because of its perfect balance of comedy and drama. Up in the Air nails this, matching every scene with comedic excellence as well as emotional story. It can't really be described as either; instead it feels much more real. The characters aren't always sad, nor are the situations always funny. It feels like real life. All of the lead characters in the film feel like people we know, our friends, and we enjoy watching them do their thing. Real life is boring, but there is enough color added to it via the writing that makes you enjoy this movie and to not want it to end. It's a movie you will love watching, without necessarily rolling on the floor laughing or crying your eyes out in. The acting from the three leads (Clooney, Kendrick, and Vera Faramiga) is good and all of them carry their own weight. It helps that the script they are working with seems flawless. All of them have memorable moments. Nominations for all three is a near guarantee, but I don't think Up in the Air will be winning any acting awards. Up in the Air is just perfect in so many ways. It's layered with many ironies, as well as some great messages about life, and more importantly, whom we spend it with. I am left slightly speechless at the genuine quality of the film. It's the kind of movie I love, and it's perfect. So far, this is the best we've seen in 2009. My Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>reelscenes.blogspot.com"
"shweta162001","9","2","8","13 December 2009"," A brilliant take on the grounded realities of life
","Anything George Clooney (and that dreamy smile), and I lower my requirements from a movie immediately.I had been eagerly anticipating it's release and made sure that I caught the movie the very first day that it hit my Virginia multiplex. This is one of those movies that is so multi-faceted and multi-dimensioned, that it becomes very challenging to write a review that will do it justice.<br/><br/>The director : Jason Rietman (who also directed the much applauded ""Juno"") builds the movie around Ryan Bingham. To the director's biggest credit, Clooney is Bingham, and not the other way around. Bingham works for an agency that helps employers fire their employees, and escape the messy situation of having to do it themselves. His job keeps him on the road, rather ""up in the air"" for more than four-fifths of a year (I think).<br/><br/>Bingham is a loyal American Airlines traveler who flies cross-country to help corporations ""terminate"" their employees. He leaves them with a package that has a road map for their future unemployed days. Bingham's agency hires a recent Cornell grad, Natalie Keener (played by Anna Kendrick). Ms Keener proposes the money saving, highly efficient, zero travel requiring idea of firing people over the internet. Bingham pooh-poohs this idea, citing how inhuman and mechanized this process would be. His boss makes him take Keener along for his last firing spree. Some of the most satirical moments of the movie occur here. Bingham's efficient and seasoned traveler ways are comically juxtaposed with Keener's over-packed and inexperienced ways. One brilliant scene is where Bingham shows Keener the stereotypical ways of other air travelers: ""Never get behind old people. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left. Bingo, Asians. They pack light, travel efficiently, and they have a thing for slip on shoes. Gotta love 'em"". <br/><br/>Kendrick does tremendous justice to Keener's role. She brings out the hardheadedness, confident and yet highly vulnerable characteristics of Keener's role to a T. Bingham's casual, and initially endearing relationship with another frequent traveler- Alex (Vera Farmiga) provides some sweet romantic relief to the movie. Another few sets of brilliant scenes are when the trio crashes a tech company celebration at their hotel. Keener's well planned time line for her life is wonderfully contrasted with the older duos nonchalant and non-committal ways. Bingham's public speaking episodes that ask ""How much does you life weigh?"" are extremely well constructed and poignant. I will not write too much about the plot, as I want you to get your bang for the buck when you watch this movie yourself. Every single character in the plot: Bingham's boss (played by Jason Bateman of the Arrested Development fame), his sisters, his cold feet-ed on the wedding day brother-in-law does beyond ample justice to his/her role. Every character that Bingham and Keener are brought in to fire is amazingly directed and brings out the hurt, scare, numbness and confusion of a just fired employee to realistic perfection. Stereotypically, the Indian nerd firing scene is my personal favorite!<br/><br/>Don't confuse this for a feel good movie or an easy breezy air- travel satire. The emotional landscape of each character is wonderfully layered. The story flows with ease, slides and glides with an array of complex feelings, it provides some easy laughs, some subtle smiles and ends the way that most life stories do. No candy floss romance, no everything fixed hunky dory life. In a very subtle way, the movie does send across a message. Life is not worth living as a cynic. When one door shuts.....a floodgate of new possibilities can open, as long as you don't close your mind to it. <br/><br/>I can not praise this wonderfully directed, brilliantly acted movie enough. I loved the aerial views of different US cities, the well selected soundtrack. I can also easily see this gem of a movie win Academy nominations for the best actor, direction, cinematography and soundtrack (if only my opinion counted...)"
"berthine","3","2","9","17 January 2010"," It was lame
","I went to this movie because it was recommended in the reviews as a 5 out of 5 but I was sorely disappointed. This movie has turned me off George Clooney, perhaps that is a bonus as it might be more realistic. I used to think that he was sexy but I spent most of this movie huddled in a corner because it made me feel so bad and disconnected. The best moment was when the younger woman finally dares to criticize his life as they are taking a picture of his sister against a background of water and he ends up in the water. And when he finally as a classic romantic story part runs to get the woman he realises he loves and it turns out she has been playing but also has a REAL LIFE. The woman up to then seemed the ideal male fantasy but this is the 2000s and it is now an end to the impossible male fantasies a la James Bond as they are SO last millennium. Those 2 moments caused me to give the movie more than a 1 for score as I was actually laughing or found it a great point in the story. But the rest : LAME An endless boring sequence of more people to fire, and at the end he is still flying round up in the air. SAD. I needed some Santa movies to recover from this one."

"davispittman","8","1","3","13 July 2017"," Very well done, engaging film
","Up in the Air (2009) is a film that really does engage its audience. The acting from George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick is all great, they all deserved their academy award nominations. This film revolves around George Clooney's character and his journey through a time of change in his life. Farmiga plays a woman that Clooney sees occasionally in between flights, they usually talk some and have sex, they establish a fairly casual relationship, no real commitments. And Anna Kendrick plays a just out of college newbie that Clooney is showing the ropes to. I was very impressed with how well these talented actors commanded the screen and how they had good chemistry too. I cannot reveal very much more about the plot without giving away spoilers and I don't wanna do that. I'll just say that this film doesn't turn out to be conventional or predictable in any way shape or form. The script is written in a very attention grabbing and intelligent way. You will not be bored at any point while watching this film. The top notch acting, engaging writing and interesting storyline is all too much combined for ones attention to wander. I vigorously encourage everyone to see this film. 8/10 for Up in the Air."
"g-bodyl","9","1","3","6 December 2012"," One of George Clooney's Best!
","Up in the Air is a sweet, memorable film that features charismatic performances from the leads, a clever script, and a plot that people can relate to whether positively or negatively. This film has a great mixture of comedy and romance and that adds to the pleasure of watching this movie.<br/><br/>This film is about a guy whose job is travel around the states to fire people. Reluctantly, he must train a new, young girl to do the same thing. Despite not be very willing about it, the life of this guy is about to change.<br/><br/>The acting is extremely good. George Clooney gives one of his best, if not his best performance ever. Vera Farmiga is very good as Clooney's lover. But, Anna Kendrick really nails down her role. She comes into her own and out of the Twilight shadow with this film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great followup by Jason Reitman after 2007's Juno. He really knows how to make these kind of quirky comedies. This film definitely deserved the 6 Academy Awards it got nominated for. I rate this film 9/10."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","8","1","3","11 August 2011"," Much more than the ""film of the moment"".
","I really eat up focused character dramas and this is an excellent one that stands strong through multiple viewings. Ryan Bingham is flat out a great character and George Clooney gives a superb, understated performance. He gets a lot of flak for ""playing himself"", but I feel like that couldn't be less true. He takes all of his characters and makes them his own, yes, but I don't think he's repeated himself, which shows his power as an actor. Here he takes this guy who, on paper, is a smug prick and makes him someone that you can relate to and genuinely feel for. That in itself is a remarkable achievement. The character himself is a unique one, a guy who has built his entire life around not having any attachments and then has to watch everything he believes in fall apart.<br/><br/>A lot of films find it necessary to have huge moments of evolution for characters, but I admire the ability here to have him gradually change without even realizing it. I love movies that have you look back at the end and realize that the character you started off with has drastically evolved and you don't even realize it. I always find it hard to believe when someone makes this huge transition, but here there's this much more natural flow that stays entirely true to the character while still giving him a lot of growth. I feel like so many movies, especially ones that are pretty strict character dramas without a lot of action like this, always end up having to do things with their characters that ring so false just to make things interesting. But this one is so intelligently written and stays so true to it's characters all the way, it's really admirable. <br/><br/>Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga both more than deserved their Oscar nominations as the women who come along and change Ryan's perspective on things. Farmiga is fun, interesting and gets you to understand why Ryan wants her to be the one girl he has stick around for a change. It's a hard role to play; she has to leave an impression without making the story be all about this character's relationship with Ryan, but she balances out all aspects of her character quite well. Kendrick is the complete opposite, this precocious young girl who dominates the screen whenever she's on it. She's strong and independent and almost steals the show. I love her character; this girl who was raised in a world where you're taught to shut yourself off from everyone else and is then thrust into being an adult and has to come out the other side with herself in tact. The scene with her first solo firing is devastating and she plays it so subtly; it's very admirable.<br/><br/>The film got a lot of praise for being ""of the moment"" and while this rings true, I think it's a lot more than that. It did a tremendous job of putting a human face on the economic crisis our country is facing, without having the film be all about this message. It creates a genuine character drama and then builds this commentary on our current time around it. The film is very of the moment, but it can also stand on it's own ten or twenty years from now as a strong character drama.<br/><br/>There are definitely some things that I don't care for in the film, though. I have mixed feelings on everything with the wedding in the final act; it does have some nice emotional moments and it brings necessary development for Ryan, but I feel like it doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the film and it's a little too conveniently timed. Aside from that, I think the whole thing is a little cookie-cutter and I wish it had gone to darker places. But these are things that have only popped up after a few viewings of the film and ultimately don't really stick in my mind for long afterwards. I think it's a great character drama with some tremendous performances and it's an important one for our time."

","based on the novel by Walter Kirn with same title it portrayed the life of a corporate down-sizer.

A person remains happy alone, till he is happy. As sadness comes in his life it shows him/her his loneliness. During first half it appeared that movie isn't going anywhere but during second half it all made sense. performance wise all were good but specifically Anna Kendrick really acted very well.

"thinker1691","8","1","3","28 November 2010"," "" ""He knows the secret of life, is being alone, but never being lonely ""
","In America, with corporations losing their ability to believe in tomorrow, they have discovered, that it is much easier to discharge employees, then to keep them. In this movie called "" Up in the Air "" we have Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) a corporate executive who's job it is to fire people whom their employer has decided they don't need. Ryan has become so skilled, he has lost most of his ability to sympathize with the people he puts on the unemployment line. His position is nearly tenured, until he meets up with Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who convinces the top executive, that she has discovered a more efficient and impersonal way of doing it. However, she lacks the necessary ambivalent, detachment and is therefore in need of further training which thereafter become Ryan's role. The movie, written and directed by Jason Reitman,is a cross section of America's economic woes and Clooney is superb as a high flying loner who has convinced himself that a man with no friends, attachments, home or responsibilities is much better off, That is until he meet Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) a nearly mirror image of himself. With a whole litany of employees being canned, a few do stand out like J.K. Simmons (From Spiderman) who plays Bob and Sam Elliot who plays the Chief Airline Pilot. The film is a great vehicle for Clooney and one wonders how effortless he made this character his. An interesting, but fun offering. Recommended. ****"
"angielou325","4","1","3","20 June 2010"," Not what I expected, boring, to say the least.
","Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney travels frequently for his job. He works for a firing service, where companies can hire him to come fire their employees. Ryan is constantly traveling and does not know what it is like to stay at home. This leaves him secluded and he does not know how to show emotion or become close to people. Natalie Kenner, played by Anna Kendrick, comes to his company with the idea of firing people over the internet. There boss, Craig Gregory, played by Jason Bateman, wants Bingham to show Natalie the ropes of the firing business. Bingham is unhappy about this because all he has ever known is ""on the road"". He has never had to stay in one place for a long period of time. Bingham starts to travel with Natalie and she questions him about his personal relationships with people, in particular, his relationship with Alex Goran, played by Vera Farmiga. Alex is also traveling for her job and meets Ryan Bingham on one of her trips. They plan to meet again and Alex is adamant about their relationship being strictly on the road for casual hookups. At first, Bingham is OK with this, until Natalie continues to pry into his feelings for her. Natalie gets Bingham to open up more and he realizes he is in love with Alex. The journey of showing Natalie the ropes of the business ends and Bingham can not stop thinking about Alex while he is learning the beginning stages of firing people over the internet. The ending of the movie was completely unpredictable to me and left me disappointed but everyone is entitled to their own opinion on it. The movie ends without anything happening, Bingham finds out that Alex has a family and they go their separate ways. Natalie leaves the job at the firing agency after one of her experiences with firing someone turns out bad. Therefore the project of firing people online is stopped and Bingham gets to go on the road again. The theme of the movie relates to the secluded lives of workaholics. The prying of feelings from Bingham shows that if you are constantly working, you have no time for relationships and real feelings for other people. Another movie with the same theme is The Proposal, with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Up In the Air is shot mainly in a subjective point of view, the shots are filmed as the characters in the movie would be seeing them. Especially when Bingham is firing people, the camera is mainly shot from the his point of view, showing his isolation with only the person he is firing. When the frames are shot in objective points of views, such as when Natalie and Bingham are arguing, it shows the distance between them, representing how Bingham is not close to anyone. I also feel that setting was an important aspect of the film. Every city that they would travel to would open up with a new shot of the city as it would look from an airplane. The constant change of setting relates to the constant change in Bingham's life, never giving him time to commit to anything other then his job. Overall this movie shows the struggle of workaholics being able to have normal relationships with people."

","I just wish that I had seen this marvelous movie about 35 years before I did. I think I might have lived my life much differently had I heard the life philosophy that George Clooney's character (Ryan Bingham) espouses near the beginning of the movie. It makes perfect sense. Too late for me now, that's for sure but for all of you unattached 20-somethings out there, play close attention. The writing is excellent in this movie and all of the actors are quite good as well. I particularly enjoyed Vera Farmiga's character of Alex Goran. She moves from one world to another seamlessly and I could almost place myself in her shoes as she works her magic. George Clooney is great as usual, quite a bit lighter than he was in Michael Clayton most of the time. Anna Kendrick's character is a little too predictable but that was the way the part was written so I don't blame her. Surprise ending I doubt anyone can see coming. One of my all-time favorite movies."
"valsalahb","8","1","3","18 June 2010"," Thank you for the wonderful flight
","There is always a solid difference between the terms 'cinema' and 'movie'. Let me explain it in a simple manner. A cinema is a motion picture that not just entertains the viewers but also makes them think about it especially, the story and the characters. Makes them realize that the story, if not realistic is at least understandable, clear and appreciate it whole heartedly. Whereas a movie is also a motion picture which tries to entertain the audience mostly by unrealistic portrayal and innumerable scenes involving a lot of action, sex and cheesy dialogues. It absolutely lacks in a proper storyline or a storyline which can be too complicated to be understood by the viewers. Well to make things clearer with respect to the present aspect, Up in the air, directed by Jason Reitman and starring George Clooney, comes definitely under the category, cinema. Director Reitman has provided us with yet another sensible and realistic work following his Oscar nominated Juno. Easily one of the best pictures produced in 2009, Up in the air revolves around the life and happenings of a single man named Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who works as an executive agent in a firm that is primarily called upon by other major companies to fire their employees. Ryan is one of the most experienced people in his field of work i.e. firing other people of their jobs. As the title suggests most of the story or at least the basis of the story lies up in the air or simply because Ryan travels a lot across America to tend to his clients. The last time I saw Vera Farmiga in 'the departed', she did not quite catch my attention, but in this case, where she plays the beautiful Alex Goran is definitely commendable and proves to be of worthy note. Natalie Keener depicts her character in a wonderful style as the inexperienced colleague of Ryan Bingham (Clooney). The film consists of a simple storyline which primarily concerns human emotion and relationships. It portrays beautifully the relationships between a brother and a sister, between two colleagues, between a man and a woman etc. George Clooney plays the style and suave executive and gives a memorable performance and so do Vera Farmiga and Jason Beitman. A simple story, excellent screenplay, great editing, appreciable music, wonderful acting and a seamless direction makes Up in the air always remain Up in my heart and mind."
"prasad2505","9","1","3","23 May 2010"," Brilliantly directed movie with a story to tell and thoughts to retrospect. 5/5
","The director of Juno comes with another exhilarating and touching message with ""Up in the air"". I wish more and more flicks of this kind to be made in the coming days to make watching movies a pleasant and pleasing experience.<br/><br/>Okey, enough of my wishes and the story goes like this. Clooney's (Ryan)job is to fly to his office's different locations and start firing the people. And he has to tackle the situation and keep it cool. He is not so young, giving motivational speeches and believes in not getting committed and live a smooth life. Natalie joins him in the firing job with him, however couldn't cope up with it. She finds her struggling with the job every now and then where once to her it seemed cool to fire someone. Meanwhile Ryan gets along with a 30+ Alex(Farmiga) and as time goes by he finds her irresistible. Moving away from his own principles, Ryan goes to meet Alex and the director opens a cool twist. And the movie ends with introspection of the protagonist which is nothing but perfect.<br/><br/>Clooney in a very different role here shines. He carries the role of a lone man with all ease, whose only wish to fly miles and enjoying in the suites offered. Farmiga deserves the Oscar which she got. She is looking mysterious, beautiful, sexy and what else, she acts well. She as the 30+ woman is the best in the flick when it comes to performances. I cant believe myself to see the same woman who got so bettered from ""The Departed"". The cinematography is brilliant and has lot of scope to shoot picturesque locations from the plane and it looks great in screen. This is one of the finest movie I have seen in the recent past. This would have got the academy awards for best picture. Dialogues are witty and meaningful when required and when backed up with great on screen performance, it culminates to be a great flick to cherish.<br/><br/>You may not feel how strong the flick is ,however if you think after sometime, it shall sound to be a satirical note on relationships, jobs and everything else. And that's the strength of it. It just shows how small things are valued more where real relationships are not. And it's true in everyone's life. Ain't it?<br/><br/>Up in the Air - Time to question ourselves on how honest we are to our own principles"
"jzappa","9","1","3","1 May 2010"," Totally and Completely a Film About 2009
","Up in the Air, if nothing else, is totally and completely a film for our time. It takes the dependence people once had on their jobs and replaces it with a teetering insecurity. George Clooney's Ryan Bingham is the company yes-man for the 2000s. He never comes to the office. Indeed, he doesn't have an office, he has a headquarters where his boss has an office. His life is spent traveling to other people's offices, and firing them. Bingham identifies himself as a Termination Facilitator. He fires people for a living. When corporations must cut back immediately yet don't like being the bad guy, he flies in and plays the bad guy to the new ex-workers. In economic decline, his enterprise is booming! But eventually, the detachment of the road life is jeopardized by the dawns of firing by Web chat. It may not be as affable as firing someone face to face, however it conserves a lot of money on airfare.<br/><br/>This isn't a comedy. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an alert observation of how people in 2009 do their jobs. Bingham adores his profession. He doesn't want a home. He doesn't want a family. He orates self-help speeches on how and why to unpack the backpack of your life. Clooney plays Bingham as one of those people you know yet you never break the ice. They endure all the motions, and make all the appropriate overtures, and you're ""friends,"" yet who's in there? There are two women in Bingham's life. Vera Farmiga plays another commercial traveler, and for some time they've been having rendezvous in lifeless ""Suite"" hotels, eating, having sex, pretending to be the happy couple neither one will go in on. Anna Kendrick, who was terrific in the 2007 buried gem Rocket Science, here plays a promising, driven new graduate who has acquired an opening at Bingham's company as it's close to her boyfriend. Bingham takes her on the road to show her the business. Farmiga is him now, Kendrick is him then.<br/><br/>You probably won't peg all that Farmiga is thinking. Kendrick's character is bursting with such liveliness at the advent of her career that it radiates even on the departures of others'. Nothing better than pleasing your employer. The movie's strongest scenes by far involve Farmiga or Kendrick. Farmiga is so completely real and becoming that everything she says is worlds better than anyone else would probably put it in as little time and words and with as little effort as her. And the scene where Clooney puts Kendrick on the spot and tells her to fire him while he fires one hypothetical curveball question after another is pitch-perfect in its razor-sharp and rapid-fire reminiscence of a classic Howard Hawks picture.<br/><br/>I like how Reitman begins with the way corporations rationalize degenerate methods and then administer their justifications with seamless coherence. That approach was at the heart of his exceptional debut, Thank You for Smoking. Reitman also made the cute but phenomenally overrated Juno. With these three films at the outset of his career, we can just wonder what's coming up. He makes clever, subversive commercial films. That's more of a challenge than making clever, subversive art-house films."
"ferdinand1932","8","1","3","27 March 2010"," Very good but with one big flaw
","This movie has many good and surprising features, notably, an ambiguous ending. Indeed the ambivalent approach infuses the entire story, underwritten in the ironic tone, the slight mocking of corporate language. A real strength are the direct to camera cameos of the people who have been 'let go', never fired. They tell the contemporary story<br/><br/>of America, and are a countervailing force against Clooney's cool, even smug, but perfect detachment. <br/><br/>Having praised it, there is, however, one major flaw and it's a character and plot flaw which may be in the source book. Alex, yes, just wonderful as played by Vera Farmiga, is however badly written. While the affair is playful it deepens when they visit Wisconsin for a weekend wedding. The audience believes along with Clooney's character that this signifies a real real bond between them. It does not and for devastating reasons. The first time I watched the movie I could almost accept why, but the second time I could not because for it to work it demanded that Alex be a sociopath i.e. betray other people to seek her own pleasure. A sociopath is plausible - but works against the theme of the latter half of the film, if she is. Not good writing. So,if she is not a sociopath, it is a poor piece of plotting. It is a significant weakness in another wise, very good film."

","Ryan (Clooney) has a job whereby he flies to companies all over the country and fires selected employees. He is single, loves his job and prefers being on the road (so to speak) and has no ties to anyone.<br/><br/>I can see why this was nominated for Best Picture. It's very good. Okay, it's more than that - it feels more like an old pair of shoes we will never throw away because they are always comfortable. I hated to see it end. This is a very comfortable movie. The actors make it so. <br/><br/>I am not familiar with Vera Farmiga, but her performance was seamless throughout and she was deserving of a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Also, the Efficiency Expert Natalie (Kendrick) did a good job, but am not sure if a Best Supporting Actress nomination was in order (well, some believed it was and she got the nomination too). And, I think we are beginning to see deeper ranges in George Clooney. He has those expressions that show us how he feels at times, and you feel it too. You like his character and want the best to happen for him. I was not surprised he was nominated for Best Actor.<br/><br/>But, the acting aside, the thing that also makes this comfortable is the dialogue. The characters say what you would say if you (okay, if I ) were in those positions. Yes, the movie is slow, but hey, it's not a Jason Bourne thing. We are looking at Ryan, who has no ties to anyone and then he meets Alex (Farmiga) and begins to reconsider by falling in love with her. He's up in the air about it and about his life in general. Now, you know what the title is all about. And, the very last scene should bring this home to you as well. <br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, briefly. Language: Yes, some not much"

"vrnathan1982","Null","1","3","1 March 2010"," A Class Cynical Comedy!
","Directed by Jason Reitman (the director of Thank You for Smoking), this movie is pretty much in the same genre as Thank You for Smoking. The name of the game here is Cynicism! Over the last few years, George Clooney has done movies that have been supreme in content and entertainment, but also provoking in terms of their ideology and political stand. Be it Syriana, or Michael Clayton or even Up In The Air - he seems to be giving audiences food for thought! In all the 2 of the above-mentioned movies, there's one string that stands out - Corporate Malfeasance! While Syriana spoke about the games the corporates and lobbyists play at the power stage to control the oil economy; Michael Clayton showed the ruthless face of selfish corporates! Up In The Air takes a lighter look at yet another corporate game and it couldn't have gotten more timely... It talks about mass-layoffs during the economically-vulnerable United States.<br/><br/>Clooney works for a third-party downsizing company, whose help is sought by spineless corporate ""giants"" for firing their employees. He, though enjoys his job as he is the one who believes that all the relationships are nothing but baggages that makes one's life heavy! He enjoys this job because it accords him the opportunity to get philosophical with the fired employees and make them see the light at the end of the tunnel. He also loves this job also because this allows him to fly relentlessly and get some ""frequent flier points"". However, he is in for a major shock when he learns that he and his fellow employees are on the verge of being ""grounded"" thanks to a new plan of ""online firing via VC"" which is being considered as a ""cost-cutting initiative"".<br/><br/>It is at this time, that he throws up the challenge to his new ""I-wanna-revolutionize"" colleague. He throws her an open challenge by saying ""She Doesn't Understand My Business"" and takes it upon himself to show her around and train her and make her aware of the complexities that lay in firing people.<br/><br/>A rather simple story, would you think! Not really! There are a couple of characters who shape Clooney's professional and personal characters arcs and beliefs... Vera Farmiga (The Departed) plays a gorgeous middle-aged woman to perfection. She plays the character who seeks a casual ""relationship"" with Clooney to find an escape from her boring life. Though what begins as an emotionally-detached relationship, slowly warms its way into the heart of George Clooney and leaves him at a stage where he just can't deliver ""relationships are an unnecessary baggage"" speech.<br/><br/>The other character is played by the young-cocky Anna who is Clooney's trainee. She provides a more complex and a more humane side to the entire proceedings. She is the perfect foil for Clooney's Ryan Bingham! Where he is steely and cold and methodical; she is restless, all-over-the-place and towards the end also moved by the results of her job! The movie, though stays funny throughout its stay, also plays beautifully with the fear of being fired from the job! The fear is a constant factor that is understated.<br/><br/>Another poetic aspect is the ""Loyalty"" factor. Where we see employees being fired for nothing in spite of staying loyal the company for years; George Clooney gets 10,00,000 free air miles as a reward for being a loyal flier.<br/><br/>Performances are outstanding and beautifully understated by all the players. George Clooney defines elegance and methodical perfection! He drops cynicism in every frame that he visits! Vera Farmiga is sexy and independent! Watch her striking a conversation with Clooney after their first sexual encounter - you'll know what I mean! Anna conveys her entire character trajectory in the scene at the airport where she pulls a heavy baggage for the travel! Fabulous is the word! The dialogues - true to what you expect from a Clooney movie. Top class and some of the finest one-liners! The dialogues are a jab at the capitalist structure of the U.S. Witness this line...<br/><br/>""These are worst times for America! This is our moment"" Camera-work is constantly hand held and providing the movie with a certain unpredictability! Editing is fabulous... Jump cuts are methodical and at the same time a little unsettling! All in all - A Great Movie! My pick for the Oscars!"

","My problem with this film is that, as good as Clooney's performance is as Ryan, I didn't believe the character for a second. There was no reason to accept that Ryan was a real person the way that he is. No way to think that a person could be in his situation where he was ""ready to make a connection"" because there was no explanation as to why any functioning human being would be so connection phobic in the first place. It's not Clooney's fault. It's simply that the character was written without enough back story to make him realistic. He's a plot device and nothing more. Which is why the story ultimately fails to work or generate much emotional impact.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is terrific, and both Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick deserve the nominations and awards that they've received so far. Pacing is good, and the script is well written, except for the big hole where the main character should be."

He has become the perennial bachelor and all that cute repartee between him and the girl, could well be him ad libbing from real life. I am also thinking that he is now of the age where what his character was going through is exactly what he is going through. Like Warren Beatty, I expect him to quit tomcatting and settle down within the next year.<br/><br/>I especially like the income level that the movie placed his character in: I have spent many a lonely night or nights in those 'executive suites' that the Candlewwod or the Holiday Inn Express or the Hampton Inn puts you in. He obviously is not a big money maker, since the 4 Seasons is definitely not one of his 'homes away from home'.<br/><br/>The fact that his sister seems to work in a seedy hotel also gives you the impression that this wedding is WAAAAAY over the incomes of the participants. In the South, we were told that the reason many African/Americans drove huge pink Cadillacs was because their income bracket would never be able to afford them a nice home. But here was one way of being able to experience a little bit of the American Dream....a huge pink=finned car. The same thing goes for lower middle-class All-Out weddings. There will never be another day like this in that girl's life. Unfortunately, many brides are so stressed out by the experience that they don't really enjoy all that their credit rating allowed them to owe. As indicated by the groom's cold feet, one of the most touching scenes in the movie (and more proof of what a people-knowledgeable person Clooney was).<br/><br/>One thing still puzzles me: Clooney's sister reams him out for his 'adolescent way of life', always roaming, never settling down. She tells him to 'Grow up', as well as that little girl who was going to fire everyone by Internet. Yet, at the end (****spoiler alert), the woman he was falling in love with and finally deciding to settle down with turns out to have been married with children all along. And she has the effrontery to tell him ""I am a grown-up."" How wicked, how droll. Did the authors know what the effect of that line would be, even on us jaded cynical older folks? Being grown-up means that I screw around on my husband? So here's what will happen. George will nurse his wounds for awhile, but then go after some other girl (maybe the one he got the job for in San Francisco), whom he will marry and have the kids he was considering (just like Warren Beatty).!!!!!!"
"wisewebwoman","8","1","3","13 February 2010"," The Corporate World
","George Clooney gives a great performance (right up there with ""Good Night and Good Luck"") as a driven Type A personality corporate type with no personal life. He plays the part of an outsourced downsizer, Ryan Bingham, who is contracted to fire people across the country, 24/7. A timely movie in these economic times.<br/><br/>Ryan can't abide the few days a year he spends at home and only feels threatened when a new hot shot employee in his company threatens to knock him from his pedestal of constant travel by creating a technique of firing people on the internet.<br/><br/>George has one goal in an otherwise meaningless existence: he wants to achieve a stratospheric level of total airmiles which few others have reached.<br/><br/>Natalie, the go-getter new employee played by Anna Kendrick, and Ryan don't go the Hollywood route in their relationship, which is refreshing. Instead they get to lean emotionally on each other outside of the job. A friendship rather than a romance, which I found appealing. And real.<br/><br/>Ryan plays a detached Casanova, with random meetings in hotel rooms that are quickly forgotten. His life is thrown out of kilter by the announcement of his baby sister's wedding and a series of silly photos she wishes him to take.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga plays Alex with sublety and confidence, in a great line she says of herself:""just think of me as you with a vagina"". And she is bang on.<br/><br/>Nuance and emotion exist side by side in the movie with comedy and heartbreak. I've often thought that George channels Clark Gable, both physically and the wonderful facets of comedy he is able to portray. the roles he chooses are a challenge as George doesn't often get the girl. His roles are more complex than that as he plumbs ever deeper into roles that on the surface can appear light.<br/><br/>This is a movie I would like to see again as there are many threads and many little stories along the way leading to George's denouement which I won't spoil here. Suffice to say is that the normal 2X4s are missing. The whole drama is understated rather than overstated and ultimately very satisfying.<br/><br/>The real life people faced with job loss portrayed in the film are heartbreaking. Some wrote their own scripts or reiterated their own exit dramas from real life jobs.<br/><br/>Watch till the last credit rolls as the movie doesn't 'end' when it 'ends'.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 from me and yes, I would see it again."
"Stampsfightclub","9","1","3","10 February 2010"," Great current themed drama
","Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is employed to fire people from other companies and he travels to different places in America and when a promising but naïve business woman joins the firm his outlook on life starts to change.<br/><br/>Despite the relevance to modern day global financial issues this Oscar promising picture is based on Walter Kin's novel, now almost 8 years old that from this adapted screenplay makes a striking resemblance to our modern day situation.<br/><br/>Director and part screenplay writer Jason Reitman, better known for his work for Juno and Thank you for smoking, again delivers an articulate view on worldwide issues only this time hitting the nail perfectly on the head.<br/><br/>This story uses an ideology of a young arrogant woman coming in and implanting a business idea to which would save their business a heap of credit, it does not save the worker's jobs, and there in lies the core of this wonderful story.<br/><br/>The idea for Anna Kendrick's Oscar potential character is to initialise and test a system which would allow Clooney and company to fire employees from their own office, via webcam. This impersonal concept from an apparent emotionless protagonist engages us into the harsh nature of today's reality when all we believe is that we are being made redundant with no valid explanation.<br/><br/>The film starts with such instance. Encoded are a collection of actors telling stories of real life redundancies, all of which are lavishing their frustration upon George Clooney's character.<br/><br/>Clooney himself is a fine example of a middle aged businessman. It is quite a performance to note no physical emotions but deep down we can tell he really does care about life. The whole backpack talks is a perfect example of his character's perception of the real world, which gets a gradual building during the two hours. Oscar potential? Very high but it is Anna Kendrick who deserves the full praise for her cold hearted performance that, after a break up, sees her dive into a warmer more upsetting state of mind.<br/><br/>Reitman has certainly developed since Juno. The usage of plane shots are very good, encoded with some delicious music. This land is your land song is a warm setup. The quick fire airport montages are well used, especially when Clooney adds some stereotyping. Whilst there is a slight formula to the last third this is certainly a well handed picture.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful test of the drama genre, adding flickers of comedy and more so romance. When you think you have the setup acknowledged it changes course and dives into a more appreciative recollection of real life. The whole fling business is a perfect example of how to tackle various genres.<br/><br/>Up in the air is a joyous creation of a drama that adds deft touches of comedy, juxtaposes a promising actress with an established a lister and with Reitman defying his critics this is worth a viewing."
"Greatornot","9","1","3","7 February 2010"," Interesting, Creative Film
","This was a true pleasure. A creative, innovative effort that shined. The acting from all the characters was spectacular. George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham; A man whose life is spent traveling around the country , mostly in the heart of America firing people. In fact , He is a part of a contracted consultant team that does the dirty deeds. Bingham not necessarily a man of low morals or standards, is none the less immune to his devious chores, much like a QB knowing he is going to take a big hit every down. Mr. Bingham loves the first class travel and perks that go with his position. Enter young ,naive, Natalie Keener , hired to reorganize the Consultant company ,with objections from Bingham. They end up in the air together and both learn some valuable lessons in life . Further muddling the situation is Alex Goran, a female companion during those lonely times traveling for Bingham. This was a film that explored human emotions from every spectrum. There were some fine twists in this film . The film also shed some light on our cold culture of technology . Is it better to be fired in person? Is it better to be fired via webcam or perhaps a text? The word firing could be replaced by the words 'breaking up'. This film went beyond Binghams job and highlighted some personal relationships, involving his family and his meaning in life. Mr. Bingham the word master was a servant to his own emotions."
"stu9003","9","1","3","6 February 2010"," An excellent film with very true to life characters
","Up in the Air has been one of the most acclaimed movies of the past year and I'm going to go with the critics and say that this is a terrific movie. George Clooney is outstanding as Ryan Bingham, a man whose job is to fire people. Because his job involves a lot of travel he has almost no personal attachments and that's just the way he likes it. Unfortunately for him, his world is about to be shaken up by changes in his working life as well as the arrival into his life of two very different women: a love interest named Alex (played by Vera Farminigia) as well as a younger colleague/protégé named Natalie (played by Anna Kendrick). Eventually, Ryan is forced to question his priorities and what he truly wants out of life.<br/><br/>This is not a movie filled with heavy duty action scenes or incredibly dramatic events. Rather, it's a movie based on very realistic characters, the choices they make, how they deal with setbacks and how they decide what's important to them. The final answers for these questions aren't cut and dry, which, to me, makes it very true to life. I haven't seen all of the Best Picture nominated movies yet, but of the ones I've seen, this would get my pick."
"neil-476","9","1","3","4 February 2010"," A film for Grown-Ups
","If you are trying to decide whether to go and see Up In The Air, the big question is ""Is the brief shot of Vera Farmiga's delightfully unclad derriere sashaying across the screen reason enough, in itself, to go and see this film?"" Without hesitation, I give you the answer - ""Of course it is!"" But there are quite a lot of other reasons for seeing this movie, despite the fact that it is really difficult to categorise. It's not a comedy, although it is often very funny. It's not a romance, although there are romantic elements. It's not a drama, despite having a lot of (low key) drama in it. It isn't social commentary, but you will be aware of some acidic observations on modern day living. And so on.<br/><br/>There are four distinct elements, although they are so deftly intertwined that they never strike you as distinct and separate. They are: <br/><br/>1. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)'s determined espousal of his executive traveller's lifestyle and rejection of a conventional rooted lifestyle and the connection to other people that goes with it; <br/><br/>2. The arrival of pushy young Anna Kendrick (Natalie Keener), the threat to Ryan's lifestyle which she poses, the defensive action he puts into play, and the effects this has on Anna; <br/><br/>3. The development of Ryan's relationship with fellow executive traveller Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga); and <br/><br/>4. Ryan's family, from which he is almost estranged.<br/><br/>The core of the film is the way in which all these things work on Ryan. This is a film for grown ups. The audience when I saw it were all of mature years, and there was quite a lot of knowing laughter, particularly at some of the unconsciously patronisingly ageist remarks Anna makes. The performances are uniformly excellent, and Clooney (in a part which suits him down to the ground) is given an opportunity to show that Ryan has depths he never realised he had. The script is sharp, and a first class example of how effectively a decent script lifts a film into becoming something special.<br/><br/>An excellent film, and I thoroughly recommend it.<br/><br/>Plus, like I said, there's this bit with Vera Farmiga in it..."
"billion_mucks","8","1","3","27 January 2010"," The Clooney Clash
","Clooney is without a doubt in my mind one of the best actors of his generation. He may be undermined for the fact he chooses (or chose) roles molded exactly for his limitations: a man of easy virtue normally, thoughtful, aware and unaware of his environment in a complex- puzzled looking face, without explosive furious needs, or crying parts, or anger blasts.<br/><br/>Since ""Michael Clayton"" he flipped degrees with his performance. He has a very noticeable emotional undercurrent. We know that at the time he is acting he is internally lubricating every inch of his voice, his stare, and his posture. To watch him is to watch a real person, and he lets the character do ""osmosis"" through his persona. ""Up in the Air"" is basically about a man that we can relate to, given in perfect accordance to George Clooney. He is trailed by a beautiful and shivering Anna Kendrick and correct stars, obviously pushed with a masterful script that knocks well on today's crisis time."

","George Clooney is a man who likes to star in light-hearted films, such as From Dusk till Dawn, the Ocean Series, Burn After Reading and The Men Who Stare at Goats. With his latest film Up in the Air he has possibly made his best comic film and Jason Reitman is showing himself to be a director who outshine his father's success.<br/><br/>Up in the Air tells the story of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man whom job is sack large numbers of people for companies who are too scared to do it. He enjoys his job, allowing him to flight all over America. He is such a regular user of American Airways and Hilton Hotels that he has rewards schemes that most people can't access. He aims to be the seventh ever person to gain 10 Million Airmiles. He also acts as a motivational speaker, and believes that most people don't need many belongings. On his travels he meets Alex (Vera Farmiga), a follow traveller and the two form a friendship and causal relationship. But Ryan's livelihood as he knows it is under threat when a recent graduate of Cornell University Natalie (Anna Kendrick). Natalie notes the high cost of sending people across the country to sack people, and suggests using video conferencing technology and do the firing from the head office. Ryan obviously doesn't want to loose the jet-setting live style, but he also believes that his job needs a personal touch, and needed people with tough characters and experience. Their boss (Jason Bateman) pair the two off. Both try and show that their way is better and Natalie soon see that Ryan's live is really quite lonely, but he is happy with it.<br/><br/>The film has a simple theme, that a jet-setting lifestyle can be very lonely. Ryan doesn't have an real friends, he is distance from his family and his home in Omaha is somewhere he hates. All he lives for is travelling and his job. He doesn't even see the sights. He only has causal relationships, but Alex could be his way out. The other is the film has a lot to say about the recession, with a lot of people loosing their jobs across America, and company either going out of business and downsizing. Cities live Detriot are really suffering because of the downturn in the manufacturing. As well, many people who are sack have been are often older and finding a new career path will be difficult.<br/><br/>What makes this film what is that it has a very witty script, with good natural lines and jokes, making this a more low key comedy. This is the type of comedy films Hollywood should be making more of. It appeals to a clever audience, who listen to the film and not watching for something visual. Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner write a fine script and I am sure their was some ad-libbing that helped. There is also real heart and emotion, allowing the characters to grow and see into each other's worlds. Ryan does grow into a more likable character. Reitman offer a very even handed approach of directing, mixing the humour and serious effectively. He has some stylist moments, but those are few and fair between. Despite the airborne nature of the film, Reitman direction is grounded.<br/><br/>The cast is great in this film. Clooney offers one of his best comedic performances, and brings real depth to his character. He has wonderful comedic timing and is also able to show the serious nature of his character. The talented Vera Farmiga was also very good, bringing in a down-to-earth humour to her character. Anna Kendrick, best known for her role in the Twilight films, shows that she is a woman to lookout for in the future: she too shows herself an fine comedic performer. There is also an excellent support cast, such as comedic veterans like Jason Bateman and Melanie Lynskey, even some big actors who have cameos.<br/><br/>An excellent, witty little film."
"decoconnor5","9","1","3","22 January 2010"," New found respect for Clooney
","I think that this may well be Clooneys best performance to date. I didn't know a lot about the film before i went to see it, only what the adverts were giving. The story itself is very powerful and direct. It will pull audiences in and not let go. Clooney was given the perfect role and in return he delivered the perfect performance. The supporting cast all gave solid performances and their were some fantastic cameos from some very well known actors, one in particular from the man that made the Hangover so enjoyable! The story was so relevant and I think it will succeed due to its brutal honesty. Given the current global recession the writers saw an opportunity to really get inside the viewers heads. This film will have an effect on many people as it did to me. George Clooney was at his best and gave an amazing performance and in doing so allowed us to approach a topic that many people find to uncomfortable to talk about. A powerful piece of cinema."
"honorhorror","9","1","3","21 January 2010"," The real tragedy?
","And yes. Up in the Air is one of the finest crafted motion picture of year 2009. If you have any interest in it, go check out Clooney, his big-time young apprentice and Vera Farmiga in this movie.<br/><br/>No matter how much you try to take it as a comedy, it's essentially very sad in the undertone. And, after you know better and better how to write a proper satire, you'd know there's something fishy about Farmiga's character the moment you see her naked back. So, Up in the Air is not about revolutionary story structure, instead it's a good look at our daily miseries as we are more comfortable in calling them ""daily lives"".<br/><br/>Clooney's character Ryan Bingham reminds me of his performances in Coen brothers' comedies as well as in more serious dramas like Michael Clayton. It's a magically charming character with very deep sense of exhaustion and sadness restrained, but with robotic professional attitude embedded. This mixed feeling of reality and its funny side is even deepened when his young apprentice/competitor Natalie(with a surprising performance from young actress Anna Kendrick) interacts with him. ""The man who's ready to make a connection"" the tag-line will be realized as an ultimate irony once you finished the movie. That's because everyone Clooney met and made friends with in the movie eventually would be ""send off"" by him(willingly or unwillingly). He makes emotional connections with people only because he's part of a mechanic that cuts undesirable ties when companies decided to do some laying off.<br/><br/>If we try to double the irony and sadness in Juno and Thank You for Smoking, we would finally get something like Up in the Air. Except this one gives you more chills when you walk out of the theater. ""Do I deserve to be treated like a machine, a used one?"" You may ask. Well, that's the question I often ask myself, but if you, like me, always have treat yourself as a dedicated working machine, then the answer is undoubtedly yes. The movie showed different mindsets of people dealing with families, goals in the life, etc......One scene that caught me was when Clooney attached the ""gnome pictures"" he shot for his little sister to the USA map. That's when he realized there's something more valuable in the life he missed. While Ryan Bingham the 10-million-miles loyal flight passenger haven't got an option but had to fly on, I prayed for myself to have an option not to be like him. God bless America."
"Troy_Campbell","7","1","3","15 January 2010"," Occasionally poignant, sometimes conceited, but always entertaining.
","After his critically acclaimed, but commercially underrated, debut feature film Thank You For Smoking, Jason ""son of Ivan"" Reitman proved he was one of those uncanny directors who could make those type of indie movies that seep into the mainstream. Then there was Juno. Reitman's sophomore effort won all sorts of awards, especially for Diablo Cody's unique screenplay. But it was Reitman's handling of the dialogue on screen that really makes it work and turned what would have been a cult favourite into a widespread, modern-day classic. Third time round and Reitman has his first bona fide Hollywood star – and budget – to work with. But with great resources comes great expectations.<br/><br/>Already tipped as an Oscar frontrunner by the critical world, Air is actually Reitman's least successful film. That's not to say it isn't very good and doesn't show glimmers of brilliance, but unlike his previous works it just feels a touch overdone with the self-knowing hipness and metaphorical messages. Where Smoking's biting satire and Juno's razor-sharp dialogue felt natural, Air's quirkiness has an – wait for it – air of arrogance. This may be misleading though as Reitman's slightly subpar output – compared to his own work – is still an enjoyable journey that most filmmakers could only dream of creating. He obviously has a confidence when dealing with multi-layered characters and plots as he handles them with ease; Ryan, Natalie and Alex all go through a massive arc that is realistic and intriguing whilst the underlying stories of family, love and job-loss are always present, even if only in the background.<br/><br/>Whilst I would be extremely hard pressed to put Reitman or his film as the one to beat at the Oscars this year, Clooney is a different case altogether. The notorious ladies man gives himself over completely to Ryan Bingham, a middle-aged bachelor who seems entirely comfortable and content with his isolated, travelling lifestyle in the clouds, but is possibly a different man underneath the facade. He should be loathsome and unrecognisable, however Clooney's inspired performance ensures Bingham is neither; in fact he is quite the opposite. Without seeing the other touted Oscar contenders it is hard to say, but Clooney gets my early vote for Best Actor. In the peripheral is the tremendously talented Farmiga, who has etched out a respectable CV for herself over the last few years, and Twilight¬ sideliner Kendrick who proves she is worth more than just teenage guff.<br/><br/>Occasionally poignant, sometimes conceited, but always entertaining thanks to a career-best turn from Clooney.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","I went and saw this movie after hearing all the buzz, and decided I needed to see it for myself. Besides the friend I was with, I was the youngest person there by 30 years (I'm 24). Minutes into the movie, I realized why.<br/><br/>Many of the early firings are people that valued themselves as ""Company Men"" and the air of hopelessness that surrounds the idea that a loyal employee of 15+ years isn't safe from downsizing is all too real. My own father recently lost his job at the company he's worked for 28 years.<br/><br/>The desperation the fresh faced college grad has after realizing the gravity of her job is a rude awakening to a generation that already has huge trust issues. We're expected to be loyal to companies we work for, yet they reserve the right to fire us at the drop of a hat. It's a wonder that my generation is so fickle in who we share our lives with.<br/><br/>The most flooring part of the movie comes when George Clooney's character and the girl walk into an office almost completely devoid of life and proceed to fire people who work at desks without walls, completely vulnerable.<br/><br/>Vera's character made me absolutely sick, I won't completely spoil the end of the movie, but I hated her character after developing this bond with her for the first hour.<br/><br/>In the end we assume George Clooney's character flies off into the sunset back into his hopeless life, absent of any meaningful relationships.<br/><br/>The movie is a ""dark comedy"" but some of the subject matter is so real and close to home, that I forgot about the funny parts altogether. I have never seen a movie that is so ""for it's time"" and I appreciate what Reitman created."

There's a cute scene in that movie in which Nicholson and Keeton are in separate beds, (not even in the same room?) texting each other on their MacBooks; a scene repeated in ""Up in the Air"", except on (I assume) iPhones...cute, but it does raise the question, homage or product placement? <br/><br/>Thought the the aerial photography was superb, and really brought home the point how homogenized the on the ground airport environs are, irrespective of the surrounding terrain. Another nice touch the little homage cum history lesson at the airport in St.Louis"
"JimD73","8","1","3","13 January 2010"," The most relevant movie of the year
","For such a new director, Jason Reitman certainly had the string of hits. Starting with corporate-sleazeball-with-a-heart gem Thank You for Smoking, and continuing with Oscar-nominated hipster fuel Juno, his third film, Up in the Air certainly had a lot to live up to. While skewing more towards his first film than his more popular second, Up in the Air is still a moving, funny and, most impressively, relevant drama.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Ryan Bingam, a man whose job it is to fly around the country firing people. Ostensibly, he helps them find new jobs (relocation services), but for the most part, its to help supervisors too cowardly to fire their own employees. Due to his job, he lives in airports, spending at least 300 days of the year in the air. He's saving up for record-high air miles, he has gold cards to all major hotels and car rental services. He gives motivational talks on how baggage such as family, friends and any commitments in general.<br/><br/>Of course, whenever we are introduced to a character like this, we immediately know that something or someone will change him over the course of the film. In this case, there are two. The first is Alex, a woman Ryan meets in a hotel bar and proceeds to wildly forrnicate with. Like him, she spends much of her time in the air. She has gold cards, texts dirty and refers to herself as Ryan, ""but with a vagina"".<br/><br/>The second is Natalie Keener, a new and fresh employee at Ryan's company. She has the bright idea of cutting air travel costs by doing all firings over webcam, which Ryan opposes due both to concerns of the quality of job decreasing plus (mainly) how it would ruin his lifestyle. To show her the ropes, Natalie is forced to shadow Ryan on his trips in order to learn the ropes, during which time she learns the harsh reality and Ryan learns the follies of his ways.<br/><br/>It sounds cliché, I know, but honestly it goes in some unexpected directions. I highly doubt anyone would have expected the ending to be the way it is based solely on trailers. It does stretch a bit at the end, and perhaps is a bit too vague in the ending, but it usually has a good pace to it and is overall quite clever, and often funny.<br/><br/>The movie also happens to be incredibly relevant given the current economy, as a major focus is the moral decay inherent in making a living taking away the jobs of others. The fired employees are all played realistically (even Zach Galifinakis) and never too over the top. JK Simmons in a cameo is particularly effective. The little documentary-style compilation at the end is a bit much, but this may be the movie to sum up the year 2009 perfectly.<br/><br/>The cast is by all means excellent. Clooney plays Ryan as very confident and self-centered, yet rarely does he come across as selfish. Its the kind of role Clooney specialises in, and he's damn good at it. Farmiga basically plays a female Clooney, and manages to keep up with him somehow. Jason Bateman is unfortunately underused as Ryan's lazy boss. The true standout is Anna Kendrick as the naive Natalie who, despite an annoying crying scene, steals the show.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is by all means an excellent film and one of the most relevant of the year. In ten years, if someone asks me for one movie to sum up 2009, this will be that film. Maybe not the hipster breed some Juno fans might expect, but for a trip into the lives of the busy, look no further."

","Ryan (George Clooney) is an ace at what he does. He works for a company, under boss Craig (Jason Bateman), which sends him all over the country to corporations who are downsizing. Its Ryan's job to give those being ""axed"" the bad news. As distasteful as this might seem, Ryan does it with care and consideration, giving the newly fired advice on how to overcome this temporary setback. But, what Ryan loves MOST about his job is that he gets to travel everywhere and is never in one place very long. Unmarried and disliking commitments and family ties, he is rarely at his tiny apartment in Omaha. One day, however, a sort of reckoning occurs. The new business hotshot at Ryan's firm, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has convinced Craig that video conferencing is the best way to go. No more flying here and there and wasting money. They can do their ""dirty work"" from their headquarters in Omaha. Ryan is upset, to say the least. He makes some sharp observations about why it won't work and he insists that Craig let him take the biz whiz on some trips to get a clearer picture of the operations. Craig agrees. Meanwhile, Ryan has met a fellow frequent flyer businesswoman, Alex (Vera Farmiga) in a hotel lobby and they are starting to ""arrange"" their schedules to meet time and again. Is this the beginning of something? Not likely. As Ryan and Natalie travel to Wichita, Detroit and many other places, Natalie does learn what a difficult job it is to let someone go gracefully, even in person. She also flounders when HER perfect boyfriend calls it quits. Will the video-termination idea fall apart permanently? This is a great film, tackling many difficult issues with courage. For example, what is most important in life, our work or our family connections? Don't laugh, for our jobs sustain our families, making it difficult for everyone when positions are lost. Also, should we open our hearts, only to have them broken? As the players in this drama, the cast is truly great. Clooney is terrific as the flying ""loner"", who isn't happy with the changes to his present life. At critical times, his marvelous facial expressions say it all. Farmiga, Kendrick, and Bateman also do superb work, as do the lesser cast members. Costumes, sets, and cinematography are very fine. Especially noteworthy are the aerial views of cities just as Ryan's plane is landing. But, it is the script and rock-solid direction of Jason Reitman that take top honors. Here is a story with so much substance that it belies the feeling of ""air"". Therefore, if you never want to miss the ""heavyweights"" of American film, race over to the nearest cinema and buy a ticket for this one. It is a classic stand-out in the cinematic world."
"sidfargas","Null","1","3","7 January 2010"," a wonderful character study that makes you think
","A story that takes a deep look at purpose in life and exactly what avenues that are available to some. It's a wonderful character study and I'm glad the movie itself never resorted to clichés or an overly predictable path. Sure, some plot turns are easy to spot but the message I got out of the story is that purpose has to be defined by an individual, not society or other people's expectations. That's the true beauty of the script. Clooney's quips and charm do carry the film but the overall tone is masterfully presented. Do you need a ""co-pilot"" to be happy in life? As in reality, the answer is not what you think it would be. Clooney's character himself doesn't know for certain but he seems to be trying to figure it out while enjoying true freedom and self-fulfillment. Loneliness only rears its head after he fools himself in to thinking that he wants more. His ending monologue doesn't pass judgment but does give the viewer more to think about. Paraphrasing: ""People will come home to their bouncing dogs and screaming kids after locking themselves away for the day to look up at the stars. One star that is shining brighter than the rest will be my wingtip as I pass by."""

","Up in the Air follows the life of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a mature, single, middle aged man whose job is to fire people. Directed by Jason Reitman (Juno and Thank You for Smoking), it hits home in relation to our currently troubled economic climate, which is bound to get our attention. Ryan is a charming man, liked by just about everyone albeit his clients. His employment has him flying just about everywhere in the country, and as such he lives a life composed mostly of solitude. Fortunately for him, the trade off of close personal social interaction gives him the bonus of high-end credit cards and VIP hotel accommodations.<br/><br/>However, like with a lot of other fields, his job is changing and evolving. Enter the young and very bright, Natalie Keener played by Anna Kendrick (the Twilight Saga) who has a brilliant idea to save money by doing all the terminations via webcam on the ever-practical internet. Ryan's new job is to teach Anna the ropes before the company is totally sold on her idea.<br/><br/>Also joined with the cast is Vera Flamigo (the Departed) as Alex, a fellow frequent flyer with a similar 'no-strings attached' attitude and an obvious affection toward Bingham.<br/><br/>This movie was smart, witty, and playfully cynical. Clooney does a great job as usual, trying to mentor sweet Anna of the detached yet falsely hopeful persona this position requires. Under the guise of a documentary crew, the director actually held real interviews for the film with people whom recently been fired from their jobs and asked them to express the way they felt during their termination.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and engaging, but not necessarily unpredictable. However, it by no means follows the Hollywood general criteria. Put simply, Up in the Air gives perspective on what should really matter in life, and the effects of our appreciation, or lack thereof."
"poordeep","10","2","10","10 December 2009"," Another gem from the director of Juno & Thank You for Smoking...
","Here is a fine example of movie-making: no dazzling special effects, no breath-taking locales and yet... you have a contender for the Picture of the Year. Director Jason Reitman presents a well-timed study of a corporate downsizer and consummate frequent traveler, finely portrayed by George Clooney in top form.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham loves to fly and has a rather disagreeable job: he fires people on behalf of corporations that are downsizing. He is a decent, charming and sharp man who has embraced whole-heartedly a world of material perks. He carries with him his badges of honor: elite frequent flyer cards, exclusive frequent guest cards with hotels, special privilege cards with car rentals and so on. He has spent 322 days in the last year traveling and 43 ""miserable"" days at home in Omaha, Nebraska. His only goal in life is to be the seventh person in the world to log 10 million frequent flyer miles. While being pampered by every travel loyalty program on the road, he has nothing real to hold on to. In fact, his empty one-bedroom apartment is quite symbolic of his personal life: clean, cold and bare.<br/><br/>We meet up with Ryan (George Clooney) when he is encountering 3 significant changes in his life. His boss (Jason Bateman) has hired a young upstart protégé Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who wants to improve efficiency via teleconferencing and threatens to permanently ground Ryan and his counterparts. Ryan has met a simpatico traveler, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who seems to offer a meaningful connection to Ryan, one that he has never experienced before. Finally, Ryan's sister is getting married and wants him to attend the wedding in northern Wisconsin with the siblings that he barely knows.<br/><br/>At his boss's insistence, Ryan begins a road-trip with Natalie to show her why his job is a little more personal than a scripted workflow for firing employees, oops, letting them go. Along the way, Alex intersects itineraries with Ryan to spend time together. We follow Ryan as he reluctantly acknowledges the loneliness and emptiness of his life while Natalie discovers that there is a lot more to business transactions than she knows from her education. All the places in the film are familiar. Most of these are office buildings and hotels. There is no effort made to hide the hotel locations. For example, the signs for the Columbus Hampton Inn is clearly visible. These are places we have been to and we cannot help but relate to the events.<br/><br/>Clooney is nothing short of excellent as he embodies his character and manages to be funny, confident yet vulnerable and deserving of sympathy. The two female characters are presented as a brilliant study in contrast. Vera Farmiga displays excellent chemistry with Clooney as she presents a very assertive yet smooth business woman who has learned a lot from her experiences and is comfortable with her recalibrated expectations. Anna Kendrick as Natalie is a revelation. She presents Natalie as a bright, naive young manager who has a lot to learn but has an undeniably bright future. Reitman avoids the trap of making this character a stereotype and allows her to hold her own against the other two, more formidable leads.<br/><br/>This cannot be pegged as a comedy even though it has many funny moments. Reitman has captured the sad bitter truth about layoffs and the timing of this release could not be more appropriate. It is important to note that with a couple of exceptions of known actors, every person being fired in the film is someone recently laid off in real life. The excerpts in the film are a portion of hours of footage acquired by film-makers by getting reactions to job losses by real people. Some of these are heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>Having attended some networking group meetings with people looking for jobs, the phrase ""up in the air"" strikes a chord. In corporate-speak, a job-seeker is referred to as ""having landed"" when they find a job. In perspective, I suppose anyone looking for a job is still up in the air. If you stay through the credits, it is revealed that the title song is written by a recent job-seeker and offered to Reitman for use in his film. Reitman has become one of my favorite directors with this follow-up to Juno and Thank You for Smoking.<br/><br/>This is an masterful character study of a familiar corporate executive who is easy to relate to primarily because he doesn't belong to any one place. When asked, more than 30,000 feet off the ground, where he is from, Ryan's response is insightful: ""I'm from here.""

"C-Younkin","8","2","10","5 December 2009"," One of the best movies of the year? It's up there
","If you think ""Up in the Air"" is about laying people off, you're only half-right. It's really about learning how to connect with people and the even tougher goal of learning to care about people. It's a feel-good movie about dealing with feel-bad stuff, and not to mention a solid charmer with lots of laughs, heartbreaking poignancy, and terrific performances. <br/><br/>George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a hired gun for companies too spineless to fire their own employees. He enjoys his solitary life and considers planes and hotel rooms home, but a new business plan thought up by 20-something new-hire Natalie (Anna Kendrick) and meeting a fellow frequent flier, Alex (Vera Farmiga), both leave him putting his theories of life and love into question. <br/><br/>Director-writer Jason Reitman offers unique ideas and funny lines about everything from the internet age, new view of feminism, the modern-day version of love, and traveling (one terrific scene has Clooney and Farmiga showing off gold-club cards). Clooney gives a smooth talking, confident, and comforting performance. He's also a romantic lead in the mold of a Cary Grant-type. If he doesn't get the Oscar, he should at least get some thank you notes from HR departments around the country. Farmiga has a very sexy chemistry with him (and not to mention a perfect ass) but sadly doesn't get much to do besides being the love interest. Still, this is many steps above ""Orphan."" And Kendrick's youthful innocence and naiveté is well played, proving to be a voice of reason and someone in-over-her-head at different points. Jason Bateman also shows up (as Clooney's boss) sporting a really horrible beard. It looks like someone smeared Nutella all over his face. Minor quibbles aside though, this is Reitman's best movie yet. It finds humor, heart, and inspiration when dealing with times of uncertainty, while always keeping it real with some nice twists. It's the best romantic comedy this year by far. So suck-it every other romantic comedy this year!"
"MannyCastro","Null","2","12","4 December 2009"," ""Up in the Air"" is High in Quality!
","We're in a recession and many are losing their jobs everyday. It's a dark time in American history...except for companies that specialize in corporate downsizing. One of its employees is Ryan Bingham (George Clooney). He's nomadic by nature, so he doesn't mind traveling the country and firing people. In fact, he's about to become the 7th person to reach ten million frequent flyer miles and he's proud of it. Then one day, a 23-year-old college grad named Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is hired to save costs by making the company more electronic. Her idea is to fire people through webcams. Bingham doesn't like that. It has to be done in person...or at least that's the excuse he's using so he can remain on the road. So, he takes the young lady under his wing and shows her how it's done. In the meantime, he meets a fellow frequent flyer named Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and the webcam idea doesn't sound bad anymore.<br/><br/>Overall, it's another well-done and quirky film from director Jason Reitman whose credits include Thank You For Smoking and Juno. However, I don't think it's the year's best as the National Board of Review claimed yesterday. The highlight is mostly the performances. Clooney is his usual charming self, but the stand-out is Kendrick. You might remember her as Jessica in the Twilight series. She's very spunky and adds a lot of humor to the film. I can see her being nominated at the Oscars for best supporting actress."

"eddax","9","1","4","18 February 2010"," A rather genteel movie
","I definitely enjoy the Jason Reitman touch, though I have to say of the three movies that he's directed and I've seen, I prefer Thank You for Smoking, which was a dark comedy. Juno was comparatively too... light. This movie is kinda fluffy too, and I think that I'm disappointed that it's not more subversive.<br/><br/>At the onset, I thought I would love it, since it began with witty banter between two people who are essentially homeless because they are travelling constantly for work. Their flirtation composes of comparing frequent flyer and car rental clubs elite statuses. Hot. But I soon realized that the focus was on George Clooney's character soon being grounded and his life being ironically up in the air while he has to adjust to redeveloping social and familial relationships. <br/><br/>There's also social commentary to be found as Clooney works as a professional firer, so to speak. Big companies hire him to retrench their staff when they don't want to do their own dirty work. Hence, it's pretty relevant in the current economic climate. It also adds some spice to an otherwise genteel movie.<br/><br/>George Clooney and Vera Farmiga, as the two frequent flyers, give radiant yet understated performances. Anna Kendrick, the uptight young upstart, is fun to watch, especially when she has her little breakdown. <br/><br/>I don't know; I liked this movie well enough but it doesn't feel like a Best Picture to me. I think it's more likely to just net Reitman a screenplay win, as with Sofia Coppola and Lost in Translation."
"MetalAngel","10","1","4","15 February 2010"," A unique film, unlike any I've seen before.
","Jason Reitman is on his way to become one of the greatest film directors of our time. Of an ostensibly young age, and with only three films under his belt, he has already proved himself as a visionary young director who refreshes the film industry and gives his movies the necessary combination of electricity and art that appeals to both mainstream audiences and art lovers. ""Thank You for Smoking"", his directorial debut, was an astoundingly hilarious dark comedy with deep and poignant reflections; ""Juno"" was a miracle comedy which revolutionized the teen comedy genre and which found its way into every household viewing experience. Now his latest film, ""Up in the Air"", is yet another dose of genius, a dramedy that entertains as it ponders the precarious balance between work and family, dealing with every scene a jolting blow to our consciences and a permanent life lesson to be learned.<br/><br/>The film introduces us to Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a highly successful man who lives for his one-of-a-kind job: firing people. He's the best at a highbrow company where experts at firing people are hired by other companies to do the dirty work for them. Ryan is forced to fire countless people he's never met before, day after day, and he's really good at remaining emotionless and calm through their reactions- ranging from openly crying, to pleading for their family's well-being, to violently throwing a fit, to threatening with suicide. And yet, after each grueling meeting, he emerges with a smile, ready to take the next plane wherever he's needed next.<br/><br/>Ryan is a happy man, happy in his loneliness. He's comfortable up in the air, away from human connections, and thrives by earning wads of money, living in airports and keeping safely distant relationships with the few acquaintances he has. His friends are airport and store clerks who greet him happily as their patron, his girlfriends are casual women he meets at airport bars for a one-night stand, his family is the company he works for. What amazes audiences about this Ryan character is how coldly focused and intelligent he is- so much so that he acknowledges his loneliness, recognizes how isolated he's becoming, accepts the fact it may be detrimental to his well-being...and yet he relishes it. He lives for a fast-paced life traveling and earning frequent flyer miles.<br/><br/>One day, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) comes along; a sensual, intelligent, successful woman he meets at an airport bar. Naturally, they hit it off right away, but through time and through many meetings with her, he begins to understand the sudden and unforeseen need for company. And with the arrival of Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young girl with fresh ideas and dating issues who challenges his working techniques and whom he has to show the ropes around the 'firing people' business, he begins to earn valuable life lessons and he begins to discover the deep complexities of the human condition...and how they're a deliciously bittersweet experience he can no longer live without.<br/><br/>Naturally, the film deals with highly complex topics, and they really ARE complex. These are topics authors have devoted heavy volumes to, and they've been thoroughly explored and cross-section in endless psychology textbooks. In a two-hour film, and through a fascinatingly original illustrative story, Jason Reitman has managed to probe into the topics and wrench their guts out to be exposed to an awestruck audience. The sheer force and poignant situations in the film are sure to make the audience both gag with heartbreak and sigh after laughing. Like another critic said, 'it's a searing and delicious slice of life', and every second of the film rings with truth and comic drama that we can all identify with. Clooney is down-to-earth and believable, the two supporting actresses are a joy to watch; the extras hired to play the fired employees have actually been fired at some point in their lives, and they were asked to improvise their emotions based on past experiences...so you can imagine the raw emotional power of their short performances.<br/><br/>It's an effective story driven by its pitch-perfect screenplay and its flawless performances. Notice how the drama and emotion happen by themselves, as naturally and as realistically as a film can convey. Rolfe Kent's score is quiet and creeps under the action to the point where you KNOW the music has become part of the feeling and not an enhancer; Eric Steelberg's cinematography deals no fantastic camera shots or dramatic camera effects, but includes every detail of the scene and makes us feel like actual witnesses of the action; it's us in that room, and Ryan is firing us. Basically, we're forced to take in the film as a whole and every technical aspect contributes to this wonderfully-crafted story.<br/><br/>As with his previous films, Reitman pays close attention to every word of the dialogue. It's fast-paced, witty, but every syllable down to every pause is important and is rendered to perfection. This is surely the best screenplay I've seen all year (adapted from the novel by Walter Kirn). It's a film to meditate with, to reflect upon...but above all, to bask in and to marvel at. And it's a hell of a good time too! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!"

","I don't think there is anybody around in 2010 that makes acting look as easy as George Clooney. He oozes charm and it seems any role he takes , he makes it his own. And there lies my problem. Despite the fact that films like Up in the Air , Burn after reading and Michael Clayton are all very good films in their own right , Clooney seems to be the same guy in all of them. There seems to be attempt to change the character in any way , and although some people like Clooney to be the way he is , i for one would love to see him trying something a little different. <br/><br/>Ryan has long been contented with his unencumbered lifestyle lived out across America in airports, hotels and rental cars. He can carry all he needs in one wheel-away case; he's a pampered, elite member of every travel loyalty program in existence; and he's close to attaining his lifetime goal of 10 million frequent flier miles-- and yet...Ryan has nothing real to hold onto. When he falls for a simpatico fellow traveler , Ryan's boss , inspired by a young, upstart efficiency expert , threatens to permanently call him in from the road. Faced with the prospect, at once terrifying and exhilarating, of being grounded, Ryan begins to contemplate what it might actually mean to have a home. <br/><br/>Up in The Air is an enjoyable movie . I love the way that Ryan's goal in life was to get as many air miles while he dodged any form of commitment and stable lifestyle . I'm friends with a couple of people who are commitmentphobes so it made me laugh to see someone in a movie with the same problem. I enjoyed the performances of the two leading ladies Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick and there is one scene in particular involving Vera Farmiga that will stick in the mind for a while ( Guys , it's 15 minutes into the film!) Over the last couple of months this movie has been banded around as potentially Oscar winning material and although it's a perfectly good film, in my opinion , it's no ""Best Movie"" winner ."

","Having flown >55k/yr for 4+yrs, I personally understand Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) world: Blackberry in hand, efficiently filling grey TSA bins, hotel key cards as home key, snatching a boarding pass from a kiosk while by-passing non-Elite, living a week from rolling luggage, laptop on hotel WiFi, hotel shuttle as one's commute, and satellite offices as one's ""home"" office. These images of what people hate about travel are truly fond reminders of a frequent flyer's home. His Omaha office's and corporate apartment's sparseness both prove his fear of not being on the move. The camera carefully but quickly frames each fleeting postcard from the frequent flyer's world. Their world is not just a dream but a daily reality briefly hinted to some and lived by only a few.<br/><br/>Warning: frequent fliers expecting a rehash of their lives and loves will be disappointed. The movie must venture into emotional drama thus is not a documentary about high mileage.<br/><br/>Stereotypes of men as emotionally unavailable simpletons fall under Ryan's admissions of growing loneliness and desire to see someone more than once: his casual hotel fling, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Ryan's purposefully designed world of emotional isolation, as many mature male knows, is unsustainable. Attending his sister's wedding pangs his conscience. His loyal partner/fling saves Ryan from a potentially lonely event. Life is a tease: we just want to be loved and to love.<br/><br/>New hire Natalie Keener's (Anna Kendrick) proposal of firing via videoconferencing grounds Ryan's high-flying ambitions. Her Ivy League psychology degree belies her chilly exterior, each glance able to efficiently e-fire an anonymous worker bee. Ryan's boss charges him with tour guiding Natalie through in-person firings on the road. Beyond the comedy of Natalie's new-to-flying hiccups is the familiar notion that coworkers become adopted families. Work experiences become unexpected opportunities to share personal revelations not told to even (or especially) family members. Personal, private turmoils burst into one's professional life. Work and life blur as working hours lengthen, as business travel forces ad hoc families.<br/><br/>The movie's purposeful shift to a ponderous ending comes after a series of unexpected turns. Emotional isolation becomes impossible. A family crisis undoes his intentional emotional distance from them. Each firing brings Ryan closer to his own firing. The trainee becomes the trainer. The unfamiliar world of frequent flying becomes too familiar. The theme song ""Help Yourself"" sarcastically toasts the new economy. This movie has its pulse on our lives. Widespread acclaim of the movie is thanks to its balancing a fun lifestyle which is based on true stories which relate to our lives: emotionally isolating 1-night stands, unforgivingly impersonal corporate climate, travel as general burden, and family rifts growing and healing. The movie covers much ground without ever leaving home ... pun intended."

","I guess you may have to be of a certain age to fully appreciate a film like this because I think you may have to have lived a few of these scenarios to understand where the characters are coming from. I see a lot of negative reviews of this picture and I would assume that most of them are from people under 30 or even 25. The term used the most is that the film is ""boring"", and I guess to a younger person who has not lived much would think a movie about a middle aged guy who loves to be in airports would be just that. I recently worked for 6 years as an adviser for a large company and had to travel almost every week here and abroad and let me tell you it gets to you quickly. One hotel becomes another and each city looks the same. I can see where Clooney's character of Ryan Bingham could learn to love it because it is how he escapes from the reality he refuses to face. He claims to not want family and a committed relationship but we begin to see that he does when he gets around his estranged sisters and falls for a mysterious woman who is his equal in not wanting to get serious, but she has different reasons. The chemistry between all the characters is great and Anna Kendrick is wonderful as the spunky newcomer who is a reflection of Ryan when he was young. What I liked best was that the movie does not end on a high note, no sappy wrapped up happiness. He gets screwed and has no one, it's the bed he chose to lie in and now it is all he has. The character of Ryan Bingham is an instant classic, a modern Willie Loman if you will, who's failures make us feel better about ourselves."

","Important life lesson: If you're approaching an airport security checkpoint and you've an option of standing behind a party with small children, an elderly couple, or Asian businessmen, always go with the Asians because they're notorious for packing lite and inevitably will wear slip on shoes.<br/><br/>All of this as told by Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a very very preferred customer of most airlines, hotels, and car rental agencies in the continental U.S. He's what they call a ""termination specialist"", which is a fancy word for someone who fires employees when the actual company doesn't have the balls or the inclination to do so themselves. Seems like a waste of time and money to me, but it's a good concept for the film and so I'll put that aside. Ryan's job requires him to travel endlessly to various companies to fire employees on site. Through this is he is able to avoid having to take on any lasting commitments or responsibilities that come along with setting down roots somewhere. His home is in the air, he proclaims. He feels more at home in a strange hotel than he does in his own cold, impersonal 1-bedroom apartment that he hardly ever sees. His own personal motto is ""set down the backpack""; the backpack being the ""stuff"" that we acquire throughout our lives; the stuff that serves no purpose but to tie us to things that don't add up to a hill of beans in the end. ""We all die alone"" he states in one of his motivational set-down-the-backpack speeches at yet another out of state hotel.<br/><br/>Ryan firmly believes in his outlook and probably would have gone on that way indefinitely if it wasn't for a young ambitious employee Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who threatens his freedom when she proposes a new process by which all terminations would be conducted via the internet and a webcam. Through this innovation the employees would no longer be required to travel but would conduct their business through the central office. Ryan squirms at the thought.<br/><br/>The storyline is somewhat typical. Many films deal with the ""changed man"" concept, as does this one. However this one is more clever the most. The script is very intelligent and the main cast is commendable. George is his usual charming self, nothing new really from him this time. Vera Farmiga is steadily becoming one of my favorite actresses for good reason. But the standout one to me was Anna Kendrick. I'd only seen her in the much loved/much hated Twilight and even in that she stood out with her quirky bubbliness. Perhaps that's why I'm so impressed, but I feel like she's got good things in her future as an actress. She looks all of 12 years old but she held her own with one of the biggest stars in Hollywood; even outshined him in some scenes. Kendrick's character really makes the film what it is. Clooney's character feeds off of her innocence and fresh outlook on life; essentially creating the focal point of the film. Through a young girl who is still wet behind the ears, a hardened cynical older man finds himself. And suddenly cardboard cutouts don't seem all that ridiculous.<br/><br/>My rating: 7.4/10"

","If you like marriage then this movie is for you. I happen to think the opposite, hence I do not find the movie too pleasant. It could have been sponsored by the catholic church, or any other institution that mystifies marriage. <br/><br/>I found only dumb and shallow arguments for marriage in that flick, nothing substantial or convincing, e.g. ""you need a copilot, you don't want to be alone, you don't want to be old and lonely when you die"", and so on, the usual pseudo philosophical crap, as if in order to not being alone did require anyone to marry at all. Just think that you can have all the good stuff in life, like sex, companionship, kids, without the drudgery of the glorified, out of date relationship called marriage, which most of the time will certainly fail you, and often leaves you stripped of your car, house, assets, even your own offspring. More and more people are in relationships without a marriage certificate. much to the chagrin of hard core religious simple minds, who will sure love that (IMHO) not so thrilling movie. <br/><br/>The good thing is that Ryan Bingham does not fall into the marriage trap, partly because the woman he increasingly likes turns out to be already married with kids, and used him as an escape from her own husband."

","""Up in the Air"" is a movie you must force yourself to stick with, as although many of the characters are difficult to like it's still very well worth seeing. Much of this is because of the clever script, much of it is because of the nice acting but most of it is because the film avoids all the typical clichés you see in movies. In fact, this is one of the best films of 2009--and far better than some of the other Oscar nominees. Perhaps not as good as ""Precious"" or ""Hurt Locker"" but a wonderful film.<br/><br/>George Clooney stars as a strange and rather antisocial man. No, this does not mean he commits crimes or he hits people--he's just convinced that it's better to have no connections in life...none. He is thrilled that his job keeps him on the road 320+ days a year and has worked very hard to avoid closeness or ties. And, at first I hated this sort of thing as the film seemed to be saying this was a good thing. However, through the course of the film you see a few minor chinks in Clooney's armor. Perhaps it isn't quite as perfect as he says it is--even if he does give seminars on the joys of non-connectedness when he isn't doing his regular job--which is traveling the country and firing people for various clients--a great job for such a guy.<br/><br/>There is MUCH more to the film than this and two important women that come into Clooney's life. But the best part of it is NEVER does the film give in to sentiment and clichés--Clooney does NOT discover any magic and the film does not end of a typical Hollywood note. It's daring and you may not like the fact it is not a 'happily ever after' film--but I loved that it was deliberately vague and left so much to the viewer to make of the movie. Clever and well worth seeing...HOWEVER, be careful. It's not a movie to watch if you are unemployed or have just come out of a relationship--it might just churn up too many personal issues. Great...just be careful.<br/><br/>By the way, there was one thing I did not love about the film. The soundtrack was filled with too much LOUD indie wuss music and it was, at times, too pervasive and invasive."

These script writers should study the work of the great screen writers to learn that WORDS are important. <br/><br/>Clooney looks faded, old, worn and only Garbo could have that blank look and get away with it, on George Clooney a blank look is a blank look.<br/><br/>The women in this picture will soon be forgotten too. Where are the great lady stars of yore like Kim Novak, Julie Christie? who never had to talk trash but were mesmerizing so sexy whom you never forget!<br/><br/>I also fly a lot and Sam Elliot looked 100 years old as a Pilot. Am sure a lot of AA pilots got rankled over how a Pilot was portrayed.<br/><br/>I am not sure if anyone else caught this but I surmised early on that Clooney was playing a gay man trying to masquerade as a playboy straight man; deep in the closet but Gay<br/><br/>American Airlines should ask for its money back."

","Up in the Air has a contrived plot with likable characters and interesting depictions of a fictitious occupation designed to play on the current political climate. It is agenda-driven and ultimately predictable. George Clooney does an admirable job of establishing Ryan Bingham then phones in the remainder. Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick give compelling performances, but their characters have initial moments of interest followed by spotty hits and misses. Ryan's hometown scenes add little other than reinforcing the message that flyover country is filled with simpletons.<br/><br/>I might have given this a higher rating, but it was hyped so much as a great film, it fell way below expectation."

He tries to make connections and in the grand scheme of things, fails.) I mean sure, the firing is an unpleasant obligation that goes along with that existence, but you do the best you can. I hope there are no doctors out there who enjoy telling people they have cancer, but someone has to do it, and in both capacities, their task is to try to make the process as painless as possible.<br/><br/>You're either a family person or a career person.

I know, I made that up, but it's the perfect metaphor as he flies from place to place doing his job and ending up spending more time in the air than in any other place. He doesn't even own a home or even rent and his greatest pleasure is to make a presentation of how the things you own and the people you know are nothing but dead weights.<br/><br/>Now, this could have been a total screwup, by placing some wide eyed female star to steal his heart and make him realize his mistake of not being a star-crossed lover, not wanting kids or to settle.

"Red_Identity","Null","1","5","3 January 2010"," A powerful and rich film. One of the best of 2009
","Up In The Air is a rich film. It is one of those rare films that manages to entertain, make you laugh, make you sad, and one that stays with you after it is over. I say it is that rare film, because although there might be a lot that try to be similar in a way, Up In The Air is the one-of-a- kind film of 2009, and probably the most satisfying experience you will have from 2009. <br/><br/>George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man that goes all around the country firing people from different countries. He meets Alex (played by Vera Farmgia) and both believe they have the same desires for their relationship, and nothing mutual. Ryan is forced to teach Natalie (played by Anna Kendrick) the ropes of the company, after she endangers his chance of achieving a certain number of flier miles. All three of these characters go through circumstances that reveal their true nature and true life. I have never been a big fan of Clooney, I have always thought he plays the same types of characters in all of his films. But in this film, I finally recognize how great of an actor he is. He achieves everything that is required from him, and his subtle expressions and thoughts are perfectly portrayed. I fully appreciate his character transformations now, and how subtle and realistic they are. Vera Farmiga is a natural actress, and she reveals her character to be mysterious and not what we expect her to be. Anna Kendrick is a charmer, and I believe that all three actors deserve to be nominated for Academy Awards. I have only seen one other Jason Reitman film, and that is Juno. While that was a good film, a very good film at times, I found Up In The Air a lot better- more charming, more real. He has incredible writing skill and his direction was very well balanced, and he never over- directs anything or allows it to feel unauthentic. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, Up In The Air makes you think about your own life, and about everyone and everything involved with your experiences. It is one of the best films of 2009"
"wwefreakjon","10","1","5","2 January 2010"," If you're disappointed, you didn't get it
","The one thing that you will hear from 30% of critics and 60% of audiences about this movie is that the ending was a disappointment. The acting, superb; the screenplay, humorous with drama that makes you think; the direction, Jason Reitman's best; but the ending, disappointing. If you share this opinion of the film then you did not get the point.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a professional termination technician (in lay terms, he fires people for a living). He has settled into a lifestyle where he flies across the country for over 300 days a year. Due to this lifestyle his one goal in life is to accumulate 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles.<br/><br/>When a new hire at his company (Natalie Keener portrayed by Anna Kendrick) shows up wanting to change his business so that all the firing can be done over the internet, Bingham is told to take Keener with him on his next trip to show her the ropes of the business. While flying across the country Bingham meets Alex (Vera Farmiga), another middle aged travel hog and they begin to sleep together whenever their travel plans overlap.<br/><br/>The plot takes a turn when Bingham's boss decides to take Keener's new strategy over Bingham's old one; he goes to his sister's wedding with Alex. Through all of these people arriving in his life and events taking place, Bingham realizes that the way he is living doesn't work for him anymore.<br/><br/>After this little turn everyone is expecting the clichéd, redemption ending where Bingham gets the girl and becomes a wholesome person. This to say the least does not happen and that is the point. He led his life by running away from responsibility and relationships. The way the world is right now means that he can't just change and expect to be rewarded with everything that he wants. That is the point of the film. That the life that he led came back to bite him in the ass when he let down the wall he had built around himself.<br/><br/>Yes the plot is very depressing in the end and will leave you surprised, but that is the beauty of the film. It creates a stable and funny premise and let's all hell break loose.<br/><br/>Aside from that, Up in the Air will make you feel happy for a variety of reasons. Anna Kendrick's performance is the best of her career. She is funny, and smart but naïve which makes her a very interesting and realistic character. Vera Farmiga is also very good, as she plays Clooney's match and yet polar opposite simultaneously.<br/><br/>Clooney also has the best performance of his career in this film. His protagonist role fools you into believing things that are inherently untrue and unrealistic. This gives the film the power to pull the rug out from under you.<br/><br/>This movie is happy, sad, inspiring, and depressing all at once and that can come as a bit of a shock. But I suggest you see the film again if you didn't like it the first time. Maybe it will surprise you again."
"thesar-2","10","1","5","2 January 2010"," Up, Up and So Far Away
","I think why Up in the Air shot straight to the top of my 2009 best list is not only was it a perfect movie, it connected with me. I've seen a few dozen 5-star movies in the past few years, but none has connected with me personally since Lost in Translation.<br/><br/>As depressing as it could be at times, it showed truism with the scenes and especially the dialogue. The movie was so well crafted and written, so tight and real, I loved every minute of the movie.<br/><br/>It helps that I am a enormous George Clooney (Ryan) fan, but the biggest surprise for me was how incredible Vera Farmiga (Alex) fed/bounced off him with excellent ease. Listening to them go back and forth, especially with Anna Kendrick (Natalie) indirectly insulting them, was as much fun as watching Clooney (again) with Brad Pitt in Ocean's Eleven (or any of them, for that matter.) Ryan is set in his job, which because of the freedom of traveling and not being micromanaged, he is in love with his life on the road. His job (not the most ideal or friendly of employments) is firing those in multiple cities throughout the USA for approximately 320+ days a year. He does this due to the corporate big-wigs are too much of a pansy to do themselves. But Ryan has the gift of turning any negative statement (quiet, shouted, violent or sworn) into a positive. Yes, it's his job to do that, to ease people into their new ""lives,"" but he is effective in actually helping some. (On a side note, and this is probably why this was a personal movie for me, I have to do the same thing in my own job. Unfortunately, bad news is what I have to give to some people. Though I try to detach myself, as Ryan is perfect at, I simply cannot at times and it is heartbreaking to be the bearer of bad news.) Of course, there wouldn't be a movie without conflict, so in comes two new women in Ryan's life. On the road, as usual, Ryan meets Alex in a bar. The scene was so juicy in dialogue and filled with spontaneity, I couldn't believe (at first) that this was their initial introduction. But, that sets the scene for their ""non-involved relationship,"" whether sexual or just company in the long days away from their own homes. A perfect union of noncommittal, planned out encounters.<br/><br/>The other variance in Ryan's life, the other female is a 23-year-old, extremely wet behind the ears college grad, Natalie who's book-smart, but hardly street-wise. Her idea is to save money by transferring live fires to chat-room lay-offs. Impersonal? Absolutely, and Ryan immediately clashes with her in one of the best scenes in the movie. Nevertheless, Ryan's boss (Bateman) sends her out with Ryan with fantastic comedic scenes, including and especially the ones where Ryan, whom you know pretty well by this point, is pitch-quiet.<br/><br/>And that's how well made this movie is. You know the characters. You not only feel for them, you understand them. All the while the movie does progress and characters grow/develop and even more layers are uncovered. If the movie didn't grab me from frame one (and it did) the longer it went on, the ingenious plot developments, including comedy and drama and definitely realism, the more I fell in love with the film.<br/><br/>It's almost award time. Here are my wants for Up in the Air: Best Picture, Best Actor (Clooney), Best Supporting Actress (Farmiga), Best Director (Reitman) and Best Adapted Screenplay. If it wins for all, it is truly a perfect world, but the following is what I am willing to settle for.<br/><br/>No one, and I mean no actor living, could pull off the role of Ryan as Clooney did. I am hoping for another Best Actor Oscar for his performance, but I will settle on Farmiga as Best Supporting Actress. Not only was she a surprise scene-stealer for me, but she was absolutely excellent. I strongly believe also this should win a Best Adapted Screenplay at very least. And it's funny, usually when I said that, before the Oscars are announced, I'm usually right. I also wanted the following to win Best Screenplays (Original or Adapted): Brokeback Mountain, L.A. Confidential, The Silence of the Lambs, No Country for Old Men, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Juno, Lost in Translation, Little Miss Sunshine, American Beauty, Fargo, and Pulp Fiction. All of which won. (To me, the ""Original"" award is even better, but nevertheless, I still wanted them to earn a screen writing Oscar.) As you can see from the list before, my favorite aspect of any movie begins with the script. Everyone of them above received a 5/5 (or close to) and it was related to the script. Real dialogue, interesting ideas, originality, pace. These are all things I look for, probably first, in a film. And Up in the Air captures all of these. So, again, in case the Academy Award voters are off again – and 7/10 times they are in the majority of categories (namely Best Picture), I'm hoping for the win in the Best Adapted Screenplay section.<br/><br/>See this movie. Especially now with the economy in the state it is. Sure, the source material's years old, but this is as fresh as it can be. See it, at very least, to understand what happens on the other side of the desk when you're laid off or fired. Of which, I've been both and never bothered to put myself in the other's shoes."

It soars on the strength of the writing, direction & 3 excellent performances surrounded by a slew of really good ones.<br/><br/>As much as I'd like to describe this movie I don't want to give anything away. It is as unpredictable as that ""A"" movie is predictable. It could have gone wrong so many times but it doesn't.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for MICHAEL CLAYTON this would be Clooney's best work in a career filling with outstanding efforts. He could've gotten away with slickness here & made it look easy. The pain in his eyes & forced smile are conveyed with all the discomfort of a suit that fits a bit too tight. Vera Farmiga is sexier than hell as his lover. Their chemistry matches the kind that Clooney had with J-Lo in OUT OF TIME (?). And Anna Kendrick is as much of a discovery as Jeremy Renner was from THE HURT LOCKER. She is an electric bundle of ambition, vulnerability & cuteness. All 3 are memorable.<br/><br/>This film takes some unexpected turns & gets very murky in an emotional sense but they all add to the depth of what goes on in it.

The script was written extremely well with many catch-phrases that I'm sure will soon be popping up in preppy classrooms everywhere, and it had an awesome cast with some no-faces. I certainly do not have to dive into the storyline much, because it is pretty straightforward, but I will say that the movie has some well played MAJOR TWISTS, and I haven't enjoyed one of those in a long time.<br/><br/>The reason I gave this film a 10 is because I cannot find any reason not to.

","Jason Reitman (""Ghostbusters"" director Ivan Reitman's son) made his directorial debut two years ago with the satirical comedy ""Thank You for Smoking"", about a tobacco industry spin doctor. Reitman focuses on similar subject matter in ""Up in the Air"", including similar dialog. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, who has the job of going around the country firing people when their bosses don't have the guts to do it to their faces. Spending most of his time in airplanes, Ryan has no family, and his apartment is the most pathetic place that you ever saw. But Ryan has a surprise waiting for him.<br/><br/>The tanking economy and massive job losses in the past few years make this film all the more relevant. Many of the ""firees"" are people who actually got fired from jobs responding as they would to the person firing them. While feeling disgusted at what Ryan does, I couldn't help but admire his gumption (or is it his lack of ethics?).<br/><br/>This movie and ""Thank You for Smoking"" (I haven't seen ""Juno"") have shown Jason Reitman to be a very good director. It certainly deserves its Oscar nominations, although I haven't decided for certain which movie I want to win. But either way, I wholeheartedly recommend ""Up in the Air"". It's the perfect look at what our society has become.<br/><br/>Also starring Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey (of ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""The Informant!""), J.K. Simmons (of the Spider-Man movies and ""Thank You for Smoking"") and Sam Elliott."
"DonFishies","9","1","6","4 January 2010"," A masterwork of maturity and true artistry for Reitman and Clooney
","There is so much I want to say about Up in the Air that it has taken me days to even attempt to sit and write out my thoughts on it. It is the rare movie that is every bit as good as the critics and awards groups are making it out to be, and maybe even a little better. While it is not quite the best movie of the year, it is still a movie very much of its time, and one that will not soon be forgotten.<br/><br/>The film follows Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who crisscrosses across the United States firing the people major companies cannot. He leads a very secluded lifestyle, rarely spending any time at home or with his family, and finds the joys in life come from collecting plastic loyalty club cards. He even works as a motivational speaker, giving people advice on how to live their lives more like his. But he enjoys the life, and thrives in it. When young up-and-comer Natalie (Anna Kendrick) comes up with a plan for his company to save costs across the board, he is at first flabbergasted at the very thought of his lifestyle coming to an end. But then his boss sends him out to teach Natalie more about what he does, and Ryan begins to see things a little different.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman belongs to a very exclusive group of young filmmakers who are getting better with each film they make. With Thank You for Smoking, Juno, and now Up in the Air, he has demonstrated an unparallelled consistency that is unlike almost all of his peers, including his own father Ivan (who acts as a producer here). Even though this is his third major film (and almost certainly his second Best Director Oscar nomination), he simply works like he is already a master filmmaker. The film knows what turns to take, what moves to make; everything is just so highly crafted and near perfect that you may wonder if this really is his third major film. There is so much creative output on display here that the film is simply a marvel to look at from the mindset of a filmmaker. The slapdash editing style of his previous two films is even stronger here than before as well.<br/><br/>If Reitman is at fault anywhere, it is in the jumping tones. It works very well for this film (whereas it nearly sank the obscenely hilarious satire in Smoking), but it has not been quite honed to perfection quite yet. Earlier this year, the animated emotional roller coaster of adventure found in the ironically titled Up managed to find its footing jumping around from being devastatingly sad to hilariously funny in a moment's notice. But that film had the benefit of being much more simplistic than Up in the Air (even with its unmatched character depth and balance). The film does strike a good balance, but as Ryan grows as a character, the film's tone does not necessarily follow with it. There were more than a few scenes that should have been funny but were sad, and others that were sad but came off hilarious. It is all about balance, and not every scene feels like it is as balanced as the next. The biting satire Reitman crafted in Smoking is here, as are the hilariously poignant moments he helped extend through Diablo Cody's script for Juno, and even a bit extra that comes from the maturity Reitman has gained as a filmmaker. But if there is a small flaw in the film, this is where it lies.<br/><br/>If Reitman has matured as a filmmaker here, than Clooney has matured even more so as a leading man. While his one-two punch of Syriana and Good Night, and Good Luck gave Clooney an excellent range as a star, it is this film that cements his status as a leading man. He commands the screen every second he shows up, and never once do we question the legitimacy of his portrayal. Reitman may have given Ryan Bingham his voice, but Clooney gives him the breath of life. This character is a flawed hack of a man, living the dream that is at once everything we could ever want and a nightmare of everything we never want to even think of. As the tone flip flops, Clooney stays on the straight and narrow, never backing away from any challenges, and never once sacrificing the quality and dimensionality of the role. In a year of surprisingly great performances, this one is a clear standout. It is not the kind of ballsy role that Syriana's Bob Barnes was, but it is a stronger performance and one that may make us forget Batman and Robin ever existed (well, at least the Batman portion of the film).<br/><br/>While J.K. Simmons, Sam Elliot, 2009 wonderkid Zach Galifianakis and Danny McBride all deliver great, small performances, and Jason Bateman helps ground the film in his surprisingly unfunny yet tragically serious role, it is Kendrick and Vera Farmiga that light up the screen in the few sections where Clooney is not chewing the scenery and just about everything else up. While Farmiga nearly ruined The Departed, she works as the yin to Clooney's yang. She delivers a brutally honest performance here, one that perfects Clooney's portrayal far greater than it ever could be. I was impressed with her work in every instance. Kendrick acts as the relative newcomer that she is, but it works for her rough around the edges character. I hope for more creative output outside of the Twilight franchise from her.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is a flawed film, but the flaws can easily be looked past. It is an incredible feat for everyone involved, and one that stands out as honest and heartbreaking at the same time. It is likely the one to beat come March.<br/><br/>9/10."
"Reel_starz","9","1","6","3 January 2010"," ""Up in the Air"" is grounded in humor, intelligence and pathos
","Amid the jumble of sequels, remakes and senseless blockbusters, Up in the Air, a witty, classy and lighthearted drama, feels like a breath of fresh air. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes this movie so great, but perhaps that's what's appealing about it - it simply has the right amount of everything. Without a doubt, Up in the Air is one of the year's best and most memorable films.<br/><br/>Because Up in the Air is a character-driven film, it is important that the actors deliver and fortunately, they do. Perhaps it shouldn't be much of a surprise, since Jason Reitman, who directed and wrote the screenplay, apparently wrote all of the three major characters for their corresponding actors. As Ryan Bingham, George Clooney brings charisma, confusion and a certain amount of weariness. There is a hint of Danny Ocean-like suaveness to Ryan, as when he is giving motivational speeches or smoothly convincing a just-fired employee to look on the bright side, but he is nevertheless a person the audience can relate to; at some point, everyone feels the same sense of aimlessness that Bingham experiences, and this not only makes him sympathetic, but also heightens the film's emotional impact. Equally impressive are Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick, who play Bingham's love interest Alex and colleague Natalie, respectively. Both of them manage to make what could have been two-dimensional roles into characters that feel as real as anyone in real life; you can easily imagine passing them in the airport or seeing them sitting on the other side of your office. They also have great chemistry with Clooney: Ryan and Alex's romance sizzles, and the off-kilter, occasionally tense relationship between Bingham and Natalie is completely believable.<br/><br/>Perhaps what gives the movie its extra oomph is the phenomenal script written by Jason Reitman. The dialogue is witty yet convincing and the story's various elements are perfectly balanced. It avoids the trap that many comedies or even light-hearted dramas fall into in the third act, which is the tendency to let heavy themes or sentimentality overwhelm the movie and extinguish any previous cheer. The theme of unemployment and economic uncertainty is played with, yet the film never takes it too seriously or too lightly, and up to the end, the characters are given the front stage; after all, the movie is not about the economy, but how the characters, especially Bingham, grow and how they deal with life's obstacles.<br/><br/>All this is enhanced by Rolfe Kent's wistful, moving score and rest of the film's sensational soundtrack, which includes the song ""Up in the Air"", written by Kevin Renick who sent his composition to Reitman after being fired from his job, making it all the more poignant.<br/><br/>At its core, Up in the Air is about relationships: their burdens, the compromises required to maintain one and, most of all, that, without them, life would lose its purpose and meaning. It traces the way they ebb and flow and change over time, but also how they can remain constant, something to rely on in an increasingly uncertain world. As Ryan Bingham slowly discovers, no accomplishment is truly satisfying or enriching unless it is shared with another human being.<br/><br/>The movie's atmosphere feels oddly novel, almost magical, and in many ways, it reminds me of Jerry Maguire. Though it has now become parodied multiple times, that 1996 movie still stands out as a romantic-comedy that truly warmed the heart in an era when few rom-coms manage to transcend the sappy or trite clichés of the genre. Like Jerry Maguire, Up in the Air relies on sharp writing and soulful performances in order to do what few films are able to achieve: they tell complex, engaging stories about people the audience wants to cheer for. We build a relationship with the characters and, through the highs and lows, we're with them all the way."

"larma7","9","1","6","1 January 2010"," ""Up in the Air"" -- a great, and sometimes brutal, film!
","Director Jason Reitman's new film ""Up in the Air"" is a favorite for Oscars, and it is great film.<br/><br/>It stars George Clooney as Ryan Bingham, who works for a business firm where he is sent around the country to fire people from their jobs. His job is his life. He spends almost all the days of the year constantly travelling by plane. He has become so comfortable with traveling that he hates to be home at his apartment. His real home is up in the air in an airplane.<br/><br/>Bingham's job certainly is not for the faint of heart. He sits face to face with people he has never met and tells them that they no longer have a job. Bingham's job is not to provide sympathy for the person, but to provide some kind of hope so their process of leaving the company goes smoothly. Bingham is a master at his art, staying calm and smooth even when the people he is firing become hostile.<br/><br/>However, Bingham's own job becomes at stake when a young, vibrant Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a recent Cornell graduate, starts at the firm and introduces a new technology which would enable people like Bingham to fire people over the computer, making the already brutal job more impersonal but also more cost efficient. This now threaten's Bingham's life-style of travelling the country almost every day of the year. The thought of living at home makes him sick and uneasy. But before this new system is put into place, Bingham is forced to travel with Keener across the country, showing her the ropes of how to fire people.<br/><br/>It is a very funny, although also at times a very brutal film. Filled with cruel irony -- some funny, some sad. Reitman's film works not only as a character study, but also as a satire of America's poor economic state.<br/><br/>But the success of the film really does rely on George Clooney's wonderful, vulnerable performance playing the lonely, empty character of Bingham. Bingham discovers how truly empty and devoid of value his life really is. His job requires him to be emotionally cold, and with his constant travel and lack of any real relationships, his life is now emotionally cold and empty as well.<br/><br/>Along the way, Bingham also develops a relationship with a middle-aged, frequently travelling business woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga), both sharing the life of constant travel away from home. With Alex, Bingham finally starts to open up emotionally, as he seeks some kind of relationship that his life has been lacking.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Up in the Air"" is about finding value and strength through the relationships we form with people. It is a brutal world out there, and we need people with us to get through it sometimes.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I truly am a fan of Reitman now. ""Thank You For Smoking"" was a fantastic, hilarious satire and ""Juno"" was a very fun, sweet coming of age film. Neither quite reached greatness, but I think now with ""Up in the Air"" Reitman has made his first truly great film.<br/><br/>Now is this quite a masterpiece? No, not quite. I did have some problems with the ending and there were a few moments that I completely predicted near the end. In addition, some moments felt a little clichéd. However, overall this is a great film and should not be missed. It is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year."

","I enjoyed this film very much. But when I started to think about it, this was not just a film. It is a reflection of the society we live in today. Most people go to the movies to escape life. They would much rather see a WWII fairy tale, or blue people fight against humans for their planet. I did enjoy both of those movies, but what I felt about this one was different. I watched this overall depressing tale about a man with no life and a world where people can lose their jobs at any second and the boss doesn't even care. I walked out of the theater to the blazing cold night only to realize that I was looking at the same world. This is not a film. This is a wakeup call for the people who continue to look away and that are in denial that we are in a recession. And I must say, with stellar performances by George Clooney and Anna Kendrick, this is a darn good wakeup call."

","Make no mistake, Clooney makes this film what it is. I can think of very few with the talent and charisma to get it done in this complex role. The brilliance lies in the fact that it seems so effortless and probably overlooked because if I try to substitute any other contemporary superstar it just doesn't hold up as good! I felt that every other main cast in the movie was replaceable . <br/><br/>Bingham's character provides the fabric to weave the intricate design and complexities of the script and story. It also feels like Reitman let the characters evolve in the script in due course providing the subtle nuances and ultimately we get a masterpiece."
"meganweinand","9","1","6","27 December 2009"," This movie is fantastic! 8.5/10
","This movie is really a fun time. George Clooney is great, and the young girl character from Cornell is a really big hoot. It's a good feel-good movie at times, and then other times it really makes you reexamine your life and your priorities. Above all though I just thought it was a good commentary on the modernized technological lives that most of us are all now leading. A little bit of a sex scene with Clooney if you're looking for a sexy-type film, but overall just a good comedy. I'd recommend this one for a slow night or a good time with friends. I can't give it a 10/10 for only a few reasons-mainly that I wish the movie tied up all the loose ends with some of the character's relationships (although that's not possible in real life most of the time, so I can't say why I assume it would be here), and because it felt a little long towards the end. But truly, this movie is hilarious most of the time, I'd strongly recommend it!"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","6","20 December 2009"," The ideal blend of sharp comedy and heartfelt drama with an enduring message
","Jason Reitman has been the creative force behind two of the warmest, funniest, modern- savvy and thought-provoking comedies in the last five years (""Thank You For Smoking"" and ""Juno""). He continues this tradition with ""Up in the Air,"" one of if not the best film of 2009, which looks at life with a view from the top, the perspective of a man who lives out of his suitcase -- and packs light. Devoid of commitment and responsibility in everything down to relationships, the story of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is cleverly smooth and will make filmgoers everywhere appreciate their own baggage.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham fires people for a living. Gutless bosses outsource their layoffs to the company he works for, so he travels the country dropping traumatic news on countless people. As a frequent flyer, he has a secret goal of reaching 10 million miles on American Airlines. To him, the airport is home; he has no committed relationships or friendships and he gives lectures on how those are the things that weigh our lives down. Who better to play a free-wheeling middle-aged bachelor with a soulless job than Clooney? His suave looks and comic delivery make him an enviable and intriguing character despite that we'd never want to spend all that time in an airport let alone make people miserable every day.<br/><br/>Bingham's life of traveling bliss gets an upgrade when he hooks up with fellow businesswoman Alex (Vera Farmiga), who shares his same passion for traveling nuance and sexually charged witticism. At the same time, a young up-and-comer in his company (Anna Kendrick) threatens his way of life when she proposes online video conference firing. In an effort to prove that would be a bad idea (and save his lifestyle), Bingham convinces his boss (Jason Bateman) to let him take her on his next set of trips so she can see what this work is really about.<br/><br/>Loosely adapted from a novel by Walter Kirn, Reitman and Sheldon Turner whip up a script that's smart and hip yet familiar and easy to follow. It's somewhat predictable, but in a good way -- never cliché and all in the spirit of the story's message. Bingham's unique and isolated lifestyle serves as an ideal example for jump-starting a discussion of what's most important in life -- ultimately whether happiness can be achieved if life isn't shared. The other characters provide other perspectives on this same essential question and further complicate Bingham's own emotional journey as he questions his long-held beliefs.<br/><br/>Reitman's genius as a director is in guiding us along fluidly through this contemplation. Being his third very good film, ""Up in the Air"" is now proof that no director takes his audience from comedy to heartfelt drama as seamlessly and gracefully as Reitman. The script is naturally funny, playing off our familiarity with airport travel for a variety of jokes, yet the next scene will be when Bingham's firing someone and suddenly all this tension builds and sympathy and pity pours out of the audience for these poor people losing their jobs whom Reitman handles with such sensitivity given the tough economic context this film is being released in.<br/><br/>Other impressive elements of the film include Anna Kendrick's performance as Natalie, a recent college grad who is a hard-nosed efficient type on the outside with an emotionally sensitive interior. Her trip with Ryan reveals to her that not everything in life can be planned for nor should it be. Kendrick handles one of those potentially cliché young person roles with class. She's multi-dimensional including throwing her own bit of humor in with the many emotional highs and lows her character experiences. Farmiga also proves no marquee name was necessary. She's sweet, a bit sassy and holds her own against the magnetic Clooney.<br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" could fall into a rut of being all about travel humor and how always being on the go affects a person -- or it could be about what it's like having to fire people day in an day out, but all these elements are instead tied beautifully together to remind us how valuable relationships can be, no matter how big or how small. Reitman and this wonderful cast not only entertain us but also deliver that message as well as it's ever been delivered.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at moviemusereviews.com"
"moviemanMA","10","1","6","13 December 2009"," The meaning of life on the road
","George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a man detached from all commitments and relationships in Jason Reitman's brilliant film Up in the Air, based on the novel of the same name by Walter Kim.<br/><br/>Bingham is a man hired by other companies who are too afraid or lazy to fire their own employees. Bingham is trained to handle those employees who may be disgruntled, emotionally unstable, or just plain let down. In this harsh economic climate, Bingham and the company he works for is booming. Bingham spends on average about nine months of the year in the air and away from ""home"" or Omaha, Nebraska. Life is good for the man who has more frequent flyer miles than one could even think of having.<br/><br/>Everything seems to be going great until he is called back to the office and is introduced to Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young, Ivy leaguer who proposes that using video conferencing instead of face-to-face confrontation to fire people will save the company a large chunk of change. Bingham sees that his livelihood is being threatened, demands that he be left on the road. His boss, played by Jason Bateman, sees this as an opportunity to show Natalie the ways of the business and tells Ryan that he needs to have her tag along. Seeing as this is his only way of staying on the road, he reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>Bingham shows Natalie a fast paced world of concierge service, minibars, and how to manage people. What Bingham didn't expect was to see what his life has become and how he is going live out the rest of his days; alone. Unless he changes it.<br/><br/>Clooney and Kendrick are fantastic together. Clooney's smooth talking and confident screen presence is balanced nicely by Kendrick's emotional and slightly neurotic tendencies. Along with these two is Vera Farmiga, whose relationship with Clooney's character blossoms out of their love for the road. They are an unconventional couple, but they would never admit that they're together.<br/><br/>This is a truly remarkable story. This film has been described as 'the film of the moment,' and it is just that. There are many films coming out about the Iraq war and the impact it has on the soldiers as well as at home, but here we have one of the first films other than Michael Moore's documentary Capitalism: A Love Story, to show the economic downfall that this country has faced. It's a startling look at what is going on out there across the country. It's a poignant reminder that there are a lot of people out there suffering and have little to comfort them.<br/><br/>Reitman does an excellent job not just selling the characters and their story but the time and space that this takes place in. We are shown office buildings void of workers, yet here comes Clooney and Kendrick to lay off even more from a business that has already been hit hard. Each lay off we witness is almost like a real testimonial. We see the sadness, the despair, and the anger that people exude when they realize their lives have been turned upside down by someone they don't ever know.<br/><br/>There are a lot of powerful images in this film, especially where we can see how alone these characters really are. Each airport terminal starts to blend together to form this artificial, sterile, and uninviting environment that no person could truly ever love. As we delve into the life of Ryan Bingham, we see how truly alone he really is, and how he is a truly remarkable person to be able to deal with a life like this. His story is unlike any other."
"Gustavo_Lequerica","9","1","6","6 December 2009"," The Peak of Clooney's Career
","There is something about George Clooney that it's charming that even in the most boring roles he can captivate the audience like nobody else. Definitely the movie Up in The Air is not an epic saga from our times but it's a simple charming movie that can make a date something fun and enjoyable because it's a movie made for couples that so far is on the buzz for Oscar Nominations because of the incredible acting (maybe the Academy is going on roles that are more realistic and less glamorous Sandra Bullock is also on the spotlight for an Oscar Nomination for her movie The Blind Side) Many critics as it was said previously are predicting Oscar Noms for George Clooney and they are speculating that new comer Anna Kendric is slowly but steady positioning herself in the A-list of Hollywood because her roles in successful movies like Up in the Air and the Twilight franchise.<br/><br/>In the movie George Clooney plays a transition specialist whose jobs it's to fire people for corporation executives who don't have the nerves to fire people themselves; after acting like the servant to many executives Ryan Bingham starts to feel some happiness doing that but as soon he finds that the company he works for hired a new person to play on Ryan's role without even leave her office Ryan starts to feel anguished that his days on the company are counted. Critics are calling this movie the peak of Clooney's career and maybe they are right because at his age and success it's hard to see George on other types of roles specially after many years being typecast as the Romantic Comedy Lead (I guess he suffered the Meg Ryan Syndrome) it's going to be difficult to see him on action or horror roles, but he always can go on the director seat and do something amazing because he has consolidated his name to be a money making machine worldwide. Maybe it's true that George has moved on since his Fact of Life days to become an household name."

","UP IN THE AIR (2009) *** George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Amy Morton, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis, Clooney excels as a corporate firer for hire whose charm borderlines smarm and the good life (of literally being the title for traveling so extensively as a 'lifestyle') faces his own personal crises when the powers that be saddle him with a freshly scrubbed college grad (ambitiously obnoxious – in a good way – Kendrick) to tag along and see how the route works as she has designed an interfacing method (dismissal by video chat!) Along for the ride is fellow traveler Farmiga (equally wonderful in a icy, brittle fashion) who is Clooney's booty call (and possible wake-up call too boot). Filmmaker Jason Reitman – who co-scribed the witty and timely adaptation with Sheldon Turner of Walter Kirn's novel – covers all the bases – comedy/drama/soul-searching/redemption parable - and makes the film a near-instant classic (when the characters aren't so in love with themselves is the only Achilles' heel; but then again that's the point isn't it?)"
"griffolyon12","9","1","7","31 December 2009"," Challenging, But Rewarding
","Up in the Air is an ethereal movie-going experience. I don't think there is any other way to put it. The movie is relevant, realistic, and at the same time, oddly beautiful. While the movie starts off snarky and very savvy, it later on slips into the true realities of life and meaning.<br/><br/>The film stars George Clooney as downsizing expert, Ryan Bingham. Ryan works for a corporation who loans out guys like Ryan to big companies all over the country to lay off their work force, so essentially he fires people for a salary. Ryan has no real connections in his life and considers airport terminals his home. Seeing as how he nearly has 10 million frequent flyer miles and is traveling about 320 days out of the year, I'd say that is an astute observation. Ryan's way of life is threatened when a young college grad starts working alongside him and has developed a way to fire people via webchat rather than traveling all over the country at an expense. Ryan is opposed, but has a chance to possibly settle down with Alex (played to crisp perfection by Vera Farmiga), a soul mate if there ever has been. She is a frequently flyer too, and as stated in the film, is essentially the female version of Ryan.<br/><br/>It's kind of odd watching this film and wondering whether the filmmakers had any idea what kind of state our nation's economy would be in at this time. I guess it was foresight or whatnot, but the film plays out so much more powerfully in this current economic crisis than I think it would in any other time. Much like The Grapes of Wrath, Up in the Air captures the realities of this economy. What it captures though isn't Midwest farmers, but rather the turmoil of the corporate world, where nearly every company is downsizing and having to lay people off. This is played out wonderfully in many sequences, in particular when actor J.K. Simmons steps in for a small one scene cameo, but he makes the most of it, as Ryan convinces Simmons to pursue his dreams of become a chef.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this film is all about people. The recurring theme rampant throughout Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner's witty screenplay, is the concept of connection, and in some cases the lack thereof. Anna Kendrick is a delight as Ryan's young, fresh-out-of-college protégé, who Ryan has been forced to show her the ropes. She challenges Clooney's character, and acts as if she has it all figured out, but Clooney just shoots her down like a one-winged duck. Then, there is Vera Farmiga as Clooney's love interest, Alex. Farmiga is very flirtatious in the role and plays off Clooney and his charm extremely well, so well in fact that you wont even see the truck coming when it hits. Though the real star here is George Clooney himself.<br/><br/>Clooney is essentially playing himself, but I think that is what makes this performance all the more affecting. In order to have achieved the emotions required by this film, Clooney had to have taken a deep look at himself, and if like Ryan, he didn't like what he saw, we will never know, but it is that soul searching that comes across in this film and is a different breed of acting that we tend to forget. Clooney manages for you to feel empathy for Ryan, even though he isn't the most desirable man on Earth. I mean seriously, he fires people for a living! Even still, we feel deeply for Clooney when he is burned by his own philosophy of having no connections in life, and we feel a rush of melancholy when he finally achieves his goal of 10 million frequent flyer miles. It's kind of a moment of, ""What was it all for?""<br/><br/>The film was directed expertly by Jason Reitman, and I applaud Reitman's decision to film the corporate world with a slick expertise, and when the characters are out mingling in the real world, he films everything hand-held, almost as if it is a documentary. Not only that, I think Reitman benefits here from having written the script, because he handles the balance between the comedy and drama extremely well. It doesn't feel like a flip-flop bouncing up-and-down upon the sole of your foot, it's just a smooth ride to the other side, very much like a Billy Wilder film in that way.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a special movie that is actuality extremely funny, but at the same time it is very down-to-Earth and deeply moving.<br/><br/>I give Up in the Air a 9 out of 10!"
"jacksflicks","9","1","7","22 December 2009"," Sugar-coated nastiness
","Jason Reitman has brought to the screen a new zeitgeist class, for whom I confess a certain envy: those who live in airplanes, airports and hotels, who live everywhere and nowhere. Are these the new seafarers, the new range riders? Are they paladins or pirates? They seem unfettered, but are they truly free?<br/><br/>""We've hired this professional hit man to ruin your life, and if you don't like it, we'll call security."" Companies are gangsters with lawyers instead of guns, severance packages instead of cement buckets. George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, gentleman job assassin, immaculately attired and groomed, professionally smiling, mouthing canned reassurances as he gently plunges the knife into his victims -- the Dilberts whose terminations he's been outsourced to announce. His young protégée, played by Anna Kendrick, is a true believer who has invented a new way of firing, via teleconference.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect, including scene-stealers Kendrick and Vera Fermiga as Alex Goran, Bingham's kindred spirit-in-the-air who deliver's him his comeuppance. Jason Bateman plays Bingham's amoral boss flawlessly. Reitman even casts some authentic terminees to play themselves. Other victims are played by professionals, who blend in perfectly, except for J.K. Simmons, who's impossible not to recognize, in a delicious bit.<br/><br/>This would be a perfect movie except for the episode of Bingham with his family. I think we're meant to loathe the life Bingham leads, yet ""back home"" we are met with lives as flat the cardboard cutouts of Bingham's sister and fiancé he schleps around to fulfill a feckless wedding assignment. There's an ambiguity here I'm not sure Reitman meant to introduce.<br/><br/>A word about George Clooney. He's this generation's Robert Redford. A little darker in his look, sound and roles, but the same in many ways. Do you remember Redford in his Twilight Zone episode, also playing a ""transition specialist""? He could have been Ryan Bingham. I predict an Oscar nomination for Clooney, and possibly for Kendrick and Fermiga."

","""Up in the Air"" is an intelligent, well-written adult story. This film has no special effects and it relies solely on the shoulders of their characters, as they are humorous & realistic.<br/><br/>The screenplay and all the performances are great! The dialogs are clever and the scenarios were funny & sometimes emotional. The entire movie is entertaining and it's a comedy throughout most of the film, but it slowly becomes more of a drama near the end. Just as you think you know exactly how the movie is going to end, the conclusion of the film catches you by surprise; but the payoff is perfect as it clearly defines the whole movie for what it is, which is about Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) character.<br/><br/>The character of Ryan Bingham seemed to have been written for George Clooney. It's a perfect role for the actor as he believably portrays a hard working bachelor who spends the majority of his life in airports, hotels, and in a different city every day. His philosophy, profession and lifestyle are the movie; but the supporting characters that he meets & encounters throughout the film are slowly changing him & challenges everything about his life.<br/><br/>There are two important things that I learned in my life. You can never tell somebody on how they should feel, and everybody wants to be loved by somebody. A way a person feels is programmed throughout an individual's entire life, based on the people they meet and their own unique & personal experiences. As for the character of Ryan Bingham, he believes that he lives a perfect life for himself as a bachelor who doesn't need anyone; but you get to see his transition throughout this film, as he eventually falls into the same category as everyone else. The difference for him is that his entire life, is up in the air."

","Greetings again from the darkness. With Juno and Thank You for Not Smoking, writer/director Jason Reitman had proved himself to be not just a terrific filmmaker, but also one with real insight into people and society. His commentary is based on putting people in real situations and having us recognize these moments for what they truly mean.<br/><br/>Full disclosure - I am not a George Clooney fan. While I recognize his appeal to the masses, I usually only appreciate him when he steps out of the Clooney role and into something messy (Syriana). In this film, he does a pretty good job of removing his tongue from his cheek and playing the role with the necessary head-on approach it requires. His scenes with Vera Farmiga are extremely well written and acted; but it's his scenes with Anna Kendrick that make this film something special.<br/><br/>Clooney seems to be getting all the pub for this, but Ms. Kendrick delivers a turn that provides the emotional depth and link to the audience. My favorite scene is with the three leads discussing their ever-changing life dreams. As they say, youth is wasted on the young.<br/><br/>So many insightful moments about everything from loneliness to independence to loyalty to belonging ... all mixed with the harsh realities of the business world at a time when everyone lives in fear of losing their job. Watching these people talk about the pain and humiliation of losing a job that is so intertwined with their person is just excruciating. This really plays out in the scene with J.K. Simmons.<br/><br/>Gotta mention the great Sam Elliott in his brief moment as he chats it up with his airline's most loyal customer. Mr. Elliott never disappoints, even if on screen for just a couple of minutes. Thanks to Mr. Reitman for delivering yet another film with bite ... something to chew on and appreciate."
"warthogjump","10","1","8","5 January 2010"," Filled with WOW moments!
","I didn't want Up In the Air to finish. I never knew that a film under 2 hours could provide viewers with countless astonishing moments. Up in the Air is filled with Oscar scene, after Oscar scene in the acting and screenplay departments.<br/><br/>I won't bore you of a summary of the movie as I believe you can get countless summaries from various reviews. Instead, I will outline why this movie is perfectly, fantastically, phenomenally and outstandingly excellent (without giving any spoilers).<br/><br/>The thing about Up in the Air is that is it both sad and uplifting at the same time. It has so much inspirational, but equally important, honest dialogue which is delivered with utmost geniality from all the actors in the film.<br/><br/>So much happens in this film. I was very surprised how this film was not even 2 hours long. It seems like it has everything in it.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is a very complex film if careful attention is given to each specific word uttered by the characters. It would require more than one viewing in order to appreciate the true and full 'gist' of the movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Reitman did a fantastic 'job' of juggling the topics of unemployment and relationships so wonderfully in one beautifully woven script.<br/><br/>I can go on and on about Up in the Air forever. It has so many intense moments due to the dialogue and the manner of delivery of the dialogue. It is definitely as original as a movie is going to get nowadays. It has a bit of this and a bit of that, but ultimately, Reitman delivers something we have never seen before.<br/><br/>This movie touches on real life issues and really goes 'up in the air' in terms of realism. There is so much everybody can relate to in this film. Loneliness, companionship, unemployment, security, and meaning are all issues which are given decent thought throughout the film.<br/><br/>Some people may urge that Up in the Air doesn't have the potential to be a masterpiece because it doesn't really have something 'special' to offer and is simply a normal, decent movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. However, Up in the Air is much more than that. It is very simple, yet complex due to the varying views it offers on so many real life issues. I would certainly put this movie up in my favorites list and number 1 for 2009. I have seen every other movie in the Best Picture categories under the Golden Globes and Up in the Air is a home run for me.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say I had the highest expectations going into this film. Vera Farmiga (well known from Departed) is my recent favourite actress and the reviews I was reading about Up in the Air really sky rocketed my expectations. I usually don't enjoy the idea of having such high expectations. Some movies I would have enjoyed more if I expected less. However, Up in the Air was an exception. I enjoyed this movie even more due to my high expectations. Every time I viewed a scene which touched me so deeply, I thought to myself, 'Thank God for watching this movie the first chance I got. This movie is so wonderful that I don't care what happens next, I don't care how it wraps up, I just don't want it to finish.' Of course, it finished. However, you can be sure that I will watch this move in the theaters countless times and purchase it on DVD for even more viewings. I can't get enough of it.<br/><br/>On a side note, J.K Simmons made a very minor appearance in this movie. I must declare that I am shocked that Simmons has never received an Oscar nomination. His supporting roles are immaculate. Juno, Burn After Reading and Up in the Air are some examples. His acting ability is phenomenal, but I also think he only suits supporting roles. Nevertheless, no minimum screen time is required for an Oscar nomination. He seriously deserves one!"
"classicalsteve","10","1","8","6 December 2009"," George Clooney's Best Performance, Academy-Caliber, About the Heartlessness of Corporate America--the Innocents Who Get the Ax Deserve Honorable Mention
","Ryan Bingham is happiest when he's traveling, either when he's at an airport contemplating his next flight, aboard a plane where he can meditate on the world from 30,000 feet, or flopping on the bed of a hotel room where he's treated like royalty. On the road, Ryan Bingham is somebody, a VIP customer who has racked up more flying miles than the equivalent of several trips to the moon. He gets the best hotel rooms, he cuts through long lines, and he can jump into rental cars faster than a speeding bullet without having his life-story entered into a computer terminal. He is one of thousands of frequent-flyer business travelers to whom hotels and rental car companies genuflect; they kiss his ring by offering the best rates, the best rooms, and loads of freebies. His one-bedroom apartment even resembles an hotel room, although from the get-go, we learn he doesn't like being at home. The road is his home and the people at American Airlines are his family. And occasionally he meets a similar bird-of-a-feather, a business traveler of the opposite sex, for a quick fling. <br/><br/>He has an unusual job: to fly to certain corporate American locales and lower the proverbial lay-off ax onto the necks of unsuspecting employees because the company doesn't have the guts to do it themselves. In an age of outsourcing, it shouldn't be surprising that even the dirty job of laying people off can and has been outsourced. Ryan Bingham is the ax men of ax men, firing hundreds of people at a single bound for a plethora of American companies. His own company has come up with a pamphlet that is supposed to ease the blow and convince the poor victim that this is the beginning of a new life. Bingham does his job well (but of course he knows the stupid pamphlet is meaningless), and the upside is he doesn't have to be at home. He does the dirty deed like an assassin-for-hire before heading back to the airport and beginning the cycle all over again. And in between these hits, other companies engage him as a motivational speaker where he likens people and possessions to luggage that drags you down. Of course he advocates traveling light, and not just in terms of what he takes on his business trips.<br/><br/>But then his neat and tidy world comes under threat when a new upstart less than half his age, Natalie Keener played by Anna Kendrick, propagates a more efficient way of doing the dirty work. Instead of paying for all those planes and hotels, the company could simply do the job from a virtual terminal back at the corporate office. Firing can now be done with the efficiency of a skype network video-conference style. The ax can be wielded in a setting that wouldn't be much different from ordering something through a Sears online catalog with a live agent on-screen. Complete virtual outsourcing. (You wonder if their next step would be to outsource the outsourcing to India!) The proposal however would mean no more frequent-flyer miles for Bingham. To add insult to injury, his company instructs Bingham to take the young upstart crow through the process. Now we have two reluctant bedfellows, as it were, traveling all over corporate America. <br/><br/>This was a pleasant surprise of a movie, maybe not for all tastes, but an incredible storyline with an absolutely tour-de-force performance by Clooney who moves from his usual Steve McQueen cool and eventually shows a more vulnerable side. Simultaneously, I wish there existed an Academy Award for honorable mention. One of the best aspects of the film were a few dozen short clips of the people being fired. According to an interview with Terri Gross, the filmmaker Jason Reitman used people who were not actors, but whose only prerequisite to being in the film was that they had recently lost their jobs. They were instructed to remember how they felt when they were fired and react impromptu on camera, something you don't see very often in films outside of reality television. Also high marks for Reitman who finds the appropriate tone and atmosphere for his story.

","Juno director Jason Reitman has done it again. Up In The Air is by far the most enjoyable film of 2009. Bristling with outstanding performances led by George Clooney, this film is rightfully the Oscar front runner, and if the academy is wise, reward this film with the Best Picture Oscar! <br/><br/>Up In The Air, is not only highly enjoyable but it's also by far one of the most relevant Oscar front runners in years. The country is in an economic meltdown not seen since the great depression (all thanks to the incompetent leadership of George W. Bush, but that's another story!) Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney is a guy who works for a company that ""lets go"" of employees all over the country. He makes it easier for companies to lay off workers who are too timid to do it themselves. <br/><br/>He's so good at his job that he has nearly racked up ten million frequent flier miles. In fact, that's where he feels most at home, ""Up In The Air"". Bingham's company hires a new employee, Natalie Keener played by Twilight's Anna Kendrick, who has developed a new program of laying off workers from behind a computer screen, making it easier and more cost effective to lay off workers without the high cost of flying and hotel rooms. <br/><br/>Bingham takes Keener under his wing to show her how to do the job correctly, and in the process meets another lay off specialist Alex Goran, played by The Departed's Vera Farmiga, with whom he shares a close relationship. Bingham's philosophy is to have as little attachments as possible, nothing personal, to keep things completely casual. <br/><br/>It's a philosophy he shares at regular speaking engagements. It's the same philosophy that he shares with many of the people he lays off. However during the course of the film, he realizes that personal relationships are the key to surviving a lay off, and that human companion ships are worth having.<br/><br/>Clooney has never been better, Anna Kendick, does a terrific job of playing a hungry Cornell graduate who finally realizes the human toll of letting people go from their jobs, and Farmiga is Clooney's equal in the film.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman is one of America's most promising new directors from his debut in Thank You For Smoking to the great Juno to this.<br/><br/>Up In The Air, truly deserves the Best Picture Oscar at the Academy awards, and there isn't enough praise for it's cast or storyline. Truly the best film of 2009, and far better than the hugely overrated Avatar."
"yxo-1","9","1","10","7 December 2009"," Is grounding possible for a flake?
","Most of the comments on IMDb contain the story line. I don't think it is necessary or advisable. But sharing your personal experience and analyzing it from the vantage point of your subjective reality could be enriching potentials of perception and preparing the one who didn't see the film yet. Equally it may give the confirmation of their own feelings, or a totally different angle to the one they had. Naming who is playing whom is not necessary either - it's all on the title page.<br/><br/>I would have given this film 10, but still can't figure out whether the predictability of the most dramatic moment in this film was necessary or not. On the one hand it gives the viewer a sense of bitter satisfaction (""I knew it!""), but creates a feeling of double disappointment and sadness on the other.<br/><br/>The film is about and soaked in the existential essence of life commitments vs. self-absorption and detachment. The cruel process of severing people from their lifeline - firing someone from their job, depriving them of their livelihood - coats the sometimes literal executioner in an almost sadistic aura of impotent or inevitable omnipotence. The skillful HR consultant type who specializes in terminating people's employment flies around in business class comfort as a utilitarian Angel of Death personifying the vampire-like nature of his source of wellbeing through the process of taking it away from others. Isn't it a circular conspiracy of the ""everybody against everybody"" nature of our culture? The earthiness of the texture of life, family, partnership, sharing, empathy and consistency (the grounding of a human being) is too real for this individual, who can't afford it - otherwise he can't do his job. Imagine the surgeon feeling the pain, fear,and anguish of the patient. How long will he last?<br/><br/>The film is full of the paradoxes of life - fake vs. real; commitment vs. separation, abandonment and betrayal; discovery vs. loss.<br/><br/>Good and timely for the contemporary society masterpiece enhancing our appreciation of life process. I wonder if, at least for some while,the rate of the weddings will rise and the divorces - diminish. <br/><br/>Hilarious comedy/drama too."

He plays a professional who has to tell workers that they're getting fired or laid off and deal with their reactions. Reports say production invited real people who'd been fired or let go from their jobs, and around 100 responded, from which around 22 were put in the movie. Despite the glamour of always being in nice hotels and business class, the job shows itself to be isolating and anti-relationship, as Ryan seems to just go from fling to fling with no commitment whatsoever.

That's how good this is.<br/><br/>We are introduced to Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who would be just another typical business man, except for the fact that this one works firing people. Traveling became his life, and to do so, he had to put family and relationships in second place. But that's all good for him, that's the life he always wanted. Then, we meet Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a young but wise woman who brings new ideas to the whole firing business. As expected, soon the two have to pair up and work together, and that's when the real fun begins.<br/><br/>Their moments together are just great, and not only can make you laugh, but also make your heart beat faster. Not in a romantic kind of way, obviously, but with emotion. That's the whole point. She has to admit to herself that he has much more experience that she could ever have, and has to sit and listen, even though it's hard for her to do so, but for Ryan, a successful noble man, to do that exactly same thing can be even harder, and to watch him realize that there actually are a bunch of things that a young girl can teach him is a beautiful, touching journey.<br/><br/>Also, Vera Farmiga's character couldn't be greater. She can make anyone who's watching look at women from another point of view, a strong one. Fierce. Add that with a little bit of plot twist and there you have it: a great persona.<br/><br/>Not too slow. Not too long. Not tiring or pointless. This movie takes its time, and makes you feel.

Up in air is where you are when you choose to detach yourself from the world. People detach themselves from their families as they see their siblings in Christmas. They fly solo as bigots who only care about their personal benefit. Americans seem to perpetuate this attitude and they do it perfectly well because it it in their blood. Asking the question of whether it is OK for people to choose to stay lonely or carry other people in their life journey; the film is tastefully done, combining eminent human feelings and sufferings, It is worthy of an Oscar. This is a movie that can only be starred by George Clooney, along with Anna Kendrick as supporting actress. Anna lays out what seems to be the opposite of what George thinks about commitment. This undergirds the whole theme of the movie in portraying a basic human struggle to grasp the reason of living.<br/><br/>Totally recommend it. A true art in the shape of a moving picture."

","Leave it to George Clooney to expand on a beautiful piece of writing about finding the meaning of life with both subtle drama and sweet humor. Clooney is perhaps the most iconic movie star in Hollyweood, now, and will surely become an iconic historical figure. The reason being is due to his capability as an actor to carry out a story so beautifully and give the audience reason to care and feel for his characters . In Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" we see Clooney play Ryan Bingham, a businessman whose job is to fire people from companies. A tough job, Ryan ends up working with a new young worker played by Anna Kendrick, who test his philosophies about his cynical and lonely life. Ryan also forms a relationship with a woman played by Vera Farminga, a connection that could potentially change him forever. Whjat this movie asks the audience is if your life is going in the direction you want it to. As Ryan flies daily and lives at the airport for a career, we see that his life is both literally and figuratively up in the air. The clever touches and meanings behind Jason Reitman's wonderful screenplay are all reminders of what this creative talent can do with his films. With him and Clooney teaming up to form a dynamic duo, ""Up in the Air"" soars as a beautiful and inspiring message about the path of one's life."

","Up in the Air (2009): Dir: Jason Reitman / Cast: George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Melanie Lynskey: Provocative drama about decisions. George Clooney plays a go-between who spends most of his life travelling by plane to attend sessions where he is instructed to lay off jobs whose bosses prove too faint to take responsibility. Director Jason Reitman gives an extraordinary view of life reduced to planes and hotels. This is his third success after helming such great films as Thank You For Smoking and Juno. Clooney brings out an indifferent attitude yet faces his sister's wedding. This brings him out of his comfort zone of hotels and planes and places him in the realm of care and compassion. Vera Farmiga plays a woman he bonds with in his travels. At first the role seems unnecessary until interesting truths surfaces where Clooney let down his guard with regret. Anna Kendrick steals scenes as his assigned business associate still naïve about the nature of the job. She isn't a professional like Clooney but her love for life has her questioning the nature of her job. Jason Bateman is underused as their boss featured in a couple scenes. Melanie Lynskey plays the younger sister of the Clooney character. There are many cameos that perhaps should have been broadened as well. Strong case made about the importance of relationships.

"StevePulaski","10","0","1","22 December 2014"," One of the smartest films to emerge from post-recession America
","Up in the Air focuses on Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man who has worked for the Career Transitions Corporation (CTC) for several years and has made his living a traveling downsizer, flying all across the United States to lay off white collar workers. He believes in traveling lightly, a philosophy he expands on in the speeches he delivers during his downtime, and resorts to animalistic ideas of walking alone and refusing to bear the baggage relationships, possessions, and other trivial things bring to his structured and meticulously-managed life. His sole goal is to obtain ten million frequent flyer miles, a feat that will grant him not only a personalized flyer card but his name alongside various airplanes, a trait shared by few other individuals.<br/><br/>One day, he is called into his office by his boss (Jason Bateman) where he meets Natale Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young, newly-hired idealist who believes she has created a response to the costly operations of the CTC, which currently has numerous men flying around the United States at all times and staying at lavish hotels, compensated by the company they work for. Natalie foresees a future for the company that has the same sort of traveling downsizers operating over the internet, interacting with souls about to be laid off from their jobs through a webchat program, which will prove to be more economically efficient. Ryan is disgusted about this idea, seeing Natalie's innovation as an impersonal way to communicate with people in one of their most emotionally fragile and unstable times of their lives. To show her that this job requires compassion, quick-wittedness, and one-on-one humanity, he takes her along to be his assistant on various jobs in the United States, showing her what the process is like in the flesh. Along the way, Ryan meets Alex (Vera Faminga), a thirty-four-year-old, traveling saleswoman who could be called Ryan's female counterpart, as she operates with the same sort of suave, confident characteristics as him and embraces the fun and freedom that comes with frequent travel. Ryan relishes the fact that he can maintain a casual, friendly relationship with a woman while still ""traveling lightly,"" so to speak.<br/><br/>Writers Sheldon Turner and director Jason Reitman constantly maintain a human focus and do not get too wrapped up in economical themes or subtext. They center the film entirely on Ryan's life, which is one of the only and most profound depictions of content loneliness I have ever seen. While the film would've been interesting to see Ryan as a quietly-depressed and openly lonely man, entering his later years and realizing he has little to show for it, the suave and confident Ryan we are presented with here works just as well, if not better. Clooney is the ideal actor for Ryan, as he practically oozes these characteristics, and is assisted by the likes of Kendrick and Faminga, who are written with equal attention given to their characters and are not shortchanged as empty female characters.<br/><br/>Up in the Air comes just a year after the crippling financial crisis in America, which left the futures of banks, car dealerships, and the entire American economy uncertain and unstable. Interestingly enough, the film offers a fantastic parallel to one of the features the new American economy will have, which is incredible, technological influence from younger people. The film creates an interesting juxtaposition to what you see occurring in the workforce right now, which is younger people slowly weening out the baby-boomer generation and initiating sweeping technological changes to businesses and industries. In the film, we see Ryan's disgust and disbelief at Natalie's innovation as an underlying theme of the young taking over for the old, and seeing Ryan become beaten at his own game; how long before he finds himself eying himself in the mirror and telling him that he's the one who is fired? <br/><br/>Up in the Air is one of the smartest and strongest films to emerge from post-recession America, focusing intently on a character who is more than content with leading a life of functional loneliness from a writer/director who knows how to usher in meaty, contemplative themes while retaining a pleasant, human focus to the material.<br/><br/>Starring: George Clooney, Anna Kendrick, and Vera Faminga. Directed by: Jason Reitman."

The narrative is not too long, never boring and smart.<br/><br/>It's shot and edited well, combining subtle humor with sharp dialogue and a level of honesty bordering on brutal.<br/><br/>Every few months or so, I see a great movie starring George Clooney.

Wildly.<br/><br/>Is our protagonist enviable? Probably not.<br/><br/>Is it realistic? Regrettably, yes.<br/><br/>In a sea of motion pictures that end with a sigh of relief, we need the occasional boat to get lost in a storm.<br/><br/>The credit card scene is spectacular.<br/><br/>How about Vera Farmiga, huh? What an outstanding performance as Georgie's wandering love interest.<br/><br/>And how about Anna Kendrick with some equally unexceptional acting? The moment she cries is the worst in the entire movie. Luckily a solid scene follows.<br/><br/>I also like how, ultimately, Kendrick's character does something outside of the narrative norm. Cloondog avoids his feelings for a justifiable reason. Kendrick, the catalyst, causes him to change, but this is (in the end) not a good thing.<br/><br/>Do they ever pay off the implication that Clooney's lying when Jason Bateman asks him about the woman who kills herself?<br/><br/>I don't love the scene where Clooney reassures Danny McBride, the groom with cold feet.<br/><br/>My final criticism is I think the process of firing people doesn't entail as much direct animosity toward the individual hired to do the job. Throughout the sequences in which the film illustrates a string of employees being let go, I just thought the ""How do you sleep at night?"" type of reaction is shown too many times.<br/><br/>All that being said: Man, I enjoy Up in the Air."

","Up In The Air is a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking drama starring George Clooney and Vera Farmiga. Clooney's corporate 'hit-man' is gloriously uncaring, but still exudes charisma in a way that is difficult to take one's eyes off. Clooney's chemistry with Anna Kendrick's character is very entertaining, and the corporate (and personal) carnage that they wreak, while wince-inducing, is inventively captured by Jason Reitman through the device of talking heads. This is a superb follow-up by Reitman to the excellent 'Juno' , almost looking at the opposite end of the human condition for its inspiration, it should send you off to look for Reitman's other films 'Thank You For Smoking' and 'Young Adult'. There are clever and thoughtful twists in the third act; it is ultimately a very satisfying and enjoyable film that should leave you with something to think about if you are on a professional career path."

The film has that natural progression that all of Reitmans films have, the film seems to just go where the wind takes it and you are simply a passing person who happens to witness these events.<br/><br/>The conclusion is again, totally Reitman. Its not a complete happy ending, the characters do end up scarred with guilt or pain and you feel for them but your at least happy they found something again to an ending for their tale and they are now wiser and know a little more than they did before.

","Up in the Air is a simple movie of simple pleasures but exquisitely crafted and with a moving message on the power of real life to sway even the most ardent of individuals who are married to a job, call a first-class seat a home, and collect not a retirement nest egg but instead a pile of frequent flier miles to come to understand and appreciate the grounded life and all its ups and downs. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) has been racking up the frequent flier miles and spending almost 11 months out of the year on the road while working for a firm that sends him to fire employees at various enterprises and industries around the country. He's approaching the magical 10,000,000-mile milestone while living -- and loving -- life out of a suitcase and with nothing to tie him down, a philosophy he teaches at various seminars when he's not ruining people's lives as a career endeavor. During some downtime at an airport, he meets Alex (Vera Farmiga), a lady who shares his passion for elite status memberships, frequent flier miles, and all things first class. The two engage in a romantic relationship that's dependent on them meeting during their hectic traveling schedules, but their rendezvous are placed in jeopardy when Ryan's Chicago-based company hires young upstart Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) to transition the company from face-to-face firings to web-based terminations. With Ryan's comfortable existence suddenly thrown into chaos, can he find meaning on the ground, in a home, and in the arms of a woman rather than in first class, an airport terminal, and an impersonal hotel room? <br/><br/>Up in the Air is a film that's of a superficially facile feel but it subtly and, sometimes, not-so-subtly, weaves a more involved tale of a man that comes to realize that his perception of the world may not be as cut-and-dry as he believes and, just as pertinent to his life story, has led others to believe. When he's not serving as the bearer of bad news, Ryan delivers a unique brand of motivational speaking, using a backpack filled with the ""baggage"" of daily life -- people, places, and things -- as a metaphor for an anchor of sorts that ties a man down and keeps him from free roving and fulfilling a greater sense of purpose with an unburdened ease. Ryan practices what he preaches, but his burgeoning relationship with Alex, a sudden jolt to his routine that threatens his very existence as he knows it, and a return trip home to celebrate his sister's marriage allows him to see the world from a perspective that has long since been absent in his life, a vantage point that's no longer obscured by clouds and miles and cards and hotels but captured in a palpable heart and soul, flesh and blood, and perhaps even, ultimately, happiness and fulfillment. Of course, Ryan comes to learn that life isn't always what it seems to be from his perch high atop the world and from the comfort of an American Airlines first-class seat; those things which seem absent from his chaotically-structured existence -- namely hurt and confusion -- exist on the ground floor, but so too, he realizes, do love, honesty, devotion, meaning, morals, and integrity. <br/><br/>Up in the Air posits that while life without pain and with lofty but ultimately empty goals might for a time -- and maybe even a lifetime -- fulfill the voids left by the abandonment of a typically-structured lifestyle, it's the real-world ups and downs that truly satisfy a man. Much like a plane ascends and descends, moves from one location to the next, and rewards those faithful to it, Ryan comes to see that real life offers similar benefits, but ultimately does more to satisfy the soul than does life out of a suitcase, even if, like any given flight, it can be bumpy, delayed, uncomfortable, or maybe even crash and burn. Ryan comes to learn that life isn't about a membership card, frequent flier miles, or an elite traveler status; it's about doing what satisfies a deeper need, even if the pursuit of that satisfaction leads to painful hurts and dreams unrealized.<br/><br/>Director Jason Reitman (Juno), working off a script based on a novel penned by Walter Kirn, delivers a complete movie with themes and drama that come full circle and that offer both light entertainment and, upon further reflection, a deeper examination of life. Clooney's character is the real winner here in that he is readily identifiable as flawed, but not to an extreme that makes the character any lesser of a man. Clooney gives the character a charm and wit that allows the audience to go with the flow and even appreciate and come to admire a man that fires people for a living and lives to love only the number of miles he's racking up. Clooney's character is neither self-centered nor arrogant; he simply is who he is, does his job because he's good at it and not because he necessarily loves doing it, and has fallen into comfort with his lot in life. This is perhaps Clooney's best effort yet, his portrayal of a man that's of many pluses and minuses but nevertheless of sound reason and demeanor, a man that cherishes what he chooses but accepts a changing structure and learns of deeper meanings to life in a plausible manner and without any sort of pandering or phoniness, a credit both to the actor and to the script. Additionally, Vera Farmiga is wonderful in a complex part as the bringer of many of the film's developments, though Anna Kendrick's is a lesser but certainly not ordinary effort as a young woman in search of her place in the real world, a foil of sorts to Clooney's seasoned character who has distanced himself from all that Natalie seeks."

","Reitman the Younger is a true wunderkind. Of course, it's reasonable to assume that his first correct move is in picking great, compelling stories, and the story of Up in the Air is a winner. After this, his screen writing, casting, direction, editing, etc. are wonderful.<br/><br/>The depth of the story is highlighted by the fact that it took me a while to realize probably the most important fact of the larger scenario into which UitA is a window. It's that the people Bingham serves so slavishly--it's not enough he subjects himself to this; he creates and hosts presentations to siphon others into his lifestyle--would never subscribe to the lifestyle he idealizes. The people Bingham serves (and whom we never see in the movie) are thereby enabled to create a cash-intensive, hothouse facsimile of the lifestyle he derides with every word, every action, every breath. In short, it's important to recognize that Bingham is a schlemiel; perhaps the ultimate schlemiel."

Here comes 'Ryan Bingham', the expert in firing people for people, helping you transient through this stage. Another great piece of art displayed, was with Ryan's extraordinary speech sessions. 'Whats in the back pack?' elaborates what we need to do on daily basis to ensure that we move on, prospering. He puts our daily problems to be like weight, added into our backpack, ensuring we don't move. Now you know what the problem is, hence what you could do, is look out for how to let it go. ANNA KENDRICK is one of the cutest, and exceptional actress in Hollywood, and indeed the one with a bright future as well. She and Vera had put such a good show in this that made the film, fill out all the loop holes it could have. Vera being a free bird, was like an open relationship woman to Ryan. While Anna helped Ryan transient into the new generation of Firing people. Both had so extraordinary impact on Ryan, such that both being out of his life, made him suffer.<br/><br/>A MUST WATCH!"

","It only runs for 105 minutes, but Up In The Air feels even shorter. This is a fine piece of entertainment .. with more messages here than in 20 mobile phones. George Clooney is great in his rather ""Oliver Cromwell"" type role of--sacking people.(giving people the chop!!) He flies all over America doing the dirty work for corporations that are too queasy for that kind of thing. He virtually lives in the air. He likes his work, and he is also a motivational speaker. The movie revolves around him,,,his romances,,,his family (he is un-married),,,his relationships Etc. There are good one liners here..and much more fun and intelligence than in most movies of to-day. The supporting cast (particularly the sexy Vera Farmiga) are all great."

","Spoiler alert I've finally got round to watching this after seeing fantastic reviews and previews and it didn't disappoint. I thought it was really moving and quite heartbreaking in some points. There are no Hollywood happy endings - when George Clooney's character finally decides to go to Chicago to ""get the girl"" I actually thought it would be a happy ending, and I wouldn't have minded. Instead, it showed a real life situation. Of course she was married and had a family, or at least had ""someone"" at home. And yet, I didn't hate her for it. I could understand why she wanted that escape. Interesting that it was the female who did the betrayal, perhaps audiences (myself included) would have had double standards and judged him.<br/><br/>Loved the ""co-pilot"" bit before the wedding too! So many one liners and laugh out loud moments, as well as just wanting to hug George Clooney as he looked so sad and alone"
"cherold","8","0","1","21 June 2012"," Intelligent and engrossing
","With a sharp script and good performances, Up in the Air is an unusually thoughtful movie driven by character rather than plot. Clooney plays the role of a man whose enjoys life in what to me would be an exhausting limbo, a life of constant travel from city to city. His life is disrupted when changes in his company, represented by a young go-getter, threaten to ruin his carefully constructed way of life, and the movie is primarily concerned with how this makes him ponder that life.<br/><br/>But the movie avoids going to predictable places or offering pat answers. Yes, most of us wouldn't like his life, but the movie really shows that all lives are fraught with disappointment.<br/><br/>I was a little bothered by how casual the movie is about Clooney's job. I mean, it's an awful thing to do, and I can't help but feel that the people who would actually do such a job are probably awful people. Clooney comes across as basically a nice guy, but if he were really a nice guy he would feel bad about what he does. And while you could argue that Clooney's character is simply someone who avoids introspection and refuses to think about the ramifications of what he does, he comes across as too smart for that to be true.<br/><br/>While I didn't love this movie the way some people did, I thought it was very good."

"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","9","0","1","14 December 2011"," Up in the Air (2009)
","Much in the same vein as Thank You For Smoking. Up in the Air is rather intelligent musings on life without being predictable nor condescending. Clooney plays a bachelor that believes life is better alone. He has no home to settle down in, he's always on the road, and his job is to fire people for big corporations that are too cowardly to do so. What starts as a despicable job, soon turns into admiration. Clooney is blessed at his job, and understands that people skils are required. It's his job to show Kendrick the ropes, as she plans to make all firings over computers. The film flirts with predictability, as Clooney discovers a woman that may be able to settle him down. Luckily, the film slaps the audience just as life would. Reitman's film is wonderfully crafted, showing both beautiful blossoming relationships, relationships in trouble, and some people are just better off alone. This really is a story about life, and overcoming difficulties. Some kill themselves after being fired, and some seize life. Enjoyable and thought provoking, it will take a lot to not contemplate where your life is headed after this."

","Warning - Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>The last weekend, my students and I saw the 2009 film ""Up in the air"" starring George Clooney and Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>This is a funny and witty film which has you chuckling and grinning through out, but, in the end - in the end, the films sets you thinking.<br/><br/>Ryan has perfected the art of blunting his emotions and living a life that ""without attachments"". He does not feel the need to connect as he wonders how relationships can weigh one down. All of us, at some point in time, have a fear of getting too close in a relationship and then not being able to assert oneself. Ryan has no relationships and it does not bother him. Or so it seems.<br/><br/>Ryan ends up advising his to be brother-in-law about relationships and happy moments. The apparently fake but persuasive advice hits back only to shake his ideas about relationships.<br/><br/>I would not like to ruin the plot for you but here is my take:<br/><br/>a) Building trust and having nurturing relationships lie at the core of our heart. All else is perfunctory and ephemeral. The new acquired independence, confidence and the powerful feeling of the teen years can carry over as a habit wherein we assume that our heart has no needs. There is a phase where outgrow our physical desires and needs and look for more meaningful relationships. What matters most is whether we find ourselves in a pleasant world or are surrounded by the debris of hurting relationships.<br/><br/>b) Professional and financial success can cloud our vision of what is right or wrong. We may get caught in what the Bhagvad Gita calls ""the pairs of opposites"" - pleasure and pain, love and hate, etc. This ""blindness"", as it were, can strike a blow to what our heart may desire.<br/><br/>c) A single word or a statement from anyone, known or unknown, has the potential to set us on the correct path. It pays to listen and it pays to collect feedback.<br/><br/>The movie sets you thinking about your own life and the relationships that you share."

","I didn't expect much from Up In The Air. I hated George Clooney and the poster didn't look so promising to me. In the end, the movie turns out much greater than I had thought. I don't like George still but the movie itself is great! George was perfect in this role: a smart handsome middle-aged man who has a mouth that works, who has nothing and lets nothing to tie him down. A perfect salesman who is a total ass-hole. That is, until he meets two women that change him somewhat.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes or so are annoying to me, mainly because we only get to see the annoying aspect of the characters. After that the movie picks up nicely. The movie tells a part of Ryan's life with people he meets. Nothing more, nothing less. It poses some issues about what young people wants and what older people wants, how people feel when they get fired, what are the attitudes of people about a free lifestyle's like Ryan. But that's it. Nothing really gets solved and answered, as life goes on.<br/><br/>There are great camera works and editing, as well as some smart lines along the, although some parts (Keener's enthusiasm about the work) feel a bit too forced or straight forward. Love Vera Farmiga from Source Code and love her still. Anna Kendrick does well as the young ambitious and naive girl who just enters life. Overall, a great movie that you should watch. Try getting past the first 30 minutes and George Clooney's flat face.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit: http://voicemotion.wordpress.com/"

","I love George Clooney, and i would say i Loved Ryan Bingham more, he stays close to my heart coz he resembles me and others who feel are solitary and isolated in their lives. And there are certain things which are true to itself as shown in the movie. You don't always get to watch a happy ending where a Lady who gets stuck somewhere in our life be there forever, neither are we gonna change our life style to be someone else!<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham, a downsizer & motivational speaker - motivational stuff as to how to avoid commitments and stay single and lively - subtly shows how men have been more to being negative and having the dark shades of life, i mean firing others and abstaining from relations is a common plight with guys around, who doesn't find the meaning of life and just lives on somehow. Ryan Bingham is even referred as a ""cocoon of self banishment"" to which he replies its simply a life choice. The way the story winds up was so beautiful, the climax scene in which George Clooney stands alone watching the schedule in the airport would be my favorite.<br/><br/>George Clooney was suave, neat and perfect as Ryan Bingham. I still believe he deserved more than an academy nomination. The supporting cast were all good, anna kendricks so perfect as the newbie, Vera Farmiga and Jason Bateman doing their parts so well. The soundtrack was good and drove the movie in good tone. The snaps from the air were all beautiful. Wonder why The movie didn't win a single Oscar!"
"nickmesafilms","9","0","3","27 August 2011"," Up in the Air (2009) - My Backpack is in the Air!
","Director Jason Reitman brings his third feature film about traveling, connections, and your every-day backpack. ""Up in the Air"" talks about Ryan Bingham, portrayed by the wonderful George Clooney, who travels in the air, just to fire people. Then along the way, he makes unexpected connections that can change his life forever. Jason Reitman brought a lot of smart charm and truth to bring ""Up in the Air"" to life, and I guess he wanted the film to be true to life, and it'll maybe give us a few life lessons. The script provided by Reitman and Sheldon Turner was a well-written pack of words filled with innuendos, gags, life lessons, and a true connection. The brilliant casting ensemble was on fire with the wonderful performances provided by George Clooney, Anna Kendrick, Vera Farmiga, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Zach Galifianakis, and J.K. Simmons. But it's Clooney that brought the performance of a lifetime with his charming charisma, fast-paced attitude, hard-working mind, and smart intelligence. ""Up in the Air"" is kind of like a movie where everybody goes through. Besides losing our jobs, it's actually a lesson saying that real connections don't happen that often, but since a true person comes in your life, it changes everything about yourself. From the minds of Jason and Ivan Reitman, with a perfect balance of comedy and drama, ""Up in the Air"" is a really well-written idea that can only come from the truth of mind. ""Up in the Air"", in my review, ""a perfect portrait of connections from the heart""."

","So I just watched 2009's Up in the air, was it good well yeah. It was directed by Jason Reitman son of Ivan Reitman who gave us some comedy classics and gave us some real stinkers as well. His son has given us in his relatively short career this movie, Juno, and Thank You for Smoking. So I can picture this kid being in his dad's world and learning from it, being inspired by it, and taking it to the level his dad hasn't. What I mean is I love Stripes and Meatball's but Jason's movies are much better and in this case deeper than his father's work. I have to think his dad is proud of his son. This movie had great acting from America's sweetheart George Clooney who is embracing getting older, and the rest of the cast including Vera Farmiga. It was deep without being obvious about being so, comical, and enjoyable to watch from start to finish, this is one of those movies that most people can find enjoyable.

Anna Kendrick is an impressive little firecracker in this film. She is fantastic alongside Clooney. Vera and Clooney have tons of chemistry and it was a pleasure to watch them shine together. A few little surprises happen along the way that may upset some viewers BUT it is what drives Ryan and Natalie to change. Yes, there is character progression! There is a touching scene with George and his sister's fiancé that really strikes me. As for Anna, I think as long as she picks movies as good as this one to act in, she'll do well."

","UP IN THE AIR is that rare chickcentric movie that doesn't make me want to vomit or slap someone. It is a story about love, but it's not a Love Story; it's a movie about romance, but it's not a Romantic Movie; it takes us on a bucking and diving flight across the landscape of human emotions and leaves us... up in the air.<br/><br/>Two ships pass in the night. And keep passing.<br/><br/>This movie is refreshing as a bottle of Orange Cream-Mama being shaken and opened in your face. A story about an enigmatic connection between two attractive, intelligent, middle-aged protagonists - not teen hipsters flapping platitudes and doing drugs in tight t-shirts. A movie that doesn't dumb itself down, nor dumb us down, which surprises even the best of us nihilists.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, charm working overtime) and Alex Goran (curvy, sensual Vera Farmiga), two Constant Travelers turned on by each others' elitism, meet at an airport bar and strike up a steamy, traveling relationship, never daring to get closer than a few cities apart.<br/><br/>Ryan's job is to fire people from theirs, a kind of Termination consultant brought in by corporations too gutless to face their own employees when letting them go. Much like the impermanence of the job market he sluices through like a shark, Ryan's life is uncluttered and itinerant - that's the way he likes it: ""All the things you hate about flying are warm reminders I'm home."" He describes the time he spent in his apartment last year as ""43 miserable days."" Alex is a little more mysterious, which will prove to be this movie's trump card.<br/><br/>Ryan's boss (Jason Bateman) saddles him with a termination novice, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), whose naiveté about career and love is in stark contrast to Ryan's and Alex's mature, intelligent take on life, sex and other mishaps. Whereas Clooney and Farmiga work beautifully together, underplaying against each other with an easy chemistry that sits on them like favorite sweatshirts, Natalie is an uncomfortable naif in her own skin, representing the flapping teen demographic and spouting the Chick Flick platitudes to prove it. Irony is, she details her mundane life plan as something worth aiming for, and Ryan's brother-in-law to be (Danny McBride, in a poignant, subdued role) details the exact same plan later as if it is a fatalistic dead end.<br/><br/>Directed and co-written by Jason Reitman, UP IN THE AIR and his other auteur work, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING (2006), are so much more honest and compelling than that girlie crap that he merely directed, JUNO (2007, written by Diablo Cody). Movie's denouement is a welcome shake to the shoulders, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. Produced by both Reitmans (Jason and father, Ivan), from a novel by Walter Kim, UP IN THE AIR takes the Chick Flick Handbook and tears out the pages on Making Real Men Vomit. Men (and pussy-men alike) can safely watch this whole movie with the person whose purse holds their balls, and not pretend to fall asleep or threaten a brain aneurysm.<br/><br/>Effective cameos from J.K. Simmons as a sacked employee, Zach Galifianakis as a vengeance-crazed sacked employee, and Sam Elliott, whose mustache is now completely out of control."
"mark-4522","10","0","2","4 June 2011"," Makes you think in unexpected ways
","There are hundreds of other reviews that state the obvious and true aspects of the film including the insights into frequent flier business travel, the life of young and aging professionals, the emotions felt by people laid off and those worried about their job changing around them, and the fantastic acting in the film.<br/><br/>What I found interesting about the film were the hidden insights into the directors, writers, and actors thinking as well as subtle cultural cues that the audience laughed at but may not have thought about at a conscious level.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film is very leftist/Hollywood. Heartless corporate bosses can't fire their own workers so they hire an outside firm to do it for them. Haha! I googled the concept and couldn't find such a firm. In my own corporate experience, the heartless, gutless managers don't bother to pay someone like Ryan to fly in business class to layoff the workers. They simply take the day off and have their HR representatives do it. I unfortunately know this from personal experience. That's part of why I enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>What was worth the price of admission was the dialogue between Ryan and the two generations of professional career women at a hotel lobby. All three of them are unapologetic selfish human beings. Ryan fires people for a living because it provides him with the lifestyle to run up frequent flier miles. This character also has a lot to do with Clooney's Hollywood alter ego. But the other two characters hit closer to home to the audience even if they didn't catch it. The young woman expressed post-feminist angst that while she loved earning lots of money and being able to pursue her career dreams, she worried about being able to land the perfect man. The older, attractive, and successful professional woman represented what the younger woman aspired to have (and in more ways than one, but I won't reveal how) but the older woman was more savvy about setting the ""have-it-all"" expectations of the younger woman more, down to earth.<br/><br/>So here the film features people getting laid off amid a bunch of professional bourgeois jetsetting around with their own selfish, shallow problems by comparison and they just don't ""get it"" that they're part of the problem. It's a nice allegory for the writers of the film and even many of the viewers.<br/><br/>When the film comes to an end, it doesn't leave the viewer's emotions all wrapped up in a neat bow but rather hanging where you don't know where the three characters' lives are leading. Indeed, the more successful, stable characters of the film are the ones who seem to have the most uncertainty.<br/><br/>Many of the best one liners are also the most politically incorrect and totally not the kind of thing that George Clooney would say at an Oscars presentation but probably the kind of things he thinks in his daily life. The scene where he lectures the girl at the airport at how to ""save time"" especially comes to mind. So much for him protecting minorities from sitting in the back of the theater! In the end, we're all ""up in the air"", whether we know it or not, with the biggest baggage not being our relationships, at least with each other, but rather with our expectations of the world and our cherished beliefs."
"pfgpowell-1","6","0","1","28 March 2011"," Sadly a rather mushy love story, not the satire I was expecting. Oh, well...
","Perhaps I missed something, perhaps Jason Reitman's Up In The Air is more subtle than it seems, but by the time the credits rolled, I felt rather cheated. The style and content of the film's first 60 minutes seemed to promise a spiky satire. Exactly what was to be satirised was not at all clear, but that, too, promised to be revealed in due course. It wasn't. Instead Reitman's opus turned into a rather soft-centred love story, one admittedly with a bitter-sweet ending, but a marshmallow type of love story all the same. OK, so George Clooney's gift of the gab with which professionally he had sugared the pill of being 'let go' for thousands of loyal employees was employed to calm down his sister's intended when the poor chap got last-minute nerves more or less at the altar. Perhaps there was some significance in that. But if so, it is rather slight significance. In the event gorgeous George, who until then had eschewed domesticity with a vengeance and instead dedicated himself to gaining air miles while criss-crossing the US sacking people meets a fellow traveller, beds her and is smitten. She, a good turn by Vera Farmiga, it seems is something of a minx: despite giving George every impression of reciprocating his growing love, in fact is married with children and only regarded him as a bit on the side. Was that the centre of the film? Tables are turned on man? Well, if so, that also wouldn't make sense because despite his aversion to settling down and despite the cruel nature of his job, George's character is rather a nice chap and, in the film, at least does nothing which deserves cruel retribution. Then there's the gal he falls for: if anything she is the nasty one, and a good case could be made that she lead George on. But whatever, the whole story – for that is the story, and forget about any putative satire of corporate America – is simply far too slight for a film of this kind. Clooney, I have to say as always, give excellent value for money as do his two female leads, Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. But despite that I felt cheated. If I want to see a love story, I'll seek one out and see it. And I'll make sure it has more substance than this. I would, however, have preferred a spike satire. But there was, as it became apparent, no chance of that here. Shame really, there was a lot of material to go on."

","Just saw this flick on a Pay channel yesterday, and I must say I did enjoy it. Perhaps it's because I can relate to the main character's (George Clooney) dilemma as far as the traveling and comes the time, he was faced with ending that. Fresh out of college, I took a job decades ago as an Internal Auditor with a major food machines manufacturer then in Troy, Ohio, and was on the road about 70% of the time - always traveling first-class, eating in fine restaurants, and staying in first-class surroundings. It was 'the life' for me, a 26 year-old who'd never done extensive traveling - I got to 'see the world', so to say, and loved every minute of it. One day, about three years later, it all came 'crashing down' when the company was sold and these positions were deemed 'excess expense' and all in my department were suddenly out of a job. I spent a few weeks at home getting 'reacquainted' as to how the non-traveling world works, and I hated it! I had met many while traveling (a few like his 'love') and the realization 'set in' that I'd likely never see them again - and this became the truth. As is often the truth, however, we all 'moved on' and made our lives in other ways so many years ago. The traveling did let me make a 'new home' in Southern California today, and I'm now retired after two + decades working for a local large computer maker. I often think back to my experiences back then, which is a reason I did enjoy this motion picture so much. I got somewhat 'absorbed' into the main character's lifestyle, which is when I rate a motion picture a 'keeper'. Many thanks!!!"

","Up in the Air is an impeccable journey! Ryan Bingham (Geroge Clooney) has a job that most of would kill for and be killed to have as far as the traveling perk. He gets to fly around from major city to city with his job covering most of his expenses. The downfall being that he does the work of firing people. This kind of work that Bingham pursues adds tone to the story. This tone being sardonic and sympathetic. Although, Ryan is apathetic (or appears to be) during the process of releasing someone, he meets this suave and class-act Alex. Alex is definitely an independent, feminine version of Ryan. There is so much more to the story than this but I love the dialogue and how witty and clever it is. My favorite part is when he opens the door to see who Alex really is. The essence of that heartfelt moment is so powerful! GO SEE THIS!"

","From the box and the synopsis on the back you might think Up In the Air is a typical Hollywood romance/drama that anyone without an X chromosome should try to avoid like the plague, it isn't. Sure there is a romantic element to the story and it plays a vital role in the film but it isn't a smothering love story full of such clichés as long walks on the beach and romantic candlelight dinners. Up In the Air is a story about a man who thinks he has it all figured out, until he realizes that perhaps he does not, or maybe he did after all.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) fires people. When companies want to outsource the unpleasantness of terminating large numbers of employees they call his boss and he is on a plane to the next city to dish out the bad news. Bingham loves his life on the road, in a different city every night, no ties to hold him back, just him, his carry on, and his miles. He even makes it a point to occasionally give motivational speeches to groups about the virtues of his spartan lifestyle. With nothing to weigh him down he is totally free. Everything is fine until a new hire at his firm, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), proposes a bold plan to utilize video conferencing to fire people instead of doing it in person. Bingham detests the idea as it will completely turn his life upside down so in a desperate attempt to sabotage the plan he convinces his boss to send young Alex out with him into the field to learn about the business she is about to destroy.<br/><br/>What follows is a wonderful example of a character driven movie. With each scene we get so see a little bit more of Ryan Bingham and how his relationships, or lack thereof, have shaped his life and molded him into the man he is. Clooney is determined and confident but not ruthless or arrogant, he is likable, competent, and he has sort of a zen thing going on with his life philosophy. Later in the film he starts to perhaps have some second thoughts about his take on things and watching the character grow on screen is a real pleasure. I won't give away the ending but I will say that it is not all sunshine and lollipops like so many Hollywood films are. Up In the Air is a serious film that is presented in a manner that makes it light, funny, and enjoyable."
"philip-barclay","10","0","2","29 December 2010"," Up in the air - a fair summary of life in the 21st century!
","Only George Clooney could make this movie work properly. A combination of his effortless charm, which would make anyone happy to be a part of his Career Transition plus the fact that he has truly eschewed the pipe and slippers and is still ""living the dream"".<br/><br/>But what is the ""dream"" really about? As Oscar Wilde says, there are only two certainties in life, death and taxes. In Bingham's case, you could substitute air-miles for taxes as Ryan's life is carefully tailored to maximise the former and minimise the latter. Living life in the fast lane doesn't change the destination, you just get there faster and miss out much of the interesting scenery along the way. Criss-crossing America just below the speed of sound whilst keeping Ryan looking as good as ever has still not moved him along through life's gateways.<br/><br/>Ryan's well rehearsed severance patter that keeps him at an emotional distance from those who are being let go is equally matched by the pre-formatted greetings he receives from the hotel frequent flyer priority check in desks. Ryan is at home in this world of the superficial where you can always expect a chocolate on your pillow before you go to sleep at night and a complete supply of miniature bottles of spirits in the mini-bar.<br/><br/>This lifestyle keeps Ryan ""up in the air"" and well on his way to reaching the mythical 10,000,000 mile club.<br/><br/>Meeting Alex upsets the equilibrium and the thought that he may have finally met ""the one"" is enough to bring Ryan back down to earth, appropriately enough going down not just to ground level but further still as he and Alex explore his roots.<br/><br/>Whilst this film can be seem by some as a little depressing, for those of us who are middle aged, it is a clear statement of life as we live it in the 21st century. We all remain ""up in the air"", despite all the apparent benefits of technological advances in our developed world. Instead, we have to live through the uncertainties generated by a world wide recession that mean that any of us could yet be subject to a visit by one of Ryan's colleagues. And yet, despite all this, it is clear that the main message of the film is that the essence of human life is contained in our connections with our humans, no matter how heavy they make our back pack.

","I remember this film being critically acclaimed earlier this year, even winning some important nominations and picking up one or two awards. I hadn't realised that the director, Jason Reitman, also directed Juno, a favourite of mine from 2007. With all these coincidences, I had to give it a viewing when it came up on TV. I wasn't disappointed, it's pretty good but more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please wait in the VIP Executive Lounge while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham has a job that means he is on the road a lot, well, when I say 'on the road' I mean up in the air, of course. He spends most of the year travelling from place to place terminating people's employment. Not the nicest job, I know, but one that he is very competent at. On the side, he also gives motivational lectures. During one of his trips he meets Alex Goran, an attractive woman who also has a job that entails a lot of air travel. Having compared notes, they get together and find there is some attraction there. Later, Ryan is called into the office and is told that the company he works for is looking at taking everyone off the road and replacing them with an impersonal internet-linked screen. He argues against it and ends up taking the inventor of the system, Natalie Keener, on the road so she can experience exactly how it works. The pair don't exactly hit it off at first, but soon develop a respect for each other. Ryan and Alex meet at various places across America and eventually Ryan asks her to accompany him to his sister's wedding. Will she go, and, more importantly, will this bring them closer? Well, I'm not going to tell you here I'm afraid, can't give too much away.<br/><br/>This is a really well made gentle comedy that I found both endearing and quite engrossing to watch. All three of the main characters were very good, but I must pick out George Clooney, as Ryan Bingham, for particular praise. I thought he fitted the role perfectly! Vera Farmiga as Alex Goran and Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener were also both excellent.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, it made a nice change to see a modern film with characters that are so easy to relate to. I love the style that Jason Reitman uses; I find it quite relaxing with some great visuals and a tremendous script. Over all, it's one I will watch again and so, definitely recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.4/10"
"wright7700","9","0","2","20 December 2010"," Haunting and all too timely
","This work of art exposes the disconnect in our modern, fast-paced society in ways that have never been explored. Examples are as follows:<br/><br/>1)George Clooney's main character lives in a motel room with no pretense of being a real home, very sterile and spartan. He is far from his family emotionally and geographically and does not relate well to other people in many cases. 2)Employers don't even talk with their employees, just hiring another company to come in to terminate them. 3)Big Rust Belt companies are dying on the vine. Mr. Clooney has been to Detroit a lot and says so. Their offices are barren with phones strewn all over the floors and carpet with impressions where the desks used to be. 4)Vera Farmiga is an exquisite job with her role as the love interest. I knew something was wrong with her but just couldn't place it. My friends, family, and co-workers are still complaining about the amoral wanton slut. 5)Of course, there is the obligatory smart-girl new grad from a northeastern school who delivers the bad news the all the laid off employees. This must be quite demeaning to a 62 year old grandfather with a high school diploma. That is often how it happens.<br/><br/>Most troubling: All of the people being fired appear to be middle aged, old, fat, African-American, or some other minority. As in real life, they have all been in their positions a long time, earning an above average salary to the point that they are on the radar to be let go. All that vacation, 401k, health care is too expensive for these types of people when you can hire Mayling in China (or Maria in Mexico) for $1 per day.<br/><br/>""I'm here to be fired, aren't I?"" ""I have plans, there's a bridge near my house, and I gonna jump off it.""<br/><br/>All of the main characters, particularly Clooney and Farmiga, do a fantastic job and rattle the viewer to the core with this all too timely work. Just outstanding."

","Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) plays the part of Corporate Killer immortalized by Norm Peterson (George Wendt) over two decades ago in an episode of Taxi and more recently reprised in an episode of animated series King of the Hill. He is a downsizing specialist. Exactly what is that? A downsizing specialist is one who fires people when the company decides to shed jobs. The bosses are too haughty to admit their own failure and too timid to confront the employees with the bad news. Ryan explains that all he does is get the redundant employee to leave the building peacefully.

The costs of sending 21 Termination Specialists into the air has become too high.<br/><br/>There may be an art to Ryan's manner of terminating employees but there is also a philosophy behind it: This is pitched in Ryan's motivational speeches, ""What's in your backpack"" where Ryan preaches that the audience is carrying the weight of too many personal relationships around.<br/><br/>Yet Ryan exudes charm and finesse when he is about his trade. He compares it to a hotel industry term ""foamy"" a cross between ""faux"" or ""false"" and ""homey."" At his home base, a studio apartment,Ryan has little weighing him down.

"Likes_Ninjas90","9","0","2","15 October 2010"," It represents the director's most mature film yet, one that is not only funny but also sad and ironic too
","As a director Jason Reitman escaped his father's shadow with two very impressive films, Juno and Thank You for Smoking. Both were mature comedies that dealt with dark and politically sensitive issues; teenage pregnancy and spin-doctors respectively. Up in the Air, which was named Best Film by the National Board of Review, is based on the novel by Walter Kirn, with a screenplay by Reitman and Sherldon Turner. It represents the director's most mature film yet, one that is not only funny but also sad and ironic too. Although the novel was written in 2001, the film takes place after the US recession and it is within this context that Reitman can express the increasing difficulties of Ryan's job and enhance the emotional core of the film too. The verisimilitude applied to the minor characters in the film is particularly impressive. Those that are fired by Ryan look and sound ordinary and real. Their responses, as they are dismissed and stripped of their dignity, are as painful for the audience as they are for Natalie. Ryan's family too, when he meets them at the wedding, are not particularly attractive people, just ordinary folks who have their own pleasures in life, even if they struggle to make ends meet. Reitman's fine direction is not just limited to the excellent casting, as the aesthetics excel as well. The film is briskly paced in representing Ryan's globetrotting, without sacrificing the depth of its narrative. While the art design, from the meticulous selection of suits for the actors, to the cold and structured framing of the airports, is also strong reflection of the uniformity and controlling nature of Ryan's life.<br/><br/>Natalie's gradual understanding of the responsibility of the job form the basis of much of the film's narrative. As with Juno this is also about a relatively young woman who is in a situation that is completely out of her depth. Natalie attempts to use the same catchphrase as Ryan for firing people and also tries to map out different strategies on her laptop. Yet in one of the film's most heartfelt scenes, she is given the task of firing a list of people from a company and she can barely make it through the first interview. The emotion that is shown by the employee is the reality that no degree in psychology can prepare Natalie for and she is affected accordingly. The change that Ryan undergoes is equally as believable. At the beginning of the film he is someone who is completely confident in every aspect of his life. He seems almost proud of his disconnection to the world. However, one suspects that beneath his well-tailored shell he is longing for a lot more, even if it is slightly subconscious. When he is told that he isolated he responds arrogantly and naively by saying: ""isolated? I'm surrounded"". Yet the hurt is visible on his face whenever his attempts to connect with people fail. When he tries to invite his neighbour over she brushes him off stating: ""I'm seeing someone now"". Similarly, at the wedding rehearsal dinner Ryan is shown the ring on his sister's finger. It's a funny but ironic moment as it is tiny and probably cheap but at the same time it represents the bond between two people that Ryan may never experience. The family he barely knows resonate with the audience as the same ordinary-looking people that Ryan has had to dismiss, but as with those he fired, his empathy for their struggles has been contained because of his lifestyle choices and his own isolation. Thus the heart of the film is its screenplay, which is smartly written and layered with both humour and emotional depth. The changes in the characters are not only credible but they also do not mistake true emotion for sentimentality either. It is through these transitions that the film becomes richly compelling viewing.<br/><br/>The performances from the cast are collectively superb. Clooney's suave personality is still present as he knows how to be charming; with the ability to seduce a woman at a bar or to persuade a redundant worker that they still have options. Yet he is also colder, more clinical and determined in this film than he has ever been. The scene where he fights for his living epitomises this. As Natalie tries to fire him in a hypothetical situation, he acts out the various responses of people being dismissed and in demonstrating his thorough experience and knowledge of the job he is able to crush her optimism for the new system. Most significantly, Clooney expresses the changes he undergoes both internally and externally. As with the aforementioned scene, one can see him at the peak of his powers, in the comfort zone of the experience of his job. By the end though we also see him at his weakest when he realises he is like one of the released, only in a more emotional sense. It remains a very convincing and layered performance by Clooney, justifying much of the Oscar buzz surrounding him. Kendrick too has a challenging role of playing an inexperienced woman who is acting like she knows what she is doing. It is a performance within a performance. With her hair tied back in a pony tail, her suit and sophisticated vocabulary, her character looks and sounds the part, but she is of course hollow in regards to her knowledge of real human suffering and crumbles in the most convincing manner. Vera Farmiga is pivotal as Alex, offering subtle support too."

","Some criticism has been made of this film, I notice. It's not worth an Academy Award. There's too much product placement -- Hertz, American Airlines, Hilton Hotels. I can understand that point and can add more. It's not exactly plot driven either. There's a good deal of character dissection and little in the way of action, unless you count flying as action. On top of that, the musical score is execrable -- a warm and fuzzy folk guitar playing pretty tunes with lyrics like, ""There's an ocean of water under your feet...."" If you've heard Simon and Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair,"" you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>The one criticism I thought thoroughly unjustified was that the ending was predictable. It caught me by pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>George Clooney is a well-paid bureaucrat whose job is to fly around and fire executives. At any rate, I guess they can be called ""executives."" Many seem no more than mid-level and the only salary mentioned is by one firee, who admits to making $90,000. That doesn't seem like very much, does it? But wait. Let me get my calculator. Yes. That works out to 4.86 times as much as I ever made in my life. Okay. As far as I'm concerned, he's an ""executive."" So in this sense the movie is -- <br/><br/>Hold on. Is that the MOST I ever MADE? What the hell happened? I've always wondered where it all went, and now I know. It was never there in the first place.<br/><br/>Where was I? Right. We follow George Clooney around and watch him do his job, which sociologists call ""cooling out the mark."" If you're going to fire somebody, you don't want him suing the company or jumping across the desk and strangling you.<br/><br/>Clooney is cool, but he's joined by a newbie fresh out of Cornell, which happens to have a fine school of Industrial and Labor Relations. The ambitious neophyte is played by Anna Kendrick who is just plain marvelous. Evidently she was born in Portland, Maine, but sounds like a Valley Girl. The velocity of her speech is like unto that of light. It comes in staccato bursts. And there is one scene in which she is hurrying after Clooney through an airport, demanding to know why he doesn't believe in love and commitments and he keeps parrying her increasingly earnest queries with common-sensical ripostes -- there's no such thing as love, it's all pointless. Then she stops suddenly. Clooney gapes at her as her features screw up into a grimace and she squeals, ""Brian LEFT me!"" Clooney's face drops and he moans, ""Oh, ****."" The way I look at it, if a movie has even one scene that can make me laugh out loud, it may or may not be Academy Award material (who cares?) but it can't be all bad.<br/><br/>Clooney seems satisfied with his job. He doesn't mind firing people. He gets to tell them about the bright new future ahead of them. He doesn't ENJOY it. He's just good at it and his company keeps him busy.<br/><br/>Then he runs into the sensuous Vera Farmiga. She travels around all the time too. They begin an on-and-off affair. It's on whenever they happen to cross paths at an airport. When Clooney is pulled by circumstance into a family ritual back in Wisconsin -- a marriage -- he asks Farmiga to come along as his date. She does, and they seem to have a great time together, although he knows nothing about her. The warm and fuzzy guitarist croons in the background, always a bad sign.<br/><br/>On his trips, firing folks and giving motivational speeches, he begins to contrast the life he's leading with the kind of love that Anna Kendrick has experienced. His mind turns to Vera Farmiga, to family and children. So he's launching into a motivational speech at some businessman's gathering and he stammers and hesitates, and I'm thinking, Oh My God, we've got St. Paul and an epiphany on the road to Damascus. Sure enough, Clooney excuses himself and leaves the podium. He hurries to Farmiga's house for an impromptu visit and I'll leave it at that. Except that, when they didn't fall into each others' arms, I wept with gratitude.<br/><br/>As I said, I don't care if the movie wins any awards or not. And the pace is a little andante in parts. But then it's largely a story of character rather than plot, and the weaknesses are more than compensated for by the trust that the writers, the director, and the performers have placed in the audience. It's a movie for grown ups and that's distinctive enough these days."

","Jason Reitman's tale of corporate downsizing is bound to strike a chord with moviegoers in our modern recession and was released at the perfect time. However, unlike most topical films, which tend to slide into obscurity after their time in the limelight, I feel 'Up in the Air' will be remembered as a timeless classic which can really reach out to anyone. All three leads (George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick) are breathtaking in their character roles, each carrying a sense of enigma affixed with their own goals and expectations for love and life, and as always each is compromised along the way. The relationship between Clooney and Farmiga has incredible chemistry, and Kendrick's conjunction of professionalism and idealism was handled perfectly.<br/><br/>Though most of the dialogue is infused with that quick wit you can always expect from Reitman films, this movie really proves to be one of the most devastating and heavy films of the year. It perfectly embodies the journey of middle-age angst just as 'Juno' represented the indifference of smart-ass teenagers. Just like 'Juno', though, it is more likely appeal more to the age group it is depicting."

It is funny at moments, but also very deep and dramatic most of the time. It is also a stroke of genius to let real people be ""interviewed"" during a pivotal scene and therefor make it more authentic.<br/><br/>One of the best movies to have come out in 2009, this really is a showcase for the actors (as mentioned), with a story to back them up. And you still cannot mention Clooney enough, especially because this seems to be as close to the real man or some of his real dilemmas that he has. And he still didn't back down from that challenge. A really good movie, with a great ending then."

","Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" is, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2009, if not the very best. That's something that took me by surprise since I was unimpressed by Reitman's last effort (""Juno"") and I find that George Clooney is an actor whose work I don't always care for. Nevertheless, this so-called 'recession-era' drama hits its mark with a sharp script and solid performances.<br/><br/>The story revolves around corporate downsizer Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man who lives for the road and has built his life around the concept of eschewing close personal relationships. However, when he sparks a casual relationship with another frequent flyer (Vera Farmiga) he begins to consider whether or not he's chosen the right path. The other main thread of the story deals with a cost-cutting plan to haul the downsizers off the road, much to Bingham's chagrin. As a result, the plan's initiator, an eager graduate (Anna Kendrick), hits the road with Bingham in order to experience the sorts of things that can't be encapsulated in flow charts and slide shows.<br/><br/>Clooney, Farmiga & Kendrick all landed Oscar nominations for their performances and I think that any one of them would have been a deserving winner. Clooney is perfectly suited to his role and Vera Farmiga makes a great match. Anna Kendrick also has wonderful interplay with Clooney in a completely different way. The supporting cast is pretty good as well, with a number of notable names showing up, including Jason Bateman straying a little from his usual comedic persona.<br/><br/>Reitman's direction is routinely lively and attractive but it's his adapted screenplay (co-authored with Sheldon Turner) that steals the show. It really should have won the Oscar but I guess the Academy felt otherwise. I should also note that the score/soundtrack is pretty good, too.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Up in the Air"" is a fine film that makes me look forward to Reitman's next project. See it for the unique, engaging script and the trio of wonderful performances."

","I saw the review by Jonathan Ross which was quite positive, and it had been getting hyped because of the up coming awards ceremonies, so I had to see why, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Jason Reitman (Thank You For Smoking, Juno), son of director Ivan. Basically Ryan Bingham (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated George Clooney) makes a living and career from flying place to place to fire employees from companies where the boss can't do it themselves. He works for an Ohama based Career Transition Counseling that deals in corporate downsizing, and his boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) has hired arrogant young Natalie Keener (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Anna Kendrick) who has developed a computer video conferencing method of doing Ryan's job. Determined to show how much of an error this idea by the naive strategist is to (his and) the company's future, Ryan is taking Natalie to all the places he is assigned to in order to see why the way he does the job is much more professional than what she proposes. While journeying Ryan is asked by sister Kara (Amy Morton) to take a cardboard cut-out of his sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey) and her fiancée Jim Miller (Danny McBride) with him and take photos of them in many of the places he travels. Along the way Ryan also has a great sexual relationship with attractive businesswoman Alex Goran (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Vera Farmiga) whenever their flight plans at the airports come together. Ryan has realisations about his lifestyle choice, he changes his opinion on marriage relationships being meaningless after helping Jim and Jim patch the wedding up, and he finds out that Alex is married. In the end, Natalie leaves the company after discovering that a particularly memorable woman committed suicide after losing her job, Ryan hits his dream goal of taking 10,000 miles worth of flying and meets plane pilot Maynard Finch (Tombstone's Sam Elliott), but he can't celebrate it as much as he would have wanted, and he enters an airport with no idea where to go. Also starring Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons as Bob and The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis as Steve. Clooney does really well as the charming, smooth talking and sophisticated hired gun, the two supporting female characters also do very well in the scenes they feature, it is a really good adult romantic comedy drama that steers clear from too many clichés and makes the business world look a bit more cool. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film and Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

Juno is a character who starts out aimless and finds a more defined path for her life. Ryan starts out with a defined path for his life but winds up aimless by the end. The effect is unsettling and even unsatisfying if you're looking for a more traditional comedy.<br/><br/>What is great about Jason Reitman is that he shoots for the edit in this film. Every shot is carefully planned for both comedic and dramatic purposes. One scene in particular could be used to study directing and editing. It simply has Bingham going through a security check at an airport, but every little step involved with that procedure is shot and cut in rapid, harmonious succession with sound effects that make those blunt gray containers seem like weapons. Bingham is a warrior.<br/><br/>Several scenes include large American Airline posters in the background that read: ""We Value your Loyalty."" This underlines the defining concept of the film. Loyalty is a limited resource. Everyone has it invested in something, but what's going to provide the most return? There is much to be said about relationships, with characters that are loyal, disloyal and even indifferent, and the need ""to make a connection"" (as the tagline so cleverly tells us). This is a timeless story centered around the American Dream but yet is a snapshot of our time and the result of the current economy. People need to see this. It will reach out to them.<br/><br/>It is clear that ""Juno"" was what it was because of Reitman. He brings a certain level of humanity to everything he does.

"cannonclubonline","10","0","2","3 July 2010"," Probably The Best Clooney Can Ever Get! Superb
","There is no way that I could pass up the opportunity to review this film. This one superbly traps us up in the underpinnings of real life situational irony that only gives us few clues about who this guy, Jet-set Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) really is. The writing is always witty, drastically depressing (yet satirically hilarious) in places and always manages to deliver up an heir of living with purpose by the book and on the clock. Produced by Ivan & Jason Reitman, Jason gets totally behind this project by directing/co-writing this story along with Sheldon Turner pitching in on the screenplay.<br/><br/>This Ryan ""guy"" initially comes across as way too simple minded for me; the outward facade of a study in timing and efficiency. Everybody knows one of these ""guys"". It soon becomes evident that our guy is comfortable convincing himself & others of his total belief that he indeed has the perfect life. His only goal in life seems to become 1 of only 7 who hold the elite distinction of having flown 10 million miles with American Airlines. Don't get me wrong about this. My traveling days peeked with 12 take offs & landings in one week on commercial airlines across the U.S. in the late 80s & early 90s. I also had a severely depressing job selling computer software directly to funeral homes. Of course, people are still dying to get into the computer (pun intended)! Clooney reminds me of myself here. He's proud of the fact that he, of all the people in the world, is a ""total professional"" at firing people. He's proud of his corporate raider downsizing technique. Traveling lightly is not just an art, it's a necessity. Clooney gives us certain glimpses of this guy's soul (what makes him tick) to the tune of ""I started out as a diamond, so don't rub coal on me"" as opposed to ""I'm just a lump of coal but I'm going to be a diamond someday."" Jumping in bed with just anyone couldn't really happen with this guy. He totally falls for the gal that's his female counterpart he meets during connections at an airport bar watering hole.<br/><br/>Reitman & Turner create this world of words that is hard to duplicate with boring people. The quick witted banter is totally heady & shoots straight from the hip. The counterpart role of Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) is comfortably romantic & played attractively & honestly. Little do we know whats really around the bend.<br/><br/>Fascinating things happen when Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) come into the picture. The down time, disappointment, & anxiety all build us up to the eventual meltdown/refreeze. Our ""guy"" Ryan really is a fascinating & caring person, yet somehow doesn't have the family roots to bring him back home much. Only his sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey) getting married (whom he isn't close with) will bring him back home to northern Minnesota. Sometimes he is comically depressing; other times, it's just plain common sense.<br/><br/>Just when you think he's headed for the pasture, things head ""back east"" for him & you somehow feel that same ole' familiar ""guy"" slipping back into his comfort zone, up in the air.<br/><br/>The cast is balanced off with funny people such as the groom Jim Miller (Danny McBride), the boss in Omaha, Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), depressing people like Bob (JK Simmons) & Samuels (Steve Eastin), and last (but not least) Maynard Finch (Sam Elliot-Ghost Rider 2007). Funny that after 67 years, Elliot is still churning the butter. He & Kate Capshaw really where the hot tamales in The Quick & The Dead 1987."

","Oh my god... what this guy George Clooney is? i mean look at his performance. He can justify any role he is being offered. What a Marvelous performance. All that i can say is, the concept of the movie, Star cast, Picturisation, Timing (during Recession in US), Locations (offices mostly) are outstanding which, undoubtedly, enough to make this movie the hit one. i like the way Clooney used to work for his company. his suits, dedication to his work is nicely framed in this movie. <br/><br/>Seemingly not playing with a full deck is Natalie, played most beautifully by Anna Kendrick, who portrays brains don't equal smart choices. <br/><br/>Must watch movie for those people who are dealing with corporate offices. For a typical film, Up In the Air is perfectly satisfactory and an enjoyable enough distraction for anyone that gets pleasure watching Clooney do what he does best. But ignore the hype, ignore the awards, and lower your expectations. There's nothings shocking or particularly moving here, unless of course you're one of the unemployed. In that case, it's better to just go see something like ""Avatar"" and escape for a few hours."

","In a year that has been filled with anticipation surrounding 3D epics and generic disaster movies such as '2012' and 'Avatar', it was refreshing change to see an honest film which tells the story of one dysfunctional man and his rather alternative and shallow take on life. George Clooney's performance was the best I have seen from him in a while, and whilst his character was not always the most likable I found it very easy to engage with him. A particular highlight for me was his narration in the beginning of the film and his lectures which feature throughout. The most important aspect of the performance is that we see the characters love for the life that he leads and the pride that he takes in the work that he does.<br/><br/>Granted this movie may not make its way into history, but in the current global economic climate the subject matter is very close to the heart of all of us. One particular highlight is the use of real people who have lost their jobs in this recession being used as actors and talking about their experiences at the end of the film. This gives the film that you have watched a whole new depth of meaning and is a credit to Reitman's personal touch that are familiar with from 'Juno'.<br/><br/>Relationships are also a key feature in this film, particularly the one between Clooney and Anna Kendrick. The dynamic and chemistry between the two is always intriguing and for much of the film I was not sure who was teaching who, but Clooney eventually shows her that the personal touch is what is important. It was almost as if Reitman was sending a message to other directors such as Roland Emmerich, and showing them the quiet dignity of the smaller things in life.<br/><br/>Overall the film is well directed and the screenplay is good enough to keep you gripped without demanding too much from the cast, despite a great performance from Clooney himself. Other than that there is a small but solid performance from 'Jason Bateman' of 'Arrested Development' fame, I still eagerly await a good leading man role from him."

"Jonny_Numb","8","0","2","10 June 2010"," Finding Levity
","With only 3 feature films under his belt, Jason Reitman has developed a unique cinematic language for his own interesting voice; unlike his father (Ivan Reitman, most renowned for the ""Ghostbusters"" franchise), he is less interested in big-budget blockbuster film-making, and more passionate about intimate tales that turn their characters inside-out. His Awards-hungry ""Juno""--while not a perfect film by far--established a teenager who was by turns arrogant, callous, and clearly unaware of the grownup responsibility that came with her pregnancy; by the end of the film, however, it was clear that she had undergone a series of epiphanies and personal discoveries that not only forced her to confront the reality of her situation, but transformed her character into something heart-wrenchingly believable. The same finely nuanced character development occurs in ""Up in the Air"": George Clooney (who comes across as a close cousin to Aaron Eckhart's character in Reitman's debut, ""Thank You for Smoking"") plays a corporate shark/motivational speaker, who, by his own admission, spends only 40 days at his Omaha apartment out of the year; the rest of the time, he is boarding endless flights around the country, firing workers on behalf of companies who don't have the brass to do it themselves. Initially, Clooney's character comes across as an arrogant gloss on Michael Clayton, and is very hard to like (there is a palpable coldness to the way he and fellow jet-setter Vera Farmiga ""bond"" over frequent-flyer miles and online itineraries); it is only after meeting plucky-yet-emotionally-fragile Anna Kendrick (the brainchild behind an depersonalized online method of firing workers en masse) that Clooney undergoes a change in attitude, going from a man who loves to be surrounded by people without actually connecting to anyone, to a man who realizes that he might be missing out. Reitman, who co-wrote the script with Sheldon Turner, lets the image speak for itself: while the characters are clearly works of fiction (and contrived in their own ways to meet the script's needs), the snap of their dialog and shared experiences seldom rings less than true. By its ambiguous close, ""Up in the Air"" has gone from a study of alienated (and alienating) people to a near-revelation in how we, as human beings, disconnect from one another without even knowing it."

","Very powerful and strong plots  it's the true story of American corporate society today. Director Jason Reitman is always trying to show and portray hidden but we are seen in everyday life of American society. Juno was about life of 16 years old pregnant high school girl and Up in the Air was about a corporate down-sizer Ryan (George Clooney). The film released on perfect timing because today many Americans are facing exactly same problems occurred in the film. Last couple years many big corporate are downsizing their employees, but they rather hire an outsourcing and they would handle their firing situations easier. Ryan was one of those guys whom portrayed in the film. He travels around America from state to state; company to corporate and so on. Then he meets a new and ambitious Natalie and then they travel together to fire more people in different places. Furthermore, he met these frequent flier woman named Alex and later on he fell in love with her; but at the end of the movie he found out that she was married and had a child. In conclusion, the point of the movie was Ryan has no place to home because he travels around America all the time. At the end of the movie; when his travel miles approached to 10 million, airplane pilot asked, where he was from. He didn't have answer because he spent most of his life up in the air."

","Y'know how movies are often criticized for somehow being less than the novels from which they are adapted? That the characters so three dimensional on paper become two dimension on celluloid? That the plots are untwisted and sanitized? Not so for ""Up In The Air"".<br/><br/>I read the novel first, as it happened whilst I was on the road for a couple of weeks. It captured the tarnished charisma of modern air travel beautifully, the banality of it all. The once glamorous pilots have become bus drivers, the once elegant stewardesses have become waitresses. Greyhound with wings.<br/><br/>That being said the book also paints a picture in two dimensions... of a guy who goes around the country firing people for a living. He's a professional asshole basically. The very thing that irks most of us about modern day travelthe utter staleness of it all is this guy's wellspring of comfort. His goal in life, it seems, is to amass frequent flyer miles for the sole purpose of amassing miles. He is colorless; he is two-dimensional because he chooses to be. Or maybejust maybehe can't help it.<br/><br/>The movie takes this premise and expands on it. That's the gift herea rather (purposefully) banal book is brought to life. mostly thanks to Clooney's interpretation of a very well written script the two dimensional characters grow a third dimension. Mostly but not exclusively. The film is nicely shot, thoughtfully decorated and extremely well cast in the persons of Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. What ends up happening is one of these women warms his heart and the other breaks it. Clooney takes this character from being a superficial cliché'-spouting asswipe to becoming a vulnerable somewhat adrift middle aged man. It's a tour de force, ranking up there with his portrayal of Ulysses Everett McGill. In this case however he didn't have the Coen Brothers gifted bizarre adaptation of Homer to lift him.<br/><br/>This performance deserved the Oscar for Clooney."
"daryl42-1","8","0","2","19 May 2010"," Up In The Air is a good movie, but ultimately becomes weighed down the protagonist's family.
","8.4<br/><br/>I have always loved to be on the move. And I don't mean physically moving, like exercise. I mean changing my location, and making sure that my plans meet that requirement. I find it more interesting to be mobile like this, instead of working in just one place. I do not mind settling down for a while, but I need some novelty. I survive through novelty. I require either for me or my environment to be dynamic. And like I said, I'm not the most active person, physically. I like to sit down in a car, or even an airplane, look outside the window, and relax.<br/><br/>Up In The Air is a story about a man that lives the extreme of what I just described. He appears to have no family, no connections, no ties. Nothing to weigh him down, for his occupation requires him to be portable. He works for a company that other companies hire out and request for agents to come and fire or lay off their employees. He travels around the United States, terminating people from their jobs. He is the bearer of bad news, and nothing more than that.<br/><br/>Up In The Air starts off really good. Although the audience can't relate to the main character, they can find some rapport. Most everyone has been on an airplane before, possibly even for business reasons. Most everyone knows what it's like to be busy all of the time, always moving and doing. Usually, movies offer an exaggerated depiction of normal people. This is definitely true about the protagonist in Up In The Air.<br/><br/>I found the trailer and premise for Up In The Air to be very interesting. I was sure that this movie was going to be one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, this was not the case. While it does start off good, it soon ends up being anchored down by a side story of sorts. The main character's sister is getting married, and she has asked him to take pictures of a cardboard cut-out of her and her husband all over the country. We soon find out that this is because they can't afford a honeymoon. Not only is this weird, but it feels completely out of place with the rest of the film. And soon after, we are treated to a good chunk of the movie dealing directly with the marriage. Even though I feel that this is necessary for the story to continue, and the main character to develop, it is almost painstaking to watch. Why must we focus so much on these side characters in this side story? It is not what drove me to the film in the first place, and it ended up being what repelled me from the film in the end. It is interesting that the main character feels weighed down by his family and their lives, because it is exactly how I felt about it in regards to the film. Is this what the filmmakers were going for? Somehow, I doubt it.<br/><br/>Even though I see the movie as being completely lop-sided by this side story, it is definitely a very nice vessel. The scenes where the main character is firing people, usually just a montage of people's faces and their accompanying reactions, are powerful. You really get to look into these people's eyes and feel the emotion in the scenes. Contrasted by the other half of the protagonist's personality, is the scenes where he is in the airports, or in the airplanes. These scenes are also very entertaining, as he usually narrates what life is like for him on the run. Again, these scenes are directed and shot very well. They match the pacing that his life asks of him.<br/><br/>These are the scenes that make Up In The Air what it is. This is the meat of the movie, and it's sad to see that there is so much bone content here. I was really expecting that Up In The Air was going to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Sadly, it wasn't. However, I can't really judge the film for letting me down. I can be as honest as I can and say that the film is weighed down by the marriage side story, and the amount of time the filmmakers decided to spend on it. I did want the character to develop, but during the entire time I was watching these scenes I wanted him to kind of, you know... move along. Up In The Air is an entertaining movie, and there is definitely an audience for it, even though after a certain point, you might not want to settle down with it."

Flip over with his father, Jason Reitman is well-known in these recent years as a Director in thoughtful and enjoyable dramas like ""Thank You for Smoking"" (2005) and ""Juno"" (2007). The trio Cast members fill the characters properly. George Clooney once again shows his talent for one-man-show, Clooney is one of the Actors who could deliver such character with his aura. Vera Farmiga appears a little bit sexy, charming and lovable. It's a fantastic flirtatious appearance. Anna Kendricks emerges annoying but gets sympathy in the end. The unique story is about Ryan Bingham (Clooney), a frequent flyer who across many states. His job is to fire people by representing his boss who doesn't bold enough to do it himself. Maybe for many people, thiz is a life drama movie. But personally for me, thiz is a great romantic movie with most of the scenes contain tremendous chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga. It has been a long time, I didn't have such a feeling since ""Lost in Translation"" (2003). In the end, the movie convinces us that we need a partner in life.

","There are movies that deserve 10s and this one is on that list. Unique, funny and sad all wrapped up in a nice little travel package. A commentary on people and life seems to be what great movies possess and Up In The Air has those things. Though almost on the verge of a formula movie in the end, it manages to fly away from this glimmer of mediocrity to a deep sadness for the main character who accepts his decisions with wisps of kindness. From not quite as cocky of a person when the movie begins, to someone realizing their wrong assumptions and having to now live by those as time has passed him by. Clooney has forged himself into one of the great actors of the day with this movie and shows himself to possess an extraordinary amount of talent. He emits a charisma of proportion not found in any other actor today but manages it with a decorum.

"fwomp","10","0","3","12 April 2010"," A Story Well-Told
","Think you've got plenty of frequent flyer miles? Wait until you meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, BURN AFTER READING), a guy who flies almost nonstop. It's his job that gets him Up in the Air all the time. He travels around the States firing people as humanely as he can. Trouble is, though, is that this job makes him the most detached person alive. No family ties. Not married. No kids. Not even a real home anywhere. Ryan lives out of his carry-ons and knows how to move through airports like grease through a goose.<br/><br/>But things are about to change. His boss Craig (Jason Bateman, SMOKIN' ACES) just hired a hot-shot who's idea to tele-fire people remotely (via computer) has the potential to ground Ryan. But he's not giving up without a fight. This new up-and-comer named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has a few thins to learn. So Ryan takes her on the road with him to show her why firing face-to-face has its merits.<br/><br/>Paralleling Ryan is the female version of him; a woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga, THE DEPARTED) who so mirrors his sentiments that they seemed destined for one another. Sexual sparks fly but their jobs (and flights) keep them apart more often than not. Which initially seems fine for both of them.<br/><br/>As Ryan shows hot-shot Natalie the ropes of how-to and how-not-to fire someone, we learn that Natalie is more brittle than previously believed. A broken relationship with a boyfriend sends her reeling, much to the confusion of Ryan who's never had a serious relationship in his life. ""Everything I own can fit in this backpack. Even my relationships."" But as Ryan sees his job changing, he also sees his life moving in a different direction. He's headed for a three-way fulcrum. The first is that he might actually need someone. And as he begins to see that not everything fits so neatly into his backpack, his feelings for Alex change his views. The second is that he has a family member who's about to get married, and he finds that seeing a wedding and how people actually enjoy needing one another changes his outlook. And finally we get to his frequent flyer miles. He's about to hit a milestone that only a handful of other people have made it to. Millions upon millions of miles. And as the realization that he's collected all of these miles alone comes to him, he finds that maybe, just maybe, he needs to make a connection ...not a connecting flight but an actual human connection.<br/><br/>It is here that I have to end my summation of the movie and simply say that this isn't going to be some formulaic film where a person finds what they need and everyone lives happily ever after. Life just isn't that cleanly laid out. I applaud writer/director Jason Reitman for having the gumption to not take the road most traveled. Although I saw what was coming for Ryan after he decided to make a change, the impact of it astounded me. Clooney did a great job making us care for a man that we really shouldn't care for. We want to give him a shot at a normal life, but when that option is snatched away, we feel exactly the same way Ryan does: cheated. Even though he's been a complete butthead most of his life.<br/><br/>This is a story with no special effects. No tricks. And it pulls no punches. It's just a great story well-told. I loved it."

","This spring brake I rented ""Up in the Air"" from a local RedBox©. I herd about this movie from my High school film projects teacher. She was talking to my class about how George Cloony (aka Ryan Bigham) was made fun of on a late night TV show by being framed as a crude individual who fires people day-in, day-out and can manage to sleep at night. I just needed to see this movie for myself. It starts off with Mr. Bigham firing a man and told him that this was only phase 1 of finding new opportunities and yet there was an internal voice over saying ""I'll never see him again"". That right there got my perception on Mr. Bigham without a doubt. Mr. Bigham Hated his home in Omaha, Nebraska and would avoid coming home at any cost. I thought that him being so stubborn kind of made the movie what it is intended to be."

I'm the biggest Juno fan in the world, and while Up in the Air doesn't eclipse that particular favorite of mine, I still enjoyed it for many of the same reasons. The story is starkly modern, yet I think it will stand the test of time very well. It's melancholy (I do so love melancholy), occasionally uncomfortably honest, and it flows perfectly. Never a dull moment, no glaring flaws, and a cast that brings the best out of the characters. The music is a perfect companion to each scene, enhancing them while never becoming a distraction.

It's also one of the year's very best films and probably the year's wittiest comedy.<br/><br/>I love a little mindless escapism as much as the next guy, but sometimes I just want to see a movie where a couple of down-to-earth human beings sit around ad talk to each other in the wittiest ways possible. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, whose job is to travel around the United States of America to fire people. Since his boss (Jason Bateman) and the company he works for is, as he described it, too cowardly to do it themselves. He enjoys the life on the open road anyway, and he's already used to living his life on his suitcase (he gives speeches regarding the subject). But just when he is about to reach 10 billion Frequent Flyer miles, his life takes a turn. He meets a woman (Vera Farmiga) he might possibly like intimately and his company finds a possible way to fire people via internet and therefore grounding him on Omaha for good.<br/><br/>UP IN THE AIR is not just a another quirky comedy with a Capra-esquire premise and where the lead character is some guy whose been missing out on what's important in life, the characters here are real and relatable, and it's also a movie that is made at the right time where the issues and current events are still relevant. Released at the time America plummeted into economic recession, the issues in UP IN THE AIR are still hot and topical and the movie deals with it realistically instead of giving it the typical Hollywood dumbing-down. Reitman didn't just make a great film, he's made a great film on the right time.<br/><br/>After being the first Oscar favorite upon release, I wonder why it couldn't have won at least one of the six Oscars it was nominated for. A win for Best Adapted Screenplay would have been deserving. Reitman's script (co-written by Sheldon Turner; based on the novel by Walter Kirn) is loaded with wit as well as serious drama and some situations that feel like a reality slap. His movies, UP IN THE AIR among others, aren't just quirky comedies; they have this reality in them. Clooney gives one of his best performances (as is the talented Vera Farmiga, here at her spunkiest and most refreshing) while Anna Kendrick gives a career-making one as the newly-hired Natalie Keener. She's not in a lot of movies these days (she was in TWILIGHT), but after UP IN THE AIR, she's should expect a lot of them lining up. If JUNO acknowledged his presence in the movie-going public, his later films like UP IN THE AIR might just put his name on the map. Funny, quirky, but grounded in reality, UP IN THE AIR is another future minor classic alongside Reitman's successful ""little"" movie. By all means do not miss one of 2009 very best and smartest movies.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."
"duke_of_windsor71","8","0","2","31 March 2010"," Mayday! Mayday! Alpha Male Down!
","This is a very good movie. <br/><br/>George Clooney plays the opposite of a headhunter, named Ryan. He goes around firing people and is quite good at it. Being Clooney, he is handsome, centered, confident, and happy. He spends 250 days a year on the road and loves the isolation and is engaging in a quest for 10,000,000 air miles, which would make him the seventh person on the planet to do. ""There have been more men on the Moon,"" he exults. <br/><br/>However, all is not well in Clooneyworld. For readers of Syd Field, this would be called Arc of Transformation. For people who don't need to spend $100K on film school, we call it emasculation.<br/><br/>First, Ryan is going to be taken off the road thanks to a precocious Cornell gamine named Natalie, who comes up with the bold proposal of using IT lines to fire people from cubicles. Ryan is aghast, and probably worried about the potential for losing his air-miles dream, and manages to take Natalie on the road so she can learn, in film parlance, a Valuable Lesson: firing is a most personal pas de deux and cannot be accomplished via the Web. This is contrary to Clooney's political views as Ryan's carbon footprint must be equivalent to the methane production of India.<br/><br/>Ryan meets Alex, who is the female version of Ryan. She tells him to ""think of me as you, but with a vagina"". And he engages in coitus with her and all is well.<br/><br/>Or is it?<br/><br/>The Pussification of Ryan really begins when he schtups Alex and begins to fall a little for her. When Natalie meets her and Ryan trumps up a good time for them, Natalie deals with her psychic pain by getting drunk and having casual sex. Meanwhile, Ryan is falling more and more for the Alpha Female Alex.<br/><br/>He makes the catastrophic error of attending his sister's wedding when guilt-tripped by a shrew of a sister who says he is needed. Then, to compound the error, he brings Alex. He manages to salvage the wedding when the groom gets cold feet. He is all over Alex and, of course, in the calm, mid-Western setting of northern Wisconsin, realized that all along he wants someone to come home to. And this someone is Alex.<br/><br/>He returns to his empty apartment and realizes, ""Dang it, I love the Alex and I want to throw away my perfectly happy life to do it."" This is a well-composed scene and reminds me of the time Rock Hudson exclaims in Pillow Talk, ""Why does a man ruin himself? Because he thinks he's gonna get married.""<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER (for those of you with an IQ below 80):<br/><br/>He flies to Chicago to sweep Alex off her feet and propose a lifetime of Alpha Dog lovin' only to discover... gasp! she is married and has a family.<br/><br/>Clooney's acting here is excellent. He does puppy-dog eyes as well as that cat in Shrek 2. And director Reitman goes so far as to rip-off Magritte in the following scene at the airport, sans bowler. <br/><br/>Now completely emasculated and probably reading I'm OK, You're OK, thankfully he does not cry, he further sabotages his life when he walks off the stage during a paid lecture, crippling his earning potential. I'd imagine the sequel will be about his trying to gentrify a barn and making it a shelter for abandoned pot-bellied pigs. <br/><br/>And just to make sure his manhood is stored somewhere in a vault at Brown University, he reaches his 10,000,000th mile and does not enjoy it, even when Sam Elliot (SAM ELLIOT, people!) sits down for a chat with him. Is there anyone more avuncular? Anyone who is less difficult with whom to engage in conversation? But, no, Ryan is just too doggone Alan Alda'd to enjoy his victory.<br/><br/>Considering how Clooneyites despise traditional marriage except as it applies to alternative lifestyles, you'd think that the movie would praise Clooney's isolationist choice. But no, he was too Alpha Male and had to be put down. <br/><br/>The movie itself is well-written, acted, and directed. Notice the little things: how the cities are introduced with aerial shots. Notice how Natalie is disgusted with her job in the scene where she has to tackle a list of firings. The scene is done without dialogue. Reitman, for such a young whippersnapper, has a good grasp on the mechanics of cinema. There are many scenes where character is revealed visually. Clooney letting go of his suitcase in the airport when he realizes he wants the hand, awwww, of Alex. And the life-on-the-road is well-presented.<br/><br/>I remember Anna Kendrick in a little hoot of a movie called Camp. She played an Eve Harrington-type which is repeated and then spun upon its head here. Clooney is always good and, despite the role he took here, probably one of a handful of real men left in Hollywood who is a star (Tom Cruise, c'mon). I don't know who this Vera Farmiga is, but this kid's got a future. She has acted in movies I have seen, but I never noticed her. Sorry, Vera. Take solace in your Oscar nomination (Oscar is a trademark of the AMPAS). <br/><br/>This is a very well-done film and I enjoyed it immensely even as I was covering my eyes watching a perfectly good man get crushed again by the adoption of sentiment.<br/><br/>Just once, once, can't he just stay happy and the world around him is at fault?"

","This movie is not about romance. <br/><br/>It's not so much about the entire story line, and how the plots and subplots weave together to form the ending.<br/><br/>Rather, i think it's about the message that the director wants to send. I think in a certain sense, it reflects the way of thinking of today's younger generation, the sad facts of life in today's world. <br/><br/>George and Vera represent the cynical executives today. Yet in much sense, their cynicism is back by the harsh realities of life.. the high divorce rates, the unhappy marriages. When the two talk to Anna together in 1 scene, i thought the characters really show that they were once like Anna too, except the years of experience have shown them that Anna's just a classic e.g of the naive fresh grad.<br/><br/>Then we have George who wishes to stay free from commitment. Today, don't we have lots of people like that too? They stay away from families, friends, with the goal of freedom and a comfortable solitary life. By at the heart of it, there's always this inclination to remain connected, especially after the years have gone by. You can see George's dilemma - that on one hand, he wants his free life, yet on the other, he wants to be mean something to his sister.<br/><br/>I think to really understand this movie, one got to go beyond what's on screen, to the social thinking and philosophy of today's modern society."

","UP IN THE AIR comes with a breeze of fresh air. It tells a story about a guy that basically lives on the airplanes travelling around the US and telling people they're fired. No relations, no settlement. But two things change in his life. One - he gets a young girl to train for the work and he meets a woman who seems to have a similar life, he does. It's an intelligent, original and fresh (finally!)

"michaelRokeefe","9","0","3","18 March 2010"," The harder facts of life. Great movie.
","This film from director Jason Reitman lives up to all its ballyhoo. Talk about taking a bad situation and making it sound good. Ryan Bingham(George Clooney)has been making more than a decent living as a high end hatchet man. When a company is ready to down size, Bingham is sent out to 'chop heads'. He is a brilliant motivational speaker and the silver tongued charmer easily convinces workers getting the pink slip that their life is not over...just at the doorstep of an other fulfilling opportunity.<br/><br/>Bingham is constantly in the air crisscrossing the country, staying in the best hotels, wearing the best clothes and not having any kind of normal life doesn't bother him in the least. Ryan strikes up a conversation with another traveler...a very nice looking Alex Goran(Vera Farmiga), who also racks up the air miles in her job. Their schedules allow them to meet every so often and there is the beginning of a special relationship.<br/><br/>Back at the home office, Bingham finds out his own employer(Jason Bateman) is wanting to change the policies of having his hatchet men traveling so much. A young twenty-something, fast rising and highly motivated Natalie Keener(Anna Kendrick)presents a novel idea of conducting the interviews via webcams. Bryan is given enough time to take Natalie on a few trips to see if she really has the 'chops' to fire someone.<br/><br/>A very interesting story with impressing locales and quick-witted dialog.

","George Clooney gives the performance of his career. Stepping aside from smooth, suave characters he always portrays, he delivers a much more down-to-earth and very believable, and very human, performance as Ryan Bingham. The supporting cast, particularly Oscar nominees Vera Farminga and Twilight's Anna Kendrick, provide superb back-up and contribute to making this movie such a pleasurable experience very nicely indeed. Jason Reitman does a superb job behind the camera and brings this movie the class and attitudes it needs. The characters are very engaging and you do sympathise with Clooney's Bingham from all the loneliness he goes through. Without a doubt, this is best movie of the year, and most likely will be for the rest of the year."

","George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, the number one road man for a company that specializes in firing people. The people don't work for his company, but his company is hired to fire them and then spend 6 to 12 months to help them re-direct their careers. (Some of the characters seen being fired are not actors, instead they are people who really had been fired recently.)<br/><br/>Ryan is happy with his life. His 'home' is the airplane, the hotel, the constant traveling. When he shows up, yet again, the staff knows him by name. He has a goal, he hesitates to tell about it, to reach 10 Million traveler miles. Not that he wants to go anywhere else, he just wants the satisfaction of achieving that milestone. He would become only the 7th person to do so, and his name would be added to the side of a plane.<br/><br/>He was happy, but his life had no substance. It was all fluff, even though he was very good at his job, actually being able to make fired employees feel good about the situation. He gave seminars on ""how full is your backpack"", urging attendants to get rid of unnecessary things and relationships to walk easier through life. <br/><br/>But he does have one vice, a girlfriend road warrior whom he meets periodically. Vera Farmiga is that girlfriend, Alex Goran.<br/><br/>All that sets up the main of the movie, where a young new MBA, Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, joins the company and convinces the boss that they can save lots of time and travel expense by using video conferencing to fire people, no need to do it face-to-face. <br/><br/>Jason Bateman is the boss, Craig Gregory. <br/><br/>There are a few other side stories involving Ryan's sisters and one of their weddings, but the meat of the story is Ryan, how he eventually realizes that his life is very empty, and even if he can convince his boss that they need to travel, his life will still be empty. <br/><br/>Good movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: At some point, while dealing with the new girl and some fired employee issues, he starts to realize the emptiness of his life.

"dvc5159","7","0","2","10 March 2010"," One of the decade's best movies.
","George Clooney unlocks himself here as a versatile actor, not afraid of showing his age, and becoming afraid of it. Here we see him as a man who lives life to the fullest, all alone and isolated from his close ones and society, in order to get a seemingly meaningless goal as he drifts along life. His job is to fire people throughout the country and it's VERY personal. On the other hand, we see the people that he fires, full of anger and sorrow. What will they tell their family? How are they gonna survive for tomorrow?<br/><br/>Rather than forcing us to accept the truth, ""Up In The Air"" shows us both sides without choosing any and allows us to make our own choice. Director Jason Reitman directs this film with a subtle edge that gives the film a sort of steady pace, not frenetic but not too slow either. Add to that a sexually charged performance by Vera Farmiga and a very lively/cute and sensitive performance by Anna Kendrick (hope she gets a better agent after this, she's WAY more talented to be starring in tween-crap like ""Twilight""). Add to that some memorable appearances by Jason Bateman, Zach Galifianakis and J. K. Simmons, you've got yourself a near-flawless dramedy.<br/><br/>What makes ""Up In The Air"" works is how relevant it is to society today. It's hard economic times like these that we understand the characters on the movie, we feel for them, but as the movie points out, life goes on. And the ones who are suffering will be comforted by their families back home. That one point really brought home the movie for me.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9/10"

","While not the best picture of the year, UP IN THE AIR deserved its nomination. Good writing, directing and acting all around. Would have liked to have seen the Vera character more fleshed out as to :SPOILER ALERT: why she carried on with Ryan as she did and looked like she wanted to be with him in a long standing serious relationship, all the while being MARRIED yet. It was like she had a split personality. If she was that unhappy in her marriage, although it's never acknowledged, why didn't she just leave the marriage? To carry on like a slut all over the place, being a mother yet, just didn't make sense. How she managed to be away so much with the Ryan character, do her job and have a home life is beyond reality. Other than that, a very enjoyable movie with an interesting story line. George Clooney was at his best and young Anna Kendrick just about stole the movie. All in all a worthwhile rental.

","Up in the Air is a romantic comedy at the core, and I'm the first guy to pass off a movie just because of this fact, but there is much more to this beautiful film. There are subtle comedic elements and in my opinion, very strong dramatic moments. All of the roles in this movie were very well played, including, if not especially, the characters who received one or two minutes of screen time. The plot is somewhat predictable but the dialog and story make up for this slight flaw. Romance between Ryan and Alex is complex, depressing, and at times quite beautiful. George Clooney makes Ryan Bingham radiate with loneliness and his performance hit me right in the gut, as though I was staring at the dark side of my reflection. Though Up in the Air may seem like Hollywood crap, due to the overproduced looking cinematography and the romantic comedy feel, it is anything but. Please, go rent this movie, you'll be doing yourself a HUGE favor."

","""Up in the Air"" (2009) <br/><br/>Directed By: Jason Reitman <br/><br/>Starring: George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, & Danny McBride <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for language and some sexual content) <br/><br/>Like George Clooney's Ryan Bingham, I love airports. There is something fascinating about seeing hundreds of people, all with a unique destination, come together in one place before branching out in infinite different directions. Watching ""Up in the Air"" is similar to visiting an airport. The characters meet, interact, and then depart for the rest of their lives. It is not surprising that, in such a character-driven movie, its performances must be flawless for it to be effective. Indeed, George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick are rather remarkable in their respective roles. Following a termination facilitator (Clooney) as he tries to educate a young hotshot (Kendrick) on his much-maligned business while trying to obtain ten million frequent flier miles, ""Up in the Air"" is a wry, funny, and moving portrait of life on the road. The always-dependable Jason Reitman delivers yet another movie that is subtle in its execution, yet special in its outcome, proving once again that he has his hand firmly planted on the brain of corporate America and on the heart of the people within it. It is especially compelling to note that many of the people that Ryan fires, excluding a few well-placed actors like J.K. Simmons and Zach Galifianakis, are actual victims of widespread corporate lay-offs. ""Up in the Air"" achieves greatness not just by showing their distressed faces as they contemplate their uncertain futures, but by also showing the people on the other side of the desks as human beings who, in the end, are facing lives that are just as uncertain.<br/><br/>9/10"
"east-emerald","9","0","2","13 March 2010"," George Clooney can even make getting fired sexy
","Sometimes I just know from the first trailer that I am going to love a movie and this was the case with ""Up in the Air"". George Clooney in the guise of Ryan Bingham plays my favorite type of movie character - he is jaded, disconnected and likes it that way. He travels constantly and has it down to a science; so much so that I would say he is a airport screener's wet dream. His job is to travel around the country and fire people for upper and middle management types who can only be described as spineless. Sound depressing? It's not for him. He dreads spending time at home and has become a legend at the art of firing people. He gives his victims a short speech about how life has handed them an opportunity to follow their dreams, pats them on the head and sends them on the way. We are given a brilliant montage of reaction shots with the actors looking directly in the camera. My favorite is who I will call the ""fuck you"" lady who deserves some sort of Oscar. In his defense thought, you do feel that Ryan is not just spouting Oprah pop psychology and really believes the ""follow your dreams"" speech.<br/><br/>Since we meet him at the height of his game, we know he is in for a fall. This comes in the form of two women who in my opinion steal the movie. The first is Natalie (Anna Kendrick who is totally wasted in Twilight by the way) who threatens to ground Clooney by having possibly the worst idea in corporate history - cut down on travel costs and fire people via I- Chat. The second is Alex ( Vera Farmiga) a woman Ryan meets in a hotel lounge. In one of my favorite scenes the two flirt in the language of two people who spend too much time on the road. In some very witty dialogue they turn frequent flyer mile perks into near sexual fetish and share war stories about joining the mile high club. Alex tells Ryan very early on to think of her as ""him but with a vagina"" and by the end of the movie, trust me, you will believe her. I guess I gave my opinion away to early but I did really enjoy this movie from beginning to end.<br/><br/>One warning though, be very afraid if you are ever called into an office at work and sit down in front of a computer to see a smiling, oh so sincere, ""Clooney""esque face looking back."

","I was impressed with Anna Kendrick's display of emotions and sense of identification with the character of an ambitious, workaholic, young business counselor who is trying to demonstrate her new proposed methods to fire people in a specialized company of labor contract's terminations. And the professional and emotional confrontation with the experienced field man who doesn't agree with her ideas but who will have to teach her if he wants to remain in his position and not end on ""the other side of the desk"". The opposed perspectives to life and values from both characters enriches the story with delightful dialogs and situations.<br/><br/>George Clooney evolves from his ever-played role of successful- rich guy, providing this time a thoughtful performance that reminds me in a way, the sadness expressed by actor Will Smith in the 'Seven Pounds' drama from some time ago. You can feel the emptiness of his existence when he smiles to acknowledge his fortunate up-in-the-air life which has also caused the coldness from his closest family members. Also memorable are the scenes of disappointment after finding out the status of his new like-alike lover or the conversation he had with his soon to be brother in law.<br/><br/>As per Vera Farmiga's adaptation to a similar character of the one played by Clooney, we have to agree on the fact that the acting is the most valuable part of this film along with the originality and prevalence of the topic. Not only fixes well under the current economics' circumstances but delivers a positive message as well, where the attitude towards negative events can help us to find out ways to overcome and strengthen our weaknesses. There were some less interesting shoots and maybe the script concluded a little way too loose from the original point of start, but seeing the complete work, we must admit that was good movie material treated masterfully by its crew."

","Career vs. Family, or Freedom vs. Bonding. These dichotomies has been very popular so long as a theme of films, novels and so on.<br/><br/>Why are they so popular? A cynicism about successful people, or a consolation for them (because sacrifice sometimes looks beautiful)?<br/><br/>Unfortunately (or fortunately) I've been off the track of climbing a successful career ladder, my point of view has a bit distance from the characters in the film. I feel I want to be a Ryan unconsciously, but I cannot. Therefore, I can easily understand this film as a kind of cynicism.<br/><br/>What I felt mainly, however, is the complexity of human life, and humans themselves. Any lifestyle can be justified by some logic, but there is always lack of something, any choice is trade-off. The dichotomies mentioned above might be a good way to show the complexity and suggest the possibility of embracing both of them, that might be why they are very popular theme in the modern society.<br/><br/>http://creativatorblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/up-in-air.html"

","UP IN THE AIR Jason Reitman , the director of Juno and Thank You for Smoking is back, with a bang. Up in the Air is definitely one of the best movies of the year. In a line, the movie talks about the protagonists' emotional transformation in our 'disconnected' society.<br/><br/>George Clooney, in one word is spectacular. He plays the role of Ryan Bingham, who fires people for a living. He is also a motivational speaker, who talks people out of relationships, who doesn't buy the whole idea of relationships and marriages. He travels 322 days a year and his life is basically, ""Up in the air"". Vera Flaminga is his soul-mate , who happens to meet him , given the two being frequent flyers. She does a brilliant job. The movie is about, what happens to their lives. Might sound simple, but trust me, it is so unpredictable. After he meets his soul-mate he wonders if it's time to give up what he believes. Right when everything is perfect and he is ready to make the connection, he discovers that it is not to be. In the end, he is overcome with disappointment, which leaves the viewer startled.<br/><br/>Also noteworthy is Anna Kendrick's role as Natalie Keener.The screenplay is so brilliant, it just takes your breath away. Importantly, it is funny and takes an ambiguous view of Ryan Bingham's feelings and emotions. I was told the movie is based on a novel by Walter Kirn. The movie scores in all the departments. With flawless screenplay, acting, direction, cinematography, the movie is definitely up and running for the Oscars. One of George Clooney's and Jason Reitman's finest.<br/><br/>My Rating:4.5 on 5 . A definite watch."
"Christian_Dimartino","10","0","3","6 March 2010"," An amazing movie.
","George Clooney stars as a man with a good life, but it turns out kind of bad in Up in the air, a truly terrific, and hilarious dramedy which is more comedy than drama. It may have more laughs then dramatic moments, but this is real comedy. It's a real movie. It shows you that times are hard, and that it's hard firing somebody.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman has only directed three films. His first film, Thank you for smoking, was kind of boring. I actually fell asleep through it. His second movie, Juno, was terrific. But Reitman's third film Up in the air is a home run. He really knocks the adaptation of Walter Kirn's novel into a masterpiece which is one of my favorite films of the year.<br/><br/>Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a guy who has an easy life. His job is to travel around the world and fire people. But as you see, it's not that easy. Making people go on unemployment and feel responsible for living on the street. But Ryan's easy life changes when a young woman(played by the terrific newcomer Anna Kendrick)tries to replace him. But as they travel together they get to know each other and she knows that it's hard firing people too.<br/><br/>Ryan's job is nice. He gets to travel around the world, stay at four star hotels, stay at four star restaurants, and sleep with women, including Alex(played by the always great Vera Farmiga)who he falls for. But as Ryan soon finds out, this job is causing a loss in respect from his family. And other people.<br/><br/>Juno was a terrific movie. This one may even be better. I loved both films though. I love Jason Reitman's humor. The performances given by Clooney, Kendrick, and Farmiga are all terrific. I was very surprised by Anna Kendrick. I mean she goes from a lackluster film like Twilight to a terrific film like Up in the air. Up in the air is a hilarious, moving, and tragic dramedy that I will certainly root for at The Oscars tomorrow.<br/><br/>Up in the air: A"
"DICK STEEL","10","0","5","5 March 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Up in the Air
","Once in a long while comes a film that you'll tremendously enjoy because it engages on many levels through an extremely smart story, with wonderfully designed characters, and themes that you can easily identify with straightaway. Jason Reitman seems to be on a roll here, with Juno and Thank You For Smoking being great films that I've come to enjoy (particularly the satirical latter) and he delivers yet again with Up in the Sky.<br/><br/>From time to time I dwell on the what-ifs of having being told to walk. Given the jittery economic climate the last few years, anything's really possible, and yes I've got to admit I've got a plan B set up, a dream that would be put into execution in the event I'm sitting across someone who's reading me the marching orders. Then again, why wait for something to happen before pursuing what one really wants to do? I guess it's what they call it as the comfort zone.<br/><br/>George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a man with an interesting job yet one which most people loathe - telling people that they're given the pink slips, and essentially that they're considered surplus and no longer required by their companies. He's a corporate down-sizer for hire, where companies with pussy managers hire his company's expertise, to do the marching orders on their behalf. Which means his type gets to travel frequently to where they are required, and in which case chalk up frequent flier miles by the thousands. In my opinion, not the bad job scope given being on the road most of the time (those who hate to live out of the suitcase need not apply), though one that has to come with plenty of EQ and sensitivity, since you're the harbinger of bad news, and have to face the brunt of mostly surprised employees being told their worthless.<br/><br/>Which of course through the years Ryan would have formulated his game strategy to deliver the message softly, sugar-coating it all, and as an occupational hazard develops this fetish for plastic cards for convenience, miles and a major one being unable to hold down a stable relationship because of his nature of not always being around friends and family. And I actually share his attitude towards expectations that stem from relationships, preferring to be winging it alone rather than to surrender that sense of freedom, although time and again one might just feel the need to belong to somebody else. But of course we're not identifying with Ryan just because of his single status, but also because of the comical, quirky mantras he lives by in his jet setting career, offering some keen insights to the very rote manner in which he travels from plane to hotel and back again.<br/><br/>Things are set for some change when his boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) gets smitten by some textbook cost cutting measures (which manager wouldn't?) presented by Ivy Leaguer Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), and hires her to execute her plan, involving the use of technology to remotely fire someone on the other end of the webcam. Of course this means the total disruption to Ryan's comfortable lifestyle, with a hint that it'll make them all redundant in due course, when the need for face to face interaction ceases, in what would be a totally impersonal, not to mention the lack of moral decency and respect for the staff one is about to let go.<br/><br/>But because with any technological plans come the need to understand the process and the business in which technology will be employed, so Natalie gets attached to Ryan since she has zero real world experience being fresh out of college and all, and in showing her the ropes come more opportunity for comedy, as well as to dig deeper into the characterization. The best scenes of course come from their interaction, and the three way conversation that they have with Ryan's new found fleeting girlfriend, Alex (Vera Farmiga). when they touch upon the decisions one makes on relationships, whether it be willing to commit, or prefer to be free from the shackles of relationships and emotional routine.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film talks about the moral courage for changes to be made in one's life. We all get complacent in our zones of comfort, and can become quite the creature of habit, seeking solace in routine and things we're familiar with. Branching out isn't easy and comes with innate fear which we must overcome, sort of like the backpack motivational talks Ryan gives, where we tend to pile our life with so much junk that it's always hard to let go of things, to lighten our load, and find new meaning and adventure. And on the relationship front, one character finds himself falling into a relationship, while another finds herself getting out of one but not by choice, offering a nice little opposing parallel when put side by side.<br/><br/>Up in the Air deserves every single accolade that it has won thus far, and surely this flies up into my initial shortlist of favourite films of the year. No prizes for guessing which movie I'm rooting for in this season's Oscar race for Best Adapted Screenplay for its incredibly well crafted story. Highly recommended, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you miss this on the big screen!"

","Up in the Air is a timely story about the frontline, corporate downsizers who terminate workers across the country. It's an unpleasant job with emotional backlash, and George Clooney's performance as a top gun terminator is exemplary. Abetted by assured direction by Jason Reitman (Juno), this is a film for our times.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is very good at what he does, and he has the mileage to prove it. You see, corporations hire him to fly across the country to fire their employees. So good is Bingham that he has a perfect response for every possible reaction or objection. It is an art, and he has honed his skills over the years while living an insulated life of perks and frequent flier miles without any emotional attachments or long term plans for the future. He is even distant from his family. He has his routine down and lectures as a motivational speaker. Ah, what a life.<br/><br/>During a layover, he meets another frequent flyer, Alex (Vera Farmiga), who, like him, jets cross country and lives on her corporate credit cards and comps. So begins their jet setting affair and multi-city rendezvous. When Ryan's employer decides to streamline expenses, a new hired gun, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), brings big changes including cutting down travel expenses and relying more on a telemarketer setup to conduct the corporate firings. This is a direct threat to Ryan's lifestyle and he proposes to show her the ropes and what it is like to personally fire someone. It is a sobering, learning experience for Natalie as Ryan mentors her and espouses his words of wisdom and his hands on approach compared to her more empirical, scientific methods. It becomes apparent that they have differing values and philosophies on life. When Natalie tries to do a firing, it becomes a game changing event with severe ramifications for all. She is the young, wide eyed idealist, who learns about life the hard way. <br/><br/>At the same time, Ryan's sister calls about a wedding that he is reluctant to attend. While most people go home for the holidays, he feels the opposite. He grudgingly takes pictures of cardboard replicas of his sister and fiancé in his travels since they can't afford the trips. He even uses his powers of persuasion on his sister's fiancé who has second thoughts about marriage. It is in this moment that Ryan has an epiphany and learns about himself and what's important in life. As Ryan begins to have feelings for Alex and sets about to make his future, he discovers some startling, harsh truths that will alter his outlook on life forever. <br/><br/>Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, Reitman has created a smart, engaging film whose subject of corporate firings amid an economic downturn is quite timely. It is those scenes that are fascinating as they are heartbreaking, and Clooney's Ryan is a master at finessing verbal interplay. This film puts faces and souls on the nameless whose lives are destroyed. A scene where a fired employee (J. K. Simmons is excellent) is inspired by Ryan to try something else is masterfully written.<br/><br/>Clooney's Ryan is a distant cousin of sorts to his recent standout job in Michael Clayton. Rarely has he been more charming! His character lives in airport terminals and judges his success by his independence and frequent flyer miles. When Natalie, Alex and his own family converge on his life, we see him change, and that is what makes the film so special. To see someone whose outlook on life is changed forever is a rewarding, enriching feeling. When Ryan and Alex talk about life from their experiences, it is in stark contrast to the neophyte Natalie. What is refreshing is to see how Ryan becomes genuinely affected and how in the end he does the right things to correct an injustice. <br/><br/>Farmiga (The Departed) registers strongly as the mysterious lover, and Kendrick (Twilight) shines as the naïve Natalie. Jason Bateman (Juno) re-ups with Reitman and scores as a corporate manager. A note of interest is that many of the fired workers are played by actual, laid off employees so that their scenes do take on a sense of immediacy and realism. <br/><br/>This is one of those films that makes all the best lists of the year because it's smartly written, well acted, and leaves you with that aftertaste of time well spent."

","""Up in the Air""<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham is a 40 something with not a thing to tie him down, except his job and the travel that comes with it that he loves sooo much. It's a pretty cool job, when companies need to downsize a workforce, they hire Bingham's company led by Owner Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) to come in and fire people.<br/><br/>Clooney's Bingham has the whole traveling thing down to a fine art- even the line to get into for the least amount of wait time( follow the Asians). Accumulating mass amounts of frequent flier miles( he's trying to get to 10mil, only 6 other people have done it) reward points and women that are into that type~ Namely, Alex (Vera Farmiga, loved her in the Departed). Who is also a frequent flier type. After a extensive comparison of their rewards cards and a few cocktails later, Alex finds herself burrito'd in the couch cushion. They seem quite content with their new relationship, only to part ways until the flight patterns cross again.<br/><br/>Bingham is called back to the home office in Omaha for a new announcement of budget cuts. The new direction of the company led by Natalie (Anna Kendrick) to fire people via live web cam chat. Cutting travel expenses for the company by 85%. Ryan, not happy about his oh so precious traveling lifestyle being slammed to a screeching halt professes to Craig(Bateman) that the new plan could never work due to the personality of the job nature. He is accorded a final hurah to show Natalie how it was meant to be done, thing is, Natalie has to go along for the ride.<br/><br/>Along their journey Bingham's life that should have been comes in to the picture, via his sister Kara Bingham ( Amy Morton) and the ever continuing drama that is Alex.<br/><br/>The Direction that is this movie captained by Jason Reitman is magnificent, he constructs the onion that is Ryan Bingham, then starts to masterfully uncover the layers of love, family, humanity and potential change that make Clooney's Bingham is a character that you really begin to feel for. Reitman's work is near flawless. Clooney, Harmiga and Kendrick are talent incarnate.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't want to see this film, my wife asked me to take her and I can truly say that I loved it. I expected droll and gray and got exactly that and much more.<br/><br/>BruceVain"
"jian-shanshan","9","0","2","1 March 2010"," A very subtle movie and the deleted scenes made it a truly Oscar winning level movie
","I watched it in cinema and felt like this has one of the greatest screenplays for years, and the performance of the characters are brilliant. The only thing though is that I felt the movie is not completed and there is something missing, not at the ending, but rather something in the process. But that was the feeling before I watched the Bluray version with the deleted scenes, especially the last two sequences. They actually push the movie to something fantastic, and make the story whole and quite arty. The whole story took place in the troubled time, and everything around was casted in a grey sad colour. But at the end it was"" family"" support, warm, comfort and encourage everybody to get through. But what did Ryan get from all these experience or anything changed to his philosophy and his life? How Nat dealt with the suicide case, would she be in law pursuit trouble? The answer seems to be there, but the movie just did say enough leaving the characters less fullness. The two deleted scenes gave me complete satisfaction on everything. Their running times are every long and in HD quality, well edited. It seems it's just because they need to fit the movie to the cinema rules, so they have to cut the two deleted scenes down, and I'm sure in later DVD and Bluray, there will be the director's extended cut to show the movie as it should be. If you like this movie, make sure you get to watch those deleted scenes, you will be surprised!"
"petervee","8","0","2","1 March 2010"," A very good movie and a parallel universe to me
","After getting enough encouragement from facebook friends to go see this movie, I finally made it and was pleased to have done so.<br/><br/>This movie is close to my heart and life. I fly often. Not 350,000 miles as Ryan (played so convincingly by George Clooney), but about 200,000 miles per year. In 2009 I flew 159 times. I was on the road for almost 300 days. I do consider airports my places, have learned how to go through security (and yes I do follow people that have very little hand luggage), have learned how to get miles from everything (although I would never sit down and exchange loyalty cards with anyone because, what's the point) and how to live, an at times, pretty lonely existence.<br/><br/>The fact the Ryan meets a lovely woman with similar life at an airport is interesting, although many women I meet flying certainly do not have kids and if they did, would not fly as much as she does. It is a life choice.<br/><br/>George plays the role very well, although you would think that after getting #7, he would give up his airline seat, instead visiting airports where he can go see his ""Ryan"" labeled airplane. The film of course finishes in a way that there will be Up In the Air 2 coming soon in a theater near you. Maybe this is the plan.<br/><br/>I don't give this film a 10 because: Would a company really sent a 25 year old to fire people? Would people that have worked at a company all their lives really accept to lose their jobs by such a young person? And is it morally acceptable to use video conferencing to do such a life changing event? Or we just accept this movie as, well a movie.<br/><br/>And finally is there a need for so much endorsements in this movie? Do we need to push Hilton, American Airlines, Hertz and every other company mentioned. Or future movies will become infomercials. Or maybe this movie could not be made without names, any names. <br/><br/>Yes, this is a good movie and recommended to anyone who lives Up in the Air. Just like me."

","Don't get me wrong, I love George Clooney. It was refreshing to see him in this role. He is basically a man who company's hire to fire people. During most of the movie he flys from town to town with this girl and tries to show her THE ROPES. There is a great scene toward THE END with Sam Elliot where he is some kind of CAPTAIN. It was a strange scene because GEORGE reached 10 million miles. As a reward, the captain of the airplane left the COCKPIT and sat down next to George. That CAPTAIN was played by SAM. He had a huge mustache and the conversation he was making with GEORGE seemed strange and forced. It was very strange to see him. In fact, he looked like he was made out of plastic. The rest of the movie was good and the fact that George Clooney didn't try and act tough or funny was a nice touch."

While some say he's that ""cool guy"" in every movie, he seems to be able to mold a character on to his personality very well.<br/><br/>Supporting actress Anna Kendrick shines bright in this movie, she does an amazing job in her role as Ryan's sidekick. This girl is gonna go places.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman does a fine job with his directing, it was fluid and clear between scenes.<br/><br/>My only gripe is the final act, it suddenly became a ""romantic comedy"" ending and while it was done well, I was expecting a somewhat different outcome or a different way in handling the ending."

","Jason Reitmen creates History in 'Up In The Air', if this doesn't make up in the 'All-Time Best Of Hollywood', than I am ashamed to be a Cinema Fan. <br/><br/>An adaptation of the 2001 novel by the same name, by Walter Kim, Reitmen and fellow- writer Sheldon Turners adapt it like wow! 'Up In The Air' is a film I enjoyed and as a die-hard Cinema-Fan, I am more than happy. It's a simple story told in the neatest manner ever! A film where words like 'Hiccups' or 'Minuses' don't exist. An Outstandingly Outstanding Film in all respects!<br/><br/>Reitmen's direction is as good as it can be. He's a genius & his legendary body of work proves that. He's amongst the Best Storytellers today. Cinematography by Eric Steelburg is excellent. The music is amazing, 'Help Yourself' is an enlightening song!<br/><br/>Acting wise, George Clooney is fantastic as Ryan Bingham. Playing a off-beat character with rare ease and understanding. Clooney is one of the few Star-Actors of Hollywood. Vera Farmiga is fabulous as usual. She's so so natural in all her films, she'll surely win an Academy Award soon. Anna Kendrick springs a surprise, she's flawless. Watch her in the sequence when starts to sob in a hotel reception, it's exemplary. Jason Bateman is good. Zach Galifianakis is mind-blowing in a cameo appearance. Sam Elliot does his usual bit in a that lone scene he gets.

","The makers of Juno give to us another great experience. Even though many told me that this is a boring film I watched it and trust me I was really glad I did. To begin with the acting was great, George Clooney totally fits into the role as in many aspects he is just himself, until the last parts of the movie were thanks to the newbie in the company Nataly he sees life from a different point of view, Vera Farmiga is excellent as Alex, makes many women sympathize with her and makes many of us men to think why the hell do we act like this towards women that adore us? This occurs for almost all the movie as we see a woman in love with Ryan, a woman that wants to have family and she is willing to give everything to her other half however in the end this image is surprisingly crashed as both viewers and Ryan find out who she really is. A brilliant movie that talks about the realities not only of love but of life in general, every person can link himself to one of the characters, to people getting fired by someone the have never seen because there boss doesn't have the courage to announce them that there life is ruined, people like Nataly who are ambitious however at the end they can't handle it as they see people getting hurt because of them. A must see movie and hopefully a definite Oscar winner."
"ncoviell","10","0","5","19 February 2010"," Brilliant in all aspects
","A movie that completely avoids the clichés and is forcefully anchored by its three lead performances. Clooney is at the top of his game (although I don't think his performance outdoes his role as Michael Clayton), Vera Farmiga also gives a very valiant performance; however, I think the shining star was Anna Kendrick. Often, the physical form of acting is overlooked and that's where Kendrick truly hangs with her co-stars. When her character is finally put one-on-one via web cam with the 57-year old man...her body acting/expressions/overall visage is simply flawless and she was just a joy to watch on-screen. Clooney also masters the physical aspect of acting as his dance scenes are hilarious, his emotional scenes are perfect (i.e. his verge of tears look before the wedding and on the subway), and added together with his typical witty, rather sarcastic charm and he easily wins over the audience. Jason Reitman is top 10, probably Top 5 director. Thank You For Smoking is great, Juno was fantastic and Up in the Air is close to a masterpiece. The writing is very strong and the storyline is perfectly put together. I don't know if Reitman has his own personal casting director...but his casts are always selected beautifully. Who knew Danny McBride would be right for that role? Speaking of sort appearances...my favorite scene is by far the one with J.K. Simmons. Perfectly written, perfectly put-together, perfectly acted. Loved the movie."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","2","18 February 2010"," Difficult to categorize; easy to admire
","This is not an easy film to categorize - which is a good thing. It's a kind of road movie, except that all the travelling is in the air as Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) aims to hit a personal (and meaningless) target of 10 million air miles. It's a sort of rom-com with Bingham meeting Alex (Vera Farmiga), his match as a hard-nosed executive who likes some fun on the side. There's an odd-couple theme as Bingham is teamed up with Natalie (Anna Kendrick), the very young newcomer to the corporate world who tries to outdo her companion in coldness. And the whole thing is a satire on the brutality of capitalist enterprise that sacks hard-working and long-serving staff with a management-speak that makes it sound as if the company is doing them a favour.<br/><br/>Whichever way you look at it, this is Clooney's film. He is rarely off the screen and gives a marvellously assured and textured performance as the mobile downsizer or ""career transition counsellor"" who at a personal level does not want to be burdened by anything or anybody (shades of Clooney's own reluctance to commit to a relationship). Credit must also go to young director (and co-writer) Jason Reitman, hot from his success with ""Juno"". If the film has an episodic narrative, this is clearly because it is based on a novel by Walter Kim with chapters based on Bingham's visit to different airports and different companies in various mid-western towns.<br/><br/>The economic context to the movie feels very contemporary since the release comes at a time of high unemployment in the United States (as elsewhere) as a result of the worst recession since 1929; yet the novel was published in 2001 and Reitman began work on a screenplay in 2002. An interesting touch is that almost all the people fired in the movie were real-life workers who had recently lost their jobs in St Louis and Detroit and were asked to say what they felt about the experience"
"druid333-2","9","0","3","12 February 2010"," Ice Water For Blood
","Ryan Bingham is a corporate ax man (that is to say,he has the thankless job of firing people for various bosses that lack the nerve to do it themselves). Ryan really enjoys his job, all because he is a heartless bastard with ice water for blood (as the above mentioned),as well as the high class perks that his job supplies him with (he spends most of his time in planes,flying from job to job--hence,the title). Ryan is also something of a ""user"" of women,with no regard for settling down for a lifetime (he also has little use for his own family). Ryan seems to have it all down,pat. He is having a fling with a woman met on a connecting flight. He is also training a young novice in the wily ways of firing people,cold (""how do you sleep at night?"",asks one of his victims). Does a humbling experience,involving family members cause a (paradigm)shift in his realm of thinking? George Clooney takes the part he was obviously born to play,in this smart & well written drama, with some nice touches of comedy to lighten things up. Vera Farmiga is Alex Goran,the woman he is carrying on with. Anna Kendrick is Natalie Keener,a young,up & coming ax person,who is learning the ropes from Ryan (but obviously doesn't like Ryan much as a person,'tho does respect his position on firing some genuinely hard working people). Jason Reitman (director of such toothsome film fare such as 'Thank You For Smoking' & Juno',and son of director,Ivan Reitman,who also acts as one of the executive producers of this film)directs & co-writes the screenplay with Sheldon Turner,in a film with a touch of savvy. Other cast members include Jason Bateman (who's obviously redeemed himself from appearing in such fare as 'Teen Wolf 2')plays Ryan's boss,Craig Gregory,and if you don't blink,you'll spot Sam Elliot (several notches up from the sorry mess he last appeared in ['Did You Hear About The Morgans?]),as an airline pilot,patterned after Capt.""Sully"" Sullenberger,who saved the passengers & crew by crash landing that flight in the Hudson River last year. This is smart,savvy film making that makes for a well spent Saturday night at the movies. Rated 'R' by the MPAA for some outbursts of strong language,brief nudity & adult content"
"ackstasis","8","0","2","11 February 2010"," ""How much does your life weigh?""
","When I first mentioned my interest in seeing Jason Reitman's latest film, a friend swiftly dismissed it as ""one of those intellectual movies."" It isn't really. 'Up in the Air (2009)' is an affable, unpretentious look at life in today's fast-moving society, lighthearted for the most part, but pointedly dramatic when it counts. I must confess that I haven't seen 'Thank You for Smoking (2005)' or 'Juno (2007),' so I can't offer an auteurist perspective. However, the film's pleasantly- wistful approach reminded me of another good recent comedy/drama, 'Dan in Real Life (2007).' Both films explore the yearnings of an older man for an emotional connection in his life, though the screen personas of Steve Carell and George Clooney could hardly be farther apart. 'Up in the Air' displays Clooney at his most suave, gliding through a gleaming world of spotless airport terminals and glossy credit cards, a disconnected lifestyle of sterility and emotional emptiness.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (Clooney) has spent most of his life in the air. His daily routine involves flying endlessly across the United States, firing people who he's never met, and will never meet again. He thrives on single-serve friendships (if I may borrow from 'Fight Club (1999)'), and feels empty if he's grounded for more than a few days. Ryan is estranged from his family, and never engages in romantic relationships beyond the occasional sexual fling with fellow frequent-flyers like Alex (Vera Farmiga). We expect Reitman to thoroughly condemn this lifestyle, but his approach is double-edged. In modern society, particularly given Ryan's difficult occupation, there's something sincere about the city- hopping lifestyle. Even among those like Natalie (Anna Kendrick), who would prefer to remain permanently grounded, technology acts as a barrier to genuine human interaction: partners break up via SMS, employees are fired over the internet (even when sitting in the next room)."

","Boring, predictable plot? Strained and awkward acting? Overrated and doesn't deserve the recognition it's been getting? Half the cast look like they're from Shameless? None of these could even come close to being the truth - except perhaps the Shameless one. I'm more than thrilled to say that this film really does live up to the hype and Oscar nominations rightly surrounding it.<br/><br/>Clooney gives a spot-on performance as a lonely but enthused worker who travels regularly around America firing employees for a living. This all goes smoothly until he falls for Alex who also flies around regularly. Vera Farmiga shines as his dream woman or as she likes to put it ""Just think of me as yourself with a vagina"" so as you can imagine it isn't hard to see why he likes her.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick also proves to have great potential as supporting actress, she is almost as strong willed and witty as Clooney but it is Reitman's fantastic direction that makes the pace and conversation of the film so enjoyable to watch; proving his Juno phenomenon(though Diablo Cody got most the credit)wasn't mere luck. This is easily a must see of this year and easily deserves the praise it's been getting."

Maybe, you could think that Batman is a fantasy and Up In The Air is a drama and their comparison is not right, but let's talk about a movie-not about the genres. Being a man who thinks that every movie, even if movie couldn't give to people as much as books, must make people a little happier and more experienced. Doesn't matter it's not your own experience. So let's talk about this particular movie with George Clooney. I liked his acting always, but he shouldn't play in movies like BURN AFTER READING. Because when he acts in movies like Up In The Air we all can how perfect actor he is. Movie is nice, easy and has a very deep meaning. I like such movies. Wish it'll get Oscar. Another few words is for Anna Kendrick whose performance unquestionably deserved Oscar nomination. I don't know whether she'll get or she's too young yet for it, but she deserved it."

","Up in the Air follows the life of Ryan Bingham, a corporate hatchet who loves his life on the road. His job consists in traveling all across the country firing people and in the meantime meeting good looking and collecting frequent flyer miles. Directed by Jason Reitman, he takes us into a journey of a self examination of life, human relations and all of its consequences. It is like a mix of road movie with comedy and drama with a story that captivates, a plot perfectly developed, various locations with beautiful landscapes and a soundtrack you really enjoy throughout the movie. The movie has a slow paced rhythm but that doesn't mean it turns out to be a boring movie, in fact it keeps you interested for almost 2 hours. The cast is wonderful, George Clooney is excellent, Vera Farmiga is simply flawless an Anna Kendrick is pretty convincing. The Only thing I regret a little from the movie is the ending, I felt a bit disappointed but also I think that the way it ends gives the movie a more realistic point of view. In conclusion, Up in the Air is enjoyable, entertaining and very recommendable."

","Reitman's refreshing 'Up In The Air' sort of has the similar structure as his debut 'Thank You For Smoking' and the whimsical fluidity as his 'Juno'. Yet this film isn't another 'Thank You For Smoking' or 'Juno'. It 'misleads' the viewer into thinking that they're watching a comedy but then as Reitman peels the layers of the story and characters, the depth become much more apparent and involving. With sharp writing, that includes witty dialogues, rich characters and a consistent story, 'Up In The Air' works well in engaging its viewers. The soundtrack does a wonderful job in setting the mood. George Clooney does an amazing job as he transforms from a know-it-all arrogant guy to one whose vulnerability is exposed and who doubts his actions. It's also funny how his Ryan is so into airports and the history that surrounds it, that he misses out on so many things in the world, which almost includes his sister's wedding. Vera Farmiga is stupendous as the charming and 'available' Alex. She's finally getting her long overdue recognition. Anna Kendrick is impressive as the naive rookie who thinks she's got a bright future waiting ahead. Then there's Jason Bateman who is first rate as Ryan's smug boss. I was almost at a semi-conscious state when I was watching 'Up In The Air' but I enjoyed it a lot and will be revisiting it again soon."

"gradyharp","10","0","4","7 February 2010"," A Brave, Compassionate, Brilliant Film: Examining the Now
","Jason Reitman (director and co-writer with Sheldon Turner based on Walter Kirn's novel of the same name) is a bright light among the new directors of important stature. He has a style: he makes comedy films touching on serious matters (JUNO deals with teen pregnancy, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING deals with the dangers of tobacco); his films open with significant and elaborate sequences; his main characters offer highly subjective narrations and tend to be self-confident people who end up re-thinking their lives; he tends to favor continued using of a troupe of ensemble actors (here JK Simmons, Sam Elliott, James Bateman). UP IN THE AIR shares all of these traits and more. It dares to talk about firing people in a time when everyone in this country is frightened about the job market and somehow manages to show the compassion for both the victims and the perpetrators. It is a challenge of the first order and Reitman makes it work very well. This is not a feel good comedy; this is a drama with comic relief that addresses serious issues and people's responses to them - employment, relationships, marriage, and apparent self-sufficiency. <br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) spends his time in the air, flying to companies across the USA whose CEOs don't want the job of informing employees they are no longer needed. Ryan manages to make these encounters as human as possible and he is an artist in his work. His personal life is rather arid: his love needs are met by women on the run, he has distanced himself from his family, electing to maintain a sterile one room apartment in Omaha which he uses the few days out of the year when he is not flying. He meets a very beautiful, smart, and seductive woman Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and a crazy courtship ensues as they meet in different cities - both being traveling business people. <br/><br/>Things change when Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman) takes on a fresh graduate student with big ideas for reducing the costs of the company. Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is smart, a focused designer of telecommunications who has sold Craig on the idea of doing the firing remotely rather than spending the money to fly Ryan et al around the country. Ryan bristles and demands that Natalie accompany him on his personalized interview firings before the company goes Skype. The two - Ryan and Natalie - are paired for an excursion of real life jobs terminations and both learn from each other. Ryan continues to have trysts with Alex and eventually Ryan, Alex and Natalie party together. Natalie discovers the human side of Ryan's work and finds the person to person contact difficult. At the same time Natalie challenges Ryan's inability to form realistic relationships with women. Hurtful things happen to each to the three fliers, causing each to re-think their career goals as well as their personal needs. <br/><br/>Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick deliver first class performances (very obviously Oscar worthy), but then so do the many cameo actors in the film: Amy Morton, Melanie Lynsky and Danny McBride as Ryan's needy family, and a long list of very brief but deeply moving cameos of people being fired by an extraordinary group of actors (casting director Mindy Marin deserves an Oscar also). The gorgeous cinematography is by Eric Steelberg and the music score is by Rolfe Kent (with a special nod to the composer and singer and guitar player who ends the movie credits with a song that summarizes the ideas of the film). And shining over all of these factors is the superlative, flawless direction of Jason Reitman. This film may have unpopular themes, but it is most assuredly on of the best films of 2009. Highly recommended. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","We like or dislike a movie based on our life's experiences and preferences. So everyone who has ever been dumped painfully and ruthlessly can identify with the characters of Ryan (George Clooney) & Natalie (Anna Kendrick). A very good and compact movie. I wonder why IMDb categorized the movie as a 'Comedy' because there is hardly any, except a few sexual innuendos. Like most Hollywood movies, even this one comes with a few good surprises. Excellent performances by all the characters.<br/><br/>The movie depicts the emotional upheavals that one goes through when he/she faces a sudden shocking change in his/her professional life. It's a story about the importance of relationships in one's life; about self discovery; about the emptiness that one feels within when certain incidents in life question our beliefs and assumptions.<br/><br/>It absolutely deserves each of the 6 Oscar nominations.

Ryan (George Clooney) is a man who is trying to make a connection, before that he was ruthless man who was doing his job brilliantly. When he meets Alex (Vera Farmiga) he lets his cynic stance down and what happens after that, it's a life lesson. Ryan receives a powerful and rusthless punch from the life, when he sees that Alex has a family. From that moment, his sentimental connection with her, disappeared in heartbeat.

"michell_1987","7","0","2","3 February 2010"," Enjoyable, funny movie. Definitely worth a watch.
","The movie moves at a slow pace, but still manages to keep the viewer's attention. I personally enjoyed the movie a lot because I thought it managed to convey so many feelings, emotions and life's lessons without being preachy.The movie's protagonist, Mr. Ryan Bingham, lives out of a suitcase as his job requires him to travel all across America firing people as part of the company's corporate downsizing contracts. He is also a motivational speaker, helping people to deal with their emotional stress and encouraging them to not be bogged down by the excess baggage that life has to offer - namely relationships. He loves his life and his job which requires him to constantly travel leaving him little time for family or relationships. Not that he's complaining because he's perfectly happy moving from city to city and living in hotels. However, during the course of the movie, the people he meets and the incidents he encounters make him realize that he might have been wrong all these years. And just maybe, he doesn't have life all figured out like he thought he did. He hooks up with a like-minded fellow traveler - or so he thinks, and what starts off as a casual relationship turns into much more for him. By the end of the movie, you have him cross borders just to show up at her doorstep, only to find out that she's happily settled and he was only an escape to her everyday life. She calls him her ""parenthesis"". Even though you really don't expect a happily-ever-after for them, your heart goes out to Ryan Bingham at that moment. But such is life, you realize the most important things only when its too late. Natalie Keener is the other person who plays an important part of Ryan's realization process. She's a young lady, fresh out of Cornell, a top student, ambitious, a perfectionist and the works. Her new ideas to improve cost-cutting of the company might put an end to Ryan's business trips altogether, which Ryan doesn't take too kindly to. Natalie is sent with Ryan on his trips where he shows her the ropes of the business of firing people. Natalie might appear to be a career-oriented woman who knows exactly what she wants to accomplish, however she reveals her weaker, human side when she tells Ryan that she gave up better job offers to follow her boyfriend, only to be dumped by him through a text message. Natalie isn't blunt. She makes it clear that she's appalled by his way of life and tries to change his views on the same. The movie has some clean and subtle humour (which is quite rare these days) and that makes it even more likable. The performances of George Clooney and Anna Kendrick who play Ryan Bingham and Natalie Keener respectively are particularly noteworthy. In all, the whole cast and crew has done a superb job in making a movie that everyone can relate it on some level."
"aiga","9","0","3","29 January 2010"," He's a sad and lonely man... but the movie is great!
","It is great! I could say that it is brilliant even. I just saw it recently, but lately (since ""Avatar"" :D) it is the best I've seen. George Clooney is a great actor. I do love him not just because I'm a girl (Let's face it! Women love him because he is what he is.), but because he gives great performances one after another. A movie with his name in the titles guarantees a good time. So, yeah! I'm a fan. But let's speak about the movie... I loved it. I loved its fresh humor, the sadness of the story and how it was blended to make a perfect, refreshing cocktail. This is a movie about a man who has lived all his life in a certain manner, is used to certain things and ways, is committed to a life of a bachelor (Even more than that! He doesn't even have an address that he would call his home, and basically lives out of a suitcase by choice.). He denies family and marriage. All the interaction he needs he gets from flight attendants (That's an overstatement, but it basically explains his level of need for other people.) One day this man realizes that the philosophy, he has been living by, might be flawed and he just might want to try out some of that regular stuff that all of us are dreaming off since we were 5 years old, or so. He just might commit to another person. And guess what!!! It all blows up in his face! It seams so unfair... so sad. He was ready to change his life for another person, but it turned out, nobody needed him different. I felt so sorry for this man. He has shut himself off from the world and now, that he wants to rejoin, it doesn't let him. Is it too late at some point to change your stars??? I guess that the lesson is: be careful what you wish for - you might just get it. SO, the actors were great. George of course! I love Vera Farmiga. She is great and charming as always. I must point out Anna Kendrick's performance. She has something. I must agree with the many comments out there who all claim that she has a great potential. I truly enjoyed her performance. It is nothing like the Twilight saga. Good luck to her! But all these wonderful actors were brought together to tell an interesting and fresh story. Not everyone will like it, but it's a smart movie. It's not for everyone."

George Clooney's performance is truly impressive in my opinion, Farmiga is a classy delight but on the whole the story sounds good, the overall tone of the film matching a topic (people being laid off) that is very serious. The final verdict is in my view that ""Up in the Air"" is witty, moving and pertinent. This director who gets better and better with every film but it's George Clooney getting it to ""soar"" with one of his most accomplished performances (maybe the best one by far)."
"Philby-3","9","0","3","24 January 2010"," A blast of welcome cold air
","This is a chilly comedy, and that's not just because the location filming was conducted mostly in the American mid-west in February 2009. Being sacked is seldom funny and Jason Reitman's use of real victims of the layoff process (along with some adroit actors) reveals some of the real pain of ""outplacement"". George Clooney's character Ryan Bingham is a master of the process. His company is hired by others all over the US ""too cowardly to do their own sacking"" though given the ultra-litigious American scene there is a lot to be said for employing an expert to do the dirty work. Ryan's task as he sees it is to shepherd the victims on to the next phase of their lives (and cut down the litigation). It helps that he is a man without family commitments of his own who lives out of his suitcase ""up in the air"" in the world of airports, hotels and rental cars, his only serious life goal being the attainment of ten million passenger miles with one of the better bits of product placement seen recently, the trusty American Airlines (did anyone notice the billboard at one airport with a photo of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, hero of the Hudson River ditching on it?) The tension here is provided by Ryan being forced to show the ropes to Natalie (Anna Kendrick) an eager young beaver straight out of business school who has given Ryan's smarmy boss Craig (Jason Bateman) the idea of replacing road warriors with the internet. The romantic sparks are not provided by her, but by Alex (Vera Farmiga), an older woman Ryan meets in his travels, a road warrior like him, who seemingly has no attachments either. Their affair blossoms, but, sorry folks, this isn't that sort of comedy.<br/><br/>Rather, this is about as an intelligent piece of film-making Hollywood is capable of producing. Reitman's earlier movies, ""Thank You For Not Smoking"" and ""Juno"" were equally intelligent but here he has been able to create some depth of feeling, aided enormously by George Clooney's charm. He is exactly right for the part, and meshes perfectly with the beautiful Vera Famiga. I am at the stage of life where I find the likes of Natalie (a rollerblader, capable of going very fast in one direction) just plain annoying but I must admit Anna Kendrick does a good job to the extent that I almost feel sorry for her.<br/><br/>Reitman was lucky with his timing here – as he filmed the US went into a financial crisis and slipped into recession. Millions have lost their jobs. As it happened, I watched the movie with my boss sitting just behind me. It was salutary to observe he was laughing at several points where I was not, but then again, I laughed at several points when there was silence from behind. Remember salary-men, their interests are not always yours."
"blinky1986","7","0","2","24 January 2010"," A comedic look at certain philosophies of life
","Up in the Air is the latest effort from Jason Reitman, it's a simple story following the seemingly empty everyday life of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), providing insight into choices of life style and the importance of human connection.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham with a strange job; when a business has to lose a few employees they contact the company Ryan works for, who in turn send people out to do it for them. Ryan's life is a series of flights and airports as he travels America to fire people (sorry, I mean 'let them go'). It's no surprise that such a nomadic lifestyle has led Ryan to become a man with no connections to people, where most people would aim to build a family and own a home, Ryans greatest ambition is to clock up 10 million air miles for classy airport pass and his name on the side of a plane. The first real encounter we see him have is with Alex (Vera Farmiga), but their chemistry isn't built around the usual romantic notions we see in cinema, instead it is very businesses like. Two people who have similar tastes and desires and accept their situations dictate that the relationship can never be anything more. One great scene with the two of them whipping out their laptops to arrange their next sexual encounter based around their flight schedule sums it up perfectly.<br/><br/>Ryans life takes a turn when new employee Natalie Keener (Anna Hendrick) proposes an idea to the boss of Ryans company to change their approach. Instead of flying around America the company will do the firing via webcam and a laptop. The drastic effect this will have on the lifestyle of Ryan leaves him very opposed to the idea, with matters made more awkward when he is told to take Natalie around America to show her the ropes when it comes to delivering the news. As Ryan travels with Natalie, she challenges his philosophies and forces him to take a close look at the life he has chosen, with the prospect of being grounded and his growing affection for Alex he soon finds himself toying with the idea of changing his approach to the world.<br/><br/>The supporting cast do their jobs well, but George Clooney takes the centre stage, he is his usual suave self here, oozing confidence and coolness. Being one of the few single men his age in Hollywood and with only one distant marriage to his name, maybe he is bringing a bit of himself to the film with his anti-commitment philosophies. He also brings a nice subtle brand of comedy, he can deliver lines with deadpan or sarcasm with such little effort that will still make you laugh out loud.<br/><br/>The script is clever and witty but also insightful. The first half has a lighter whimsical feel to it, as we are getting to know Ryans character we are treated to some great throwaway lines and funny interactions (mostly with what appear to be semi-improvised snippets of people being fired), one of my favourite gags was the observations on different people in airport ques. As the film progresses the change in tone shifts a little. The humour is still there but the script focuses more on the seriousness of Ryans situation, to be a man without a home or a family, how can someone live without the prospect of building these things? Is it even feasible? The soundtrack provides a nice mix of folk and soft rock, which is a suitable choice for the films slow meandering pace.<br/><br/>The subject of living a life without roots versus building a family and a home is something we have all thought about before, and after watching it I was left considering Ryans views on life, and having that lingering thought process after a film always mean you've watched something worth seeing. It's slightly let down by the pacing towards the end, but the tight script and the comedic take on philosophies on life make for a strong effort that is most definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Sophistication is not a word we often hear in association with a comedy. Yet, Jason Reitman's relevant and funny ""Up in the Air"" is an undeniable piece of sophisticated cinema that is far more poignant, moving, and compelling than just about every hard-hitting drama made this year. Effortlessly presenting a rarely-seen perspective of the current economic crisis, it paints a complex portrait of a termination facilitator, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man whose life goal is to garner ten million frequent flyer miles. A termination facilitator, for those who are wondering, is someone who comes into a company that needs to downsize, relieves unfortunate individuals of their positions, and tidies up the mess before swooping off to the next target. Some might call Ryan a corporate-downsizing expert. But, let's face it, he just fires people really, really well. When a newly-hired hotshot, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), arrives with a plan that would revolutionize the way Ryan does business, he must reflect upon what place he now has in corporate America and the ethical aspect of his career that he has ignored for so long.<br/><br/>Read My Full Review Here: www.theguywholovesmovies.blogspot.com"

","In A Nutshell....<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (Clooney), frequent flyer and corporate downsizer, has his life just how he likes it: no emotional ties, plenty of in-flight perks. That is, until he falls for the enigmatic Alex (Farmiga), and is saddled with work-partner Natalie (Kendrick) <br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Jason Reitman has done it again, first with the perky teen comedy with heart (Juno) now the likely Oscar Front Runner (Up In The Air). He is quickly establishing himself as a major player in Hollywood. Reitman, who recently won a Golden Globe for His Up In The Air Screenplay, is receiving awards left, right and centre, but what is all the fuss about ? And what makes the film Stand out above the rest. <br/><br/>Let me introduce Ryan Bingham (Clooney) a workaholic, corporate downsizer who enjoys the luxury of flying, and the perks along the way. To him an airport lounge is home, being comforted with the delights of a high ranking member's status, and the familiar joys that entail. Obsessively collecting the flyer miles as he travels from airport to airport (10 million is the goal). Bingham is content with his life out of a suitcase, little to his knowledge that everything is about to change. Clooney Shines as Bingham, Bringing soul and personality to the movie, he is the anchor and drives the film forward, in turn brings an emotional and Oscar worthy performance.<br/><br/>There are two female supporters in the film, the enigmatic Alex (Farmiga) and love interest of Ryan's. She describes herself as ""just think of me as you with a vagina"" constantly working, flying from place to place, looking for a bit of harmless fun(but nothing serious) along the way. The second is Natalie (Kendrick) The enthusiastic and harmless employee who threatens Bingham's way of life, trying to prove, that you can fire the poor folk over the internet, instead of face to face. Naturally Bingham refuses the idea, and stating that Natalie doesn't have the right experience, He is sent out with her to ""show her the ropes"" by the boss (Bateman).<br/><br/>Along the way, Ryan gives Natalie mentoring on how to fire people the right way, try not get to personal and encourage them about pursuing their real dreams, with the help of a trusty Pamphlet and a pat on the back. Bingham's constantly trying to prove that firing someone over the internet will not work, and requires a more sentimental approach. Occasionally meeting Alex along the way, something starts to change, as he finally starts to realise that he is lonely.<br/><br/>The films pace is masterful; it leads from one enjoyable scene to next, It's beautifully shot with quick editing and some quite funny narration by Clooney. It's full of enjoyable performances and it's emotional as hell. You rarely find yourself bored and it leaves you guessing until the end. The only criticism I have is that the film doesn't know what it wants to be, at times it's a romantic comedy and at others it's a serious drama full of heartbreak. It manages to win you back towards the end of the film, anyone who complains about the ending is truly misguided, it's one of the most satisfying I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: The film is a delight, with a strong plot and colourful characters; it is defiantly an Oscar favourite and should win for screenplay and actor for Clooney, whether it will snag the big two is yet to be seen. The scene transition is fast and smooth; you will rarely find yourself bored. It's an amazing film, that has a deep message engraved into it, how you perceive that message, is up to you."

","I have never heard of any companies hiring out freelance firers to fire people before-not to say that it doesn't exist somewhere, but I have never heard of it...so this is a weird film to me on a number of levels. George Cloony will have no doubt an audience here because of his track record in previous films, but that is not to say it is a stellar performance, in fact I think it is perhaps far from being stellar, as the last line in the film is perhaps one of the most empty sentiments I have ever heard anyone utter, but I will not say what that was as it might reveal to much of the film. There is an interlude with a supposedly female version of himself in the film all full of cool dialogue to show just how cool they are to each other. The connection is ultimately not real, and in retrospect that is a very unsatisfying moment in the movie. Everybody wants to be cool, or at least be around cool. No cool here. Oh modern life is such an alienating experience with its glass and steel worlds and its access cards and impersonal computers. Most people experience that each day so this film drawing attention to the obvious is perhaps a waste of time also.Is the point that relationships suck? Some do, some don't. So what? Well, I guess it is sort of a so what for this movie from me."

","A deeply philosophical film. Everything worked, but I didn't like the stark message that love and attachments are empty promises--that ultimately we die alone. There was a coldness and cynicism and to the entire film, but we are left with the idea that the main character, played effectively by George Clooney, may be ready for a change. This is not a feel-good film, but it will make you think.<br/><br/>The casting was superb, particularly the character Natalie, a know-it-all-but-clueless Cornell MBA, who goes on the road with Clooney's character and gets an education about the real world.<br/><br/>This film is highly relevant in these times of traumatic corporate downsizing and economic stress--people losing not just their livelihoods, but their homes and even their their lives.<br/><br/>The film is a study in the Buddhist principle that suffering arisings from desire and attachment. This is driven home, without ever mentioning religion. The more attached you become to someone or to an object, the greater you suffer when it is taken away. That's intuitive, but the film questions these attachments and desires and shows how empty life can be lived without them. Choose your attachments carefully, the film infers, and a goal of airline mileage credits seems to be the one attachment Clooney's character allows himself--something attainable, that he has complete control over.<br/><br/>But the film isn't entirely cynical about losing your job. The point is made in several places that it can be the opportunity to change your life to something better.<br/><br/>The sets were perfectly rendered--airport lobbies, check-in gates, hotels, airliners... .<br/><br/>In so many great films, the music feels intrusive. When I notice the sound track, it pulls me out of the story. The music here was just right.<br/><br/>The cinematography was great, magical. I was captivated from beginning to end, made to forget that I was in a theater."

","The idea of writing an obnoxious character sympathetically is hardly new - Holly Golightly, a whore in all but name - comes to mind, as does C.C. Baxter, the role played by Jack Lemmon in The Apartment, who cynically allows senior management figures in his organization to use his apartment for assignations in order to advance his career. George Clooney's Ryan Bingham is cut from the same cloth; this is a guy who flies around the country firing (or sacking as we say in England)people for a living and actually relishing it and the lifestyle it affords him.Clooney can, of course, do charm, and he does it here which distracts from the type of career he has chosen. He is also given a romantic interest in the delightful shape of Vera Farmila and a happy ending seems on the cards until an improbable plot twist deep sixes it. As feel-good goes this is as good as it gets, as nasty taste in the mouth goes it also tests high."

","Well, Jason Reitman's timing couldn't have been better, considering that unemployment is 10% and underemployment is almost twice as much.<br/><br/>With the state of the economy, and the uncertainty of the future, due to the manipulation by the U.S. Government, and their overblown sense of importance, this film accurately depicts the life of Ryan Bingham(George Clooney), and his perception of life.<br/><br/>Ryan a middle-aged traveling ""HITMAN"", in the sense of a ""Turk"", a person hired to reduce extra or obsolete workers(that view being seen from the eyes of the Employer), and to terminate their employment, by glib matter of fact dismissing them, and their lives, with a little optimistic pep talk, and a folder (that has ALL of their answers.) Compensation and stuff. Nothing like a folder to sum up your life's value and dreams. Being on the road over 254 days a year, has added a few miles to Ryan, although he is in somewhat of a denial. Subplots include Alex Goran(Vera Farmiga), a casual relationship that reflects the emptiness in Ryan's life. Enter Natalie Keener(Anna Kendrick) starry eyed college grad top of her class, who has been hired by the same company Ryan works for, to reduce waste, by eliminating the travel of the ""Hitman"" and eliminating people from their employment by firing them thru the use of computer screens. Reducing costs and validity are a BIG part of this film. Actually the value and meaning of life are the main themes, and are understated in each of the characters. Questions like, are you your job, and what are the sum of your parts. Ryan is also a part-time motivational speaker, who gets top dollar by telling people that in order to experience life, you must rid themselves of all emotional and physical baggage. Wow, of course when the single but social Ryan reflects on his mortality, he decides to change course, with dramatic consequences. While there are ALLOT of laughs, the new Electronic but Sterile society reflects the diminishing value of loyalty. The greater the technological achievements the less connection between people, ironic, isn't it.<br/><br/>So, while the film doesn't deliver a deep and powerful emotional impact, it does make us stop and think about the people we are, and what makes us human. Clooney does another fine job, as well as the rest of the actors. He is sensitive, without being melodramatic.<br/><br/>I thought for what it's worth, the film delivers the message that people need to remain connected, even in an age of disconnection.<br/><br/>This film is number 9, in every film with a title of ""Up In The Air."" A worthy effort, but don't expect a huge emotional impact, but realize that you are important, and don't need a folder to validate your life.<br/><br/>I gave the film a rating of 8. Running time 149 minutes."
"Monotreme02","9","0","4","12 January 2010"," A fascinating character study and so much more; the best film of 2009
","A major part of what makes this film so successful and effective is its simplicity – and watching it, one is surprised at just how incredible simple it really is. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Reitman does not employ fancy cinematography, visual flair, eccentric music, gimmicky storytelling, or any particularly noteworthy or conspicuous elements to tell his story. It is a very simple and straightforward film – what makes it remarkable is the extraordinary depth and richness that simplicity conceals. First and foremost, the film serves as a resonant and fascinating character study. In the vein of the greatest character studies, Reitman portrays and explores every nook and cranny of the man that is Ryan Bingham: and he is quite a fascinating character indeed. We are introduced to him as a man who lives what can be described as a life of complete freedom: he calls no place home except the skies; he finds such purely joyous pleasure in the details of hotel rooms, car rental services, airport security procedures, efficient packing and travel, membership cards and loyal customer clubs and frequent flier miles. We glimpse his closet at one point and see that he has at most three or four shirts. His apartment, which he spends less than a few days at a time in, is completely bare. Most importantly though, Ryan has no major human connection in his life: not with a romantic partner, not with his co-workers, and not even with his own family. But while most of us would look at such a life as quite miserable, Ryan couldn't be happier or more content with his choice.<br/><br/>But Ryan is thrown off balance when technological advances threaten to ground him for life, and when he meets two women who enter his life: the first is a young, fresh-out-of-college employee who is partnered with him on the road so that he can ""show her the ropes""; the second is a free-wheeling woman whom he meets on the road and sees as his counterpart: free from responsibility, reveling in her success and her ""exclusivity"" in the form of various membership cards which the two excitedly compare. Most importantly, though, she seems interested in only the most fleeting and casual of human connections, but as their relationship develops, Ryan seems more and more interested in something serious and seems to think that their relationship is headed in that direction. If Reitman treats Ryan's character and the events in his life with utmost maturity and profundity, he manages to find an even more reflective and meaningful resolution: he avoids simple and one-dimensional solutions and provides us with one that is far more thought-provoking and multi-faceted, in which some aspects of Ryan's life and his relationship with his friends and family change, while others end up being too late to change. It is a fascinating, resonant and really significant study of the human condition, what is important in our lives, what abstract terms such as relationships, family, love, freedom, and all these other ideas mean to us as individuals, and so much more.<br/><br/>With Up in the Air, Reitman proves that a truly great movie can be made with nothing more than great performances and good writing. Reitman does not employ visual gimmicks, untraditional storytelling techniques, or any other such prominent elements that make some of the best movies ever made as good as they are. Watching Up in the Air, I didn't get the feeling that I was watching something really groundbreaking like I did when watching There Will Be Blood two years ago, which shook me to the core. Up in the Air didn't feel like something revolutionary or important as I was watching it; the cinematography is good but not particularly showy, as is the editing. The design and look of the movie are all pretty standard, rooted in reality and not flashy. The musical score is effective as are the song choices; but again, the soundtrack doesn't particularly stand out – which is why the fact that this movie is so resonant and deep and meaningful is all the more impressive. Three elements in the film do particularly stand out, though. The first is the performances which, like I mentioned, are career highs for all involved, and just totally full-fledged and fascinating and incredible pieces of work. The second is the screenplay that, while fairly straightforward, conceals so much multi-layered depth and significance and is written so well, the dialogue simply jumping off the screen with such vitality and exuberance. It is a film that works on so many levels; it is at once hilarious and genuinely funny and intelligent while at the same time genuinely and poignantly emotional and dramatic. It is at once a multi-faceted character study and an important testament to the current economic climate of our world. It is enjoyable, charming, funny, touching, thought-provoking, poignant, moving and all in all just one of the most full-fledged and genuine cinematic experiences of the year. The third is what brings it all together, what takes a fairly simple premise that could be so easily underplayed by any other director but that brings out everything that makes the movie as good as it is, and that is the director, Jason Reitman. Building up a strong reputation with his past two films, in his third effort, Reitman brings everything together, and directs the film with such focus and maturity and confidence, completely devoid of irony or preciousness and serves to create what is, in my opinion, the best film of the year."
"spaced_89","9","0","2","10 January 2010"," 'Up in the Air' Captures America
","Up in the Air is a throwback of sorts to the classic Hollywood films of yesteryear. The dynamic banter between Ryan and Alex is reminiscent of classics like It Happened One Night. And of course like the old Hollywood pictures Up in the Air is a star vehicle led by the last real movie star in George Clooney.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) spends 95% of his life sucking recycled oxygen 10,000 feet above the ground surrounded, yet entirely alone. He is a corporate assassin leased out to cowards that cannot let go of their own employees. Ryan's life is in a suspended state of animation much like all of the travelers stuck in airports this past week. That is until he meets his equivalent in Alex (Vera Farmiga) they recognize they're essentially the same souls almost instantly with Alex even teasing him with, ""think of yourself, with a vagina."" Ryan Bingham is an oddity in film. He is only at home swiping cards, earning mileage points, and avoiding his one bedroom apartment in Omaha. All of his connections are only surface deep and he seems better off for it. He knows what he has and appreciates the freeness from baggage.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman's latest effort feels like a spiritual sequel to Thank You for Smoking with both films being reflective satires on the present state of America. In 2005 Smoking focused on advertising and spin-control, at that point a burgeoning evil quickly becoming acceptable to America. Up in the Air turns it gaze to Natalie (the charming Anna Kendrick, who debuts incredibly in her non-Twilight career), a newly attached sidekick to Ryan by his douche boss Craig (Jason Bateman), and her revolutionary web-chat firing system that allows you to fire someone at will without the mess of dealing with them afterward.<br/><br/>A funny, yet serious look at the way corporations justify immoral behavior and then apply their rationalizations with sub-par logic. But more importantly the effects and culture of a recession. Bingham is not the one to be sympathized with, we are."
"ticket_for_one","8","0","2","10 January 2010"," I liked Ryan Bingham from start to finish.
","A very good George Clooney movie. Never been a big fan of his but his performances in movies such as The Peacemaker and The Ocean movies have kept me interested. This is by far his best performance. One thing I'll say about Clooney is that he has never looked uncomfortable on screen. And this proves that he's one of the best actors in the business. He plays a motivational speaker who also fires people for the companies they work for. To add to that, he's only responsibility in life is his job and he enjoys a bit monogamy now and then. I liked Ryan Bingham from start to finish. Not because he's an over confident, self absorbed man with no commitments. But because he's seriously funny. And it's hard not to like him, especially towards the end, where Clooney shows a vulnerable side to him I've never seen from him before. Supporting cast are excellent. Vera Famiga is great as Clooney's love interest. She's just a wonderful actress to watch and terribly underrated, I'll be surprised if she doesn't win an award this year for this performance. Anna Kendrick (Twlight) and Jason Bateman hold their own very well and play their roles as though they belong in the movie. But big ups to Jason Reitman son of Ivan, whose shown here he's every bit as good as his father. I wouldn't be surprised if he got a Best Director nod at the Screen Actors and maybe even and an Oscar nomination. Good movie, worth the release and one of my movies of the year so far. Expect it to pick an award or two. Go see!"

","This movie shows that there are writers and directors out there who, like Jason Reitman, still have the ability to connect with normal everyday people. This movie was about many things, love, relationships, family and people. It was a perfect movie for the age in which we are living today and maybe thats why I enjoyed it so much. Reitman did something in this movie that I thought was amazing. In the movie there was examples of types of relationships reflected through the characters: New love, love lost and nonexistent love. Now after you see this movie you can decide which characters fit into which category. Love and family were also used in this movie as coping devices, for that even though these people lost their jobs, they knew everything was going to be OK with the help of their family. There were many other great elements within this movie that can be applied to our everyday lives, and I highly recommend it. There are usually only a couple movies a year that amaze me, and this was one of them."

","Up In The Air My Rating: 10/10.<br/><br/>Up In The Air is a film that celebrates life, the joys it brings and the happiness that can be achieved at the oddest times from the oddest of events. A rare film that evaluates life from different view points and the struggles it brings. George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham a man, no one with a career, wants to ever meet. His job? He works for a company that hires him out to other companies to fire their employees. No ones dream job except maybe for Ryan Bingham himself. He is on road, so the speak, two hundred and fifty days a year. He enjoys his non-committal life. No strings attached for Mr. Bingham. That is until he encounters a woman, Vera Farmiga, who travels just as much as he and could possibly be the woman of his dreams. He experiences feelings and times with her that he hasn't in quite some time. Along the way he also meets a new employee of his company, Anna Kendrick, who is looking to revolutionize the way his business works.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick plays Natalie Keener with the elegance of a veteran actress. It is nothing less than a star making performance which steps her out from her Twilight shadow, and shows that she can in fact play the game. Her stern, hard nosed and focused portrayal of Natalie is highlight of the supporting cast. There will be great things in this actresses future provided she makes the right choices.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga shows through her character, Alex Goran, what a true talent she is as well. She shines in her scenes and has chemistry to die for with Clooney. She is perhaps the most mysterious character of all leaving everything about her to the imagination, and leaving the viewer always wanting more of her. It isn't until the third act that we find out who she truly is and why she lives the same kind of life as Clooney's Bingham.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Ryan Bingham. Clooney's range of emotions and depth is something yet seen in his illustrious career. Make no mistake about it, this is the highlight of his career thus far. His eyes tell the story of a lost man who has no clue how lost he really is. In the end it is his journey we don't want to see end. He is the reason we keep watching and hoping for a running time that never ceases.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman's direction shows his true promise and the maturity he is developing as an artist. He never comes in too close nor does he stray too far back. His lens is always at just the right angle. His visual style is really coming into it's own here. I wait, excitedly, at what his future endeavors hold.<br/><br/>Up In The Air is a film that can not be missed by anyone. A bright star in a wonderful year for film. Everything about it excels with brilliance. The entire supporting cast is spot on and it shows to be one of the best ensembles of the decade. A fitting film in this years Oscar race that deserves every bit of acclaim and all the accolades it is sure to see."
"jdkraus","10","0","4","8 January 2010"," A witty story and brilliant performances makes ""Up In The Air"" an excellent film.
","Hearing all the hype and praise for this movie, I had to go see it. I anticipated another romantic comedy that George Clooney is known for doing. Yes, there is some humor, mostly dark, and there is romance, but that doesn't make it a romantic comedy. In fact, it is a rather serious film. <br/><br/>Basically, the movie follows Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who works for a company that fires employees from bosses who are too cowardly to carry out the task themselves. This includes Ryan traveling around the country, over three hundred days out of the year. He loves his job and sees it as a service. In fact, this is all that he has in the beginning. But he quickly becomes intimate with the sexy Alex (Vera Farmiga) and has to take a new employee Natalie (Anna Kendrick) under his wing to show what his job is really like. <br/><br/>This pretty much sums up the first half of the film. But the second half pursues a more interesting storyline. As Ryan develops his relationships with these two women, he begins to change. A man who has been isolated by his job, and thinks that an ordinary life of love, marriage, and kids is malarkey attends his sister's wedding and begins to see that he desires companionship. He wants love. Now I won't give away the ending for it is both surprising and emotional. The screenwriters make it good without getting all syrupy, nor melodramatic. This plot may seem simple enough, but the controversial topic of companies firing their employees is a big part to this film and the collection of shots used of actual employees reactions when they hear the news that they are ""let go"" is priceless and scary, especially when it hits home.<br/><br/>Regarding the acting, it is top-notched. I think no other actor but George Clooney could have pulled off the role of Ryan Bingham. He's golden globe nom is well deserved. Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick are both equally brilliant in their performances, but I think Miss Kendrick has a better chance of winning than Vera, for there is more sympathy towards her character. <br/><br/>On a honest note, I've never seen a Jason Reitman film, but this movie shows that he has talent. The editing is clear-cut and sharp, and there are some great camera angles, specifically with the aerial shots of the cities and the sky. If this film gets any Oscar, which I'm sure it will, writers Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner should win for Best Adapted Screenplay. They make a simple story into a unique film. This movie proves that it doesn't take an overload of CGI to make a movie enticing; it flew by without a pause. A witty story and brilliant performances makes ""Up In The Air"" an excellent film.<br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****"

","Up In The Air is a funny and heartwarming tale of a man who's constantly traveling. That man is Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, in his most Oscar-Worthy performance since Michael Clayton). While traveling, he meets and falls for an attractive woman named Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Before I go on, I will mention to you every performance is excellent in it. I did this so I could clear that without having to type a lot more than I need to. Ryan's boss, Craig (Jason Bateman) assigns him with an assistant named Natalie (Anna Kendrick). Now I want to mention that Anna Kendrick is more cute and fun in it than she is incredible. This is not a bad thing, just that she has her own special kind of performance. The film is directed by Ivan Reitman, who surprised me with his two other surprisingly great films Thank You For Smoking and Juno. But this is by far the greatest film so far by Ivan Reitman, though. Ivan's dad is fellow director Jason Reitman, another great director. I sure hope Ivan will follow in his dad's footsteps, so I can see more great movies by him. This film screams Oscar, and I definitely recommend you see this film right away."
"drunkenhopfrog","8","0","7","6 January 2010"," Meticulous Film-Craft
","Up in the Air is a hard movie to classify. I think the best I can do is say that this it is a drama with comedic elements, but not what we would call these days a ""dramedy."" Be careful calling this a romance of any kind. George Clooney (Batman: The Worst One) brings his charismatic A-Game to Jason Reitman's film and gets help with brilliant supporting turns from Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga (whom I raved about in Orphan).<br/><br/>Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, an elite business-class frequent flier who also dabbles in motivational speaking. Bingham's full-time employment is as a for-hire executioner that companies come to to do their dirty work during these hard economic times. Bingham travels away from ""home"" 300 days a year due to this job and logs over a quarter of a million frequent flier miles annually.<br/><br/>Due his on-the-go lifestyle, Bingham has developed a personal philosophy about life, relationships, etc. that is something like a mash-up between Buddhist non-attachment and the juvenile Ayn Rand superman. Bingham's life is a stop-over of one night stands; carry-on luggage; hotel and airline executive privileges; and avoiding everyone that is not himself — including his family. Probably only George Clooney could pull off playing such a jerk and still come across as likable. This approach to life is also the one that Bingham pimps during his side job of motivational speaking.<br/><br/>Ann Kendrick is fresh from college upstart Natalie Keener who is hired by Bingham's company to revolutionize the axe-for-hire business. In short she wants to take the terminators out of the air and put them in a seat to do the deed by video conferencing. Bingham disagrees with the change and brings up enough points that his boss (Jason Bateman) decides to send Keener to the skies with Bingham to learn how to tweak her program pursuant to real life experience.<br/><br/>The last ingredient in this would-be-Oscar recipe is Vera Farmiga as Alex Goran. I have only seen Farmiga previously in the sleeper hit horror movie, Orphan, this past summer. I was stunned by how excellent she was in that movie playing the distressed and maligned mother. I made a note to myself to keep an eye out for her in this film. I did and she did not disappoint. Alex is Bingham's foil. What he does – she does; from non-attachment selfishness and one night stands to valuing airline and hotel rewards as priceless commodities. The two engage in amusing banter the first time they share the screen and the potent chemistry never lets up from that point on.<br/><br/>The movie is built around several layers of character interactions: Bingham and Natalie as he shows her the ropes and, as unlikely as it would initially appear, the human side to what he does; Bingham and Alex as they explore a completely casual relationship amidst constant plane-hopping that may be growing, against Bingham's will, into something else; Natalie and her growth from young gun for hire to an actual human; each of the character's respective relationships with their family; and the lives of all three against the back drop of the corporate world in times of fiscal turmoil.<br/><br/>There is more to Up in the Air than just that, but I would be ruining some of the nice work with character arcs and the subtly of some of the allegorical moments if I went into it much deeper. I will say that scenes at Bingham's sister's wedding and when Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick share the screen are sublime*.<br/><br/>*This includes an awesome cameo and performance by (not so) Young MC. Bust a move.<br/><br/>I personally delighted in the complete deconstructing of the third act of the film and its opposition to derivative formula. The end result is what makes Up in the Air such a hard movie to label. It's not what you think.<br/><br/>I also found it interesting that Clooney's Ryan Bingham is not the biggest jerk in the film. The fact that he is not — and who actually is — is a stunner.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is a meticulously crafted film with few or no flaws. However, though it reaches to a slightly deeper level than one may expect, it still lacks resounding profundity. That simply means that Up in the Air is the best film it can be, but it is not the best film of the year. Each of the main three performances, however, do merit some discussion come awards time."

","In a world where everybody is looking to hook up and 'not die alone', Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) and his flyaway fling Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) are the exception to this life-long rule. However when Bingham must show the young and naive Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) how his no-strings philosophy on life has improved his relationship with his job at CTC – we hire, you fire – he begins a journey which takes him - the man who has flown endlessly almost everywhere - into unknown airspace. Oh and then there's the business of reaching a select number of air-miles... Jason Reitman's (Thank You For Not Smoking, Juno) 'Up In The Air' takes a long-hard look at a life which thrives on loneliness and how this affects the relationships around him. It's mildly amusing, touching at times, and a definite Awards contender thanks to the fantastic performances from the three main lead characters.<br/><br/>Ryan Bingham has worked for years at CTC, a company which makes its money straight from the mouth of corporate greed. When a company management official hasn't got the spine to release an employee, they draft in CTC who send over somebody that can. But they do simply more than tell the employee that they have ten minutes to vacate the property, they attempt to ferry them across to a new avenue in the most fragile moment of their lives. (Beautifully appropriate, considering the recent devastating economic recession throughout the world and the rise in unemployment). Bingham lives for, and in, the air. He travels city-to-city firing employees while also hoping to give them a nudge down the right path. The only human connection he develops is with Alex, a fellow flight-hopper, who is the female equivalent of Bingham. She's strong, sexual woman who has plenty of air-miles. Yet, his idyllic life is put under the microscope when he must show the young, vivacious and ruthless CTC member Natalie Keener how to live your life constantly on the move. Curiously, and with a hint of pity Natalie asks Bingham as they walk through to the airport security station; ""Don't you ever get lonely?"" To which he replies, ""Lonely? I'm surrounded by people everywhere I go.""<br/><br/>George Clooney's central performance as Ryan Bingham, the man who lives his life avoiding commitment as a philosophy, is simply sublime. He lives his life on a schedule, just like the airlines he flies with, and this schedule leaves no time for others. Bingham is a man who is afraid of commitment and by flying for almost three-hundred and twenty days every year this allows himself to leave as little time as possible for social interaction. Social interaction, friendships, mortgages and even marriage are just another pointless blockade for this man who believes that the best way to live the ride of life itself is by carrying around an empty backpack – as this cannot weigh you down. Following Clooney, both Anna Kendrick (Natalie) and Vera Farmiga (Alex) both give equally engrossing performances as the two strongest female influences in this lonely high flyer's life. Alex is Ryan's match and the closest thing he has to a potential 'love-interest' – not that he believes in the notion of love. While Natalie becomes Bingham's closest connection to humanity, despite putting up a strong front, she is built like the majority of other human beings; with a soft, sticky, fragile centre.<br/><br/>Coupled with the great on-screen performances, Reitman also hits the right note with both his direction and his adapted screenplay (which he began writing in 2002) of Walter Kirn's original novel. Reitman employs the combination quick cuts and close-up shots of the menial aspects of Bingham's life, such as the movement from his apartment to the check-in desk at the airport. These activities may be appreciated by those that have never flown before, or have only done so a few times before, but for a man that has clocked up 350,000 air-miles in the previous year; they are nothing but a minor inconvenience to a man who loathes an establishment without a queue for priority members. While the adapted screenplay script provides a concentrated balance of amusing comedic moments, and clever, entertaining drama which in turn creates a very enjoyable film. Quirky, funny, emotional, and thought-provoking dramas certainly seem to be Jason Reitman's forte at this moment in time."

","As a fan of movie theatres and of the going to of them to see awesome movies, the holidays should, If I buy into the enormous marketing budgets of all the big distribution companies, be my favourite time of year. They seem to hold back all the cool movies for the days when the snow starts to fall. Why? Why now? Well, as it's been in the past and as it always shall be, the movies released during the last chunk of the year in North America that don't have ghosts or explosions in them might just be gunning for an Oscar. That's how it is, and being that it's well after TIFF, the Oscar buzz is flying free and easy, which means PR people everywhere get carried away and I start to roll my eyes. Previous to yesterday, everything I'd heard about Up in the Air seemed to confirm that it was a sure 'front-funner' in this big race that hasn't even officially started, which, for me (a cynical bastard who can't help but want in on the conversation) meant that I had to see it for myself. Prove it, Jason Reitman, director of Thank You For Smoking and Juno. Prove to me that Up in the Air is all that and a golden statuette, an important movie for smart, sophisticated folk, winter movie folk, folk who'd cross the street to avoid a summer blockbuster movie lovin' jerk. I dare you.<br/><br/>So anyway, as if you didn't know where this was going already, I am now definitely 100% convinced of Up in the Air's worthiness as Oscar-bait. My Oscar sense is tingling, big time, which didn't even happen after I saw A Serious Man(which was my previous favourite for 2009, but now, who knows?). I know, I know, I'm just throwing more Oscar-buzz logs onto the Oscars fire (editor's note: good one, Rajo), but this movie seems to have all the right moves: good-looking, talented actors, up-and-coming, sensitive, 2nd generation Hollywood director who knows what he's doing, a story very much set right here, right now. It's even nice to look at. But what makes it extra-super Oscar worthy is that Up in the Air doesn't even feel like it's trying that hard, which, especially at this time of year, is remarkable and refreshing. The planets just seem to have aligned for Reitman, and as a result, we movie-goers get what is basically just a great little movie, pure and simple.<br/><br/>Besides being beautifully crafted, fun and easy to watch, Up in the Air poses some meaningful questions about western human interaction at this exact moment in time in the universe, what with technology and isolation, and the internet and the facebook and the iPhone. It does so without going too far off the 'dated reference' deep end (with the exception of some slightly on-the-nose deux ex machina stuff - webcam technology threatens the livelihood of Clooney's character). It features maybe a few too many musical montages, but they don't do anything to diminish the well thought-out, thoroughly entertaining and sophisticated storytelling at play here. In Up in the Air George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a compassionate loner whose job it is to fire you when your boss is too much of a coward to do it him/herself. He flies across the country for 80% of the year, which he prefers to staying grounded, as he also happens to believe in a philosophy that paints deep relationships with other human beings as a burden. Naturally, because this is a movie, he bumps into other characters along the way that cause him to start questioning exactly what he wants, and where he's going. But interestingly, the film manages to handle this kind of relatively high-concept characterization and metaphor-laden story of human growth as if it's no big deal. Almost as if these people, all travelling through life in completely different directions, some with lots of baggage, some with little-to-none could actually exist, maybe. Which only endears them and their wacky little story to us even more.<br/><br/>Reitman, a huge fan of the ritualistic necessities of flying, poured a lot of himself into Ryan Bingham and it shows; the old saying, 'write what you know' strikes again. And besides getting the many, many details right, and casting some great actors (Clooney is charming and handsome, again, and Vera Farmiga is surprisingly good), the movie has some great music, the year's best title design and it's edited superbly well, allowing the twisty-turny story to seamlessly flow towards its satisfying if unconventional end. It basically has everything, which is why critics are going absolutely freaking nuts over it. I now have to count myself among the believers. I would gladly go see it again, and I highly recommend it to anybody who doesn't know which Oscar contenders to back, or who might just want a great night out at the movie house. It is exactly the kind of movie that is worth waiting all year for: subtle, smart and funny and sure, sophisticated. I'll just go ahead and say it: with the Best Picture nominees doubling this coming Oscar ceremony, it will not be a surprise to see Up in the Air counted among them. Deservedly so. It's that good. 8.7/10"

","Review:<br/><br/>Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" has been described as a story for today, a meditation on loneliness, and a dissertation on how globalization has at once made the world smaller and much larger. My dad thought the movie was about rejection. I thought the movie was about settling for less. Some see it as a film about careers; others see it as a film about opportunity. All these assessments are true and work in accord with one another, making a surprisingly potent film. Such is the wonder of Reitman's third feature picture. <br/><br/>George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a self described ""Termination Facilitator."" Companies hire him to come and lay off their employees in a time of downsizing. Bingham spends a vast majority of his year flying from city to city, staying in a new hotel each night. Along the way he meets the sexy Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), another professional traveler who also shares a love for life on the road. They hook up and soon after whip out their computers to find when they'll be in the same town again. <br/><br/>Matters are complicated when Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a recent college graduate, comes to Bingham's company and introduces the practice of firing people over the web. Feeling his road warrior lifestyle is threatened Bingham takes Keener on the road to show her the ropes of their field. Anna Kendrick, most notably having played Jessica in the ""Twilight Saga"" shines like a true star in this film. She has a meltdown in a hotel lobby that is comedic gold.<br/><br/>As can be expected, George Clooney plays Bingham with that confidence so customary to a George Clooney role - and yet, this time his confidence is severely challenged. He plays a man that must face times that are changing faster than he is willing to change himself. <br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" is all inclusive concerning the facets of how we live today. It ranges in topic from our post 9/11 insecurities to the inner depths of unemployment and ultimately to the incontrovertible fact that we die alone. This film is not a comedy, though it has several laughs. It is a consideration of what we need to live happily and how hard those things are to obtain.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""Fargo"" (1996). <br/><br/>Rationalization:<br/><br/>I entered the movie theater expecting to have an uplifting comedy that would reassure me everything would be OK. As it turns out, ""Up in the Air"" is not that movie, and consequently, I left the theater feeling sucker punched in the jaw. Not a hard sucker punch, but one I wasn't expecting. In fact, I would go so far as to say I was feeling blue after seeing this movie for the first time. ""Up in the Air"" resonated with me. It made me feel something and made me feel deeply. What more can I ask from a movie?<br/><br/>http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com"

","First I only watched on because of George Clooney and because I like ""Juno"" by Jason Reitman.<br/><br/>It's a bit boring at the beginning and it's hard to feel any sympathy for the main characters: people who get hired to fire other people.<br/><br/>But when you get used to the slow pace of the movie - it turns out to be really good.<br/><br/>Never cheesy or some feel-good Disney crap.<br/><br/>Realistic yet touching.<br/><br/>I really liked Anna Kendrick, too.<br/><br/>My only beef is with Vera Farmiga. Okay, it isn't her fault that she looks like a cosmetic operation gone bad - but she does a real lousy job and can't act at all.<br/><br/>She is along with so many other actresses who neither have the looks, the charisma or the talent like Julianne Moore, Kristen Stewart or Maggie Gyllenhall and so on.<br/><br/>The only thing these ""actresses"" are capable of it spoiling a nice movie.<br/><br/>Who on earth gives them acting jobs?"

","Ryan Bingham's job is to fire people from theirs. The anguish, hostility, and despair of his ""clients"" has left him falsely compassionate, living out of a suitcase, and loving every second of it. When his boss hires arrogant young Natalie, she develops a method of video conferencing that will allow termination without ever leaving the office - essentially threatening the existence Ryan so cherishes. Determined to show the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on one of his cross country firing expeditions, but as she starts to realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he begins to see the downfalls to his way of life.<br/><br/>UP IN THE AIR is a realistic outlook on life, something we don't see in films very often, and I'm not saying this because the film is about the firing of workers due to the downturn of the economy. However, that certain aspect does make the film very relevant to these days than if the film were to be released a few years prior. And ultimately, this realism that runs throughout the film is what makes it so good.<br/><br/>I would only assume the film will get nominated for however many Oscars because it deserves so many but one I'm certain it'll get nominated for is the Best Adapted Screenplay category. I usually never talk about screenplays in my reviews much because films I watch usually have a sufficient screenplay, which is nothing to scream about. However, UP IN THE AIR is a well written screenplay, filled with some great dialogue and not the ones you've heard from JUNO. This is what I call a good screenplay.<br/><br/>And there is nobody better than to say those lines from the screenplay other than George Clooney himself, who is slowly growing to be one of the more well respected actors out there because of the certain great films he chooses to star in. Clooney is very good in this film and I stress the words ""very"" and ""good."" Not only is he charismatic and funny like we usually see him in many of his films, but he branches out his performance in scenes with isolation and sadness. Here, Vera Farmiga plays an entirely different character than she did with her role in another film that was released in the same year, ORPHAN, but she is just as good or even better maybe getting her nominated for an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actress category.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick starred in last year's highly successful NEW MOON but it's apparent that she'll most likely be remembered for her role in this film. Here, she plays the naive but successful young graduate but plays it off really well that makes one think, ""Why is she even spending her time in the Twilight movies?"" Even other actors who spend probably one or two scenes in the entire film altogether, including Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Danny McBride, and Zach Galifianakis, pull off some very good performances.<br/><br/>UP IN THE AIR is not a comedy. It is, at times, dark, although there are many scenes of great humor that balances the film quite nicely. But overall, it's authentic in the way the film observes a man's lonely and isolated life who fires people for a living. I must give credit to director Jason Reitman because he is still strong after three films. Who knows what he'll do next. Funny, dark, witty, and poignant, UP IN THE AIR is one of the best films of 2009."
"Matt_Layden","8","0","6","1 January 2010"," Jason Reitman Is Becoming One Of My Favourite Directors
","George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a guy who has distant himself from family and friends. So much that he is a motivational speaker about only caring about things that really matter, or that can fit in your back pack. His job requires him to fly around the country firing people. Once this young hot shot girl comes along, she brings with her technology, a computer that makes it easier to fire people from the comfort of your own office. No more expensive flights for those guys like Bingham flying around firing people, this obviously causes a problem for him.<br/><br/>I always thought that the success of Juno was more because of Reitman than Cody, yet she was the one who got all the accolades. Both Juno and Thank You For Smoking are hilarious films with heart and are competently directed from Reitman. Both contain dark humour and themes (smoking/teen pregnancy) and yet they never cross that line of bad taste. Up In The Air is a welcomed addition and it follows the success and hilarity of Reitman's previous two films. Up In The Air is not my favourite Reitman film, that would be Thank You For Smoking, but it's his most mature work and it shows us that if he is this good now, what he has to deliver in the future will be marvelous.<br/><br/>Clooney is the lead, he has numerous plastic cards in his wallet for just about everything. Airlines, rental cars, hotel suits - he never throws them away, which comes back to hurt him when he has to try 3 or 4 of them before finding the right hotel room key. He meets Alex, played by Vera Farmiga, she is exactly like Ryan, the only difference between them, according to her, is that she has a vagina. Clooney belittles the new girl Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, who brings in new technology, but is inexperienced in the 'art' of firing people. Or in their words, letting people go so they can make an easier transition to another stage in their lives. Jason Bateman, who is Clooney's boss, forces him to take the new girl under his wing on some firing trips, before they install these new computers. It's not a sexual relationship at all, it's more of a mentor and student relationship. Clooney and Farmiga have a purely sexual relationship, until Clooney starts to fall for her and must re-evaluate his life.<br/><br/>Along the way he must take a cardboard cutout of his sister and her fiancé, you know ""like that French gnome movie"", funny Amélie reference. Natalie begins challenging all of Ryan's beliefs in life. The chemistry between the two is not only funny, but it feels real. A father figure, for her when she needs to learn about life, in her job and relationships. The romance between Clooney and Farmiga is genuine and depressing. I was able to predict some things from the film, but the way it unfolds mixes the reality of the character's lonely life into the comedic elements of the film. The film balances both of these pretty well and it never weighs one over the other.<br/><br/>As mentioned before Bateman is Clooney's boss, his role is not as funny as some would expect from him, given his resume, but he does well. As does everyone else, Zach Galifianakis and J.K. Simmons have bit parts as two employees who lose their jobs. Clooney falls into the role perfectly, he's a normal guy with elite status. He thinks he's better than others, but he doesn't have to think it. He by passes people in lines waiting to buy their tickets, argues the best place to rent a car for luxury and he has a number in mind that he wants to reach in regards of miles flown. If he gets that number, he gets another card to add to his wallet.<br/><br/>Up In The Air is funny in subtle ways and respectable in others. It's story is depressing, especially for these times, but Reitman and Co. manage make it lighthearted. This is probably one of my favourite Clooney performances, he's sly and cool and makes people like him when we should despise such a character. The film is enjoyable and will be recognized come Oscar time. I expect to see the performances being rewarded with nominations and I hope to see Reitman get another one. As I said earlier, if his first three films give any indication as to what his future career will be like, then I'm going to be enjoying all of his films."
"carol-cherman","8","0","5","28 December 2009"," Life's about-face moments
","""Up in the Air"" gives us a look at the switchtracks of our lives: those small occurrences that can get us thinking and cause us to alter our direction. They simply add up over time and one day it all comes together. We watch Ryan Bingham go through this process. And even before the change, when he's still a man who seems cold and heartless in his job, he somehow manages to do the impossible of actually leaving some of the people he fires feeling hopeful and encouraged about their future. (It reminds me of Stacy Keach's character in ""The Traveling Executioner,"" (1970) a fascinating movie to watch, if you can find it anywhere.) In the end, you want him to have that too."

","My advice to anyone thinking of seeing this is to consider your current situation. If you are in a vulnerable economic position, without a job or worried about losing your job, this could be too close to home. On the other hand, if you take some pleasure at the irony in things, maybe you'll find it a little piece of revenge. What one person takes away will be different than another. George Clooney plays his cool, usual, glib self with lines that seem written especially for him. This plot line isn't ""Glengarry, Glenross,"" though once you've seen it you may see the same kind of callousness in the characterizations. Travel the bleak landscape that is day-in and day-out business travel. On this trip the false glamour of a big expense account and a new city every 24 hours. or less, is unmasked. Ambition without purpose, nor tangible rewards, beyond material gain, comes up wanting. Is freedom from all attachments really freeing? Which one of the main characters is the real ""player"" in this movie? The twist might surprise you. Up in the Air is well made and thought provoking to the point of being painful. ""Up in the Air"" is a glimpse into America's dark heart, the devaluation of the common working man. The main actors, Jason Bateman, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick are well able to stand up to Clooney's talent and hold their own."
"abcdefz1","8","0","5","26 December 2009"," Nearly as good as you've heard
","VAGUE TONAL SPOILERS AHEAD.... ""Up in the Air"" is a terrific movie about a man who has gilded his fear of committing to others as a philosophy of remaining unencumbered. Two women in his life challenge him in very different ways, and the way his story plays out is surprisingly realistic and not at all what one usually gets from from films. Well acted, nicely directed (Reitman even lifts the junkie riffs of ""Requiem for a Dream"" for the main character's pack-one-bag fetish), superbly written. the film sags only in a couple of moments, and -- ironically -- its commitment to supporting characters could have been stronger, but this is still a fine piece of work and leaps and bounds ahead of Reitman's last film. Highly recommended."
"doralover","9","0","5","20 December 2009"," A great film, that resonates with both generation-X and Y
","Up in the Air is a film that resonates perfectly with the current times. Not only does it involve a terminating company (a company that gets hired to fire people), and women in a position of power to put forth the stand that mentality of gender equality in the 21st century, but the main character, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) represents the rolling stone mentality of so many business people in the 21st century. When asked, on an airplane, where he lives, he responds: ""right here"". Ryan ultimate goal in life differs from the typical American dream of building a family in a picket fence house – he wants to be the 7th person to reach the 10 million mile mark. He does not have a family, or even the intention to do so, he just wants to life his Up in the Air and do his job wherever it takes him. His ultimate dream is to be the ultimate rolling stone, an independent man who doesn't need anyone, because companionship means you can't life by yourself. He starts a relationship with Alex (Vera Farmiga) because they both, as she puts it, are turned-on by elite status and money. Their relationship might seem superficial, but what saves it from being just that, is that they both find themselves in the other person. She is Ryan's female counterpart, and they foil each other in a very unique way, bringing the best and the worst out of each other. Yet what makes this film magnificent is Anna Kendrick (who plays Natalie, Ryan's protégée in the termination company). She is a Cornell graduate who thinks she has live figured out by 23, and presents innovative ideas to the company that seem to make sense, but don't. If Ryan represents the intrepid entrepreneur who forgets his family because of wealth, and Alex his female counterpart, then Natalie is the Generation-Y equivalent of that. She is not interested in money or wealth in the same way Ryan and Alex are, but she is interested in having it all: the American dream, and the rolling stone dream of being independent. Being a generation-Y myself I know that the American dream doesn't work, but I can also tell that the wealthy independent entrepreneur doesn't either. Where does that live us then? Up in the Air tries to answer this question, while presenting character arcs that are both surprising and emotionally resonant, The three performances deserve the Oscar nominations they are going to get, and I can say that Anna Kendrick deserves the Oscar for best supporting actress. I haven't seen Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart yet (so I don't know if Clooney deserves the Oscar for best actor), but I have seen Precious, and although Mo'nique was extraordinary, it takes a different level of actress to sublimely act with such perfection. Their characters are people who mask their true identity in elegance and class, and when the mask melts away, that's when you see the true performance value of the actors. They don't only carry the movie along, but also make it a heartfelt comedy/drama (dramedy if you will) that resonates with everyone. It is the ultimate anti-capitalist film that is not really anti-capitalist, it's just capitalist. Jason Reitman also has the ability to mix music and dialogue to make it seem as realistic as these characters can be. He delivers his signature witty and sarcastic remarks to most of the character's interactions, and if you liked Juno or Thank you for Smoking, you will definitely like this film. Yet this film resonates more with a film like Sideways because of tone and themes, and it is no wonder the director pronounced Alexander Payne as one of his influences. Jason Reitman has established himself as one of the wittiest and realistic director's working in Hollywood, and this film proves it. <br/><br/>What makes this film a 9/10 instead of a 10/10? Some scenes are too long and some are out of nowhere. This may be in regards to the theme of life just shaking your life around, but Reitman could have handled the timing of these scenes differently, and all of the scenes that are a little off are either in the first 20 minutes, or in the last. They seem to come out of nowhere, and more explanation to the characters actions before or after could have sufficed, but that is just my opinion. In the end, it's both an entertaining film that delivers comedy, romance and the drama we all need and speaks tons to both older and younger audiences. It is a film whose demographic is people 35+ but can talk wonders to people younger who think they have the world figured out and everything is in their hands. A great film with a magnificent cast that I recommend to everyone. <br/><br/>http://mariofas.wordpress.com/"
"braidofglass","10","0","5","16 December 2009"," Clooney plays a unique man, but somehow, we can all relate...
","Up in the Air is really a well-developed character story, which makes me wonder how it came to be. Is this based on a real person? It must be, because you can feel his strengths and weaknesses--George Clooney as Ryan Bingham is just a beautifully portrayed character in this movie.<br/><br/>Anyone who's traveled can relate to Ryan. Anyone who's traveled frequently can relate to Ryan. Anyone who's traveled frequently for business can relate to Ryan. Anyone who's experienced a romantic exchange while traveling can relate to Ryan. Anyone who's been deceived and had their heart broken can relate to Ryan. But where we cannot relate to Ryan is in his lonely years of life as the married-to-his-career stoic man in a black suit, who has created a ""coccoon of self-banishment,"" as his co-star so eloquently puts it.<br/><br/>Ryan's reality is that his 'home' is being in motion, rather than in one place like the rest of us. More specifically, his home is on an American jet that's 30,000 feet above the earth, and all of his belongings fit neatly in his smooth swiveling, retractable handle, carry-on bag.<br/><br/>He has perfected the art of traveling light and quickly, which makes him the top performer at his downsizing assistance company. Like the grim reaper, Ryan moves about the globe leaving countless numbers of fragile, fired people in his wake. But he's graceful and elegant about his approach, leaving the recently unemployed person feeling hopeful in most cases. His entire existence is to be the bearer of bad news, and to give lectures to others on how to live an efficient life carrying all their important items in just one backpack.<br/><br/>Ryan's confidence is shaken when a young upstart steps in and revamps his company's system to save money on traveling expenses. She develops a remote-firing protocol which places the employee and ""termination engineer"" in front of computer screens, communicating across the miles rather than face-to-face as Ryan does it. Ryan's boss is on her side, but Ryan's not convinced that by saving money on traveling, the business will succeed without the in-person human element of the process.<br/><br/>Ryan takes his new coworker on the road with him to show her why he thinks removing the human element from firing people makes her system flawed. During this trip Ryan meets Alex, the female version of himself, and they have an instant connection. He begins to fall for her, even bringing her along to his sister's wedding. Alex seems equally smitten, and you begin to wonder if the cocoon around Ryan is shedding. He may be grounded from his traveling lifestyle if his coworker's new remote system succeeds, so why not think about being grounded with his new found love, Alex? During one of his 'you-can-fit-everything-you-truly-need-in-a-backpack' lectures, Ryan walks out mid-sentence and spontaneously flies to Alex's home in Chicago to surprise her and to no doubt sweep her off her feet. Surprise indeed! She's married with kids and her only explanation for not telling him is that she thought Ryan liked their arrangement, but that she's an adult, and her reality is that she already has a family. You can almost hear Ryan's heart breaking.<br/><br/>He's distant with his two sisters, never been married or thought about it, doesn't have a 'real' home, can fit his personal items into a backpack, and thinks that moving slow is what kills you. Ryan really becomes a unique man when he finally earns the coveted 10 million frequent flier miles award card--only the 7th one ever presented to someone. The timing for receiving this award happens after Alex breaks Ryan's heart, truly ruining a moment he's looked forward to for some time. But we finally glimpse a side of Ryan that's human, just as the movie ends.<br/><br/>Seamless plot, dynamic characters, and expert cinematography make this movie come alive. Highly recommended."
"JohnTruby","8","0","6","15 December 2009"," Transcends Romantic Comedy
","Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner accomplish a rare feat in Up in the Air, which is to write a transcendent romantic comedy. In all my genre classes, I talk about the importance of transcending your form, of hitting all the required story beats but also twisting them so the story is original to you. Transcending any genre is hard, but especially so in romantic comedy which is a highly choreographed form with 12 special story beats. The question for the screenwriter becomes: how do you stretch this narrow form and do something that the audience, which loves love, has never seen before.<br/><br/>When you want to transcend a genre, the first thing to focus on is the weakness/need of the hero. Weakness/need is the first of the seven major structure steps, the wellspring of the story and the key to the main character. If you succeed in twisting this beat, you can twist any other beat in the story. That is clearly the case in Up in the Air.<br/><br/>In all love stories, the hero's weakness is that he or she is unable to love. Ryan, the main character in Up in the Air, takes this weakness to the extreme, and in his own mind turns it into a strength. Both personally and professionally, he is the master of disconnection. Not only does he fire people for a living, with style, he is the Casanova of the sky, an artist of love and leave.<br/><br/>But the writers don't stop with this simple organic unity in the main character. In a nice touch, they show us a man who has conjured up a detailed psychological and moral justification for the way he lives. When he's not traveling the country separating people from their work family, Ryan is a motivational speaker who waxes poetic about taking the baggage of your life (ie, your relationships) out of your backpack, so you can move, be free and live.<br/><br/>The love story is the only genre that has two main characters. Once the writers establish a hero who lives at one extreme of the loner/community spectrum, they create his lover, who is the exact female expression of his life philosophy. Notice that the challenge for the writers and actress Vera Farmiga was huge: how do you create a woman George Clooney, world's most desired and eligible bachelor, would believably fall in love with.<br/><br/>Incredibly, the writers and Farmiga pull it off. She is not classically beautiful because that would be a cliché that would guarantee in the mind of the audience that Ryan/Clooney would never fall for her, much less marry her. But she is sexy and smart, and as confident a practitioner of great, free sex as he is.<br/><br/>The audience sees that in spades in her very first scene with Ryan, another love story beat – the ""meet cute"" – that the writers twist in an especially creative and funny way. Sitting in the hotel bar, the would-be lovers compare credit cards, hotels and techniques required to be a master of the love-and-leave lifestyle. The dialogue is perfect, and the actors knock the scene out of the park.<br/><br/>It is in the script's story structure, determined by the hero's desire line, that we really see why these writers are masters of the screen writing art. Notice that the concept of the film and the unique main character immediately place the writers in a terrible story bind. In the Great Screen writing Class, I talk about the difficulty of writing a story about a purposeless man. Of course, such people exist. But writing a successful story about one of them is nearly impossible, because his weakness – his lack of purpose – also means he has no desire line. Which means the story has no spine.<br/><br/>So how do the writers solve this most essential of all story problems? They have to have some spine, but it has to be true to this character's fundamental weakness. His first desire is to fly 10,000,000 miles, a meaningless accomplishment but one reached by only six people before him. Then he wants the girl.<br/><br/>Notice that neither of these goals can serve as the spine for the entire story. First, he is already flying all the time; it's the same beat. Second, he is the ultimate loner and so is she, so their meetings must be sporadic. Third, he can't find his true desire, if ever, until the end of the story at the self-revelation. So he can actively chase her only in the last 20 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>What to do in the meantime? The writers create a substitute desire line, and ongoing conflict, when Ryan takes the rookie, Natalie, on the road to show her how to fire people. Notice this has nothing to do with the hero's ultimate goal. He never makes a play for her. But she is a variation on the basic theme, having to do with the hero's weakness, in that she is even colder in how she fires people than he is. That forces Ryan to find at least some compassion in doing the work of the devil, and perhaps, just perhaps, cultivates the ground where love can grow in his heart.<br/><br/>The writers complete their twisting of the romantic comedy form by having the story turn in ways that you don't expect (and I won't mention here). Suffice it to say that Reitman and Turner take this love story to its logical extreme, which is deeply satisfying and shocking to the audience at the same time. In this, Up in the Air is similar to the great detective stories, where you look back in total surprise at who done it but realize that's the only way it could have been done. That's great writing.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at www.truby.com"
"bobbobwhite","8","0","5","15 December 2009"," shows the increasing personal detachment of our modern society
","Very slick film satire that tells a lot more about increasing personal detachment and heartlessness in the modern workplace than how companies do anything possible to avoid any unpleasantness associated with firing workers, although it did show the latter to nearly the most disgusting level possible. I did not like the movie's subject at all, but that huge negative alone should alert any critic to be very careful to make sure the story negative does not taint an honest review of the total film. This is a crummy topic told and shown well in this film and should be seen as much for its satire of craven human heartlessness and shallowness as much as for its entertainment value. My hope is that the former will teach you more than the latter.<br/><br/>George Clooney, that smiling charmer, did a wonderful job as Ryan the star terminator, contract-firing everyone in sight while showing that selfish, facile, shallow and a big smile do the best work in a dirty and dully repetitive job(involving lots of full airports)that most people would avoid like the plague, and one that would quickly emotionally execute anyone with real human feelings. Anyone like Ryan who would say that firing is a prerequisite for possible world fame and power later is surely unclear on the emotional concept at least, but for Ryan it made it almost a plus to get fired as now the really big things in a person's life could begin! The old switcheroo gets them every time! Huh, what? <br/><br/>But, when Ryan finds that his company plans to initiate video-termination(hey, a new video game?)instead of flying contracted people around to do that dirty job in person, he gets angry(maybe for the first time in his life? Remember, he's shallow)and expresses his disapproval but also his willingness to show them it won't work which he does with a vengeance. Along the way he gets to give a smarty-pants and uppity company newbie her comeuppance, find a hot but morally vacant female counterpart to play with for a while, and in the end get to continue what he does for a living as if nothing ever happened. From what I've seen of life, nothing really does happen in life to change shallow and emotionally bankrupt people like Ryan. And, we have all known some, and more's the pity for that unpleasantness."
"Phoenix1982","8","0","5","14 December 2009"," wow!!!
","George Clooney finally won me over two years ago with Michael Clayton, but Ryan Bingham from Up in the Air may well be his performance of a lifetime (let's hope there's more where this one came from) and certainly represents his best work as an actor yet. BA nomination is secured, and who knows, he may even finally get it this year.<br/><br/>Up in the Air is a fantastic film that serves up all the clichés only to shatter your expectations and turn the aforementioned clichés upside down. In the process the excellent screenplay brings the grim reality of life and how it *really* plays out most of the time to the screen, from where the actors' work projects it back onto the viewer in a wonderfully poignant way. The saddest thing of course is that Up in the Air is not going to win the Best Picture. The reason for that is the Academy will once again as it usually does (note: not always, but in most cases) vote something that is considered an *important* film instead, i.e. something that is not a Sideways_esque portrayal of regular people in their lives, more bombastic, pretentious, and preferably directed by a big-name icon. Inevitably dwarfed in the shadow of that big Oscar juggernaut will end up Up in the Air, a film that can be compared to Sideways and Juno as far as its relatively unpretentious approach to film-making is concerned.<br/><br/>Yet here is a motion picture that is thousands upon thousands times more profound. And as far as being pretentious, the layers of depth are so many, there will be much to ponder as you think back to the misleadingly simple story's intricate texture. Anyone who has ever... stopped and given some thought to the backbone of most of our lives - things like love, and marriage, and kids, and the endless running around until one gets old, is going to have an emotional response to this film, it is rather impossible not to. The amazing thing is that these responses will come in many ways as opposed to just one. The film accomplishes an amazing treat of discussing different philosophies and somehow reconciling them in the end... in the process of doing so, the screenplay uses the recurring (but by no means suffocatingly predominant, The Terminal this is not) airport setting as a means of situating the story, and its characters, against the backdrop of an environment that symbolizes diversity, portraying life as it is... that is, as anything but black and white.<br/><br/>All of the cast must be credited with what simply is a phenomenal job. I had admired Vera Farmiga's work for a while, and Anna Kendrick is a revelation (no, I have not seen the Twilight films and have no intention to, so this is my first acquaintance with her work). You have to look for the cameos. The humor is excellent and the scary parts... well, I will spoil nothing for you, but anyone who has ever been in a very dark place as far as losing faith in humankind is concerned is going to find something here. I can't think of a single dull or throwaway scene, and even the soundtrack is spot on. In the center of it all, however, towers George Clooney's performance. Subtle, to the point where some critics will without a doubt still attempt to confuse it with bleak, Clooney's work here is loaded with wonderful shades of depth. Yes, he plays a stereotype, but in the process of doing so, as all the greats have at one point or another, Clooney enables the viewer to recognize parts of that stereotype, if not the whole of it, in themselves.<br/><br/>So far, my pick for the Best Picture and it's not even close. A marvelous surprise and an absolute must-see. Bring on the nominations!"

","""Up in the Air"" is special because it's solidly good in (what used to be) an ordinary way. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. Most films today (especially American ones) open strong, continue adequately and then make a very long march to the credits, because they don't know how to stop.<br/><br/>One of the nicest things about ""Up in the Air"" is that it knows how, where and when to leave you--so you leave the theater solidly satisfied.<br/><br/>The other thing that cries out for admiration is the artfulness of the script. The film's logic is rooted, where it should be, in a fine screenplay. The actors get neat things to say, neat situations to convey, and they do a neat job with them.<br/><br/>For me, the standout performance belongs to Kendricks. Her character is sincere, complex and consistent. At the same time she's coiled, intense and unpredictable. Clooney & Farmiga, to an extent, are hampered by having to depict people who are not quite believable--although Clooney compensates with (what I see as) his trademark, dogged humanity.<br/><br/>And danged if I know why, but I always love seeing Sam Elliott.<br/><br/>This film deserves the highest rating--because, in our day, the solidly good has become heroic--and because, at its end, ""Up in the Air"" is so roundly satisfying."

","In ""Up in the Air"" George Clooney as corporate downsizing specialist Ryan Bingham asks laid off employee Bob (reliably great J.K. Simmons), ""Why do kids like professional athletes?"" Indignant Bob replies it's because they get to have sex with Victoria Secret models. Ryan reminds him that is why ""we"" like athletes. Ryan tells Bob, ""Kids like athletes, because they follow their dreams."" Ryan points out to Bob, that he sold out his dream of being a chef, to take his job. Now he has a chance to follow his dreams, and inspire his kids. Clooney is amazing. He possesses deadly deft charm that always underlies a sense of humanity. His Ryan Bingham is a self-sentenced loner in pursuit of the elite 10 million mile frequent flier status—more at home on the plane, than at home. Training in tow is idealistic Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), who envisions revolutionizing Ryan's business by terminating employees over the internet and teleconferencing. Thus, eliminating Ryan's need for travel and dashing his 10 million miles dreams. Solid Jason Bateman is boss Craig, who forces the road trip training jaunt.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is awesome, and like Clooney is Oscar worthy. Her Natalie is exceedingly bright, void of experience, and strung way too tight. As she unravels Kendrick is funny, and very human. In a great scene Kendrick silently sits outside after she fires an employee that has unexpected consequences. Clooney walks over and consoles her, saying that it is their job to make the horrendous ""tolerable"". That compelling chemistry in concert with Writer/ Director Jason Reitman's (""Juno"") narrative mastery make ""Up in the Air"" one of the best movies of the year. Reitman with Sheldon Turner wrote the screenplay from the novel by Walter Kirn. Kirn's story has been updated to the current economic upheaval and the personal turmoil in the widespread unemployment in the U.S. Reitman filmed real people, who have been laid off and must contend with paying a mortgage and feeding their families. He never dismisses the gravity of it all. <br/><br/>Reitman balances paradoxical humor and the tragedy and impact of being laid off. This is revealed in the narrative thread for Clooney's Ryan himself. Self exiled loner Ryan is captivated by fellow business traveler Alex (smart and smoldering Vera Farmiga). Alex reminds Ryan that she is like him only with a vagina. Ryan actually considers altering his status, also at the urging of Natalie, who points out that he is so full of it. He even asks Alex to come to his estranged niece's wedding in Omaha. Perhaps, there may be more to life than just flying solo? However, Ryan's karma may dictate a particular outcome. <br/><br/>""Up in the Air"" concludes not perfunctorily, but eloquently. However, particularly with Ryan and Natalie it is about following your dreams in the context of them sometimes being dashed; rather it is just that life happens. Touching Farmiga's Alex tells Kendrick, after Natalie describes the man she wants to marry: it is not about settling. As one gets older, our dreams themselves evolve, and we all have to make peace with that. ""Up in the Air"" really gets it right in one of the year's best movies."

","I will try to downsize this review of a downsize flick in less than 500 words. I am up for that even though I probably will not be able to pilot that task. Writer-Director Jason Reitman's ""Up In The Air"" is already airing it out as probably the best reviewed film of the year. Hope Reitman still stays grounded with all the Award accolades he will be receiving very soon. I am sure he will; because of his humbleness and mindset is one of the main reasons why ""Up In The Air"" is extrairdonaire! George Clooney stars in ""Up In The Air"" as a certified airhead who is always daydreaming throughout his day. Kidding! OK, to pilot this plot properly: Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a corporate downsizer who spends most of his time traveling from city to city firing away downsizing bullets by informing employees of corporations that ""their services will no longer be needed"". Bingham has an innate talent in his corporate executions in a way that it does not demean the employee, even through all the grief & anger they go through when they hear the news. Bingham does not seek comfort in completing such a task, but that is what he specializes in. He does seek comfort in living the solitary jet-set life of business travel. He also obsesses on obtaining an ultimate frequent-flyer mileage zenith goal, not for the perks but for the experience. Bingham's ""one man is an island"" life has left him still single at middle-aged with no children, but Mr. Bing would not have it any other way. Not to say he is shy and reserved, because he does possess the gift of gab. Example: On occasion, he is hired as an independent contractor to conduct ""What is in my backpack?' presentations in business seminars on prioritizing what & who is important in one's life. Other Example: He also does air out the lothario muela by meeting and bedding beautiful & intelligent women during his city stops; which by the way this is a good segue to introduce the character of Alex to all of you. Alex becomes ""Ryan's Hope"" of meeting the female version of him. She shares many of the same qualities & preferences as Ryan and also strives on living a corporate traveler lifestyle. Their connecting banter at the hotel bar where they first meet is of screenplay supremacy. Let me now stopover to Natalie. No, she is not another Bingham bang. Natalie is a novice employee of the Omaha ""downsizing services"" corporation where Ryan works. She is chatty, motivated, and straight out of college. She convinces the corporate boss Craig Gregory to consider making some technological revolutionary ""downsizing"" moves to cut cost corners. That would be for all the employees to do the axing over teleconferencing instead of city-to-city travel. Of course, Ryan loathes the idea and puts his two-cents why that would be disastrous, not to mention will also entirely change his life and keep him grounded in the republic of Non-Mutual to Omaha. In order for Natalie to obtain more hands-on and personal experience, Gregory decides to have sex with Natalie. Oops, wrong review, that was from my 1994 film review of ""Disclosure"". What I meant to say that Gregory decides for Natalie to shadow Ryan during a tour-of-axing duty in order to obtain that experience. And that becomes the lesson learning plight for both Ryan & Natalie in ""Up In The Air"". Juno that with his masterful directorial piloting of ""Up In The Air"", Jason Reitman has heightened himself to ""up in the list"" as one of the most sought out directors in the industry. His timely depiction of the downsizing humane horror was upsized with precision and authenticity in ""Up In The Air"". Also, his ""non-crash landing"" of the film's ending was unpredictable by cinematic nature. Reitman and co-writer Sheldon Turner also developed a sky-high clever screenplay. The last act of my ""Up In The Air"" review before landing is on its stellar acting. I could not visualize anyone else than Clooney to fit the Bingham bill. By George, could it be another Oscar for George? Could someone already give Vera Farmiga the kudos she deserves? The veritas is that Vera continues to excel with her acting but most average moviegoers have never heard of her. Farmiga was pitch perfect as Alex, and I will ""farmiga"" those Academy voters' offices if they do not give her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Anna Kendrick was a nice revelation as Natalie, but not yet in the ""calling the shots"" acting category. However, Kendrick is one little actress with a big future. Jason Bateman took command of his role as honcho Gregory. I am glad that Reitman did not ax and still had room to include commendable brief supporting roles by Zach Galifianakis and J.K. Simmons as downsizing victims. Hey, I even enjoyed Danny McBride's performance as Ryan's sister's fiancée ""cold feet"" groom. ""Up In The Air"" is a first-class film, that is worthy of some frequent viewer mileage. ***** Excellent"
