"robertmfreeman","8","151","188","17 September 2007"," A fun, silly movie. What's everyone whining about?
","What are people whining about? Balls of Fury was quite funny! A few years ago, the people who are now trashing this movie would have been going gaga and adding a 100 million to its gross revenue...but that's part of the problem. Tastes have changed.<br/><br/>I'm going to go on the record as saying that this movie is at least as funny as anything Adam Sandler or Will Ferrel has ever made. Why is it doing worse then? People just don't want silly, stupid comedies anymore, which is why Superbad is doing much better instead.<br/><br/>Balls of Fury is a very funny movie with a wonderful cast (especially Christopher Walken and Thomas Lennon), and if some of the jokes fall flat, or gave themselves away in the trailer, the movie moves quickly enough that it doesn't matter. They're already onto another joke.<br/><br/>Times have changed, and unfortunately for the movie, so have tastes. These days, even silly spoofs are expected to meet a required level of maturity, and for those that were raised on Naked Gun, Hot Shots and Police Academy movies, that's a little sad.<br/><br/>Go ahead, say the movie is juvenile. Say it's stupid. Just don't say it isn't funny. There were at least three moments during the movie when the entire theater was rolling in the aisles. I've never seen a SNL alumni movie do that."
"drkvas","6","99","131","10 September 2007"," All depends what you are looking for
","This movie is by no means garbage as some have posted, nor is it a great movie. Think before you buy the ticket. If you walk in expecting a spoof about ping pong w/ a cast of completely 1 dimensional characters to be a 10/10 you must live a life full of disappointment. This movie is funny, and if you didn't find yourself laughing at it you are probably already dead or on the fast track to ulcers and a stress induced stroke by age 30. This is not the first movie that approached a ridiculous subject in such silly manner. Odds are if you hate movies that have done that in the past (ie: Dude, Where's My Car, Blades of Glory, Hot Rod, etc.) you are gonna hate this one as well. As it stands right now this movie has a 4.6 and that probably a little low due to people 1 staring it because they wanted the Saving Private Ryan of ping pong movies. This movie should probably get a rating in the 6.1-6.3 category. If you have a little time to kill, have already seen Super Bad, and want a good laugh go check it out. Otherwise wait till it comes out on DVD or just ignore it. As for those who have blasted it. Go blast a movie that actually supposed to be good and isn't as opposed to picking on the 90 lb. asthmatic kid of movies. This movie can't defend itself for being stupid because is supposed to be. If you couldn't tell that from the trailer, then odds are you haven't made it this far into my comment."
"Crazy Ian","7","97","130","12 September 2007"," I liked it, I don't understand other people's problems with it...
","I laughed at this movie. I laughed a LOT. True, some of the laughs were simply because some people were in this movie that had NO BUSINESS being in it, because they are considered to belong to a higher echelon of movies. Christopher Walken and Maggie Q are usually seen in LARGE blockbusters or high-profile indies; George Lopez has a very successful TV series, not to mention MANY cameos from well-known comedic actors. These people are GOOD. When they are on the screen, funny stuff happens. The script is an obvious parody on the movie ""Enter The Dragon"", but with ping-pong in lieu of kung-fu or karate. It also spoofs the ""underdog"" motif like the ""Rocky"" movies. I dunno, all I can say is that I REALLY enjoyed this movie. I didn't expect much, and I got a lot back because of that. True, I was a little liquored up, and a second sober viewing might not pay off repeat dividends, but I had a good time. Isn't that really what it's all about? Honestly, it ain't Citizen Kane, but I've seen crappier movies... a contemporary comparison: I was NOT disappointed by this movie, and comparatively much more disappointed with the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean movie...<br/><br/>Yaaarrrr, thar be worse things under the sun, matey..."
"doolittle1","6","35","45","24 September 2007"," Not as bad as I expected
","I went into the theater expecting almost nothing good coming out of it. I read the reviews- Washington Post, USA Today, Rotten Tomatoes, etc. I knew they were horrible and quite honestly, I thought I would hate the movie. But my friend wanted to go, and me having no life whatsoever, I agreed to join her.<br/><br/>I have to say, I should go into to more movies with such low expectations, because I really enjoyed it. Was the acting superior? No. Was the script well-written? No. But it was funny and Christopher Walken makes all things glorious, so all in all, it wasn't a bad way to spend a Thursday night after an especially terrible day of work. The actors all seemed to realize that they weren't participating in a project that would make movie history and they all seemed OK with that. It was very much a movie done to simply enjoy the play on the word ""balls"" and in this particular case, it was forgivable.<br/><br/>Overall, don't go in expecting complete comedic genius and you just might find yourself laughing."
"mollymormonbrat","5","71","101","15 September 2007"," Not the greatest ""stupid movie"" made, but it certainly made me giggle.
","This has to be, quite possibly, the dumbest movie I have seen in a very, very long time.<br/><br/>However, that is not necessarily a bad thing. I don't think there was a single moment in this film that purposely wanted any smidgen of intelligence whatsoever.<br/><br/>And, heck, the reason I went to see this movie was because I thought it looked funny. And, guess what? I laughed. I don't know if this will go into the treasury of greatest stupid movies ever made, but it did leave me with a smile on my face.<br/><br/>I think it was because it was ping-pong. Yes, I like a good game of ping-pong as much as the next person, but come on. It's ping-pong. Just try telling that to these characters. The fact that anyone could take so slight a game so seriously cracked me up.<br/><br/>And that's where this movie works.<br/><br/>It's pointless, silly, and down-right brain cell killing. But I found myself forgiving everyone because they were so good-hearted in waltzing around with their idiotic humor.<br/><br/>No, it will probably not be nominated for Best Picture. But as for dumb comedy goes, this nicely held its own."
"FatMan-QaTFM","8","34","46","16 December 2007"," Mocked its own genre, not for everybody
","This is a Thomas Lennon written comedy, so you know it's going to be a little abstract, and very pacing based. Balls of Fury really did a great job of keeping in the same humor vein of Reno 911, etc.<br/><br/>Yes, there are crotch shots and other typical middle school humor, but they happened so often and with such randomness that it went from stupid to hilarious.<br/><br/>A lot of the humor is based in uncomfortable moments. Not a lot of people enjoy being made uncomfortable by something they are viewing for entertainment, but if you like that style of humor, Balls of Fury is right up your alley.<br/><br/>This isn't for everybody, so it'll either be a 10 or 1 for you. Worth the rental just to see."
"helmutty","6","21","28","30 September 2007"," Balls of fury!
","It is not that bad. I am one of the guys who like this. It is not bad comparing to the movies that were recently released in Singapore. Underdog is not very good, can't even be a superhero movie. Shoot em' up is for hard-core action fans and basically is very violent and bloody. Then it is Balls of fury which I enjoyed watching. I thought it was something like Prince of tennis, the live-action movie and the ping-pong ball fights scenes are something like that. That, the ping-pong ball fights, is the thing that attracted me to watch it. But Prince of tennis is better than this. Balls of fury got the comedy and the simple action which becomes a harmless fun movie. I like movies as long as they are fun or entertaining. Balls of fury, though fun, is considered quite dumb for some mature adults or teenagers, the director used stupid jokes like always get hit in the groin and banging into the wall. It has to be stupid to be funny. Sometimes, I admit that it is quite dumb in some of the scenes but it is fun, it got slow-motion ball fights, it got Maggie Q who is hot and it got dumb-a** jokes so what more you want for a dumb comedy.<br/><br/>Overall, it makes a harmless movie that you can watch in your free time. It can be funny sometime and it too can be dumb sometime. You may laugh or smile at some scenes. I don't know but I smiled when watching it even at the stupidest jokes. Best to leave your brains at home while watching. This movie is not to be taken seriously."
"unbrokenmetal","Null","5","5","26 August 2009"," Ping-Pong: second chance
","In a time when we are mostly given the sequel to a rip-off of a sequel to a blockbuster, I'm grateful for any movie that is slightly original, and I haven't seen any other movies yet about a Ping-Pong tournament to the death - have you? Even if some elements were familiar like the secret agents and Asian villains and although a couple of jokes fell flat, ""Balls of Fury"" has enough fresh ideas to offer to work well as a comedy. It helped that the hero was played by an unknown actor instead one of the usual comedy stars because he plays a nobody - somebody who once almost became a hero at the Olympics but lost. He doesn't deserve a second chance but gets one, anyway - encouraged by his coach with words of wisdom like ""believe in yourself when nobody else does... like now""! Maggie Q as his training partner is hot, and Chris Walken as Feng adds the eccentric element which fits the colorful scenery. I liked it."
"PWNYCNY","9","27","39","14 September 2007"," Laughter abounds
","There are some who may look down at this movie with disdain and dismiss it as just another lowbrow attempt to elicit cheap laughs. Well guess what? This movie does exactly that, and that's great! This is an incredibly funny movie, with goofy but likable characters, especially James Hong who plays Master Wong. James Hong gives one of the funniest performances ever. He was great. He made this movie happen. Also, Maggie Q was great. She is the next Sandra Oh. And the the goofy story line also contributes to the overall humor, and of course, one would be remiss if they did not mention the performance of Christopher Walken who once again proves that he is a great actor. His deadpan approach was absolutely perfect for this movie. If you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, then this is the movie for you."
"alan-1011","4","61","105","29 August 2007"," Okay, for cable
","Balls of Fury wasn't the total disaster, but when that's the highest praise I can offer, well, that's a problem. Think of it as a lesser version of Dodgeball.<br/><br/>Ping-pong just isn't that funny, or exciting, or anything really - just like the film. The idea of underground ping-pong never really goes anywhere. The jokes are okay at times, but there are no big laughs and certainly no surprises.<br/><br/>Unless you are a 10-14 year-old boy, who given the film's humor and scantily clad actresses is obviously the target market, you will probably be disappointed by paying money for it. Wait a couple of years and watch it free some night on Comedy Central and spend your ten bucks somewhere else."
"TheMovieMark","5","104","201","30 August 2007"," The jokes suffer from the ""Kate Moss, Heather Mills McCartney, and post-2000 Muhammad Ali Syndrome.""
","Taxi. The Pacifier. Herbie Fully Loaded. Let's Go to Prison. Night at the Museum. If this list of movies is an accurate representation of your DVD collection, then my friends, you either have a young child in the house or a strange fetish for average-to-below average comedies. Or ""absolutely dreadful"" in the case of Jimmy Fallon's Taxi. *shudders* I'm still trying to erase memories of that steamer from my mind.<br/><br/>Other than being part of the aforementioned pathetically sad DVD collection, do you know what else each of these movies has in common? They're all written by Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon, the duo who wrote, produced, and directed Balls of Fury. Are you trying to decide whether or not this is a film worthy of your time and money? Please let my above revelation stand as ""enough said."" <br/><br/>In all honesty, what can you expect when you take a poor man's Jack Black and give him the starring role in a poor man's Dodgeball? A little thing I like to refer to as ""not much."" Dan Fogler gives it the ol' college try, but perhaps the material is to blame for his mostly forgettable performance. He delivers a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, but by the time he's lip-synching to Def Leppard you'll be asking yourself, ""So who's this guy, and why is he doing a bad karaoke impersonation of 'Jack Black Meets Sam Kinison'?"" <br/><br/>I will give Balls of Fury three credits - 1) Maggie Q is adorable, 2) The film rightfully never takes itself too seriously, and 3) It's nowhere near as filthy as I expected. At the top of my notebook I wrote, ""Balls/Genitalia References"" and I was set to keep track. I just knew they were going to fly off the screen fast and furious, especially judging by the ""a huge comedy with tiny balls"" tagline. So I was quite shocked when the grand total was only one, and that one was merely Maggie Q's character disgustedly relaying an example of the comments she was forced to deal with from male players.<br/><br/>What more can I say about a film whose crowning achievement is, ""Well, I didn't expect much, and it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, so whatever""? That certainly doesn't send you rushing to purchase a ticket, now does it? It'll be on TNT or TBS soon enough so just have patience and watch a few legitimately good comedies in the interim. There'll come a time when you're flipping channels, nothing else is on, and you'll cruise across this. You can decide then whether you want to sit through all of it. The end result will likely be a long email thanking me for saving you $8.<br/><br/>Before I commence, let me once again bring attention to my above ""poor man's Dodgeball"" quote. I overheard several disappointed people say, ""I thought it'd be like Dodgeball."" What's that? Yeah, they said it in unison, Wisenheimer. Now shut up. The consensus? It's not even close. So if that was the opinion you formed after watching the trailer then dismiss that notion immediately. It's an interesting concept that probably contains about ten minutes of solid comedic material.<br/><br/>What ultimately happens when you stretch that over an hour and a half? Unfortunately, the jokes suffer from what I like to call the ""Kate Moss, Heather Mills McCartney, and post-2000 Muhammad Ali Syndrome."" In other words, they're flat, lame, and they pack no punch. Let's see them put THAT on the DVD cover."

","""Balls of Fury"" may be conventional, but there is a natural, fresh comedy about Fogler. With long, thick curly hair, pointy mutton chops and portly body, he has the look of someone who accidentally wandered onto a movie set, shrugged, and decided to play along. He plays Randy Daytona, a star in the underground world of table tennis competition has seen his fame decrease and luck turn sour. He attempts to recapture his former glory but is soon confronted by the FBI and asked to go undercover to smoke out a notorious criminal and ping-pong lord called Feng. He teams up with a blind ping-pong sage and Maggie Wong to complete his secret mission. the film is perfect for Naked Gun fans and Dodgeball fans."
"shaolinlooper","10","17","29","30 August 2007"," well done, funny, especially if you play TT or speak Chinese
","I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was neither Die Hard action or Three Stooges slapstick. There is a lot of subtle humor in the style of Reno 911. I am a serious table tennis player and recognized a lot of inside jokes about the lack of respect our sport gets and the characters who show up to tournaments. There was lots of funny material in the Chinese language also. I thought Dan Fogler, Maggie Q, Tom Lennon, and Jason Scott Lee were excellent. The ""Dragon"" stole the show for me. At the US Nationals, there are several amazing ""dragons"" every year playing spectacularly. Table tennis is really a great and difficult sport. You have to master equipment, speed and spin, pressure points, and even the occasional cheater. But everyone who tries the sport or comes back to it in later years, finds it addictive. It is like catnip for humans. I think many serious players fear that this movie might set our sport back or make it the butt of jokes, but I hope many will see this movie and give table tennis a try. Table tennis has been described as a mix of non-contact martial arts and chess and portions of this movie portrayed it as such. I don't think it would be suitable for young children, but teenagers won't be traumatized. Also stay for the credits, which introduce the cast and show bloopers."
"bopdog","7","24","44","30 August 2007"," Chuckle Out Loud. Quiet humour. No belly laughs, but lots of long and slow comedy, done fairly well.
","This definitely comes under the heading of ""Stoopid Comedies,"" which I happen to really enjoy. But the jokes are more wit than belly laughs. There isn't much outright slapstick--- which I would have liked. The funny parts are quiet, although not particularly subtle. The humour is more from the mild delight of seeing some old-time character actors like James Hong and Christopher Walken play out some long and slow bits over the course of the movie. Some of the humour also comes from a bit of satire--- although not of the outright ""spoof"" category. Mostly, it's just a series of improbable and goofy scenarios--- silly, whimsical, and with enough colour and dash to be enjoyable. If you want laugh out loud comedy--- you'll be disappointed, although I, and the audience, chuckled out loud. If you want a pleasant enough folly, then you'll probably be satisfied."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","17","30","22 December 2007"," Wong As 'Hong' A Surprise In This Pong Farce
","If you like ping pong, laugh at the insane characters Christopher Walken likes to play, enjoy dark comedy, don't mind a bunch of stupid-but-funny scenes and a wildly outlandish story....you should like this movie. I did, and I realize it is a dumb movie....but it's fun and it's entertaining. <br/><br/>In many respects, this is a typical farcical comedy of today, with the same ingredients you see in many of them - the same type of outrageous characters (everyone in here), the typical spy story and Nazi villain (will Hollywood move on, in that regard?), tons of sexual innuendos and scantily-clad babes, an ugly-and fat-male lead and total absurd humor. It's the latter that I like, and I can't recall how many times I laughed out loud at some ridiculous sight or sentence that I saw in here.<br/><br/>Walken, even though he doesn't play the lead guy is fascinating, as always in his typical off- the-wall role. To me, though, James Hong, an actor in his late '70s, just about stole this film as ""Master Wong,"" the blind instructor. He was flat-out hilarious and had a lot of great lines. Of course, so did Walken and the film's star, Dan Fogler (""Randy Daytona""). and the villain Thomas Lennon as ""Karl Wolfschtagg."" Kudos to Lennon for also co-writing the script.<br/><br/>Other reviewers here who wrote ""silly but entertaining"" hit it right on the nose. That's what it is, and that's what you should expect. Humor-wise, it is another ""Dodgeball,"" except now it's ping-pong, and it's funnier.<br/><br/>In addition, you get profound words to live by, such as ""To die like a tiger is better than living like a pussy."" Hmmmm."
"tajoholic","Null","15","26","16 September 2007"," Silly but entertaining
","Not the greatest comedy of the summer, but it had its fair share of laughs. Some of the situations were pretty amusing and some of the lines were laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken seems to always make the best out of his roles, whatever he's given, he makes it his own. And this is no exception. The script wasn't rolling on the floor funny, but it had its moments. This would qualify as a good choice for a matinée-priced movie, I'd say.<br/><br/>As an aside, I don't know WHY ON EARTH that African American lady who played Christopher Walken's female henchman keeps getting roles (she played Jennifer Love Hewitt's antique shop partner for a while and stunk in that role too)."
"moviemaniac008","7","19","35","29 August 2007"," Balls of Fury is Hilarious!
","I got a chance to see Balls of Fury in a premiere. It is hilarious! Let's start with the main actors: Of all of the main characters, I found Master Wong(James Hong) and Mr. Feng(Christopher Walken) really convincing. The others, such as Dan Fogler(Randy Detona), Maggie Q(Maggie Wong) and George Lopez(Ernie Rodriguez) were also convincing. The story seems like crap when you first read the synopsis, but believe me, it's actually Ping-Pong that makes us laugh for a whole hour and a half. If you saw it, and you liked it and you're actually reading this review, then you must know what I'm talking about. I highly recommend this film.<br/><br/>Why? Because it is unique. It's the kind of film that you might want to see over and over again, and, despite it's stupidity, will still like it"

","Seems that a lot of people are writing reviews and judging this movie pretty harshly. Movies are used by many as a form of escapism, I think this movie did an excellent job of this. It was a silly movie that was enjoyable to a broad audience especially if you like table tennis. I think Dan Fogler did a decent job and Christopher Walken's character was interesting. George Lopez was also way better then i expected he did a decent job. Anyone that takes their movie watching seriously enough to not find the male sex slaves, or panda humor funny i pity you. This should be getting a much higher rating then most are giving it."
"dyl_gon","1","26","53","31 August 2007"," Christopher Walken has balls to appear in trash like Balls of Fury
","If hit-to-the-groin jokes are your cup of tea, then look no further than Balls of Fury, the newest comedy from the minds behind Reno 911. Not only are there punches to the groin, kicks to the groin, and paddles to the groin, there are even chopsticks and metal spheres to the groin! If, on the other hand, you're looking for something with a little more comedic value then men being hit in their nether regions, avoid Balls of Fury like the plague.<br/><br/>The plot, which serves no purpose but to string together a multitude of lame jokes, follows Randy Daytona, a 12 year old ping pong prodigy, who is sweeping the ping pong world by storm. Unfortunately he ends up losing an important match, becomes a laughing stock and his father, who was involved in illegal gambling, is murdered.<br/><br/>19 years later, Daytona (played by third rate Jack Black wannabe Dan Fogler) is washed up and performing ping pong tricks at a run down theatre. FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez (George Lopez), who has been assigned to take down Feng (Christopher Walken), a criminal mastermind who runs an underground ping pong tournament, decides to enlist Daytona to help take Feng down. Daytona, besides making a comeback in the ping pong circuit, wants to get his revenge on Feng, who incidentally, was responsible for his father's death. So Daytona and Rodriguez go undercover, infiltrating Feng's annual ping pong tournament, where they...get hit in the balls.<br/><br/>There are two very confounding things about Balls of Fury. The first being how a script so utterly bad was green lit and produced. The movies plot doesn't make a lick of sense and ambles on from one random scene to the next. In one moment, Daytona and a female ping pong master are shown as hating each other...and out of nowhere, a minute later, they are suddenly love interests. It would've been nice for the writers to put a little bit of effort in and at least include something leading up to that. Another scene has Daytona refusing to join Rodriguez in taking down Feng, only to learn that a water park has been built next to his father's tombstone. How does that provide any motivation for Daytona to strive to take Feng down? The answer is it doesn't, as the writers were to busy writing in jokes to develop a good story.<br/><br/>This wouldn't be such a big deal if any of the jokes were actually funny. Sadly, half of the jokes either involve testicles or an old blind man walking into things, or in some instances, a combination of the two. It's not funny unless you're 12 years old (I wouldn't be surprised if the writer actually was). Not only are the jokes unfunny, they've been done hundreds of times before and done much better. When Balls of Fury does manage to include some original jokes, it involves stuff like the aforementioned water park being built next to a tombstone, which sadly enough, is less funny then the blind man falling down a staircase.<br/><br/>The second mind boggling thing about this movie is how they managed to stick Christopher Walken in this film as the villain, Feng. There are a few other relatively known actors in here, but Terry Crews has already been making appearances in terrible movies for a while now (Norbit anybody?) and Maggie Q still hasn't become a house-hold name. But Christopher Walken? Walken is an amazing actor and it's a crime to see him act in crud like this. He's been in a few duds in the past (Envy springs to mind), but he's never sunken to this level before. Walken isn't fading out or losing appeal, in fact he just had a role in the critical and box office hit, Hairspray. How could he read a script that terrible and agree to take on a big role as the villain? The only reasonable answer seems to be that director Ben Garrant blackmailed him into taking it, as I've got to much respect for Walken to believe he'd actually willingly agree to.<br/><br/>Walken manages to get a few laughs, which is an impressive feat in a movie like this, and steals every scene he's in. Despite working with crummy material, he still puts in a decent comedic performance as Feng, far outshining the other actors. Dan Fogler is the least funny leading man since Jimmy Fallon and mugs for the camera every opportunity he gets, imitating Jack Black as best as he can. George Lopez and Maggie Q play their roles completely straight, which doesn't work in a movie so absurd. By the end of the movie, you'll be wishing they axed the main characters and just made a movie about Feng instead.<br/><br/>The tagline for Balls of Fury reads ""A Huge Comedy with Tiny Balls"". On the contrary, it took a lot of balls to make this movie. It took balls for director Ben Garrant to release the film without Alan Smithee in replace of his name in the credits. It took balls for Christopher Walken to act in this trash and risk losing his credibility as an actor. It took balls for Rogue to screen the film for critics, as if they expected any good reviews. Yep, it took a lot of balls to make this movie. What it didn't take to make the film was any talent. Balls of Fury is a horrid excuse for a film, and if you're looking for a funny movie to see in the theatre, go see Superbad or Hot Rod. Hell, you can even go see Halloween, as a film about a serial killer is bound to be more funny then this trash."
"Rogue-32","6","19","37","30 August 2007"," Enough balls for everyone
","So I went to see this yesterday - had a good feeling about it from the previews, with the clever title, all the furious ping-pong playing and of course Chris Walken in that hilarious get-up, figured it'd be worth a shot. Balls of Fury is a lot of fun, with a great central performance from Dan Fogler, who grows on ya with every scene. Walken and the rest of the excellent supporting cast contribute as well, with Maggie Q. being the stand-out she always is, although everyone is good here. The energy never lags, the jokes and the situations are funny without being seriously mean-spirited - it's just fun, plain and simple. You don't have to be a ping pong wizard to appreciate this film, you simply have to come with an open mind and a new cricket for the master."

","Created by the same people behind the TV series 'Reno 911', ""Balls of Fury"" is really no ball of fire, but it passes the time amiably enough. Alright, so it IS pretty stupid. But it's not exactly aiming high in the first place. Some jokes do get dragged out too long, and there are awkward moments. Still, as it clocks in at just over an hour and a half, it doesn't go on any longer than it should. At its best, it does generate some modest chuckles here and there.<br/><br/>The cast is really more engaging than their material. Dan Fogler stars as Randy Daytona, a star ping-pong player at age 12 who gives up the game for 19 years before being persuaded to pick it up again by Federal agent Ernie Rodriguez (George Lopez). The Fed needs Randy to infiltrate a tournament presided over by arch-criminal Feng (Christopher Walken, at his most Christopher Walken-esque). It turns out that the bad guy is an avid ping-pong fanatic.<br/><br/>Working as a spoof of both action movies and sports movies, ""Balls of Fury"" is agreeably silly at times. Its characters are reasonably endearing and entertaining, and it's hard to knock a story (written by co-star Thomas Lennon, who plays the swaggering Kraut Karl Wolfschtagg, and director Robert Ben Garant) with an affection for the music of Def Leppard.<br/><br/>Lots of familiar faces here: Maggie Q as the luscious (and badass) love interest, Terry Crews, Robert Patrick (don't be fooled by his prominent billing; he's barely in the thing), Diedrich Bader, Aisha Tyler, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Jason Scott Lee, David Koechner, Patton Oswalt, David Proval, Masi Oka. But it's the legendary character actor James Hong who steals the show, in a gem of a comedic performance as the blind, Mr. Miyagi-like mentor. Walken, unsurprisingly, is a hoot as the villain.<br/><br/>Of course ""Balls of Fury"" is no modern classic, but sometimes a ""good"" no-brainer comedy is just what some people look for to pass the time. It's certainly not as terrible as it's been made out to be.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

The premise is incredibly silly to be sure but it is one of those movies that everyone seems to be having a good time.<br/><br/>DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

","Amusing comedy staring Dan Folger who won a Tony for the 25th Annual Putnum County Spelling Bee. The film concerns a Ping Pong Tournament run by madman Christopher Walken. A spoof of films like Enter the Dragon and everyone of those spy films where the FBI or CIA use a regular Joe for a secret mission this is an amusing romp I'm glad I didn't pay big bucks to see on the big screen. Don't get me wrong its a funny movie but not worth the 11 bucks it would take to see in a theater. Dan Folger clearly is a man of limited ability,He's okay here but its clear between this and Good Luck Chuck he's headed for a limited film and TV career in supporting roles. As I said he's good the role doesn't require him to do little more than mug at the camera and he's fine, but I doubt very much he'll be able to ever really do more than that. Christopher Walken on the other hand is a scream, and its clear why he took the role, he can go as far over the top as he wants and still be amusing. The rest of the cast including veteran James Hong and comedian George Lopez is up to snuff, though Maggie Q is given little to do other than look good. Absolutely worth seeing on both DVD and cable."

The way in which he delivers his lines are priceless and humorous in themselves no matter what the line even is. He definitely was an impressive part of the film.<br/><br/>The overall storyline is so ridiculously absurd that it makes the film that much more humorous. It achieves what it set out to do and that is be a comedy that requires absolutely no deep thought on the audience's part but will definitely keep you entertained and laughing. There are a few great one-liners in there as well that I am not going to spoil for you. The guys from Reno 911 hit the nail on the head in this absurd comedy.

","Seriously it was. My brother and I watched it, and the theater contained 6 people!

This film is hilarious with a capital H! It makes fun of all those kung-fu films. We all need a good laugh, and what is the best way to end it with an original comedy. This film not only screams hilarity, but pure originality. In a world where Hollywood gives us nothing but drivel (i.e. with all the sequels, remakes, and film-adaptations of TV shows and cartoons), this movie sticks out as an original. A must watch. Rated PG-13 for comical violence, language, and sexual reference."
"APOTimber","6","6","10","2 September 2007"," A good, not great, comedy
","I'll start off by saying that I'm in my early 30s, Chinese-American, and played quite a bit of ping pong in my youth. Now on to the movie.<br/><br/>I remember the first time I watched competitive ping pong in the Olympics and was amazed by the skills displayed, especially at the speed and accuracy of the players. This movie captures that, and then takes it to the best levels of spoofing and parody. Any scenes featuring ping pong balls are very amusing in the effects and performance. Sprinkle in some amusing dialog, and some physical comedy, and you'd probably have a very good movie.<br/><br/>However, that isn't the whole movie. While not spoiling it too much for people, the plot draws heavily from Enter The Dragon and any scenes resembling dialog from Star Wars should probably have hit the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The cast was a good collection of characters, including Christopher Walken who plays the bizarre characters to the hilt. James Hong plays his stereotypical role well as always, and Dan Fogler was quite good reminding me of the late Chris Farley in many ways. Maggie Q and Aisha Tyler are hot on screen and look for cameos by Heroes' Masi Oka and comedian Patton Oswalt. George Lopez was okay, and I'm still trying to figure out how low Jason Scott Lee's career has gotten for his role in this movie.<br/><br/>Not a side splitting comedy by any means but provided enough laughs despite higher expectations. It's not as good as Dodgeball or Shaolin Soccer as a comedy, so I'd recommend waiting for rental or cable unless you identify with ping pong in some way. So I give it a 6/10."

Of course,there's added incentive for the one-time Olympic contestant turned wash-out:his hard-gambling father was one of the many victims of the nefarious Feng.<br/><br/>It is Oh-so-tempting to give this film a higher rating for me,because I found this film genuinely funny and also wise enough to understand just HOW clichéd and unoriginal the film's plot devices are(a quick list: aforementioned washout re-finding his game,wise old sage teacher,the tough-as-nails female lead/potential love-interest for male lead,high-stakes tournament),hence my summary line. Director Robert Ben Garant and co-writer(who also plays arch-baddie competitor and Cold war German stereotype Karl Wolfstaadt)Tom Lennon create a crass but effective comedy.

THat's good for the film in a microcosmic sort of way(i.e.the laughs)but it doesn't distinguish itself from other,similar-themed movies(Kingpin,Blades of Glory come immediately to mind).

","Ben Garant joined with fellow Reno 911!er, Thomas Lennon to write this comedy, before getting behind the lens for his first feature film, while Lennon took the supporting role of German champion Karl Wolfschtagg. However, the star here is Dan Fogler, in a Jack Black kind of role as a Ping Pong protégé turned has-been, Randy Daytona. The acting is fine, and it's always great to see Christopher Walken back on screen. The story is pretty much a by-the-numbers spoof of Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon, with some James Bond, Scarface and every clichéd martial arts film ever made. The script, the bread and butter of every comedy, is only passable, with more smiles and chuckles than laughs.<br/><br/>Randy Daytona loses the 1988 Olympic Gold medal for ping-pong, and his father on the same day, and becomes a has-been haunted by his line, ""I'm going to Disneyland"". Daytona gets another chance when he is approached by FBI agent, Ernie Rodriguez (played by George Lopez), to go undercover at an underground ping-pong tournament run by the evil criminal emperor, Feng (Walken). After a gruelling training regiment under Master Wong, played well by veteran actor, James Hong, and his daughter, Maggie (Maggie Q) who looks great and has some very cool moves.<br/><br/>This review has come out pretty positive, but, although there are some good characters and ideas here, there is a lack of really funny jokes and, really, in a martial arts spoof about ping-pong that is packed with more talent than Tiger Woods, it shouldn't have been that hard to get a few really good laughs.<br/><br/>This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com"
"jdesando","Null","9","18","28 August 2007"," Not Powerball
","For a slacker comedy, one of the indexes I think I will use is how many times the hero is kicked in the groin. In Balls of Fury, ex-ping-pong Olympian Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) is kicked in the titular region at least three times, making this a pratfall-prone, intellectually-challenged comedy with enough low-level laughs to satisfy base cultural instincts. He is hired by the FBI to smoke out a world-class villain Feng (Christopher Walken) with an affinity for table tennis.<br/><br/>The echoes of Karate Kid and Enter the Dragon are fleeting, looking like great dramas next to this uneven revenge/kung fu comedy.<br/><br/>The laughs, especially those that have Randy bouncing his ball off an opponent's face (you have to see it in its context to enjoy), are enough for even my guest laugher, Patricia, to continue her mirth marathon with her son. But the jokes are usually base, elevated by the presence of Christopher Walken, who has perfected self parody to an extent that laughs abound before he says his first line. His fey Fang is amusing given his usually virile roles, but he makes credible the claim that he ""dresses out of Elton John's garage sale."" Maggie Q as Maggie is slender and charming, lending a martial arts aura to the proceedings, satirizing the genre with charm.<br/><br/>Def Leppard does its best to keep the action at least musically interesting, its ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" rendition by the cast a high point, albeit in the closing credits. The revenge-themed dramas of this summer will not suffer by comparison. The superior summer slacker spectacles, Knocked Up and Superbad, are not in danger of competition from this lightweight fin de summer competitor.<br/><br/>Balls of Fury is just a slight amusement lacking the power suggested by its title."

"jon.h.ochiai","8","5","9","5 September 2007"," Hysterical ""Balls""
","Academy Award Winner Christopher Walken stars as the evil Feng in ""Balls of Fury"". That's about the closest in context to an Academy Award that ""Balls of Fury"" will ever get. This is an absurd role choice for Walken, who is painfully funny. Director and Writer Robert Ben Garant's ""Balls of Fury"" is low budget, cheesy, and just stupid funny. ""Balls of Fury"" is hysterical and laugh out loud funny. Garant along with co-writer and star Thomas Lennon demonstrate their own pairs when it comes to take no prisoners comedy. Granted a lot of their rapid fire jokes veer off target, but quite often they land without mercy. There is a classic line as ping pong Master Wong (James Hong) advises his charge Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler), ""It is better to die like a tiger, than to live like a pussy"" ""Balls of Fury"" has its moments of clever genius. Keep in mind, Garant and Lennon's art is shameless camp.<br/><br/>""Balls of Fury"" is a blatant parody of Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"". Instead of the villainous Han holding an exclusive martial arts tournament on his island off the coast of China inviting the world's best martial artists, we have the evil Feng (Walken) holding a ping pong tournament at his compound somewhere in Central America inviting the world's best ping pong players. This is a ping pong tournament to the death. We are vividly reminded of this from the ""Balls"" trailer. The ping pong tournament is apparently a cover for Feng's nefarious business activity. FBI Agent Ernie Rodriquez (comedian George Lopez) believes that if he can get a man to infiltrate Feng's Tournament, he could expose the operation. That man would be Randy Dayton (Dan Fogler).<br/><br/>Randy Daytona was America's darling kid hopeful for Olympic ping pong Gold at the Seoul Games of 1988. During his semifinal match with whacked out German Champion Karl Wolfschtagg (over the top funny Thomas Lennon), Randy experiences a catastrophic collapse. He never recovers. Now 19 years later, Randy is performing ping pong dinner theatre in Reno. Randy reluctantly enrolls in Ernie's covert mission. Feng may have been the man responsible for Randy's father's death, so for Randy this is also a mission of vengeance. However, it is unclear for Randy himself or the audience. Randy clearly is no longer the Olympic competitor he once was; thus, he must train with revered ping pong master and Chinese restaurant owner Master Wong (hysterical Hong). Master Wong is blindpart of his enlightened charm. Wong also risks his livelihood and reputation by taking on ""round eye"" as his student. Wong's hot niece Maggie (beautiful Maggie Q) helps instruct Randy in the Way of Ping Pong. Maggie is also a deadly martial artist as demonstrated in a hilarious beat down of wannabe gropers. Feng too, may have been responsible for Maggie's father's death.<br/><br/>Feng was Master Wong's best student. Now this is Randy Daytona's time. Will Randy dig deep down, and discover that 'it is not the paddle, but the man'? Will he fall in love with Maggie? Will he reclaim his inherent greatness at Feng's Tournament? Well, part of the inexplicable charm of ""Ball of Fury"" is its predictability, and its off the wall gags. There is a side splitting joke about Feng's sex slaves that features the great Diedrich Bader. And Randy's match with the notorious Dragon is hilarious.<br/><br/>The bizarre casting completes ""Balls of Fury""'s glorious camp. As mentioned before, Christopher Walken is hysterical. He carries off the Elton John Captain Fantastic couture like a champ. Walken plays the role totally straight. His aloof cool is deadly. This is the first time I have ever seen Dan Fogler. Fogler is short, fat, goofy, and not at all athleticthe perfect antithesis of a Bruce Lee hero. This makes perfect sense. Fogler is naturally funny and self absorbed. He has impeccable timing and delivery. Maggie Q is deadly sexy as Maggie. She displays an effortless touch for broad comedy, and has star presence. She is great. James Hong is completely hilarious as blind Master Wong. He is so over the top funny with some of the movie's best lines. Terry Crews makes a masterful ridiculous turn as defending U.S. ping pong champion. Even Jason Scott Lee (""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"") turns up in ""Balls"".<br/><br/>""Balls of Fury"" is not a cinematic tour de force by any means. But for what it is, a stupid funny movie, ""Balls"" delivers. ""Balls of Fury"" is laugh out loud funny, and fun to say."

","I knew going into the theater after seeing the previews that this was going to be a stupid movie. How could one NOT know? Look at the title people! Don't go complaining about it if you're not smart enough to figure out a ping-pong comedy was going to be stupid.<br/><br/>What wasn't stupid, however, was Christopher Walken. He did an awesome job, though he always does an awesome job. I'm pretty sure all they did to get Christopher Walken to play this part was show him the wig he'd be wearing and an outfit or two and said ""the movie is about ping-pong"" and he went ""Okay, I'm in!"" That exactly how I image it, because Christopher Walken is awesome enough to do something like that and still do a great job at a stupid role.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this movie, however, is the panda bear. Christopher Walken as Feng takes the moronic hero into his den of evil ping-pong memorabilia then comments that he got a panda, but thinks it's dead, because he could not figure out how to feed it. Later one of the male sex slaves runs back into the soon to be exploded compound to save the panda, only to run out a few minutes later and comment that the bear was already dead, poor panda."
"DillonCometh-1","3","8","18","2 September 2007"," Diedrich Bader Steals the Show
","Much like a lot of comedies recently, Balls of Fury does a good job of appealing to the 13 and under crowd. People looking for a comedy that's smart and keeps the laughs coming should avoid this film. Reading a plot synopsis of this film, it certainly sounds promising, but experience it first hand and you can really get an idea of how it can't deliver. Dan Fogler is about as unbelievable as they come. The filmmakers seem like they want his character to be a bit over the top, but he seems like a mix between Jack Black and Chris Farley and he fails miserably. Christopher Walken is hilarious, but with the script as weak as it is, a lot of his potential humor is lost. George Lopez has his funny moments and he could have had more if the film would have played up his desire to be a James Bond-like hero. Diedrich Bader steals the show as a male sex slave with some affection for pandas, but this isn't saying much as he's only in the film for all of 5 minutes.<br/><br/>All in all, Balls of Fury should be avoided. What could have potentially been a send up of an obscure sport (ie Blads of Glory), turns out to be an uninspired waste of time and money. For good humor that can really be enjoyed, check out Superbad. I hated that movie too, but it is leaps and bounds above Balls of Fury."

Terry Crews never fails to entertain, Maggie Q has never been hotter and surprise-surprise, she can do comedy. same thing applies for Jason Scott Lee, he was equally good in his part. Chris Walken is having a blast as the villain Feng. You can always tell when Walken is merely collecting a paycheck. That is not the case here. Dan Fogler in the lead was a pleasant surprise. He had several stand-alone moments were he shined and was certainly better suited for this part than, say, a manic Jack Black or a twitchy Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>In short: Consistently VERY funny movie, with a top notch cast kicking ass..<br/><br/>I don't usually gush about a movie like this, but this one really caught me off guard.

The tournament becomes a back drop for Chinese themed jokes, everything from the wise master to sex slaves; Christopher Walken having a blast as Feng, Maggie Q kickin' ass (as usual) and our looser hero making good to the sound of Def Leopard.<br/><br/>Balls of Fury is absurd comedy in the same league as Shaolin Soccer and Dodgeball, and sits quite comfortably beside them as an emerging genre of wacky sports comedy. If you have a stomach for the ridiculous, enjoy seeing Chinese clichés parodied to the max, and find Christopher Walken amusing, than this is for you.<br/><br/>Final mention to Jason Scot Lee, a great comedy performance and should be utilised more often."

","Balls of Fury is a fun movie filled with the kind of stereotypes that are sure to offend the thin-skinned while amusing others who can appreciate unsophisticated comedy without sifting it through a PC filter or expecting Oscar winning performances. For what its worth the actors were well chosen and did a good job with the material they had to work with. Two actors stand out in particular: Brett Del Buono, who played the young Randy Daytona was very engaging and with little dialog and short screen time managed to use body language and facial expressions to define what turned out to be the fairly complex older Randy as played very well by Dan Fogler. As usual, Christopher Walken was marvelous, playing the mostly malicious yet charmingly capricious arch-villain Feng as only Christopher Walken can do. Having never seen George Lopez perform before, I don't know how funny he is as a comedian but I enjoyed his performance as a funny straight man in this movie. In fact, regardless of what others might say about the movie itself, all of the actors and actresses (is that PC?) were excellent in their parts. Aisha Tyler, as always, was luscious to look at as Mahogany, Feng's matter of fact ominous eye candy, and Maggie Q as Maggie Wong, the love interest, was ""Sexcellent,"" whether she was kissing, carping or kung fu fighting. I give this movie a ""9"" and predict that unless it succumbs to the numbing effects of some follow-the-pack early reviewers, it will grow on audiences as more and more viewers learn to relax and enjoy it without preconceptions and knee-jerk analytics. It's just a movie. It's not uplifting, enlightening or in the best of taste. It's kind of silly, and like any good spoof it's predictable in format but not in detail, with some scenes over the top and others underplayed. All in all, its just entertainment and I enjoyed it."

","WELL! How should I start this!? Inevitably, I had the gut-feeling this movie was yet ANOTHER teen flick amongst the pile of 2007 'flops', but to my amazement, this one special and glorious movie, actually pulled it off!<br/><br/>Dan Fogler, AKA; Andy Daytona, plays a forth-coming part in his role as the 'Ex' Ping-Pong champion of the nineteen eighties league, sure, he had his moments where the script lines became flared in my eyes (bit boring, in another sense), but overall, the overweight, sweaty and hairy actor actually pulled through the budget comedy without much hassle. <br/><br/>Ironically, on the other hand, the infamous Christopher Walken, AKA; Feng, played perhaps one of the worst parts in his entire career -- sure, the man's trying to be a diverse actor, but the sensation of him taking this role in the movie, is more embarrassing than his short lived five minute scene in 'Pulp Fiction' harbouring a watch where the sun-don't-shine for a child (Bruce Willis, if you've seen the movie).<br/><br/>In all honesty, the movie made me laugh like crazy at points - Why!? Because the British/English have a very dry sense of humour and this movie dictated that role immensely well and even at some parts in the film, the movie conveyed a somewhat dark comedy that had me wondering a little to myself. <br/><br/>Overall, the Movie could've been better - without a shadow of a doubt, but for a quick laugh and continuous on-beat comedy throughout, the movie fails to not make you grin or laugh from beginning to end, getting a real good thumbs from me on laughter, but a big thumbs down on conveyed acting skills - particularly by those who've been in the trade for a while."

I couldn't stop help wondering, who this pingpong player is? Never heard about this. The only Pingpong player I know that kinda is legendary is a Swedish Tabletennis player ""Jan-Ove ,The Walking tree, Waldner"" That is the most famous player in the world and China. And its the Chines that calls him the Walking tree, just because hes ability to always return and wins everything.

"dfranzen70","5","2","3","5 September 2007"," Deflated balls
","Balls of Fury is amiable to the point of being gregarious, but many of its jokes - verbal and visual - either just miss or misfire completely, and when it's over you start thinking of better ways you could have spent the previous ninety minutes. Highlights include Christopher Walken's waaaaay over the top performance as Feng, a mysterious, rich, eccentric ping pong fan; Thomas Lennon as an ubermean German Olympian; the luxuriant Maggie Q as a table tennis champion who dresses in skimpy short-shorts; and comically terrified male sex slaves.<br/><br/>Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) was once a promising young ping ponger. Back in 1988, he made the U.S. Olympic team and was all set (at age 12) to win against Lennon's Karl Wolfschtagg when he slipped and fell and couldn't return a serve, thus not only losing his chance at a medal but also sealing his father's fate, as the elder Daytona had bet heavily on the match. Years later, the adult Randy is approached by FBI Agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) to help the government nail the guy who had Randy's pop iced - a mysterious man named Feng, whose face no one's photographed or even seen. The feds know Feng's up to evil plans, but they need Randy to enter a private, super-secret ping pong tournament run by Feng at his undisclosed lair so they can get the goods on him.<br/><br/>Randy sucks at ping pong now, though, so he must undergo Karate Kid-like training under the wise tutelage of the blind Master Wong (James Hong). To make sure no stereotypes are left alone, Wong also runs a Chinese restaurant. Oh well, at least he doesn't say the whole training bit is an ancient Chinese secret. Anyway, Wong's got a niece, or daughter, I've already forgotten which, who is superdupercrazygood at competitive ping pong. She can even fend off four players while taking orders over the phone at the restaurant, she's that darn good. Of course, it falls to her - that would be Maggie Q playing (get this) a woman named Maggie - to train the living bejeezus out of Randy. It should be pointed out here that while Maggie is sensual, gorgeous, and overall wonderful, Randy is fat, slovenly, a little sarcastic. In other words, it's a typical movie love-match, isn't it? From the moment Maggie puts Randy's arm in a chicken wing, you know they're gonna hook up.<br/><br/>But the real fun comes at Feng's tournament. For one thing, Walken's Feng is wearing a different outfit every time you see him, seemingly; he's sort of like Ming the Merciless, only not as bland. Walken vamps like only Walken can vamp, but it's sort of easy to steal a movie from guys like Fogler and Lopez. Even so, it's hard to overstate how much Walken overacts, even for Walken. If you're not a Walken fan, that is to say, you'll find nothing to like about this movie. Sure, some may call it hammy acting, but it's acting... nonetheless... isn't it? Then there's the tourney itself - it's sudden death, you see, and that's meant literally. Lose, and you get a blowdart to the neck, courtesy of Feng's right-hand chica, played by Aisha Tyler. And of course, along the way the underdog Randy must face his old enemy Karl, who so gleefully ended Daytona's amateur - and professional - career nearly twenty years earlier. But Randy's not even sure he wants to stick around, seeing as how everyone's getting killed. He's funny like that.<br/><br/>Balls of Fury, brought to you by the guys behind Reno 911 and A Night at the Museum, does have its moments of funny, but by and large it suffers from a scattershot script and haphazard directing - it looks almost like it's some film student's final thesis project thingy. It's not quite as good as it should have been, and it's not nearly funny enough to be worth a theater ticket."

","Balls of Fury seemed like a clever idea; take all the clichés from martial arts b-movies and apply them to ping-pong. Unfortunately, this flick doesn't deliver on its promising premise. First from seeing the trailer, I didn't know what to expect but it looked alright. This film wasn't be taken serious but just silly and comedic. There are some jokes there but some also childish acts. Most of the jokes are toilet jokes, jokes involving the blind man. It was surprising to see Christopher Waken in this. Though he was pretty god as the villain. He's a natural; his timing is terrific and he makes nearly everything he says worth a giggle or two in ""Balls.""

","In 1973 the greatest martial artist appeared on the American silver screen in a film called ' Fists of fury.' His name was Bruce Lee. Since then dozens of martial art movies have followed. Some good, others fair, with the majority being mere imitations. Serious films involving the finest of oriental arts are rare, therefore the ones which capture American audiences today are often comedies. Here is one example. The film is called "" Balls of Fury."" If you have seen 'Fists of fury' you'll have no difficult seeing the parody in this movie. It's the story of Randy Daytona (Brett Delbuone), a young boy who's father Peter (Robert Patrick) was murdered by an Asian gangster, causing him to lose a Ping-Pong tournament. It's 19 years later and Randy (Dan Fogler) is sough-out and recruited by F.B.I. agent Rodriquez (George Lopez) to enter an international underground Ping-Pong tournament organized by Feng (Christopher Walken). Knowing he will need to be trained for the tournament Randy is given over a Master (James Hong) and his beautiful daughter (Maggie Q). With Jason Scott Lee playing Siu-Foo and other serious Hollywood actors, this is one movie which creates an assortment of slap-stick gags and amusing on-sight hilarity. It's fun to watch and with Walken playing the heavy sure to keep your funny bone active. Great movie and an honest comic tribute to the late Bruce Lee. ****"

And even though he's just hanging around for a paycheck, he's always fun enough in ridiculous roles like the one that's presented here. James Hong also steals some scenes... he is a charter member of the ""oh... I know THAT guy! He was great in suchandsuch"" Hall of Fame. One of those character actors that you know will deliver capable comic support. Maggie Q is cute as a button and provides some great eye candy, if 85lb Asian chicks in tight workout clothing is your thing...<br/><br/>It's sort of loosely based on ""Enter the Dragon"" with Ping-Pong instead of Kung Fu... and some Karate Kid thrown in for good measure. Like I said, things never really hit any great comedic heights... But Balls of Fury is a harmless farce that has it's heart in the right place, never trying too hard to please... just enjoying it's lot as a ridiculous little time waster. It's perfectly worthy for an 11pm HBO viewing after you realized you shouldn't have had all that Mountain Dew caffeine with dinner."
"vip_ebriega","4","1","1","25 March 2009"," Completely forgettable, but thankfully, I wasn't too furious with 'Fury'.
","My Take: It's only occasionally amusing. <br/><br/>Will Farrell made my day with two really hilarious sports comedies, TALLADEGA NIGHTS and BLADES OF GLORY. He would have made his winning streak a little stronger if he starred in BALLS OF FURY, another sports comedy that follows the same formula, but then again, even he would have read the script. As written by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garrant, which I learned are among the writers of the TV show RENO 911, BALLS OF FURY is packed with every single slapstick by the book. There's a lots of shots of a guy getting hit on the crotch, Christopher Walken on drag, complements about Maggie Q's sex appeal and every single joke these guys can think up (under the PG-13 level that is!). By this point, BALLS OF FURY is a train headed for disaster. But there's something that stops it from being a total train wreck. What is it? Some of it is actually funny.<br/><br/>Okay, I didn't laugh all the way, but being funny alone is worth a lot these days. I expected nothing from BALLS OF FURY except that it would suck. I guess it probably helps. I expected less and less is what I got. BALLS OF FURY never ups the ante for laughs as any of the better comedies these days, but being funny alone is worth the price of admission. Okay, there's nothing especially funny about Christopher Walken in drag, or several guys getting their crotch creamed , but the movie actually finds another way to be funny in just a few moments later. It ain't for everyone, and I probably shouldn't be recommending this.<br/><br/>Dan Fogler is not a big comedian and, as it is shown in the film, not an especially funny one. He plays embarrassed former ping-pong champ Randy Daytona who has since given up on his glory days, until an FBI agent who shares an uncanny resemblance with George Lopez, who needs him to help out on tracking down one of FBI's Most Wanted, a crime-boss named Fang (Walken in drag), who happens to be officiating the biggest and most outrageous ping-pong tournament ever. To get back on his own two feet after years of absence, Daytona aids the teachings of ping-pong sage Master Wong (James Hong) and his hot niece Maggie (Maggie Q).<br/><br/>It's all antics of course, with Christopher Walken in drag and redoing every role he does on every comedy he starred in. Some of the jokes even have predictable outcomes. You know this guy's gonna get his butt kicked. You know that this guys gay. You know that someone will kiss Maggie Q (and no question whoever gets it either). The whole thing is instantly forgettable. But compared to a few other contenders, this movie is slightly passable. If it's your thing, then see it. <br/><br/>Rating: ** out of 5."

","Yet another in an increasingly long line of minor-interest sports films based on the same formula employed by major-interest sports films but injecting a large dose of juvenile humour. Balls of Fury adapts the plot from Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon to tell its tale of Randy Daytona, one time child table tennis contender who is reduced to using his ping-pong talents on stage in a cheesy cabaret act. As far as this type of film goes, this one isn't as bad as I'd expected. I laughed out loud on a number of occasions, which is fairly unusual - I've noticed that as you grow older you find fewer things funny, especially when it comes to Hollywood's mass-appeal comedy.<br/><br/>Lead actor Dan Fogler is a new face to me, and seems in danger of being something of a Jack Black clone. As of yet, though, he's far less annoying than Black, less prone to showboating, and makes quite a likable hero. Christopher Walken plays the villain of the piece, and he's pretty good; he looks like he's having fun playing the part and joins in with gusto with the determinedly childish lunacy of the plot. The film's running time is barely an hour-and-a-half, which is probably just about right; even though things are considerably less funny in the final half-hour, there's still just about enough laughs to keep things going."
"kellyfacebook1","5","1","1","1 May 2008"," Could have been a LOT better
","I had high hopes for this movie. I wanted to see another Dodgeball (one of my faves) or Blades of Glory but unfortunately this didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, there are some quite funny moments in it (and one or two laugh out loud ones) but they are too few and far between. There are a number of reasons it disappointed but to be honest in my eyes the blame lies squarely at the door of Dan Fogler. I must admit I'm not hugely familiar with his other work but if this is anything to go by I won't be rushing to find it. This guy simply cannot carry a movie as the main character. In Balls of Fury never has the term ""phoned it in"" been more apt. He lacks charisma, warmth and above all comic timing. He did raise a few chuckles from me I must admit but only when he was on the receiving end of the joke and not the one who initiated it. I didn't care about his character which is never a good sign. I'm also sad to say that one of my favourite actors, Christopher Walken, also fares quite badly. I just don't think comedy is his forte but in his defence he was giving it a bloody good shot, unlike Mr Fogler. However, there is one saving grace and that is James Hong as Master Wong. Hilarious. He gets all the best lines and deservedly so as it is he who stops this movie getting three stars. In all this might raise a few laughs if you're watching it with mates and having a few drinks otherwise wait till it comes on TV."

","A comic take on both the ""Karate Kid"" and the ""Enter the Dragon"" formulas (replacing kung fu with ping pong), ""Balls of Fury"" is not a great comedy but it has its moments. If I had to single out the one actor who gets the most laughs, it would be James Hong, who spoofs many of the ""wise old master"" clichés (""I need your advice, Master"" - ""I'm afraid I can't help you. The game is not in the paddle, the game is in YOU; that's usually my big finish""). Maggie Q wears some tight & skimpy outfits and has 2 crisp, well-edited fight scenes - this film turned me more into a believer than ""Die Hard 4"" did. Christopher Walken is actually kind of disappointing here - not for his performance, but for the fact that the script gives him little juicy dialogue to work with (Max Zorin is still my favorite Bond villain!). The main lead, Dan Fogler, is on-and-off, just like the film: some jokes hit the target, some fall flat (the spoofy Matrix-type bullet-time effects have gotten pretty tired by the year 2007). Helped by quite a few familiar faces in the supporting cast, ""Balls of Fury"" is colorful, undemanding fun. (**)"

The script itself was lacking severely and even with a poor script, the acting couldn't deliver an even halfway mediocre attempt at what would have made it a halfway decent movie to watch while intoxicated with this being the only movie showing within a 500 mile radius. <br/><br/>I honestly did not think that it was possible to make a movie this bad, and it was actually WORSE than the worst movie I had ever seen prior to this, which I lovingly declare- ""Without a Paddle"".

"Ndirsch11","6","5","13","29 August 2007"," 'Balls of Fury' not as funny as the trailer
","Have you ever gone to see a movie you've been looking forward to for a long time only to find out that all the best scenes have already been spoiled for you? Usually when this happens it's because of some overzealous friend who can't help but reveal every joke or plot detail beforehand. I was disappointed by the new comedy, ""Balls of Fury,"" not because it's a bad movie, but rather because all the best scenes had been given away by the trailer. Judging the trailer alone, which is hilarious, one would hope that ""Balls of Fury"" would turn out to be one of the funniest movies in years. Alas, it just wasn't meant to be.<br/><br/>""Balls of Fury"" is another one of those sports comedies like ""Blades of Glory"" in which a once disgraced athlete has to prove he's still got the talent to compete. The only difference this time around is that the sport is Ping-Pong, a game just about everyone has played but few take seriously. One of the funnier aspects of ""Balls of Fury"" is how everyone in the film takes Ping-Pong not only seriously, but deadly seriously. When a character asks ""what part of sudden death didn't you understand,"" he means business.<br/><br/>The plot is absurd but that's OK, I guess, because nobody goes to these kinds of films for a coherent plot. The story goes something like this: a kid named Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) loses a national Ping-Ping tournament after having become a phenomenon and a superstar. Never recovering from that loss, Randy grows up, gains a lot of weight, and works at a bad job in Reno, Nevada. When FBI agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) shows up he recruits Randy on a dangerous mission to find Feng (Christopher Walken), a Ping-Pong enthusiast who runs a secret and criminal underworld of tournaments where people are held against their will. Before he goes off to compete in one of Feng's Ping-Pong tournaments Randy must first receive training from Wong (James Hong), a blind Chinese man who has trained some of the best Ping-Pong players in the world. If it sounds like you've heard this basic story before, it's because you have. You can more or less figure out the rest from here.<br/><br/>The funniest scenes involve the blind man (he practically steals the movie) as well as the Christopher Walken character. The casting of Walken as a Chinese man who likes to wear outlandish outfits might seem a bit odd but it nevertheless works. I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off except him. Walken has a way of delivering his lines in a deadpan manner that makes them seem all the more funny. It's clear that he had a good time with this role.<br/><br/>What's disappointing about the movie, however, is that it's really not as funny as it sounds. The problem is that there are only about three or four kinds of jokes that are simply repeated over and over again until they're not funny anymore. We get at least six scenes of the main character getting punched or kicked in the crotch. We get a lot of homophobic humor (this seems to be happening a lot lately in comedies) involving feminine men wearing short shorts. We get a lot of scenes where the blind man is looking in the wrong direction or falling because he can't see in front of him. Last but not least, we get too much ethnic humor concerning the Chinese because apparently Asians are very funny to Western audiences even when they're not doing anything funny. This is all harmless, dumb fun, I suppose, but this kind of humor seems to be aimed primarily at twelve year old boys.<br/><br/>The trailer for ""Balls of Fury"" is much funnier than the movie itself because it contains all the best scenes and edited in such way as to create good comedic timing. When you've already seen the best scenes then much of the fun is spoiled. Even though I found ""Balls of Fury"" to be rather flat and derivative, I still watched it with a smile on my face. I suspect most people will enjoy it but I doubt they will remember it for very long."

When I first saw the trailer for this I thought it was going to be like Dodgeball with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. This is nowhere close to and that movie was just OK.

","You know what this movie is going to offer going in. It's retarded funny and Christopher Walken is the greatest part of any movie he is in. I laughed throughout, never out loud, but all the way through. There were times when I found myself thinking about what I was going to do when it was over, but would focus back and continue laughing.<br/><br/>Dan Fogler is great. He looks like he was sucked straight out of the 80's. The master is a riot, Maggie Q is beautiful, and Tim Lennon is hilarious as always. The best laughs come from the cameos though. First, I never really thought Patton Oswalt was that funny, but he was cracking me up for the 5 minutes he was on screen. George Lopez was good, his best scene being in the hotel room when he wakes up in the middle of the night, hilarious. Diedrich Bader took the prize though. His portrayal of a actor thinking he was auditioning for a part and ending up a sex slave is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>In the end though, it's all about the Walken. He is the man. You could easily tell he wasn't taking this seriously and he was having a blast doing so. The way the guy delivers lines just leaves you in stitches. Oh, and Aisha Tyler is so absurdly gorgeous that she should be in everything, if only for a minute.<br/><br/>To sum it up, it's worth a matinée one day when you have nothing else to do and a DVD rental for sure, and if you go in the right frame of mind, you should have a blast.<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot Jason Scott Lee.

","""Balls of Fury"" is an absolutely dreadful comedy. It amazingly would work better as a drama (not much better). With most films, I can find some redeeming quality. I looked hard and I this is what I found on this. The main character was slightly more tolerable than one would expect from such a poor movie. Christopher Walken was occasionally funny, simply because of his delivery...and well, that's it. Other than that, there are only negatives. Every joke could be seen by anyone a mile away. I could practically give the entire outcome of the film, including all the jokes, halfway through.<br/><br/>The plot, if you can call it that, started off slightly promising, but quickly became too stupid. Randy Daytona was a ping pong child prodigy. His father bet on him, and he lost, so he was killed. 18 years later Daytona works at a bad magic show. He is needed by the FBI to catch a Chinese mafia criminal. He gets lessons from a blind man, and it just gets dumber from there. <br/><br/>To go along with all of this, ping-pong just isn't an interesting sport to make in to a movie. It's repetitive and you can only do so much with it. I really hated this, and I have a feeling this will earn a well deserved spot in the bottom 100 very soon.<br/><br/>My rating: BOMB/****. 83 mins.

This movie used jokes that would've been funny about 10 years ago, and have since been beaten mercilessly into the ground. It seemed like the writers of this movie went about it the same way Nickleback goes about writing songs: they just recycled old stuff that was successful and hoped it would work again.

"DICK STEEL","4","2","4","25 September 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Balls of Fury
","Balls of Fury is a movie that takes the mickey out of martial arts movies, throwing in a few cheap laughs, and nothing more. Like bad movies with plenty of cheese that adopts martial arts like Mortal Kombat and DOA, Balls follows the usual formula of having a prodigy fall from grace, only to be thrusted into a mission that involves prior intense training, and meeting with an adversary who in turn is skilled by the same martial arts teacher, so that the finale is a fight of values.<br/><br/>Often there's a secret weapon involved too, and there's no other direct reference I can think of except that this backtracks all the way to Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon, which the other two movies probably had traces of too. There's a tournament organized for the best of the best to pit their skills in, and the gladiators come from all over the world (so that you can include some poor geographically based comedy, in this case). Like Shih Kien's character in Enter the Dragon, you have an enigmatic megalomaniac as the chief of the tournament, held in a mansion, and in no time, our hero (hey, just for another Bruce Lee related reference for the heck of it, Jason Scott Lee's in this picture as well, though only as a supporting cast member) will discover its dark secrets, and kick the living daylights out of everyone to escape.<br/><br/>Except that in Balls, it is a ping pong / table tennis tournament, and the master of tournament is Feng (Christopher Walken, and I have no idea what's he doing here too), with assistance provided by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who is relegated from a similar head honcho role in the Mortal Kombat movie. And leading the charge to break into the tournament, is one time table tennis child prodigy Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler), a disgraced player now a fat shadow of his past formidable self, persuaded into the competition by a Secret Agent FBI man Agent Ernie (George Lopez) for the purpose of some serious federal investigations.<br/><br/>The comedy here is a bit tired, and most of the best bits were already included in the trailer. You have the usual sexist jokes involving sexy female characters, like the conveniently named Maggie (Maggie Q, doing so little and wearing even less), tired fat jokes, and plenty more from the blind sifu Master Wong (James Hong), whom I thought had probably the best lines in the movie, nevermind that most of them consists of faux pas martial arts philosophy full of sexual innuendos, and plenty of politically incorrectness coupled with slapstick physical comedy. But what went into effective overdrive, were the increasing attempts of sleight-of-hand moments in misdirection, which were spot on and timed perfectly. Other attempts though fell flat, especially those trying to recreate the spirit of nonsensical moments by the Abrahams-Zuker comedies, such as the inclusion of the sex slaves.<br/><br/>However Balls turns out to be pretty bland overall, and the storyline already well summarized in the trailer. Don't expect too much, and you might enjoy a chuckle or two. Otherwise rent this instead."

","12 January 2008. Dan Fogler's first table tennis serve in the movie in a match is one that was illegal. In a way it's the way most of the movie appeared. There was effort that was evident and there were attempts at comedy that were slam shots, some were winners and others were out of bounds, sometimes way out of bounds. Balls of Fury is a mixed bag...at times it did justice to table tennis, other times it really made a mockery of it. Some of the physical gags were funny, some of the lines were creative...yet the editing, the consistency really suffered.

","While not the most clever film out there, it did make me chuckle a few times. Let's talk about the good aspects of this film.<br/><br/>The good: The jokes at times are pretty dang funny to say the least. I didn't laugh a whole lot, probably cause I personally find films funny when I'm watching it with other people. The plot is kind of cliché, but there is some intelligence when these clichés are used. My fave character is probably Master Feng. Nothing else, he's just my favorite, he's just a fun character. <br/><br/>The bad: The film overall is kind of unoriginal. You've got the forced relationship, the ""dramatic"" backstory and the plot. The plot of this movie is that this guy Randy Daytona needs to get into this underground ping pong tournament run by this guy Master Feng. But the jokes are kind of off sometimes. Like the scene where they're going on about a character named ""The Dragon"" but the Dragon isn't a big macho dude, she's actually a little kid. The delivery in this scene is just so off. The problem with this is that when she loses, she just gives Randy a punch in the waist. She doesn't get angry, pick him up and throw him across the room. That would give him a reason to feel intimidated by a little child and earn the title of ""the Dragon"". You can't call a child character intimidating just to call them intimidating. Beyond that, the characters are thinner than paper.<br/><br/>The End Result: An okay film at best. Although, it could've been so much more than a typical ""game to the death"" plot"

","Now I do enjoy this film to a certain extent but due to a lot of things it is just distinctly average and really fails to push through to the levels of other comedies like Anchorman or Dodgeball. Now the guy that they got to play Randy Daytona in this film I have not heard of now or ever but he is functional in this film and has some good funny moments but it does leave you with the wish that somebody of Jack Black or Will Ferrell's calibre had been chosen to play the role. The side characters are really good with Christopher Walken totally stealing his scenes and having the best and most outrageous lines in the film, also his wardrobe is awesome in this film. George Lopez is a good addition with some good lines even though his character is a bit simple. The trainer and love interest are good as well even though you don't buy the romance at all she still is cool and the trainer has some funny lines. The story is just lazy it is so basic it is unreal and it doesn't have any real interesting dynamics and it is definitely not one of the positives of the film which can take away from the film. The script is like what you would expect solid though some of the lines aren't really that good and it doesn't hit like it should. The style is a mixed bag as the costumes for some of the characters are pretty cool but it is so stereotypical and a bit insulting with its interpretation that doesn't really add to the film. Overall Balls of Fury is an average film that will give a couple of laughs."

If you don't find it funny, go watch Dumb and Dumber....maybe that's more your speed. Dan Fogler was the perfect choice for Randy Daytona (makes one say ""Jack Black who?"") James Hong plays Daytona's blind ping pong master Wong and has some great lines...because of his blindness, he's constantly left in the dark (ba dumb bum) and remarks ""what's going on? What's going on?"" It's absurd, but it's hilarious. One of my favorite moments involves Walken (of course) giving Daytona his email address so they can stay in contact later...""Well, poop.

","There are probably those that say that a little feature of the sport of table tennis, like in Forrest Gump, is as far as it will go, it's not exactly a game of football or golf, but it happened! Basically Randy Daytona used to be a champion Ping Pong pro when the game was made an official sport in 1988, but then his father is killed and he stops playing. Now grown up, Randy (Dan Fogler) can only make money doing hardly watched magic tricks involving his skill, but they may have some better use when he is met by FBI Agent Ernie Rodriguez (George Lopez). He is recruiting Randy for a secret mission to get close to Most Wanted fiend Feng (Christopher Walken), who is also responsible for the death of Randy's father. To get a bit more professional practise before seeing the villain, Randy gets some guidance from blind but wise Ping Pong expert Master Wong (James Hong), and is trained by his feisty daughter Maggie (Die Hard 4.0's Maggie Q). Eventually, Randy is ready to face Feng, entering his mysterious jungle compound and the most unique Ping Pong tournaments, facing fierce players, like old opponent Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon). I admit that I dozed off about half-way through, and I woke up pretty much at the conclusion, where Feng is defeated in a final game of Ping Pong on an unstable rope bridge, and that's about it. Also starring Norbit's Terry Crews as Freddy, Robert Patrick as Sgt. Pete Daytona and Jason Scott Lee as Siu-Foo. Walken is an alright camp villain, if a little ridiculous, the Enter the Dragon inspired stuff is silly, and just the whole idea of basing a film around Ping Pong does seem very slippery, so it's a sports comedy flop for me.

The film borrows heavily from the plot lines of ""Enter The Dragon"", just about every 80s and 90s kung fu movie and (get this), at least 2 Will Ferrell movies! ""Balls of Fury"" replaces nunchakas and unrealistic sound effects with ping pong paddles and incredibly realistic sound effects.

He also gets to be cooed at by an incredibly hot Maggie Q (being hot in ways I've never seen her be hot before - did I mention she was HOT?) A decent comic performance from George Lopez, whose head looks less distractingly over-sized for his body for once - well done, Costume Department!

Christopher Walken was Christopher Walken, and getting more and more caricatured in every outing.<br/><br/>But in my opinion, this picture belonged to the ubiquitous James Hong. He essentially reprises a role from a ""Revenge of the Nerds"" sequel and takes it up a good few notches. His ultimate triumph was to unseat, finally, from my memory this classic line: ""to truly hawk a loogie, you must retrieve the phlegm not from the throat... but from the soul"".

","1st watched 1/29/2008 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Robert Ben Garant): Funny, inventive comedy without the benefit of big name comedians. This movie did very well from beginning to end of moving the story along and providing funny and captivating characters every step of the way. Usually a gimmick-type movie stalls about ½ the way thru, but this one does not let up and is not happy with just a few jokes repeated over and over again. The story revolves around an Olympic table tennis player who lost a big game and has been in exile since that loss. An FBI agent, played by comedian George Lopez, seeks the ping-pong player out to compete again so that he can get to a wanted mean guy by being invited to his tournament after all his wins. It doesn't start out very well as he loses his first tournament but in typical ""rocky-style"" he gets focused with the help of a trainer and picks up the pace. This happens fairly quickly, which is the only down part of the movie in my opinion. A blind, karate-kid style mentor helps him believe in himself(believe it or not). Next steps in the evil and feminine tournament organizer, played by Christopher Walken, as the long big name in the movie. He is hilarious in this role and helps the last half of the movie continue in it's fun onslaught. Yes, I am a fan of table tennis(aka. Ping-pong) and I was looking forward to this movie because of this, but it exceeded my expectations as a funny movie from beginning to end. Don't miss it."
"siftystick","1","5","16","29 August 2007"," This movie was terrible-a bad Dodgeball rip-off for sure.
","Balls of Fury was a poor excuse for a movie. It was not anything near what it was hyped up to be. Character development was crude to say the least, I have no idea where half of the characters came from. The relationship between Randy and Mahogany materialized out of no where, one minute they barely knew each other and the next they're kissing on a river, and Randy has a gun? (I don't have anything against guns-just very random). I felt like this was a Dodgeball rip-off; there was the handicapped trainer, fat and lazy rags to riches character(s), fighting for something barely obtainable, and the gung-ho girl ready to do it all (play dodgeball or pingpong), and some sort of try out where the team/person lost when it appeared to be a sure win. At least Dodgeball had a well written story.<br/><br/>In short, the character development sucked, as did the plot and overall development-everything could have been SO much more planned out. I would have liked to see more of the training, and more pingpong battles-there was hardly any pingpong for a movie that was ABOUT pingpong. More of the relationship between Randy and Mahogany-a date or something, please? Who are half these people, and where did they come from?! <br/><br/>I want $9.00 and 1.5 hours of my life back, please.<br/><br/>--John"

Low expectations may be key, but the movie should carry enough laughs to garner relatively successful reviews for the modest gig it is."

","The idea of taking a completely asinine sport and making fun of people who might take it seriously was done very well in Dodgeball. I had really hoped and believed that Balls might be like that. Unfortuanately I was wrong.This movie really strives to be satirical and funny at the same time, which might appear to be easy to make with movies like dodgeball and anchorman coming along once a year. But the jokes in Balls of Fire are completely obvious and unoriginal, and seems like something that might have come out of the 80's, laugh track and all. I mean you can actually hear the background of Family Matters when wins a match (having just found out that this written directed and produced by those that did the pacifier, herbie fully loaded, and let's go to prison; this doesn't surprise me) Unfortuanately Christopher Walkens guest role convinced me to see this movie, and even though he is fantastic as a white dude running a murderous Triad Ping Pong Ring, it doesn't save a horrible movie from a horrible script."

I cannot believe Christopher Walken, a great actor, actually did this dimwitted 'comedy'. He's the only thing that saves this movie from a 1 star rating. The entire concept of the film is unfunny.

Maggie Q was the only interesting person in this; and mainly because I remember her from the last Die Hard movie. She even uses some of the same moves.<br/><br/>I just didn't find ping pong appealing. Fighting to the death over ping pong; just didn't get it. Christopher Walken wasn't even too interesting in this.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: One of the worst films of the year."
"wayens","7","2","5","20 September 2007"," Balled Up Humor Needs a Better Bounce
","I went into the theater expecting total stupidity but tempered by Walken's artistry. That's not to say Walken wouldn't act silly (Mouse Hunt, Hairspray, Click) but at least he can pull off some believable antics. Sure enough Walken's Feng is a eccentric yet powerful villain that can make you shudder (when you think if he was real life) yet also make you laugh.<br/><br/>What surprised me was the high production values of the film. Music was fun, effects were well done and hardly hokey. Yet in contrast the script, pace, and plotting left something to be desired. Not to mention Fogler himself. For a leading actor, Fogler often came out stilted in line and action delivery, breaking the pace of the film.<br/><br/>The actual direction and editing of the film cuts too fast leaving me wanting a smoother transition. Some gags were funny like Master Wong's chopstick maneuvers and Maggie's kiss that ends with her hanging on to Randy's waist with her thighs. Some segments like using a wooden spoon as the ping pong paddle were clever twists as well.<br/><br/>If this was supposed to be a stupid movie then I would say the filmmakers partially failed. The high production values detract from the stupidity and only made me see the stupidity as a glaring inconsistency. Or maybe more aptly it's the performance that needs work. By delivery and overall feeling: Walken was great, Fogler sucked, FBI agent could be better, Maggie didn't have enough scenes so when she does come on and display her prowess she seemed out of place, Master Wong on the other hand was delightfully amusing.<br/><br/>The ping pong action is incredible and I wonder how much of it was real. I'm not sure if Walken was ever a ping pong master for instance. ;) The bouncing off of objects technique by Randy was fun to see and made for an interesting showdown that I think could have been played out more.<br/><br/>I don't have anything against stupid films but when you have a high production stupid film, that stupidity should be acted out well. When the lead actor trips then no matter how well the others do, the film suffers. My impression is Fogler needs to feel his character out more or there was some incompatibility. Whatever the case, Balls of Fury is a good ride but the flames aren't fanned to full blast."
"fwomp","4","2","5","3 September 2007"," Low-Brow Comedy Nets Few Laughs
","If you're a low-brow comedy fan, you'll probably love BALLS OF FURY. On par with films such as SCARY MOVIE and TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY, Balls of Fury hits the bottom end of the funny bone, but it does hit it. Just not often enough. Adding an impossible love story added to the low ranking here, too (even the poster image is aimed for low rung laughs, ""Oh look! It's a penis and testicles!"") I'm not trying to be some snob who doesn't enjoy a good laugh. It's just that the film as a whole needs to be funny. But Balls of Fury has too many valleys where the laughs vanished. In its defense, however, I will say that there were a few peaks (most notably when Randy Daytona tries to escape his Japanese style imprisonment and attempts to jump through a shoji screen but quickly discovers metal bars on the other side. Ouch!) I will also give director Ben Garant (RENO 911!: Miami) credit for making a comedy out of something as inane as a ping pong evil underworld. Making fun of the serious films that have come before (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS rapidly comes to mind where a secret world exists for hotrod enthusiasts), Balls of Fury daringly strikes out and nets a few points for originality.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the character who achieved the most laughs from me was not Dan Fogler (the main protagonist) but comedian George Lopez. His Al Pacino SCARFACE impersonation was the funniest moment in the film, especially considering it took place during the pivotal action sequence.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken as Feng the main villain was okay but very forced. His feminine dress was meant solely for shock laughs and nothing more.<br/><br/>But the biggest fault was the rapid  and impossible  relationship between the chubby, poorly groomed Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) and the athletic and exceptionally beautiful Maggie Wong (Maggie Q). This happened in rapid, slipshod fashion with no explanation as to why Maggie would fall for such a despicable lout.<br/><br/>For those who don't mind plot holes the size of a semi-truck, they probably won't mind this. But, for me at least, I need things to fit together, even if a bit roughly.<br/><br/>Meant more for young teens than anyone of adult intellect, your enjoyment of Balls of Fury will depend on how you felt about recent low-brow comedy film releases."

","""Balls of Fury"" is founded on a clever idea; take all the clichés from martial arts b-movies and apply them to ping pong. Unfortunately, this flick doesn't deliver on its promising premise. The problem is mainly lead actor Dan Fogler. His timing is off and he has no appeal at all. He's bland and brings no life to the screen at all.<br/><br/>It's too bad that the director couldn't get Jack Black for the lead. The role seemed written for him and it would have been interesting to see him play opposite Christopher Walken. As things turned out, Fogler seems to disappear each time he's on screen with Walken. In fact, the only thing that saves this film at all is Walken who proves once again that he can do comedy. He's a natural; his timing is terrific and he makes nearly everything he says worth a giggle or two in ""Balls."" Without him, there wouldn't be much to write about this movie at all.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, there isn't much point to plunking down $10 to see this in the theater. It's worth seeing for Walken, but probably better left for when it gets released on video."

It's not rip-snorting humor by any stretch, but definitely a good way to enjoy oneself for two hours if there's nothing else to do. As can be expected, Christopher Walken is the best character in the flick.

Of course there were a couple of chuckles and of course it might have made us laugh a bit every now and then. But the film lacked substance.

","I can never wrap my head around the careers of Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant. On television, their work is some of the best comedy of the past couple of decades: The State, Viva Variety!, and, their triumph, Comedy Central's Reno 911. But when they write movies, the results are well nigh unwatchable. I had thought in the past that they were just defecating cheap movie scripts so that they could make money and continue producing fine work on television. I mean, The Pacifier, Herbie: Fully Loaded and Night at the Museum smack of the kind of audience-despising material you might expect from smart writers deliberately trying to dumb down their work for some cold hard cash. Add to that the fact that their movie version of Reno 911, which was released early in 2007, was pretty good. But then, later in the year, they made this film. It's a cheesy little comedy, and it has a lot of potential to be decent, if unremarkable, fun. This is their genre, unlike the children's flicks. There's no conceivable reason to hate your audience here, since presumably they'll be pretty close to the same audience that watches Reno 911. Dan Fogler plays a former child prodigy and Olympic table tennis player. Now he's a loser, but he's being recruited by the FBI to infiltrate an underground ping-pong tournament, hosted by an international criminal, played by Christopher Walken. The premise, reminiscent of other recent underground sports comedies like Dodgeball and Beerfest, doesn't have a lot of promise, it's true. But all a comedy really needs is some good jokes, and it'll fly. Or at least you'd think it would. The problem with Balls of Fury isn't exactly its jokes. They're funny enough, for the most part. It's the delivery. The actors have little ability in comic timing (what halfway decent comedic director would willfully hire George Lopez to be in their movie?), and Robert Ben Garant often fails to sell the jokes, even when they are potentially amusing. Even when the comic performances are good, as is the case with Walken and co-writer Thomas Lennon himself, the editing is so poor that the gags almost never hit. It's all quite maddening. Reno 911 is particularly brilliant in its editing. I really don't see how the same people could produce such a laughless comedy. I guess TV is just their medium, but I don't understand why film-making should prove so difficult for them."

You want to think more for the film ? Yo think Balls of fury is stupid ? Yes, maybe you are right... but it doesn't matter. Stupid but funny! It made me laugh all the time! So many different situations, all the time it was interesting... not boring for a moment. If you want to laugh and not to think so much... this is your movie! If you want to think or I do not know what.... then this movie is not for you but I am not even sure if it is good idea for you to watch comedies. You must watch some criminal, drama, thriller... I don't know, you can choose. The other good point of this movie is that the humour is not rude like ""What's up mother f*cker"" or something like this. I hate such a language. The movie is also not so moral degradation to watch nude girls all the time etc. If you want to watch other super fun movie, I think this is ""Rat race"" ....these two films were equal funny for me, that's why I gave them 10 :) Other good comedy is ""Hot Rod"" but it is maybe for people with a little bit strange sense of humour :) I think that all people who rated this one with 1 are just stupid spoilers !!!! And they are the reason to write... p.p. Sorry for the language, I am not the best in English :)"

","I gave it a 3, due to me being generous. I ""knew"", if people were going to talk trash about The Comebacks and Meet The Spartans; that this movie would get above a 4.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, maybe boring, overly rated movies, or people ""with 0 laughter in their blood"" rate good movies, badly.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken are you that broke? Did the wife say, we don't have enough money in the bank and take any given role? <br/><br/>This movie was not very funny. I waited to go Ha Ha, but where was it? George Lopez, was too good of a actor/comedian to be in this horrible movie. I just watched it for Alicia Tyler and the other nice looking girl. Until those points, nothing caught my attention. Not a good movie, overall.<br/><br/>This is the ""truth"", not an opinion."

","This film is about a disgraced child prodigy recruited by the FBI to play ping pong ball in order to smash a triad society.<br/><br/>I expected cheap and brain off entertainment, but wow, this movie is lousy beyond my expectations. The plot is contrived, inconsistent and ridiculous. The master is supposed not to have foreigner students, and guess what? Christopher Walken is a foreigner! The electrical suits look more like a kid's toy, but that's better than the panda which looks exactly like a toy. Execution of the plot is no good either. Camera work is bad, even for a comedy. Character development is non existent. How come Maggie Wong falls for Randy Daytona all of a sudden? There are lots of homophobic jokes in the film, but at the same time there are loads of half naked buys running around in shorts! It makes me wonder whether the homophobic jokes are thrown in so that they can put hot semi-naked guys in the film. How come Christopher Walken agreed to star in this film? he just lost all his credibility! Believe me, this film is bad."

","This movie didn't really have a plot or anything that was really real. The wasn't even any good lines or any good scenes that would make this movie remembering. The movie tries to impress you with the restarted humor but I didn't really find anything funny about this film. I found a few retarded things to be funny to that was about it. I mean I could make a movie if I wanted about Ping Pong and have a good plot and some good scenes but this movie didn't even have that. I went to a movie theatre that only charges $5.00 to get in, and it is a good thing I only payed $5.00. Because this movie isn't worth the money, I wouldn't even say it was worth $5.00 it just had nothing at all that could keep you interested throughout the whole movie."
"filmgasmreviewers","5","1","3","8 September 2007"," Filmgasm.com's Balls of Fury Review
","By: Matt Shapiro Balls of Fury does all anyone expects it to do - it entertains. It takes a story that knows it's silly, throws in a lot of humor, has some unneeded but still cool action, a few ping pong battles, and entertains its viewer. But there's no way I could give it a positive grade. Not only is it an incredibly stupid (however purposeful that is) movie, but aside from Christopher Walken (who has a blast playing his part) and partially Dan Fogel (who seems a lot like a slightly less funny Jack Black), none of the performances in this film are at all convincing, as they are all stereotypical portrayal of either Asians, Hispanics, or black people.<br/><br/>The set-up is fine enough; an 11 year-old ping pong master named Randy Daytona competes in the Olympics against a German, and just before the game he discovers that his father bet an incredible amount of money on his son's win. Nervous for what will happen if he loses, Randy screws up and loses the game. His father bet an unpayable amount of money, so after losing, his life is taken from him by a man known as Feng. Nineteen years after losing this game, Daytona's life is in ruins; he has no job, he's quite overweight, and he doesn't have any friends. This much of the story works well.<br/><br/>However, the story that follows (aka the main plot of the movie) is highly unrealistic and takes some huge leaps to keep the pace nice and brisk (this was done to keep the film concise at 90 minutes). The action sequences, while entertaining, are far too unrealistic and out of touch with the rest of the story; the only cool ""action"" was the stuff portrayed via ping pong table. And the small romantic element of the movie was highly unneeded (and highly unrealistic; someone as gorgeous as Maggie Q would not fall for a super low-life like Dan Fogel, especially since she grew up hating white people).<br/><br/>If you are at all a fan of the frat pack comedies, or just dumb comedies in general, you'll surely enjoy this film to a certain extent. It provides a lot of solid one-liners and some well-done (although over-the-top) physical humor. As a movie, though, its plot is a mess, its acting outside two characters is very weak, its script falters whenever it tries to get serious, and the ending is a little too oh-come-on for it's own good."
"Dream_seeker","2","1","4","28 July 2008"," Tacky and still falls under the exact typical-ness of a east meets west movie
","For nearly a decade there have been action, adventure, and even romantic comedies that have a strong interest and emphasis of the ""east meet west"" culture...i'm sure you seen this story a thousand times...middle aged or middle class Caucasian man goes either the the east or somewhere in the world meets up with Asian female (or east Indian depending on your movie and/or director who can't seem to find any other male of a different race appreciative for the main character role)...they have some weird and interesting adventures and then they hook up; yada, yada, yada....FINE!!! and if you don't believe that this type of obviousness exist check out movies like, ""Snow falls on cedars"" or ""The last samurai"", how about, ""The quiet American"" or how about something recent like oh...,""The forbidden kingdom"" and another movie coming soon with Nicolas cage (Bancock Dangerous)or an upcoming movie with Hugh grant and zhang ziyi (HUGH GRANT...COME ON!!). This will continue sadly until someone from the minority starts to see this happen and say, ""hey...i'm just as good as that person too and i'm BLACK or Asian or LATINO!"" (Afro-American male actors very seldom is portrayed as a main character in a east meet west role and no ""Mississippi Masala"" doesn't count!) <br/><br/>But until then we are going to get the same tacky, and typical movies that displays a another case of the ""Asian East meets Caucasian west"" and, ""Balls of fury"" is another attempt at this from a comedian side of the spectrum. Now don't get me wrong Maggie Q and Aisha Tyler are HOT in this movie....but that's as far as good credit i will put towards this film. The jokes are not as funny, they try to overdo the comedy way too much and i felt that was making my head hurt, and GEORGE LOPEZ!!? come on what's wrong director and the casters that find these actors couldn't find a REAL comedian lately!? I mean Kevin Hart is more funny than this dude and he's an underdog comedian! The plot tries to be serious but fails badly...in a nutshell, Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) a failed ping pong player is given an opportunity from the FBI to go undercover to stop some gunrunner Feng (Christopher Walken) and expose his true plan but in order to gain trust he has to play...yep you guessed it, PING PONG to stay one step ahead and outwit *or try to!* the opposition. <br/><br/>Now, let's see what's wrong with this picture well i say....EVERYTHING! again Feng who is played by Christopher Walken, a man that has been nominated many times in GOOD MOVIES to suddenly be dropped in this bat of acid; that's like Ben Kingsley in, ""Bloodrayne"" what are you doing!!? again in the typical of nature a Caucasian man trying to fit into the Asian culture and did it badly; it was really sad to see him placed in this position but i'm sure others will disagree but its really up to you to figure this out for yourself. The plot and storyline had a bit of the ""Enter the dragon"" aspect but they tried to copy on that in some weird mock-ish way. The romance between Randy and ironically Maggie was again falling under a typical line up of east meets west romance and i found that faulting, I felt that the direction could of made this comedy an actual comedy but the premise wasn't there to put that up this film in the standards of what comedy is.<br/><br/>The end result, was a poorly made movie for my taste there was no direction to this it was trying to make a straight out laugh movie but it didn't do that for me all it did was make me shake my head and mutter, ""Typical, typical, and more typical"" cause that's all it was. But beggars can't be choosers and what's bad for me might be different for the next person and when you come in watching this movie i guess you have to keep an open mind and i did...but it gave me a headache after the first hour so you can read this review but the choice is yours to figure if this movie was good...but you might as well rent this film cause you might want to take it back after its done.<br/><br/>4/10<br/><br/>Story: I felt this didn't have much of a story going for it; the plot outline is straight laced but that was about it. It faltered a great deal and that what made me lose interest in the movie.<br/><br/>Character Development/acting: Lack there was, seeing Maggie Q in something sexy and Aisha Tyler were the only two reasons i was watching this movie besides that...the characters were dull, and unsurprisingly overdoing their roles.<br/><br/>Direction: Its amazing these days that directors,writers, and people that finds these actors keep looking towards the same type of east meets west romance...its a sad state of affairs in Hollywood or wherever you go that they can't find an actor that's within the minority for a main character role, and don't get me wrong certain actors an play certain roles great and some i feel that they must of known the director or someone to get in that way...either way you put it was typical to my taste and very tiresome and hell will freeze over when i see a movie where the Afro-American main male lead gets swept into a fantasy ancient china to save a kingdom and fall in love with the woman and save the world and all of that lord knows that might be just as good as well...but i doubt that will happen; but one can dream so until this....movies like this will continue....sadly."
"simonparker1990","3","1","4","4 January 2008"," The cheaper, nastier, less funny Dodgeball
","Imagine Dodgeball, one of the funniest movies in the past five years, then imagine it done again, but with the sport changed, some different actors in it, and make it not as funny. Yes ladies and gentlemen that was Blades of Glory, now imagine some stupid film producer sitting there and taking Blades of Glory and repeating the process, that unfortunately is Balls of Fury. A movie that is not a tenth as funny as it thinks it is and so unoriginal it makes your eyeballs scream in agony as you watch it! Balls of Fury unfortunately was the first movie I saw of 2008, hopefully I just made a poor choice and this is not a reflection of the quality of movies I will see throughout the rest of the year! Anyway Balls of Fury is a limp fish of a comedy with a couple of funny set pieces and Christopher Walken on delicious over the top form. But the majority of the film is just very poor slapstick, the lead actor, Dan Fogler, acting like a prat, and he really is the most annoying actor I have seen in quite some time, and just some jokes that aim for funny but end up being more irritating than anything else. The jokes range from very average to pretty much hateful, I mean how many jokes can you make about a blind person walking into things? According to this movie a lot more than you could ever hope to imagine. My other big problem with this is the fact the first half hour isn't even remotely funny, at least the middle and final act seem to be trying, the first act just seems pitiful, in fact the first act rivals Epic Movie in terms of badness! <br/><br/>So let me get onto the performances. Firstly there is Dan Fogler, now I find Adam Sandler an annoying actor, but nothing could prepare me for how hateful I would find Fogler. The last movie I saw him in was Good Luck Chuck, which I forgot he was in though looking back on it I hated him that as well. Well in this movie he seems like a very poor man's Jack Black, with not a millionth of the charisma nor the comedic timing. The script doesn't help Fogler, but personally I think that only thing that could make him less annoying is perhaps a tranquilliser or perhaps a bullet! Maggie Q plays his love interest, yes unfortunately you read that right. Maggi Q has been decent enough in Mission Impossible 3 and Die Hard 4, but here she is so bland and lifeless. Plus you can almost see that she doesn't want to be in this movie, despite Fogler's annoyingness he at least looks like he's enjoying himself, Maggie Q just seems half asleep. And the pairs romance is never, ever believable! So its down to Christopher Walken as the chief villain, Feng to steal the movie, as he always does. Walken seems to be having a blast, and he delivers some killer lines. But I was more confused by him being in the movie than anything else, he's a great talent, so why is he wasting his time in this rubbish? Anyway he has the best lines and the movie at least makes you a bit more alert whenever he is on screen. A shame then that the final ping pong match involving him is pretty poorly done. George Lopez is pretty poor as the FBI agent along for the ride and to be honest Lopez even seems aware his character isn't funny.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with Balls of Fury is the fact it just isn't very funny. While the movie is honourable in the fact it keeps references to genitalia to a minimum, surprising given the tag line and title, the movie instead relies on heavy slapstick and poor fart jokes. Fogler is hit in some way at least one hundred times in this movie, not once is it funny, not even worthy of a slight smirk. The movie also relies too much on the blind master bumping into things, or perhaps in the most misjudged joke of the past year, him having a sex with a man thinking its a woman, a scene that aims for hilarity but seems closer to cruel. Thankfully the script is funnier when Walken arrives, or at least he makes things such as ""Hurry up, we're missing the antiques road show!"" a bit funnier than they would be when said by a lesser talent. The movies fight scenes are admittedly above average, but they only really arrive towards the end when the movie is already too stuck in the mud its stuck itself in to be rescued. The movie also has no originality, the strange sport idea has been obviously taken from Dodgeball, and the movie aims to be a funny Enter the Dragon when it so obviously is anything but funny.<br/><br/>So unfortunately Balls of Fury is a very poor comedy enlivened by one actor. In fact had Walken not signed on this would head for 1/10 territory and stand firmly alongside Epic Movie. Thankfully with him, and perhaps the mad German ping pong champion, the movie has a tiny bit of life in it. Still this isn't worth a recommendation, more a warning. And be very afraid everyone if Fogler ever hits it big, because I swear to god I am going to avoid every movie he is in for a long time after this performance!"
"LilMissMousie","Null","1","4","29 September 2007"," Well, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.
","I watched this movie from a website that has hundreds of free movies, most that were poorly recorded with a camcorder right from the movie theater, as was the case with this one.<br/><br/>Now, I'm going to be a bit of a hypocrite here by being nitpicky about the film, but there's a lot to be nitpicked.<br/><br/>First things first, I think there has been far too many poor comedies gained at Asian suspense. I'm not going to name names, but the whole idea of picking things up from other cultures and making a joke out of it irks me a bit. I'm not calling the movie in itself racist, but the idea has been way over used and it made the whole movie stagnant, nothing I haven't seen before.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the subject that upsetted me about the movie. That being the character of ""Karl Wolfschtagg"". Me being the overly defensive German that I am, got a little offended by the whole ""Let's make the loud obnoxious stereotypical German guy the enemy!"" And to make things worse, they killed him abruptly during the climax of the movie, an event that made all the extras cheer. Not that I'm saying that he was suppose to represent his people, but the whole thing was in bad taste.<br/><br/>Next on the docket is Dan Fogler, and as many have called him, ""a poor man's Jack Black"", which I find to be an acceptable description of the man. He plays the main character ""Randy Daytona"", an average Joe who is an exceptional Ping-Pong player. While he is a pretty good actor, I don't think anyone could've made the role work. Not even the real Jack Black. The character was boring, to be completely honest, and lacked any interesting or eye-catching aspects.<br/><br/>But then again, that could've just been the movie's fault itself. It was tacky, unoriginal, and altogether unfunny. While it had it's moments like any other bad comedy, it simply wasn't good enough to classify as anything other then ""Wait until it's on cable."" And the jokes themselves were mostly slapstick and uninteresting, while the verbal ones have all been heard before. People have described it as something that would only be funny from ages ten through fourteen, well, I can say that I AM fourteen and even I found very little of it funny at all.<br/><br/>Like I said, wait until it's on cable, unless you're drunk or stoned and have a good excuse to watch something so crappy."
"miketigas25","4","1","5","5 November 2007"," Craptastic... Ugh...
","I wanted to unwind a little after a long day at the University Library and so when I went to the local Cinema, guess what? Balls of Fury was the only movie closest to my desired time. Without second thoughts, I bought a ticket, went in and sat down in the middle-back of the theater without any expectations whatsoever.<br/><br/>""Oh yeah..."" That's all I can say. The jokes weren't really jokes to begin with. Though original to some extent, I didn't find them that funny - and that's coming a lot from a guy who has a very wide sense of humor. All throughout the film, I think I only giggled ONCE (No, not laugh. Giggle.) I think the movie had two problems: One, the pacing of the film. Two, Dan Fogler.<br/><br/>I think the movie should have spent more time on the tournament and not during the ""training"". Watching the final scenes, it was like the movie was trying to catch a bad guy or something. Everything was moving pretty fast. It was as if the movie had to meet a deadline and the crew had to finish the film during the last hours.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Dan Fogler was awful in this movie. I don't know. Maybe it was the script or the director or whatever. OR MAYBE... It was his sideburns! I really think he could do much better on TV; like in a sitcom or his own show. But in the movies? I'm not really sure.<br/><br/>If you are really curious about this movie, just go watch it on video. Better yet, why not wait for it on HBO? Watching it on the big screen is really not worth it."

"zardoz-13","4","1","6","5 September 2007"," ""Balls of Fury"" is pathetic ping-pong porn!
","The people that created the hilarious Comedy Central cable TV series ""Reno 911"" have only marginal success with their new table tennis sports movie parody ""Balls of Fury"" (** out of ****), about a former ping-pong prodigy past his prime who helps the FBI nab the nefarious Asian mastermind that killed his father. Sadly, despite its inventive comic premise and celebrity cast, this low-brow farce depends on bowel humor and lowest common denominator jokes for its laughs. Okay, you'll smirk a lot at what masquerades as comedy in this lean but lame 90-minute nonsense. You might even snicker at the groaners, but you'll seldom laugh out loud for long. Incidentally, the ""Star Wars"" epics and ""Scarface"" provide the inspiration for much of the uninspired dialogue. The wit in the script by ""Reno 911"" writers Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant is as anal as it is banal, but the PG-13 rating prevents them from stooping too low. When was the last time, for example, that you saw a character in a movie get punched or kicked in the crotch for a laugh? Worst of all, chubby newcomer Dan Fogler looks funnier than he isan obvious Jack Black wannabe with none of Black's drollery.<br/><br/>As ""Balls of Fury"" unfolds, we meet clean-cut, curly-haired Randy Daytona (Brett DelBuono of ""The Casket""), a twelve-year old who wields a mean ping-pong paddle. Randy makes it to the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Korea, but he suffers a humiliating defeat from the paddle of his maniacal Soviet Bloc opponent Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon of ""Reno 911"") and quits the game. Not only does Daytona lose the championship, but also his coach as well as father--U.S. Marine sergeant Pete Daytona (Robert Patrick of ""We Are Marshall"")--dies at the hands of the infamous Asian criminal, Feng (tough guy Christopher Walken of ""Pulp Fiction""), because he cannot pay off his debt. Meanwhile, Feng becomes a legendary crime lord and strives to keep his identity a closely guarded secret. Nineteen years pass, and woebegone Randy grows up and out (Dan Fogler) to emerge as a lounge act in a small Reno, Nevada, casino. Randy keeps several balls at a time in the air with his paddle with expertise of a juggler. A guy with a talking cockatiel announces his act. Unfortunately, everything goes wrong for poor Randy. He solicits a volunteer from the audience to participate in a gag, and the guy drops dead from a heart attack because Randy's ping-pong balls strike him in such rapid succession.<br/><br/>Enter the FBI. Agent Ernie Rodriquez (George Lopez of ""Real Women Have Curves"") recruits Randy to assist the Bureau in their Feng investigation. They want Randy to come out of retirement and win enough games so that Feng will invite him to one of his illegal underground table tennis tournaments held once every five years. The Bureau wants to bust Feng for international arms smuggling. Despite his expertise, Randy has lost his competitive edge, so Rodriquez enlists a championship ping-pong teacher, Master Wong (James Hong of ""Chinatown""), to train him. The catch is that Wong is blind. Naturally, Wong walks into fences, looks the wrong way, and takes a nasty plunge down an elevator shaft. Wong makes Randy appear foolish when Wong's slim, sexy, athletic niece Maggie (the woefully underused Maggie Q of ""Live Free or Die Hard"") whips him repeatedly at ping-pong. Eventually, after an initial setback against Hammer (Patton Oswalt of ""Cake Boy""), a trophy licking wiseacre, Randy regains his skill and Feng invites him to his secret play-offs. The losers here get a poison dart in the neck in what Feng calls 'single-elimination, sudden death matches.' Feng tries to tempt Randy to 'go over to the dark side' and join him in his weapons smuggling operation. Feng has designed an automatic pistol made of polymer so that it doesn't trip airport alarms.<br/><br/>Clearly, writer/director Robert Ben Garant and co-scenarist Tomas Lennon are poking fun at the classic Bruce Lee martial arts masterpiece ""Enter the Dragon"" with their premise about secret ping-pong ball play-offs. The idea that a relatively harmless sport like ping-pong can be as lethal as a kung fu tournament is the source of most of the film's best humor. Some of the participants--who can spin these tiny white balls on their fingertips, crush with their fists, and slice and dice them with a hatchet--are amusing characters, too. ""Balls of Fury,"" however, runs most of its humor into the ground as well as elsewhere. Our heroes must smuggle mini-flashlight sized tracking devices into Feng's Central American headquarters. These devices will alert their FBI back-up as to their whereabouts. Yeah, you guessed, they enter Feng's premises walking a bit off-kilter with their FBI suppositories. Another example of the lowest common denominator humor here concerns host Feng supplying his guests with exotic courtesans that turn out to be male sex slaves. When Randy tries to send muscular young Gary (Dietrich Bader of ""Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous"") away, Gary refuses to leave. He explains that Feng's towering bodyguard, Mahogany (Aisha Tyler of ""Death Sentence""), a Grace Jones look-alike who uses a blow-pipe to launch poison darts, will kill him. Homophobic Randy spends the entire night with Gary playing a board game to keep from falling asleep.<br/><br/>""Balls of Fury"" isn't half as funny as ""Reno 911,"" though it does have its moments. This is Dan Fogler's first major role, and he hasn't been around long enough to establish a signature comic persona like co-stars George Lopez, Patton Oswalt, and Christopher Walken who parades around in some of the most outrageous outfits this side of Elton John and Elvis Presley. Altogether, ""Balls of Fury"" lacks both the balls and the fury to be the side-splitting sensation that it sought to be."
"dubbayewdubbayew","4","1","6","3 September 2007"," Just awful
","There is absolutely no salvation for this abomination of comedic film. It's not even so stupid it's funny, its just really stupid. Thomas Lennon (Lt. Dangle from Reno 911) is just about the only character with any humor. The blind guy has no funny parts either, you basically have to force yourself to laugh. The main character is as drab as he is two-dimensional. This was an opportunity to be a good film, but it just doesn't even come close. Christopher Walken has once again embarrassed himself, not for being bad, for continually appearing in third rate films. He has never turned down a movie offer, and I respect that, but could he just stop doing things like this?? There are only two positives in this movie, Maggie Q is hot, and Thomas Lennon's performance, other than that, it's basically worse than Gigli."
"Shraylo","3","1","7","31 August 2007"," Waste of time.
","This movie is a complete waste of time. This movie had the potential to be funny, but it failed miserably. The only thing that could save this movie was Christopher Walken, and he failed to deliver.<br/><br/>Walken was the only thing that I was excited about, and the 45 minutes or so he spent in this movie was terrible.<br/><br/>Something that really grinded my gears during this movie was the love plot. Randy likes this Asian girl named Maggie who is tired of ""all the guys all over her"", and she's also mad that Randy is the reason that her home was destroyed. But soon after, for no apparent reason, she falls in love with him and starts to kiss him. There was no explanation for this, but whatever. The whole movie fails anyway.<br/><br/>This movie was not funny. I basically forced myself to laugh. If you're walking into this movie expecting to see a funny Will Ferrell movie or something along the lines of Anchorman, or even a smarter comedy such as Superbad, you will be highly disappointed.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 3/10 because it had Christopher Walken in it, and because it had a plot that could have been used to much greater effect.<br/><br/>Do not believe what this movie is selling - a laugh fest with your buddies at the local cinema.

Randy was a star table tennis player at the age of 12 in the 1988 Olympics, but an embarrassing forfeit loss to obnoxious East German Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon, the film and TV series, ""Reno 911"") made him a national laughingstock.<br/><br/>Now, some 20 years later, he is forced to sustain himself by performing at a local run-down night club. These are some of the funniest scenes in the movie as Randy does a series of cheesy, humiliating tricks while the few patrons basically ignore the effort.<br/><br/>Enter FBI agent Ernie Rodriquez (George Lopez, ""Shark Boy & Lava Girl,"" where he played a light bulb), who persuades the chubby dork to enter a state tournament in hopes of being invited to Feng's annual ping-pong tournament. Rodriquez wants Randy to spy on Feng, who is suspected of smuggling guns, or something like that. Oh, and it seems that the evil Asian also killed Randy's Marine sergeant father (Robert Patrick, ""Walk the Line"").<br/><br/>Another chuckle moment comes when Randy is beaten by the short, goofy asthmatic Payton Oswald (King of Queens, a voice in ""Ratatouille""); but he rebounds to crush ""The Dragon,"" a 10-year old girl (Na Shi La).<br/><br/>He is trained by ancient Chinese player, Master Wong (James Hong), and his beautiful daughter, Maggie (Maggie Q, ""Live Free Or Die Hard""), and soon secures an invitation (in the form of a golden paddle).<br/><br/>Once at the tournament, it's standard comic convention, with one-by-one elimination of the players until only Randy and Wolfschtagg are left; but in order to avoid being too conventional, there are a few twists and turns here and there.<br/><br/>Like previously mentioned, Walken (even though he looks like he's doing a poor John Lithgow impression from ""The Mikado"") carries the movie as far as it can be carried. Just appearing on the screen, he causes enough laughter to make one forget the rest of the stupidity.<br/><br/>Almost a parody on his own career, at least Walken is not afraid to roll around in the dirt for a few cheap laughs. And, in this film, he really rolls around a lot.<br/><br/>But, if you're looking for light (and I mean very light) summer fare, one could do worse than ""Balls of Fury."" Not MUCH worse, granted, but certainly as bad.<br/><br/>Like ""Mr. Bean's Holiday,"" for instance."

","Balls of Fury is an attempt at greatness but falls flat, mostly due to the shamble-creating Don Fogler. His comedic style constantly stays in the mud, and for a movie like Balls of Fury to depend on him carrying it, of course the whole house then falls flat. This movie is an example of him being unable to spear-head a movie, and that he is better built for supporting roles. Even the redeemable Walken, showcasing his self- parody style and perfect dialogue delivery, could not help lift or alleviate the walking corpse that this movie is. It has few redeemable features, its stupidly predictable, and has little to offer to the genre of comedy."

","Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) used to be a ping pong prodigy. Nineteen years earlier, he lost a big match and his father was killed by the triads for losing his bet. Today, he's a dining theater act. FBI Agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) recruits him to track down arch-criminal Feng (Christopher Walken) who is hosting an underground ping pong tournament. After initial rust, Rodriguez directs him to Wong (James Hong) and his niece Maggie (Maggie Q) for training. He is given the golden paddle as an invite to the secret tournament in Central America.<br/><br/>This is extremely stupid. It's a little funny. It's not mean-spirited. Dan Fogler is a nice lead but not necessarily a top one. The comedy doesn't always hit. This is better than most but not really that great."

","Balls of Fury (2007): Dir: Robert Ben Garant / Cast: Dan Fogler, Christopher Walken, George Lopez, Maggie Q, James Hong: One joke comedy about smaller factors conquering the masses. Dan Fogler plays a washed out ping-pong player recruited by FBI to go undercover at a ping-pong tournament in order to bring down his father's murderer. Funny setup becomes repetitious and perhaps too carefree in the third act. Director Robert Ben Garant throws in every martial arts joke he can but his biggest aid is the mock production that add both look and satire appeal. Fogler loses his passion only to find it again. He aims to avenge his father's death but becomes embarked upon many amusing training sessions that often place him in pain. To say that he wins the tournament and avenges his father is obvious. What works is Christopher Walken who is terrific as the underground tyrant out to create fatal tournaments for pleasure not realizing that his past is catching up to him. George Lopez as an FBI agent is a great idea but the role is pretty routine. Maggie Q plays the daughter of Fogler's blind trainer, which is to say that her existence is purely as a sexual tease with predictable results. James Hong provides much amusement as Fogler's trainer of sort, whose methods provide some of the best laughs. Well made satire of martial arts films using a harmless sport to more devastating results. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

","Caddyshack spoofed golf and Balls of Fury spoofs ping pong. It does it in the same witty, deadpan, slapstick style with which Caddyshack spoofed golf. It was hilarious. When this movie first appeared in theatres, all the critics gave it such a bad review that I never went to see it and hesitated to rent it. Now, that I have finally seen it six years later (!!), I can only surmise that all those critics had clearly lost their way AND their sense of humor. The plot is silly, but no-one goes to see a movie called Balls of Fury with the expectation that it's going to be an Oscar nominated film. The movie has plenty of zingers and great one-liners that had me laughing out loud. Even the visuals were fantastically funny. Honestly, this was slapstick at its best. If you enjoyed a movie like Caddyshack back in the day, you will most certainly enjoy this."

","""Balls of Fury"" is a poor, obvious comedy notable only for starring Christopher Walken as a....as a what? A mixed race, Manchurian, mafia, robot-loving super villain with a fetish for ping-pong? <br/><br/>The film's a comedic take on Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"", but its jokes are mostly all dated. Even by the standards of similarly trashy ""sports comedies"" like ""Dodgeball"", ""Blades of Glory"" and ""Semi Pro"", ""Balls of Fury"" is weak. The film stars actress Maggie Q, who is some kind of statistical anomaly: a Vietnamese, Hawaian, Polish, American Irish woman. That's what the Q stands for.

","I have yet to finish watching this DVD, but already I can see where the movie went wrong. Not to take anything away from Mr. Fogler whose credentials are impressive and talent obvious, but he is miscast in this movie. Sandler would have at least made the relationship part with Maggie Q a little more acceptable. She is hot and the fat comic getting the hot chick is so lame it reeks. It's also becoming stereotypical these daze. I think the mistake that takes everything else off course is the tone of approach to making this movie. It needed just a little more believability. Like any fiction the more believable the story the more successful the movie or book. This movie had too much silly, which seems to be the current generation's idea of comedy. Try subtlety. It would be a lot better. Silly, insults your audience and makes us feel dumbed down. We deserve better.It kinda wasted the talents of Christopher Walken, James Hong, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa among others. A good concept, but poor execution . . ."

The supporting cast is fabulous, starting with Christopher Walken having an absolute ball, and carrying on with James Hong, Maggie Q, George Lopez, Jason Scott Lee and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa.<br/><br/>The movie is completely daft, amusing throughout (though not particularly hilarious) and passes an amiable hour and a half.

","Balls of fury is a story of a Randy Daytona, a ping pong prodigy who represents his country at 1988 Olympics, reaches the Semis and lose out to a German, his father any army personnel bets on his win, is killed by the bad guys when he is not able to pay the money. Now around 18-20 years later, this guy is contacted by a FBI agent who wants Randy to work for him and participate in top secret private ping pong tournament of the same guy who killed Randy's father. That's it; the story ends in first 20-30 minutes of the movie, for the rest of the movie, there nothing but pure crap. Randy Daytona is trained by a blind ping pong master, who has to be the master of the villain too. This blind fellow lives with a beautiful girl (Maggie Q) who becomes Randy's love interest. Movie is full of cheap and utter useless comedy scenes, after a point you don't even feel like laughing at those scenes. Also from the trailers it appeared that movie would have some great table tennis shots and games but they are just exaggerated and computer generated sequences. Even not even a single actor does a work worth mentioning.<br/><br/>http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/"
"bob the moo","Null","0","3","4 August 2008"," Amusing distraction but nothing more
","Nineteen years ago, Randy Daytona was the golden boy of the US Olympic team in Seoul. A child prodigy, he is a sure thing for the gold medal in the event of table-tennis. Unfortunately, Randy chokes and his father is murdered to make up for the significant financial losses that this meant for him and cruel gangster Feng. Nowadays the lasting shame of this has seen him trading his skills at matinée lunch variety shows to uncaring audiences. This might change though as the FBI need him to infiltrate the high-stakes and totally secret ping-pong tournament organised by none other than Feng himself. The chance to avenge his father is too great to turn down, but can Randy overcome his fear of failure and his rusty abilities? Another sport, another film with the humour of Dodgeball, Beerfest, Semi-Pro and so on  indeed so familiar is Balls of Fury that it needs to do very little to introduce itself since you pretty much know what you're getting into. In terms of the genre (for this is almost populated enough to be called a ""genre"") the film is not anything special but it does just about do enough to be an amusing distraction. The plot is straightforward and is used to produce the usual comedy but without as many laughs as I expected. There are some really funny and clever moments but they are in the minority and mostly the film concentrates on moving the plot forward with a generally amusing air.<br/><br/>The casting has lots of familiar faces and generally everyone does well. I've not really seen Fogler in much else but on the evidence of this he is reasonably suited to the ""comedy big man"" role but not much else. Lopez and Hong support him solidly enough, while Maggie Q does what she does best  look thin and pretty. The rest of the cast features a surprising amount of faces  few of whom have a great deal to do. Walken could have done more with better material to play up on his type-casting but at times he does look a little pained. Patrick, Crews, Lee and Bader are tiny additions who don't add more than a few laughs each  special mention to Tyler though, who does the ""stunning Amazonian"" thing and makes it look easy, again a shame that the film doesn't give her more to do with it.<br/><br/>Balls of Fury is not a great film by any means. Even by the standards of its genre it is only an amusing distracting  which will do for some but for the majority of viewers will be able to find funnier films based on essentially the same ideas."

","Well what can be said? The thing is you already know whether you'll like this movie or not. You'll like this if you like the kind of goofy stuff Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Jack Black, Adam Sandler, etc put out. This is not an ""intelligent comedy"", this is ""silly"" stuff, and it's quite good at it. Interestingly, this is also a somewhat of a spoof. Interestingly because that angle wasn't used in the marketing and because the movie spoofed is from the early 70s! Indeed the plot is mainly a spoof/homage of the Bruce Lee classic ""Enter The Dragon"", with martial arts replaced by table tennis, and let me tell you it's a hell of a lot funnier than the official ""spoof movies"" delivered regularly by the Seltzer/Friedberg duo. The cast is good and full of familiar faces if you know your stuff (James Hong, Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa, Robert Patrick, etc...) and the laughs are aplenty. Once again this is a comedy with jokes based on people falling and getting hit, gay guys, pandas and Asian people, and if you know what to expect you should enjoy it. The only disappointing part to me was that there wasn't a ping pong match in a hall of mirrors (watch Enter The Dragon if you don't know what I'm talking about)."
"Boba_Fett1138","5","0","2","13 June 2008"," Begins promising but sleeps in real fast.
","Obviously this movie got inspired by the success of recent silly comedies and the ones about sports in particular. The movie has more misses then hits in it with its comedy and even though the movie certainly does has its moments, it's just not really a good or recommendable one to watch.<br/><br/>Well, I sort of like this recent silly comedies of this new decade, even though not all are of high quality. They are just so silly that you can't help but laughing. This movie unfortunately is not among the best silly comedies of last recent years. It begins real good and promising but once the main story starts to kick in the movie starts to sleep in and becomes an usual, formulaic, silly, predictable movie, that lacks far too many original or truly hilarious moments. The movie sort of gets better again once Christopher Walken makes his entrance but it's just all not good enough to make this an effective movie. The movie constantly keeps you thinking throughout; They could had really done a better job with this!<br/><br/>It's concept sounds hilarious on its own right and the movie and main story is a spoof of the Bruce Lee class ""Enter the Dragon"". That movie already sort of was a silly movie in its own right but in a good and almost brilliant way. ""Balls of Fury"" is far from ever being good or brilliant though.<br/><br/>Probably still the most hilarious element of the movie is the fact that Christopher Walken is in it. He plays his role of course deliberately from a serious angle which makes the comedy involving his character to work out all the better. His role is sort of too small though, also since he doesn't make his appearance until about halve way through the movie. It was as if he only was available for two weeks and they had to shoot all of his stuff in that time frame. None of the other main actors are really solid enough to fully carry this movie and some actors aren't even at the right place in this comedy.<br/><br/>For a good silly sports comedy, watch ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" instead.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
