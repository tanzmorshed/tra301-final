","I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (""the Bear"") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of ""Glory Road"" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the ""Pit"". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about ""the Bear"" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as ""the Bear"". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book ""Glory Road"" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by ""the Bear"", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book ""Slam Dunk to Glory"". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards."

","In 1966, a coach of a girl's basketball team comes to Texas Western College and recruits seven black players to lead them to the top.<br/><br/>Right from the trailers and the posters, you probably know how ""Glory Road"" is gonna go: an underdog NCAA basketball team must face great odds to win the championship. It's a sports movie based from true events (read: based) with a Hollywood tag plastered over its forehead that features reluctant heroes overcoming their problems and giving it all for the game. Nonetheless, the movie achieves more than that. <br/><br/>While this Jerry Bruckheimer-produced Disney movie plot is typical (remember the Titans?), the underlying socio-political theme effectively presents the ills of racism - a problem with no easy way out of (ask Paul Haggis). The key characters of the game are dealing with discrimination and the only way they can get back is to win. Of course, a little research told me that some of the details about the real events were changed for cinematic purposes. It's completely fine by me as long as the end product justifies the means. And boy it does. The performances are also good. Josh Lucas gives a terrific performance as Don Haskins, the head coach of the team that featured the first all-black starting lineup in US NCAA history.<br/><br/>""Glory Road"" is a formulaic yet an enjoyable film. It's a movie that gives itself away as soon as one character says ""I want to play, Coach!"" Still it has charm and excitement that comes from seeing it for what it is. It's predictable, yeah, but it's not much different from seeing a replay of a game where your favorite team won."
"Buddy-51","7","28","34","9 March 2006"," conventional but entertaining sports flick
","""Glory Road"" tells the true story of Don Haskins, the basketball coach for Western Texas College, who in the mid 1960's, broke the color barrier in the NCAA by being the first to feature a majority of black players on his team. The movie chronicles the obstacles he and his players faced, as well as their ultimate triumph when the team won the national championship in 1966.<br/><br/>""Glory Road"" worships at the altar of just about every underdog-sports-movie clich√© one can imagine, yet the viewer can't help getting caught up in its story anyway. The scenes in the first half of the movie definitely have a familiar ring to them, as we see the coach first alienating his players with his hardnosed tactics, then winning them over by building comradeship and showing them how much they can accomplish when they work together as a team rather than as individuals. However, as with ""Remember the Titans,"" ""Glory Road"" is more interested in examining the social background of its time period than in merely telling yet another sports-oriented David and Goliath tale. The second half of the film concentrates more on the overt racism the team members face and the surprising courage they and their coach demonstrate in confronting it (could this really be set a mere 40 years ago?). The young actors are uniformly excellent, but it is Josh Lucas as Coach Haskins who delivers the powerhouse performance here. And director James Gartner manages to keep the film moving at a fast clip, never allowing it to get bogged down in message-mongering or overt preachiness.<br/><br/>Almost in spite of itself, ""Glory Road"" turns into a genuinely inspiring story about courage and determination in the face of societal pressure and incalculable odds. And that's pretty much what sports stories, familiar though they might be, are really all about."
"Vic_max","Null","15","17","4 September 2007"," Started Slow - but got better and better and better ...
","This 2 hour movie is pretty lackluster for the first 50 minutes or so. Then it picks up and the intensity builds and builds right to the end. It's simply one of those great sports movie that's really well done.<br/><br/>This is the story based on one of the most historic series of games in basketball history. A ""minor"" coach hired is hired to coach an equally ""minor"" Texas basketball team - but decides to do something different. He hires black players to play ... the year is 1965.<br/><br/>Because it's based on true events it has an immediate interest value. The fact that it deals with the colorblind ""win or lose"" dictum of sports coupled with racial tensions makes it all the more potentially interesting.<br/><br/>The movie delivers the goods: great performances and a lot of sports suspense. However, you have give it chance - the first one forth of the show is kind of slow.<br/><br/>For basketball fans and general audiences alike - this is a good movie worth checking out."
"leslieberger2002","Null","31","42","3 February 2006"," Everyone ought to see this Film, especially Basket Ball Game lovers
","Whether you are a fan of basketball or not, this film touches on so many different topics. A show about real life, portrayed by some dynamic actors. Oh my, Josh Lucas, the coach was amazing on film as well as the ""real coach"" he portrayed. How wonderful he was to be ""color blind"" when coaching the game of basketball, down in the south where there was so much cruelty and prejudice.<br/><br/>This was a heartfelt movie where often, I got upset to see how cruel people would be to others, just because of the color of their skin. I am ""white"" though not white like this screen, lol, and raised in Los Angeles during the late 60's/70's and just never understood why people would not like you, without even knowing you just because of your looks/race.<br/><br/>Anyway, go see the movie, it is great!

","The true story of the Texas Western University Miners (now called the University of Texas at El Paso) who defied all odds in 1966 by being the first NCAA basketball team to start five African-American players (led by Derek Luke of ""Antwone Fisher"" and Mehchad Brooks of ""Desperate Housewives"" fame) and ultimately winning the national championship. New coach Don Haskins (played superbly by Josh Lucas, one of the most under-rated actors in film right now) has trouble recruiting when he first arrives, but finds players in places like Detroit and Brooklyn. In the civil rights torn south though, getting African-American ball players was highly controversial and even potentially dangerous. It ends up being fitting that the team would meet up with Adolph Rupp (impressive transformation as usual for Jon Voight) and his University of Kentucky Wildcats for the championship that year as UK was one of the last major colleges to integrate its basketball team. Socially important story and highly educational for youngsters who may not be familiar with the importance of this stage in contemporary U.S. and sports history. Great sequences and styles in the tradition of sports classics like ""Hoosiers"", ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Friday Night Lights"". 5 stars out of 5."
"cthoenen1","7","42","65","16 January 2006"," Left out some important facts to boost the hype, but decent movie
","First off, it was just too similar to remember the titans, but I liked that movie two. The only thing that bothered me about this movie was that removal of some important facts.<br/><br/>Texas Western had three Black Players on the team already, upon Don Haskin's Arrival. Don Haskin's wasn't the sole person leading a movement to recruit black players. In their conference, they played many teams with black players.<br/><br/>Loyola-Chicago, while not fielding 5 black starters, fielded four of them and won the championship in 1963. So even though Texas Western was the first team to win with all black starters, other primarily black teams have won prior.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, they talk about how people felt black players could never be as good as white players. Even as the movie shows, the all-American player they went against (I believe he was from University of Texas) was Black. The NCAA recognized that player as one of the best players in the sport.<br/><br/>Again, it was a good movie, but I felt a little let down that they manipulated the story a tad for the sake of entertainment."
"chill-61","7","69","112","19 January 2006"," Glory Road's History of TWC and Games Inaccurate
","Glory Road is a very entertaining movie if you are will to overlook its many inaccuracies. The movie would make the viewer think that Coach Haskins came to TWC and recruited a national championship caliber team in his first year as a collegiate coach. The truth is that Coach Haskins had been at TWC for 3 or 4 years before the national championship year and that there were several black players already at TWC including Nolan Richardson. Haskins also recruited Jim Barnes before the championship year and teams that Barnes played on may have been better than the championship team.<br/><br/>The film also take too many liberties with the games that were played during the championship year. The first game of the year was not a nail biter as the film shows but almost a 50 point blowout. The film shows that Iowa led TWC most of the game. The Iowa game was never close and certainly was no buzzer beater. The fact is that TWC only played a handful of games that were close that year, most notably against New Mexico and then in the NCAA Tournament against Cincy and Kansas.<br/><br/>The most disappointing inaccuracy shown in the film was the final game against Kentucky. Kentucky only led briefly in the game and TWC had as much as an 11 point lead in the 2nd half. TWC was not behind when Bobby Joe Hill stole the ball twice in the first half. The two steals allowed TWC to expand its lead to 5 points and set the tone for the rest of the game. I know the producers of the movie had to have a more exciting finish to keep the audience excited but the truth is that the game was never much in doubt. If anyone has seen the actual game film that exists, you will see a poorly played offensive game by both teams and an outstanding defensive effort by TWC. The movie should have paid more time on Coach Haskins' three guard strategy to counter Kentucky's fast break offense.<br/><br/>Glory Road is an inspirational movie but not a very accurate movie if you know the history of TWC. See the movie if you want to watch a feel good movie but not if you are looking for sports fact."
"claudio_carvalho","8","6","7","7 January 2017"," Great Message Based on a True Story
","In 1965, the coach of the high school girl basketball team Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) is invited by the Texas Western Miners to be their coach. Despite the lack of budget, Haskins sees the chance to dispute the NCAA and moves with his wife and children to the college dormitory. He recruits seven talented and rejected black players to play with five Caucasian players and formed a legendary team that wined the 1966 national championship against the powerful Kentucky.<br/><br/>""Glory Road"" is an engaging film with a great message based on a true story. In a period when the racism was explicit in the USA, Don Haskins challenged many people with his team of black players implementing discipline and training and winning the NCAA against all the odds. The film shows the difficulties and prejudice the players were submitted and how they superseded all the relationship problems proving that they were equal to (or even better than) the white players. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Estrada para a Gl√≥ria"" (""Road to the Glory"")"
"TheMovieMark","7","25","41","13 January 2006"," Works better as a movie than a history lesson
","""We play fundamental, disciplined, defensive basketball."" <br/><br/>Don Haskins wasn't interested in flashy, behind-the-back passes. Initially, slam dunks were even banned. Coming from the school of thought that ""showboatin's nothing but insecurity,"" Haskins was intent on teaching a group of street-ballers the fine art of fundamentals because he knew that's what it would take to win a championship.<br/><br/>Haskins also had no interest in making political statements. He believed in recruiting the best raw talent he could find, regardless of race or background. His main goal was to win basketball games, and he would do that any way he could. He chose to play an all-black starting lineup against the all-white Kentucky Wildcats in the NCAA championship game not so that he could champion a cause but because those were the guys he thought would give the team the best chance of winning. It just so happens that Haskins and Texas Western were able to break down a few color barriers along the way. As one of the original players said, ""We didn't break down all the doors, but we opened some."" <br/><br/>The thing that impressed me most regarding Glory Road is the authentic look and feel of the movie, particularly the championship game. Filmed with a gritty, sepia look, the viewer gets the sense that he's watching genuine footage from the '60s. The cinematography executes a great balance between colorful and drab, effectively capturing the environment of the time and location.<br/><br/>Production design is just as authentic, using replicas of signs and banners that were at the actual game. Those with a real eye for detail will note that even the concession cups carry the Coca-Cola design of 1966. And of course, a basketball movie set in 1966 wouldn't be complete without the super tight short shorts. Youngsters familiar only with the parachute pants that players wear these days might be in for a culture shock.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that the cast and crew were so intent on making the championship game as accurate as possible that they studied choreographed storyboards of each play that would be recreated for the film. Homemade video footage of the game was used to assure legitimacy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, legitimacy isn't a main concern with regard to the rest of the story. Glory Road is fast, dramatic, and often funny, but it plays it loose with the facts. Some purists might be dismayed, but director Gartner admits, ""We took some artistic license as this isn't intended to be a biopic."" <br/><br/>Haskins didn't swoop into El Paso, quickly find a group of black players, and then turn them into a championship team in one year, as the movie would have you believe. He slowly built the team. He became the head coach of Texas Western in 1961 and made it to the championship in 1966. Also, the movie is peppered with racial tension among teammates and hotel ransackings that never happened. Can you say ""added for dramatic effect""? <br/><br/>But I suggest that you not dwell too much on the factual inconsistencies. The bottom line is that Glory Road is not only entertaining, but it also gets across an important point. No, Haskins wasn't trumpeting a cause, but his desire to win at any cost went a long way in changing the national perception of black athletes and helped kick start the desegregation of college sports.<br/><br/>If you agree with Haskins' ""Decent don't cut it with me"" mantra then check out Glory Road. It's not just decent; it's a really good mixture of fact and fiction that tells one of the most important, and least known, stories in sports history.<br/><br/>Make sure you stay through the closing credits."

Heartland gave that award to this film.<br/><br/>It's 1965 in Texas, and a new, young, white basketball coach, Don Haskins, gets his first chance to coach a Division I men's basketball team, Texas Western. There is a lot going against him. His past experience is coaching a women's basketball team, and the school has a poor basketball tradition, and he cannot recruit good white players. But, he is determined to succeed. And, he doesn't see color when he evaluates talent.<br/><br/>Forty years ago, there were virtually no black college players in the South. There was even an unwritten rule that you could play 1 black at a time at home, 2 on the road, and 3 if you were losing badly. Don Haskins recruits blacks in Northern cities, and brings them to Texas Western to play basketball and, just as important, to be students..<br/><br/>The road to glory is not easy, and there are many obstacles. The black players have to adjust to a strict coach who wants them to play fundamental basketball and not street basketball. The black players face subtle and overt racial prejudice. And the school administration, alumni, and student body aren't quite sure their coach is doing the right thing. <br/><br/>The black players, the white players, and Don Haskins display great human traits as they persevere throughout the school year and basketball season. They are courageous and even heroic in meeting great challenges. They sacrifice to achieve their goals. And, they keep their dignity at all times.<br/><br/>This is a ""Hoosiers"" with a conscience.

","Josh Lucas stars in ""Glory Road,"" a 2006 Disney film, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>The film purports to tell the true story of Don Haskins, the basketball coach led the Texas Western Miners to a National Championship victory in 1966.<br/><br/>From what I know, there is a lot of dramatic license taken here, though it remains an inspiring story, and the basketball game played at the championships was very exciting. Also, at the end of the film, there are interviews with the real-life players and with Haskins himself as the credits are rolling. <br/><br/>Haskins recruited players with no regard to color, forming a team with 7 blacks and 5 white players. He wasn't the first person to have black players on a team. I think what made him stand out were the numbers and the fact that at the championship, the starters were black and everyone on the Kentucky team was white.<br/><br/>The film shows Haskins as an extremely tough coach, and his insistence that there be no ""showboating"" However, during a losing game (and I have no idea if this is true) one of the black players told Haskins that they should be allowed to play ""their game"" which included some showboating, I guess. Haskins said okay and the team went on to win.<br/><br/>In the championship game, they went up against Kentucky, coached by Ed Rupp (Jon Voight) who is portrayed as a racist. However, he went on to draft black players and is considered one of the greatest coaches in college basketball. <br/><br/>Josh Lucas plays Haskins, and he does a great job as a tough, determined coach. He was the reason I rented this film as I liked him on his ill-fated TV show, The Firm. He really carries this movie. Jon Voight, Emily Deschanel (Haskins' wife) have small roles as the focus is on the team players. <br/><br/>The actors on the team all did a wonderful job. The film shows the hatred and prejudice against them but also the eventual acceptance. In the film, there are problems within the team when the new players first arrived, though I understand that wasn't really the case.<br/><br/>Like all of these underdog films, it's inspiring with exciting, moving, and dramatic moments.

","The scene where the ball player is beaten and dunked into a commode and the scene back at the motel were made up! Not embellished, not artistic license, but literally made up! An Oregon writer who was at the 1966 Oregon-Texas Western game depicted knew immediately that wasn't what happened and contacted the director who finally admitted making up these 2 scenes (plus the Ore-TW basketball game slant) to make the movie more race intensive. I was a college basketball player then and remember the season well and pulled hard for Texas Western to beat UK. I took my wife to see this movie and told her I wasn't aware that the scenes depicted ever happened, but I would have been just as embarrassed then as I was when we left the theater.

I had low expectations when I entered the theater, the movie is about basketball (I am not a sports fan), and I haven't been very impressed with Disney recently, so I wasn't expecting much. What I got was a wonderful story about the racial implications of an integrated basketball team in the south, during the tumultuous '60's. I recognized the actor who played the coach from his role in Sweet Home Alabama, but was happy to see excellent performances from actors I had not heard of before. Hopefully, this movie will be a breakthrough role for some of them.<br/><br/>The film fostered discussion of current race relations, opportunities, and sports over drinks afterwards. It was an excellent reminder of the fight many faced daily to secure Civil Rights that many of my generation take for granted.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film I would recommend to anyone. This movie is appropriate for young children (mature 5 years and older), although some discussion of why some ""bad"" people in the movie did ""mean"" things may be necessary.

But, since the producers think they can take liberties with facts, the whole premise of this tale is now re-spun from a ""true story"" into a story ""based on true events."" I hate that. I guess that means that all the racism portrayed in the film also was based on true events that occurred ""elsewhere?""<br/><br/>A nice ""true"" story that loses major style points for classic Hollywood remixing of facts, and reinvention of real events. If you are white, this movie is designed to make you feel guilty about the prejudice that once existed in this country that you didn't have anything to do with. If you are black, this movie will in all likelihood inspire you to feel superior about your athletic abilities, and also make you angry and bitter over the portrayal of racism in the deep South during the 60's.

","Living in El Paso TX waiting for friends to finish their time serving in the Army at Fort Bliss leaves me a lot of time to study local culture and history in this border town, and I spend a lot of time going to the movies.<br/><br/>Recently, Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer made a film based on a true story about a small time basketball coach who, in 1966, took the lowly Texas Westerns to the NCAA championship. Called ""Glory Road"" tells the story of Don Haskins -- the first college basketball coach to integrate his team with African-American players causing an immediate firestorm of controversy. The film explores Haskins's struggles, along with those of his team as they battle for ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Did you like ""Remember the Titans?"" I mean really like it? Because producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the Walt Disney Corporation have plowed through the annals of sports history to serve up almost the exact same story, this time taking their dubious intentions to the world of college basketball. I wasn't a fan of ""Titans;"" I found the film an insufferable, simplistic creation that made a mockery of real-life racism in the 1960s and ""Road"" simply reheats the same stew.<br/><br/>Bruckheimer has chosen James Gartner to make his directing debut with ""Road,"" and the newcomer seems like an apt choice, since this a film that doesn't require much direction. ""Road"" is formula at its most poisonous, with Gartner mechanically visualizing the Crayola script, regardless of how ridiculous the film gets.<br/><br/>""Road"" is grabbing at inspirational and heart-warming messages, but the screenplay is entirely obnoxious, plugging up any honest thrill of this story with appalling caricatures of Caucasians (who wave Confederate flags at the final game), one-dimensional supporting roles (Emily Deschanel, as Haskins's wife, is given nothing to play), and bestowing immediate sainthood on any black character within striking distance.<br/><br/>The script even gives one player a heart defect for him to overcome, just to jackhammer home the point that these guys had everything against them. There is simply nothing resembling real life in the film, just basic cable motivations and infantile storytelling that somehow lucked itself into a big screen release pattern and budget. I can't fault Bruckheimer for softening the story, but in his pursuit to make a film that has vicious mass appeal, he's bled the humanity and emotional weight completely out of this significant historical achievement.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for Josh Lucas's performance as Haskins, there wouldn't be anything in ""Road"" to recommend. Lucas has the perfect idea to ignore the rest of the movie, and focus deeply on the scorching passion Haskins has for the game. Lucas is completely authentic in the role, and adds to the electricity of the repetitive game sequences with his fiery courtside demeanor. Of course, he still has to deal with the script's obsession with never-ending inspirational speeches (a Derek Luke specialty) and grotesque paint-by-numbers plotting, but he's good here, against all the odds.<br/><br/>What really angers about ""Road"" is the absence of a true team portrait for the Texas Westerns. By only focusing in on the black members, Gartner has done a great disservice to the other athletes who helped define the team's winning season. ""Road"" provides the faintest of characterizations for these players, only calling them in to continually diminish their role in the team's importance, or to use them as cartoons to help underscore their differences in skin color. What a shame. To confuse matters more, ""Road"" closes with a real snapshot of the winning team. In the picture, we see the whole squad, standing together proud and victorious, bringing on one and only thought: who were those white and Hispanic dudes?"

I was high enough up the food chain in the military to hear conversations behind closed doors. In the small Arkansas town I grew up in, blacks lived across the tracks and up the hill - they probably still do.<br/><br/>A.O. Scott comments in the New York Times about Glory Road: ""Glory Road finds its true story at a point where sports history intersects with the struggle for racial equality. The annals of postwar America are full of such moments, but few of them are as astonishing and consequential as the 1966 N.C.A.A. championship game, in which Don Haskins, coach of the Miners of Texas Western (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso), sent five black players onto the floor against Adolph Rupp's all-white University of Kentucky team."" Forget about Josh Lucas, Tatyana Ali, Emily Deschanel, or Jon Voight. They were incidental to the film and could have easily been replaced with others. The story of the Texas Western basketball players in 1966 is what Glory Road is all about.<br/><br/>It happened in 1966. I was a sophomore in High School. I knew no more about Civil Rights or black oppression that the next guy. The only thing I knew for sure was that we used a two-handed set shot, not jumpers or Michael Jordan moves. It's the same criticism that I have of Hoosiers, another great basketball film. It wasn't my great grandfather's day; it was mine. It still is. If you are not moved by this film, then you are part of what was wrong then and what is not corrected to this day. It was about respect and the need for humans to give each other their due and not dwell on stupidity. We were all cut from the same cloth many many generations ago in Africa. <br/><br/>I came to Florida from West Texas and know the area well. Color is not important there when it comes to sports. We've gotten past that. It is time to get past it in other areas of our lives. If Glory Road can help a little bit in that, then it is well worth your time.<br/><br/>Well, it's well worth your time anyway as it is a great movie.

","Even with never having seen ""Remember the Titans,"" ""Coach Carter,"" ""Miracle,"" or even ""Hoosiers,"" etc. etc. I can still tell that ""Glory Road"" is a pretty much by the numbers ""based on a true story"" intended to be an inspirational moment of sports history. <br/><br/>The best moments are those that are unique to this individual portrait of an ambitious small college basketball coach who makes the somewhat cynical decision just to win by exponentially integrating NCAA games through the recruitment and playing of black players in the early '60's. The tour of Northern and inner city neighborhoods, such as Gary, Houston and the South Bronx, and how he cajoles them and their families in to coming to El Paso is both entertaining and sociologically revealing of class issues at the time. I particularly liked a comment that the best job possibilities a black basketball prodigy had at the time was to play for the Harlem Globetrotters. <br/><br/>But there are only the most trivial token efforts made to put any of this in historical context with brief flashes of TV news about the civil rights movement and the Viet Nam War, with passing references to black power, Martin Luther King and Elijah Mohammed. We hear lots of Motown music and occasional gospel which I guess is the source of the title that other wise eluded me (but ""People Get Ready"" twice?), though very little country or Latin music despite the Tex Mex locale. We do get some rueful acknowledgment that this is a side light sport in Texas compared to football, as we saw in ""Friday Night Lights.""<br/><br/>We get some of the usual threats scenes with racists of the period, both alumni supporters and on the road in the South -- though, oddly, none in El Paso. There is one more unusual scene where the white players somewhat uncomfortably try to participate in a black majority party; some of the best dialogs are these gingerly getting to know you black/white interchanges. Otherwise we see very little of their college life, but then playing college ball really is a full-time job. <br/><br/>I was hoping for some ironic awareness that as well as seeing this story as a great civil rights victory of some kind that a coach was playing all-black starters and winning against larger schools with only token black players that this might have been the moment in time when somehow the message all started to go wrong: is this when the wheel turned so that education became a farce --and the only classes we see them in do seem to be dumbed down jock courses-- and all that mattered would be the human and other bling and signing to the NBA from high school? The sop is the brief glimpses we get of the real participants during the credits as we see an interview with the real legends, including coach Pat Riley, who lost to this team in college, and see pictures of the real players with brief descriptions of their career and family paths, many as teachers, including working as coaches from high school to professional leagues. How did it get from them to kids graduating with no non-basketball skills and no moral compass? <br/><br/>Josh Lucas is personable as always, but he is the garden variety inspirational coach. If he said ""son"" one more time, rather than referring to a player by name, I thought I'd scream. Emily Deschanel has almost nothing to do in a virtual traditional First Lady role as his wife who tolerates living in a boys' dorm with their little kids.<br/><br/>Derek Luke is the stand out among the players. Their court action is very convincing. <br/><br/>Jon Voight, with prosthetics, is marvelous in a virtual cameo as the nemesis, Coach 'Adolph' Rupp, of the Goliath they face in the finals. Of course, the credits hasten to add that Rupp later expanded his black roster and coaching staff.<br/><br/>I know very little about basketball so I appreciated that all the games were narrated by sports broadcasters.<br/><br/>Per any Bruckheimer produced movie, it is very loud. <br/><br/>Looking back to this somewhat innocent experience as some bright shining moment doesn't change that the NCAA still needs to cleanse its soul. It's sad to see what colleges could have done with these opportunities for young black men."

","I thought this movie was great. I took my son, his friend, and my daughter and they are all under the age of 11. My youngest son was learning about Martin Luther King, Jr in school and he wanted to learn more about segragation. I thought this movie would be great for him to see. He learned so much about teamwork, friends and working toward a goal. I was impressed with the movie. Josh Lucas was great in this film. I recommend it to anyone. The movie did a great job showing the injustice the West Texas basketball team got while they were on the road. It was hard to watch that but it made you come away from the movie thinking more about the world and how we can all be a little nicer to people. I am glad that they made this movie about such a wonderful basketball team."

"whitakeroh","2","11","29","27 January 2006"," Unfair to whites...
","I think most reasonable Americans will say that they are not racist and deplore it. This is different then saying you agree with cultural values that certain races have proposed to adopt for themselves. Glory Road is a fine story, no disagreement, but like all racial movies, it lacks honesty, and fair dealing.<br/><br/>Truth be told, racism is not an issue today for blacks, period. It was then. This story does a fine job of telling it, and making it halfway interesting. But, there is always more to a story than the pro-liberal anti-racist message. It is truly unfortunate, that we can never address the issues of race honestly. How about a movie about Tookie Williams, the evil black man who killed 4 people in cold blood b/c he was a ""street survivor"". Or we need a movie about how oppressed Whitney Houston is during her last 20 years as a coked up millionaire who is constantly getting arrested. Or maybe a movie about 50 cent, a true story about how he murdered people and sold crack to people while ruining their lives. Or how about a movie that questions black culture, instead of a movie that constantly demonizes white culture as racist, from a time most Americans don't remember. I am unclear as to how these reverse racist movies are always getting made. The VAST majority of white people today bend over backwards and sideways to accommodate black people to insure their every unnecessary demand is met, and that every possible advantage is given them at every challenge. Every college provides unheard of scholarships for black kids based on their color, whilst charging white students exuberant amounts. These are stories that need to be made into movies. But that will not happen. We live in a strange era, where honest talk and forthright communication that asks real questions is severely oppressed by the Government and law. The new McCartyism is, without any shadow of doubt, Racism. This movie promotes the big lie, that whites are racist. People actually still believe this when every shred of evidence points to the contrary. Special privileges are conferred upon blacks at every corner, every excuse given for their behavior, while no accountability is administered. Unfortuanate. And movies like this continue to feed that big race lie. Many people after reading this will be angry. My answer is why? I am not racist. I do not hate the black skin color. No, I think very critically about movies and the issues they pose. I have a Dr. who is black, a female law professor who is black (and very, very intelligent)and several black friends, (unfortuantely too, in this day and age you must always qualify yourself, when thinking critically, as a ""non-racist"") I engage in real conversation w/ blacks quite a bit about the problems I see with their assertions. I can tell you, most at first get mad at me, then listen intently, they realize I do not hate. People who call people racist cop out, and are more full of hate and spite then those they chide. No, people respect me b/c I respect them, but I do not sign off on socially acceptable messages, when under the surface they are very hurtful. As is the case w/ Glory Road, a seemingly truthful movie that shows how blacks are human and special. Thats fine, but it falls on its face in sincerity, and the movie itself charges racism a/g whites. Please, if you see this, remember that it is a clear message that should be taken with a grain of salt."
"fwomp","4","4","8","19 September 2006"," A Shallow Disneyrama Flick That Doesn't Slam-Dunk
","Nothing should take away from the amazing circumstances that led coach Don Haskins to defy southern standards and start playing a mostly black NCAA team in El Paso, Texas during a time when the U.S. was rife with bigoted undertones. But then you watch this Disney film and wonder what went wrong...<br/><br/>The legend of ""The Bear"" (Haskins) lives on in the El Paso community and should leave little doubt in anyone's mind that this great man accomplished something extraordinary in 1966 by leading his black and white Texas Western basketball team to the national title. But in the hands of screenwriter Bettina Gilois, the film falls far short of rousing entertainment.<br/><br/>The movie stars Josh Lucas (SECOND HAND LIONS) as Coach Haskins and Lucas pulls in a good role from this languid script. Matching ""The Bear's"" attitude toward discipline and basketball basics, Lucas' performance was the cherry on this otherwise melting, gooey mess. When we first meet Haskins, he's the coach of a girls high school basketball team and is approached by the tiny NCAA school of Texas Western. Hungry to advance his coaching career, he and his family move into the dorm for the Western team, only to learn that there's little hope for success from such a small community with a crumbling stadium. But Haskins won't give up. He travels around to various states with his coaching team, hoping to find some successful players. But all of the Great White Hopes refuse to join up. So Haskins' search takes him to Harlem, Detroit and other less-than-appealing locales, digging up some of the best black talent the streets have to offer. He meets with much resistance upon returning home, too. People call him and his team the ""N"" word, as well as other unseemly titles. But these taunts soon turn to amazed cheers as Haskins leads his team to a near undefeated first season. And when Haskins team makes it to the NCAA finals, he starts a pure black team, something never heard of in basketball up to that point.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with this awesome historical story, but its execution was lacking on so many levels as to make it a yawner. The audience is jerked from one set of circumstances to the next and they never get to focus on one particular character nor care about any of these wonderful kids (most viewers will probably feel fairly detached rather than anything approaching familiarity).<br/><br/>Comparisons between HOOSIERS and GLORY ROAD can easily be seen (although one is about high school ball while the other is NCAA), and the former still rules the high cinematic ground. Gene Hackmans' coach Dale far outclasses Lucas' portrayal of Haskins, not to mention Hoosiers excellent cohesive story, something completely absent in Glory Road. And this is a sad statement. Someone as important in the racial arena as ""The Bear"" should have had a much better film made about him and his brave team. But instead we get this snoozer, a lackadaisical Disneyrama film with poor character development and shallow entertainment. Stick to Hoosiers; you'll be glad you did."
"irishmama34","8","6","14","21 January 2006"," A story worth telling, a movie worth seeing.
","I'd like to recommend seeing this movie. It's the first movie that I've attended in a long time where at the end of the movie most of the audience broke out into spontaneous applause (a mostly white bread group, too). Stay around for the credits. While they run, you'll see pictures, footage, and interviews of the REAL people involved. Historically, pretty right on. I don't usually suggest that high school history classes ""movie-fy"" their history, but this gives a feeling of the racial ""climate"" (attitudes, some of what it felt like to live the situation -- fear, anger, pride, team support, friendship, etc) in a movie that doesn't feel as preachy as most of this genre and that younger people will find interesting and entertaining (so they'll pay attention). This happened in the 60's: PRE- Remember the Titans and at the college level instead of high school. It has many excellent performances. Yes, it makes use of some of the usual clich√©s in sports movies, but what's important in the movie is the story about people and events that changed the sports world (and our country) for the better. The movie wasn't trying to be an art film or change movie-making. It was trying to tell a story worth telling and I think they did it well."
"mike-925","8","5","11","16 January 2006"," Glory Road: The True Story Behind the Film
","An upstart all black Texas Western Comes from nowhere to win the NCAA Division One Basketball title in 1966. Glory Road is the story of a seminal moment in American College Basketball. <br/><br/>In Glory Road, Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) is coaching a girls high school team in rural West Texas when the call comes from Texas Western of El Paso. The film implies Haskins started the basketball program at Tex-West from scratch in 1965, the season the Miners went all the way against Adolph Rupp's Kentucky in the NCAA Final.<br/><br/>In reality, Haskins was in his fourth year at El Paso in 1965. He did not initiate the program as the film implies, nor did he draft Tex-West's first black players. He inherited a team with three black players on it, in his first year as coach, 1961. <br/><br/>The movie has Haskins arriving at El Paso in 1965 having just left a high school girls basketball coaching job. The Coach finds he is really being hired to keep order in a college dormitory where he and his wife and two children will be forced to live. Texas Western isn't that interested in basketball. <br/><br/>Haskins is unable to draft first rank white players. In desperation, he sends his assistant to Harlem, and tries to attract black playground players himself in Indiana and other urban settings. In reality, Texas Western was among the first of southern colleges to integrate its sports teams. <br/><br/>Glory Road implies that 1966 was the year integration finally penetrated NCAA Basketball. But the University of Cincinnati won the NCAA with four black players in 1962. Loyola won the title with four black players in 1963. By 1966, not many years after the comic black Globetrotters had beaten the all-white Minneapolis Lakers, the NBA's leading players were black: Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson and Elgin Baylor.<br/><br/>So how could the Kentucky-Texas Western Showdown be the moment the NCAA was integrated? It wasn't. It was, instead, the year the mostly southern, Atlantic Coast Conference which had been dragging its feet on team integration, saw the race issue blow up in its face.<br/><br/>Haskins played five black players nearly every game that year, and assembled a 27 and l record, the same record Rupp's Kentucky finished the Season with. Noise about the team kept drifting into the nation's sports pages. But few Americans saw the team play. No one dreamed the upstart black team could challenge the traditional white teams of the ACC.<br/><br/>In the movie El Paso has seven black players and two token whites. The screenplay creates story points out of thin air to create audience support for Texas Western. <br/><br/>The screenplay has Tex-West players doing 180 degree slam dunks, but there was no play like that in the NCAA basketball of 1965-66.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is shown forcing his largely black players to play the game the 'White Way.' In fact playground basketball technique had not yet become an issue in the 1965 NCAA. A story point in Glory Road has Haskins losing several games, then having to give in and let the team 'play black.' In fact, the Miners played disciplined white basketball.<br/><br/>""Play one at home, two on the road and three if you get behind."" This is the supposed comfortable adage about how a coach should use black players in the South. Its a great legendary saying. But integration took place so quickly, there was little time for the saying to take hold and have meaning. Before Brown vs. the Board of Education there were no blacks playing on Southern College Teams. After the NBA integrated, the NCAA followed quickly in its footsteps. In '66-'67, the year after tiny Texas Western won it all, Haskins had no blacks in his starting lineup. By 1969 even Rupp had his first black player.<br/><br/>Don Haskins is a legend, but he never again placed a team in the NCAA Finals. The luck and talent that assembled and trained this great team in 1965-66, did not repeat. <br/><br/>Still the NCAA Final Game between Rupp's Kentuckians and Haskins' black Tex-Wests IS a great drama. Americans and most NCAA Teams had read stories about the upstarts, but few had ever seen them play. <br/><br/>Only one Atlantic Coast Conference Basketball game a week appeared on national TV then. With no previous reputation, Tex-West had appeared not once on television. The team was only seen where they played. The five black men all on the floor at the same time scared some college teams that had not played a totally black team before.<br/><br/>Actor John Voight disappears in makeup to make him look the image of Adolph Rupp. Voight has obviously studied game films of Rupp. His portrayal is like nothing seen from him before. The Rupp on screen is a jowly, elderly man with a load of mannerisms and tics. Voight's performance is a tour de force. This must be close to the way the real Rupp looked and acted.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled at the end the real Don Haskins appears in black and white inset and tells of his experience. A photo of the real Adolph Rupp shows how close to reality John Voight's makeup was. Haskin's remarks crosscut with black and white game footage. Kentucky player Pat Riley then appears and adds a stunning perspective to the events of March, 1966. Riley, now an NBA coach, says he went to the Miners' locker room after he'd recovered some and congratulated the black players.<br/><br/>Riley said no one realized the significance of the game immediately. But as years went by it started to dawn. Riley says it was hard to accept that the black team was that much better than Kentucky then. Over the years he says he has come to see that accepting that was owning up to the dignity and the triumph of their effort."

","I heard a lot about this movie before seeing it so perhaps my expectations were a bit high, however, I wasn't all that thrilled by it. First of all, the ""racist"" angle was a bit overplayed every time the situations arose. I realize the main theme of the story was about overcoming racism but to pound it into us and exaggerate every such instance made it obvious there was a small hint of an agenda here by the producers. Game action was poor, especially the title game. Most annoying was the announcer: ""passes to Smith, over to Jones, etc. etc."" ad nauseam. Were they that bad back in the 60's??? Jon Voight as Adolph Rupp did a very poor job or the direction in his scenes (esp. the team huddles) was just bad. The whole title game had a cheesy feel to it. Very disappointed."

I think the writer should get out of the business and do something more constructive with his life.

","There are certainly a few things to really like about this movie. I really like sports movies and this one certainly delivers on sports action, that for the most part, looked realistic.<br/><br/>I thought Josh Lucas did an excellent job as Don Haskins, although his actually resemblance to Coach Haskins is minimal. All of the acting was decent. The movie moves at a pretty good clip and keeps you interested.<br/><br/>And it's a great story about a great team...except apparently someone didn't think the story was good enough, because they took this really good story and changed it until it barely resembles the true story.<br/><br/>Yes, Texas Western won the NCAA title that year with an all African- American starting lineup and they did beat an all white Kentucky team in the finals and those two teams were coached by Haskins and Adolph Rupp. But after that, the movie is closer to a work of pure fiction than it is fact.<br/><br/>You just have to wonder what kinds of discussions go on when these projects are being developed. Yeah, it's a great story, but we really need to change it around, make up a few things, and you know what...why don't we just make most of it up.<br/><br/>There was one scene in the movie that portrayed the Miners traveling to East Texas State for a game and showing an extremely hostile, racist crowd. The only problem with that scene is that Texas Western didn't play East Texas State on the road that season, they played them at home in the 2nd game of the season. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that what was portrayed never happened, but it certainly didn't happen that season, which (oh by the way) was not Haskins 1st year at TW (it was his 5th season) and (oh by the way) the seven players featured in the movie were not all brought in during the same year (during the championship season, two were seniors, two were juniors, and three were sophomores).<br/><br/>The facts of the Kansas game in the regional finals were equally ignored for the sake of who knows what. At least they got Jo Jo White's name correct.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the mis-truths, made up stuff, etc., I probably could have given this a 7. It is a decent movie. But why make up a bunch of stuff when the original story was good enough as it was."
"tretay84","8","1","1","25 April 2014"," Great Movie with a couple miscues
","Glory Road will go down in my book as one of the greatest basketball movies of all time. Glory Road tells the amazing story of the underdog Texas Western basketball team, with history's first all-African American starting lineup of players, who took over the nation and surprisingly making it to the NCAA tournament title game in 1966. In 1962 Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) - a player who had big dreams to play basketball in college that eventually disappeared because of a knee injury- went West to El Paso, to take the Head Coach position at Texas Western University, a school not known for its basketball program. His new bosses don't offer much to Haskins besides low salary and the family is even forced to live in the same dorm as his players, but they don't expect much in return. After arriving at Texas Western he started to make a few changes. The next few scenes of the movie are a series of short clips from the players. These shorts scenes give the audience a back ground view of these players to see where they come from and what makes them the way they are. Haskins knows he has no chance of recruiting the best white players to come to small Texas Western, so he and his assistant coach flew out north to find African Americans who are happy to have scholarships and a chance to play D-1 college basketball. He was looking for the best players he could get, even though Texas Western was an unknown basketball school. In these times black athletes were often overlooked by major schools, and because Coach Haskins didn't care, he recruited more black players than the typical university would back in those days. One famous quote Haskins tells one potential player in one scene was, ""I don't see color. I see quick. I see skill."" It's qualities like those that motivate Haskins in his drive to produce a winning team. And win they did eventually, but not until Haskins teaches his players halfway, allowing them to incorporate some of the flashy moves that don't fit into Haskins' strict ideas of how the game is played; old school fundamentals. The team eventually comes together as one and they experienced lots of racial abuse throughout the movie because of having an all-black starting lineup. In Texas at that time, we learn, college basketball teams had been integrated, but there was an ""informal rule"" that you never played more than one black player at home games, two on the road or three if you were behind. They make a unbelievable run through the NCAA tournament and beat the number one ranked basketball team of Kentucky. Now this movie isn't about just the underdogs playing in a basketball game; which makes this sports movie different from most. It's about racism in American sports, and how coach Haskins and his players from Texas Western University made a remarkable moment in history I believe can be comparable to when Jackie Robinson was picked up by the Brooklyn Dodgers. After Texas Western played in the the 1966 NCAA championship with an all-black team on the court and went against an all-white Kentucky team coached by the hall of fame legend Adolph Rupp, rules were rewritten. Haskins and his team wrote the ""emancipation proclamation of 1966,"" said NBA coach Pat Riley. ""Glory Road"" is an effective sports movie, but where it succeeds is as the story of a chapter in history, the story of how one coach at one school arrived at an obvious conclusion and acted on it, disregarding the racial rules of the 1960s. I believe he opened college sports in the South to generations of African Americans; even the ones still playing. Since this movie was based on a true story, the end credits tell us what happened in later life to the members of that 1966 Texas Western team, we realize that Haskins not only played for a NCAA title but made a contribution to the future that is still being acknowledged. There are also some humor scenes in this movie that may make you smile, when the black players get drunk in a Hispanic bar or when the white teammates are invited to a very crowded black party. The funniest parts of the movie are the teasing and razzing that goes on during practices and team outings. Chris Cleveland, the writer who adapted the movie from Don Haskins' autobiography and consultation with the real-life players, should get some credit for making dialogue both believable and entertaining. Unfortunately, a few problems keep the movie from being creditable. One problem is the timing of historical inaccuracies that the movie puts in for dramatic effect. For example, Haskins did not actually play in the championship until his fifth season at Texas Western, but the movie has him playing it in his first. Then, there were plenty of black players in college ball before Texas Western, but just not in the southern leagues; the film doesn't show this. In the final game, the movie has Texas Western trailing after the half, when Kentucky never regained the lead after halftime. And in the previous victory over Kansas, the movie overlooks that Kansas had three black players other than JoJo White, and that his famous shot where he stepped out of bounds was not the final shot of the game. Even though I believe most people didn't know these facts, I still think that they could have put these situations in the movie to make it more realistic. In conclusion, Glory Road is a great movie to see especially if you're a sports-drama movie fan. The fun scenes, great story line, and amazing actors makes this one of the movies that you won't get tired of watching for a while. Even though the historical references are a little ""stretched"", they don't take away the good aspects of this film."

At that time, Texas Western's basketball program was not well respected, but Haskins was determined to change that, and in 1966 Haskins assembled what he was certain was a winning team. However, Haskins' starting lineup was comprised entirely of African-American athletes at a time when racially integrated teams were still a novelty in the South and West. Despite generating a firestorm of controversy, Haskins and his players showed they could succeed where it counted -- on the court. In post-season play Haskins and the Texas Western team found themselves competing for the NCAA championship against the University of Kentucky's all-white team, lead by legendary coach Adolph Rupp.<br/><br/>The movie is a rousing and worthy tribute to one of the most important college basketball teams and one of the most important championship games of all time.Also,it is a David and Goliath sports saga that holds just as much suspense and interest no matter how many times you watch it.Obviously,it is an inspiring sports movie."

","We see more and more of these films and that rejuvenates my heart and my mind tremendously. Here it is about the 1966 NCAA Basket Ball competition in which Texas Western lined up the first ever all black basket ball team in the final game, and the black players were a majority in the team from the very start. The film is decent about the difficulties encountered by the coach who made that choice: make them respect his rule, his rhythm and his life discipline while training and then competing; make them live with their differences inside the team, and with the hostility of many outside the team; make them accept to play a unified game as a team even if some would like to play their own personal games. And there are many others. He managed to keep them united even for the final game when he decided to have an all black team then, the white players becoming privileged supporters. Was he conscious he was setting an objective that went a long way beyond the game itself? How can we know? It is sure today that it was a milestone in the civil rights struggle, at least it became one: the 1966 declaration of independence of black basketball players at the national level. The extremely important dimension of this film is that it is not only saying or showing the blacks are better, because after all they might not be better, but showing that their game, their way of playing is better because they are able to unify their ambitions within the whole team and to integrate their white team mates even when it might be considered like bringing the wolf among the sheep by taking them to an all black party one week-end. The film shows how much the civil rights struggle was an all-race team struggle. Without the support of some whites in the public as well as in the hierarchy the struggle might have been a lot longer and even a lot less successful. That has to be said over and over again and demonstrated with as many case studies as possible. That's what Ralph Ellison demonstrated in his books: blacks are invisible but to become visible to whites it is some of these whites who have to open their eyes and see. Without these white eyes seeing the blacks around them, the blacks cannot become visible, no matter what they do. In fact everything they may do might even make them more invisible or might justify some into making these blacks become invisible by erasing them from the picture. And that attitude, so well illustrated in this film, has to be the model for us to deal with all the groups of people who are different from us, no matter what this ""us"" might stand for.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

"goodknowu","7","9","26","8 January 2006"," Good movie for sports minded. Has historic inaccuracies.
","I loved the movie. It's a basketball movie about a small west Texas school that wins the NCAA tournament. The catch is they are all black and play an all white team, Kentucky. The movie depicts the struggle this team has with racism both within and outside the team. It kind of reminds me of ""Remember the Titans"", ""Rudy"", ""Hoosiers"", or ""Miracle"". David vs. Goliath or underdog does good. As a Kentucky basketball fan, I almost found myself rooting for Texas Western. The movie is based on a true story but there are some liberties taken. The scene that disturbed me the most was during the championship game. Behind the bench, Kentucky fans were waving the Confederate flag. I can assure you this did not happen during the real game in Cole Field House. None of the stars on the flag represent the state of Kentucky as Kentucky was not part of the Confederacy. I realize this is Hollywood and the film makers were trying to emphasize racism in this movie, but their point had already been made repeatedly throughout the movie (especially the scene in the Commerce, Texas motel). This was an unnecessary smear to the University of Kentucky and the state. If not for this, I would rate this movie among the top sports movies made. Other minor errors in the movie include Texas Western coach Don Haskins being hired before the historic '65-'66 season, when in reality he was hired 4 years prior. Also I don't think<br/><br/>the Iowa vs. Texas Western game was televised. All in all it was a good movie that parents could take their sports minded children to."

","(Synopsis) ""Glory Road"" was inspired by a true story of Texas Western's Coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas), who led the first all-black starting lineup team to the 1966 NCAA national basketball championship title. Coach Haskins has a lot going against him: first, Texas Western has a poor basketball program, and second, he cannot recruit good white players to the team. Coach Haskins goes to Northern cities to recruit talented black players from the streets to play for his team. The black players must adjust to his coaching, and not play street basketball. Coach Haskins doesn't see color when he evaluates the skill of all of his players, and chooses who plays in the game. With courage and determination, Coach Haskins changed basketball history, when his underdog team beats the powerhouse Kentucky team.<br/><br/>(Comment) This is a very good movie that you should see. It portrays the racial hardships that the coach and all of his players encountered during the 60's. Even though you know that the team wins the championship game, you still root for them during the game. At the end of the movie when the credits start to roll, please stay in your seat, because you will see photos of the actual players with a short commentary, and their careers. You will see an interview with Pat Riley, who played on the Kentucky team, and you will also see footage from the real game. I liked this part the best, because it let you know what happened to the players in life. (Disney Pictures, Run time 1:49, Rated PG) (8/10)"

","After seeing the trailer for ""Glory Road,"" I started calling it ""Hoosiers 10"" as a joke. Now that I have seen it, I take that back.<br/><br/>The story is a thought-provoking one. I come from a generation that cannot fathom a time when basketball was an all white sport. This film accurately recreates that atmosphere, without doing so in a gratuitous or inappropriate manner.<br/><br/>The coach's determination to play his players no matter their color seems like a normal thing today, but the movie shows how unusual and groundbreaking it was for the game of basketball. The movie doesn't try to make this a huge national metaphor, but wisely keeps the diversity issue within the confines of the story's events. In so doing, it makes the issue seem even more important somehow, as if one game of basketball became part of the deluge that would soon begin to sweep away the racist status quo.<br/><br/>The acting is commendable as well. Josh Lucas excels in the sparse dialog, creating a physical presence that makes his character seem like living granite at times. Emily Deschanel has few scenes and lines, but she still creates a beautiful character for the coach's wife. The players were very funny. It was easy to distinguish between them because they were each unique.<br/><br/>""Glory Road"" contains few sentimental scenes and very little romance. The coach is allowed to be a man, and the script does not force him to become a guru or a mother to his players. The bonds between players and coach are intense but not overly dramatic. It is refreshing to see men allowed to act like men, not weepy copies of themselves.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film does not lie in guessing the ending, for we all know where it leads. The beauty lies in celebrating the heart and the work that got an ordinary group of men through an extraordinary story. ""Glory Road"" makes us want to cheer, without manipulating us to do so. It reminds us that sometimes a big change starts with a single courageous choice-like starting five black players in an NCAA championship."

Which is the complete wrong message to send.<br/><br/>I mean the starters were only all ""black"" because the coach played into the race card, what about those other kids that helped them get there? They don't deserve to play because they are white, or Spanish? I don't get how that is ""uplifting"".<br/><br/>I wouldn't really recommend this movie, but Josh Lucas does a great job so do most of the students. It's just the message gets askew during the runtime that really rips what the story should have been about away and leaves you with this hateful piece of work."

","Fine feel good docudrama about the Cinderella team that shocked the collegiate sports world in 1966 by coming from obscure underdog to win the NCAA basketball championship against the legendary Adolph Rupp's heavily favored Kentucky team. The important subtext here is that in building his winning team, Texas Western coach Don Haskins was the first coach in the South to recruit black players.<br/><br/>His team came from inner city ghettos in Detroit, South Bronx, and so on. In the championship game, he fielded a starting lineup that was all black, against Rupp's all white players, a first in college basketball history. Of course, in the north, things had been different for years: Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain had dominated college basketball in the 1950s and led the pro sport in the 60s.<br/><br/>But in the deep south, and Haskins and his players had to endure one hate-filled encounter after another. All of this, plus other problems (players' personalities, health and academic woes), are depicted here. Josh Lucas is splendid as Coach Haskins. Lucas appears to have graduated from the Paul Newman School of Acting. His face in profile is like Newman's, especially the bridge of his nose, but, even more, Lucas's head tilts, confrontive stares and manner of touching his face with his hands are about as Newmanesque as you can get.<br/><br/>But that's all right. Lucas makes these gestures his own in a good turn. With a very old looking Jon Voight as Adolph Rupp. Be sure to stay through the end credits to learn the fates of the players and coaches. This film is a purely formulaic sports success movie, but it is very well done indeed. My grade: low B+ 7.5/10"

","In 1965 Fort Worth, Texas, Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) coaches high school girls' basketball. He gets recruited and moves his wife Mary (Emily Deschanel) and young kids to Texas Western College in El Paso, Texas. It's a shoestrings program with no ambitions. Nobody wants to sign with the losing team until Don sees a black player named Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke). He ignores the unwritten rule of playing one at home, two on the road and three if you're losing. Don starts recruiting both blacks and whites. He insists on coaching traditional basketball. There is racial tension within and outside the team. They overcome many hurdles on their way to reach the NCAA championship.<br/><br/>This is the standard sports movie overcoming racial inequality. I guess that can be counted as a negative but it doesn't have to be. This is well-acted with some good characters. It can come off as clich√© but all that means is that people keep telling the same story over and over again. There's a reason why storytellers keep going back to the same well.

","A well meaning but formulaic film, James Gartner's ""Glory Road"" stars Josh Lucas as Don Haskins, head coach of Texas Western College. Based on a true story, and set in the late 1960s, the film details the formation of the NCAA's first all black starting lineup.<br/><br/>At its best, ""Glory Road"" explores issues of racism, discrimination and social isolation. At its worst, this is a reductive, by-the-numbers film whose climax assigns false triumph to ongoing issues. There's also something tawdry about a co-production between Jerry Bruckheimer and Walt Disney Pictures attempting to promote black consciousness and black pride.<br/><br/>Still, ""Glory Road"" sheds some light on an interesting part of history. It climaxes with a 1966 championship game, a game which would mark a key point in racial integration, and instigate a shift from basketball being labelled a white sport to it becoming a primarily black activity (in terms of race association and participation). ""Glory Road"" co-stars Jon Voight as a weaselly rival coach.<br/><br/>7/10 ‚Äì See ""Inside Moves"" and ""He Got Game""."

","I was discussing affirmative action the other day and encountered the usual argument about those things that happened in our great grandfather's day. Having grown up in the South, I am well aware that many of the things that happened in ""my"" day are still going on to some extent. I was high enough up the food chain in the military to hear conversations behind closed doors. In the small Arkansas town I grew up in, blacks lived across the tracks and up the hill - they probably still do. <br/><br/>A.O. Scott comments in the New York Times about Glory Road: ""Glory Road finds its true story at a point where sports history intersects with the struggle for racial equality. The annals of postwar America are full of such moments, but few of them are as astonishing and consequential as the 1966 N.C.A.A. championship game, in which Don Haskins, coach of the Miners of Texas Western (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso), sent five black players onto the floor against Adolph Rupp's all- white University of Kentucky team."" <br/><br/>Forget about Josh Lucas, Tatyana Ali, Emily Deschanel, or Jon Voight. They were incidental to the film and could have easily been replaced with others. <br/><br/>The story of the Texas Western basketball players in 1966 is what Glory Road is all about. It happened in 1966. I was a sophomore in High School. I knew no more about Civil Rights or black oppression that the next guy. The only thing I knew for sure was that we used a two-handed set shot, not jumpers or Michael Jordan moves. It's the same criticism that I have of Hoosiers, another great basketball film. <br/><br/>It wasn't my great grandfather's day; it was mine. It still is. If you are not moved by this film, then you are part of what was wrong then and what is not corrected to this day. It was about respect and the need for humans to give each other their due and not dwell on stupidity. We were all cut from the same cloth many many generations ago in Africa. I came to Florida from West Texas and know the area well. Color is not important there when it comes to sports. We've gotten past that. It is time to get past it in other areas of our lives. If Glory Road can help a little bit in that, then it is well worth your time. Well, it's well worth your time anyway as it is a great movie. As Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post said: It's one helluva story, and if this moving, and even thrilling little movie finally brings Haskins and a truly great American sports story to light, then three cheers and hooray."

","Glory Road has to be one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I would easily rank in my top 20, perhaps like #17. I like the movie because it was simple but still had you on the edge of your seat the whole time. You would always wonder ""whats gonna happen"" or ""Oh my, whats next"". It was time appropriate. It took place in Southern 1960's and that is exactly how they played it. Almost every time you thought, something that is suppose to happen, will happen, it turned out be just the opposite. It wasn't like those typical sports dark horse movies at all. If you know what I mean. It stands out from those movies because it filled with irony. Glory Road is filled with ironic parts. Some you will get right away. And some you might have to think about for awhile. Derek Luke did a great job playing Bobby Joe Hill. For a second, I actually thought he was a basketball player. Josh Lucas also did a fantastic job playing Don Haskins. He had character and played his role with emotion. Hard to find actors like that anymore. Overall, Glory Road turned out to be a suspenseful, emotional, unpredictable movie that I really enjoyed and wouldn't mind seeing again."

The acting throughout the film is top class.

","Basketball coach Don Haskins made it into the books of fame with his NCAA victory during the 1966 season at Texas Western College. During a time where racial discrimination was a more serious issue, he started his team with 5 African-American players at the NCAA finals creating what is known to be one of the biggest sports upsets of all time. The movie GLORY ROAD directed by James Gartner is a sports drama that's narrates the story of the underdogs of Texas Western College. Based on the novel titled the same which was written by Don Haskins himself the movie does add a pinch of salt into the entire racial banter in order to increase the level of interest and to extract more viewer passion. Much like movies such as REMEMBER THE TITANS, COACH CARTER, THE WRESTLER and THE FIGHTER this movie too can be considered one the greats and indeed a must watch for those fans who savors narrations based on true events. Nothing short of inspiration, every second of the story of Don Haskins and his team can be construed as sheer will to matter. Starring Josh Lucas as Don Haskins I am impressed with the stellar performance he puts up. Just as Denzel Washington, Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Mickey Rouke and Samuel Jackson; Josh Lucas is powerful and potent. If he is doing justice to the real Don Haskins is something I cannot comment on, however the Don Haskins he does portray indeed is a rare breed of man. Derek Luke from BIKER BOYS is the only other character written into the movie with any detail whilst the other stars pretty much hold up the character of Don Haskins; after all it his epic story. GLORY ROAD is the only movie to be directed by James Gartner and I am surprised why he never did pursue his career. Gartners effort on this bio-pic cannot be left unnoticed. There is nothing in this movie that can be considered to be out of place. If one thing could have been tweaked a bit more it would be an inclusion of a commercial soundtrack just to carry her a bit further. That being said GLORY ROAD has not made it to the surface as much as movies such as THE FIGHTER. However it is a crime indeed not to have been entertained by such meaningful productions. These are movies that can make a difference, these are movies that can influence, these are movies that can inspire, this indeed is a movie that one needs to watch!

","If you like sports movies this will be another one to add to your list. Although some of the facts where changed to work with the film it is still very worth it. Watching the man that is Don Haskins and what he was able to accomplish in becoming a national treasure. This was not just a sports story it was about the changing of tolerance and what hard work, discipline with the right leadership can do. The acting performances from all the actors were superb and outstanding. Josh's portrayal as Haskins was remarkable. Don was a coach who did not believe in flashy plays even slam dunks weren't allowed he felt it was showboating and showed someones insecurity. He wanted to instill the fundamentals of basketball cause he knew thats what would make them winners. He also wanted the absolute best talent their was it did not matter their race. He wanted no part in making political statements. When he had the starting line-up during the championship game all being black it wasn't to say how things should change it was about winning and he felt they had the best chance. As history would put it this helped break down some of the color barriers in sports. What was impressive was the look and feel of the movie it looked as if it was real film footage. The attention to detail from the replica signs, to the concession cups even the clothes and plays in the final game made it even more exceptional.

New coach Don Haskins (played superbly by Josh Lucas, one of the most under-rated actors in film right now) has trouble recruiting when he first arrives, but finds players in places like Detroit and Brooklyn. In the civil rights torn south though, getting African-American ball players was highly controversial and even potentially dangerous. It ends up being fitting that the team would meet up with Adolph Rupp (impressive transformation as usual for Jon Voight) and his University of Kentucky Wildcats for the championship that year as UK was one of the last major colleges to integrate its basketball team. Socially important story and highly educational for youngsters who may not be familiar with the importance of this stage in contemporary U.S. and sports history.

","The movie makers here seem to want to just make up history rather than tap into it. This movie is a whole lot more fictionalized than, say, Moneyball (2011), almost to the point of ridiculousness. Various IMDb reviewers have pointed out inaccuracies about Don Haskins' tenure at Texas Western, the movie's characterization of certain games during the Miners' 1965-66 season, and the use of African-American players at Texas Western and elsewhere before and during Haskin's term as coach. Besides all that, the movie makers in the first few minutes, in the part about Haskins' high school coaching, have made little effort to learn anything from the Texas Film Commission or from the state's long-time association for public school athletic competition, the University Interscholastic League (UIL). Haskins coached at Benjamin, Hedley, and Dumas, all UIL school systems. He departed in 1961 for Texas Western, rather than in 1965 a mere year before the Texas Western national championship. The movie opens with a 1965 girls' state championship game being played in Fort Worth. State championships both boys and girls were, in the 1960s, played in Austin, not Fort Worth, and still are played in Austin. Neither Benjamin, Hedley, nor Dumas placed a girls' team in a state championship game until 1980, Dumas didn't even have a girls' high school basketball team in 1961-1965 because schools in the two largest enrollment-size classes were late coming to the sport. Dumas certainly didn't and doesn't have the type of hill or butte topographical relief the movie depicts on the outskirts of town. This resembles Days of Heaven (1978) which incongruously had mountains on the horizon near Amarillo and The Buddy Holly Story (1978) which incongruously had mountains on the horizon near Lubbock. So the film early on pretty much wipes out any patience on the part of viewers who have the slightest clue about Texas high school basketball or Texas geography. Which is a lot of viewers, because girls' basketball is big in Texas and fans have to drive through Texas geography to go from game to game."

There were a lot of black players in the team and the public didn't like that very much.

Which made Don Haskins very angry because they didn't play as a team.<br/><br/>Josh Lucas as Don Haskins. He fitted in well with his character and scene in the locker room was one of my top favorite with his performance in this film. Derik Luke as bobby Joe Hill. Showed he passion for basket ball very well even though he had a heart problem he still wanted to play basketball he risked his life for the team. Austin Nicholas as Jerry Armstrong. Jon Adolph Rupp. Even Jones as Moe Lba. Al Shear. Did a good job as Nevil Shed he showed a strong character for his race and passion for basket ball. He failed at times as an actor in some if his scenes. <br/><br/>When the teams were playing there games all the shot were set up and cheese because they are all swishes which in a real basketball they would get it of the back board of the ring. The locker room scene was good because they showed grate emotions. <br/><br/>The message that I got across that the black player (black people) were the minority in that year (1960's to 1970's.) which was not a good thing for the black people. So show more respect to people of all races. a I would recommend the movie to teenagers up ward. Younger kids wouldn't get the story as well as a more mature person.

","I have just watched Glory Road and I would like to give an opinion. The movie is about sport, racism and drama.<br/><br/>Glory Road the movie took place in Texas in the U.S.A. in the year 1965. Josh Lucas played Don Haskins. He started out as the head coach of a girl's basketball team and then was offered a job at Texas Western University to coach an all boys basketball team called the Texas Western Miners. I thought he played the role of Don Haskins very well and I thought it was a challenging role to play. Derek Luke played Bobby Joe Hill. He wanted to play basketball but in the end they found that he had a really bad heart condition and he had to settle for mentoring the other black players instead. I thought that he played one of the most important role in the movie and he played it very well, it would have been an average role in the movie. Austin Nicholas played Jerry Armstrong. He had one of the most important roles throughout the movie, which was being a white boy on the team and having to deal with the racist slurs from the crowds who attended games against his fellow black players. I thought that he played the most interesting role in the movie and it would have been a difficult role to play.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be pretty average and predictable. I like the action of the games but I thought it was a bit rigged with shots not hitting the back board and being all swishes. I like the grand final scene where they won and showed everyone that blacks could play basketball and that the racism dished out by the Southern half of America was not going to stop them, it may get them down but they would bounce back every time stronger than before. I did not like the racism in the movie because it was too harsh at time.<br/><br/>The lessons I learnt was that racism was very bad in the 1960's, it was also really harsh for the black people of America to succeed at anything. If you watch the movie you will learn that we have it pretty easy in today's society and that even though racism is still around today it is wrong and shouldn't be encouraged or used.<br/><br/>I think people between the ages of 12 and 30 would enjoy this movie. If you are into sports such as basketball I think that you would like this movie. I would not recommend it to people who are racist or young children under the age of 12.<br/><br/>I would give this movie a rating of 3 ¬Ω stars out of 5 (*** out of *****).<br/><br/>Dion goes to Denmark Agricultural College in Western Australia and enjoys recreational activities providing the weather is at least 35degrees."

","Bouncing Down Glory Road BY: Johnathon Brockhurst<br/><br/>I just watched the movie Glory Road and I would like to give an opinion on it. Glory Road is about a man in 1965 who gets moved to Texas in America for the college basketball. He wants to make a mixed race basketball team. The coach finds it hard to make players play together as he finds out that not every one likes black players. The coach (Don Haskins) and the team (Bobby Joe Hill, Jerry Armstrong, Orsten Artis and some other players) find it hard to overcome and ignore racism when they are playing their games. <br/><br/>The actor Josh Lucas did a good job playing Don Haskins in the movie as it was one of the top roles in his career because he showed his emotions well in the movie. Emily Deschanel does a bad job playing Mary Haskins because the role she was playing was not for her as she looked older than her husband. I liked the part in the movie when the coach sent all the black players on, but it's not a movie that I would get out at the movie store because there was nothing that drew me in and amazed me.<br/><br/>The lesson I learned from the movie is: No matter what obstacles are thrown at you if you keep moving forward you can achieve your goal and accomplish more as well. I think other people will learn that black and white people are equal to each other.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for teenagers and up to 70 years but for the group of people that like drama and a bit of history. I would say the movie is a PG movie because in one scene there is animals' blood on the wall and younger people would most likely not like these types of movies. When watching this whole movie I didn't like it at all as it was too dull and boring to my taste of entertainment. <br/><br/>I would score this movie as a 1.5 out of 5.<br/><br/>The writer's name is Johnathon James Brockhurst and lives in Broome; he is in year 10 at the WA College of Agriculture, Denmark. He likes to play football, cricket, run, tennis and likes to spend free time on his Xbox or being by himself in his room watching a movie."

","Glory Road is directed by James Gartner and written by Chris Cleveland & Bettina Gilois. It stars Josh Lucas, Derek Luke, Austin Nichols, Jon Voight, Evan Jones, Schin A.S. Kerr & Emily Deschanel. Based on a true story, the film follows how basketball coach Dan Haskins broke down racial barriers during the 1966 NCAA national basketball championship season.<br/><br/>You got to hand it to Disney, after the success of Remember the Titans in 2000, they must have trawled long and hard to find another sports based underdog story involving racial concerns. And here it is, only this time the action has moved from the grid and out on to the court. As with Titans, Glory Road takes artistic license to ram home its point, well, to make a better movie actually. What we have is an inspiring story, with a well worthy message at its heart, but it all feels a bit late in the day. Don't get me wrong, we continue today to fight racism in all walks of life, and we all like to be uplifted by triumph over adversity, it's just that it feels like the sports based underdog story is being done to death. Playing the race card, artistically, is meant to be this particular movies saviour. But glossing over the facts does nobody any favours, whilst making things up to gain dramatic thrust is just plain wrong, and this is the House of the Mouse we are talking about.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, it's hard not to like, but it's a film that's equally as frustrating as it is watchable. The cast aren't up to much, tho to be fair to Lucas he is here playing a sports coach in a decade that is full of passion fuelled similar performances, but story wise it's a winning formula. Sountracking is great, as is the time spent on the court, tho it helps if you actually know something about basketball in the first place. The clich√©s are many, both in characterisations and those involving the sport, in fact it's very by the numbers, ultimately meaning it's an important story, but not an important movie.<br/><br/>Best viewed as entertainment only, and not, as Disney would like, as an historic snap-shot of down south 1966. 6/10"

","Glory Road is an extraordinary film that tells the story of a team from El Paso, Texas that overcame many difficulty adversities. The film addresses racial issues found in the 1960s and 70s. Coach Haskins redefines the ""rules"" of basketball by starting five African-American players in the national championship game. Throughout the movie each character is developed carefully and critically, adding personality to every face. The director uses exquisite cinematography to move viewers through the scenes. <br/><br/>The most influential aspect of this film is the exceptional dialogue in the beginning that truly places viewers in the time period. It allows the audience to understand the racism situation in American. As the new African-American players arrive in El Paso, it is the dialogue that becomes so important to understanding what these men are undergoing as far as change in location. One of the quotes that establishes how different things are in El Paso is when Jerry Armstrong tells his fellow teammate that he's never seen ""¬Öone of them¬Ö a colored."" This immediately establishes the theme found throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Coach Haskin's Texas Western basketball team overcomes something no other team at the time had overcome, segregation. Although the road is not an easy one, they travel down it with glory, eliminating old stereotypes, and setting an example for the entire country. This basketball team did remarkable things and this film is an excellent portrayal of the way one person can make a difference."

","Glory Road is set in 1966, when the Texas Western University coach Don Haskins changes the history of collegiate sports by starting five black players in the final match-up against national powerhouse Kentucky. This inspiring film parallels the plot of many sports movies in that the underdogs undergo intense training and face tremendous obstacles in order to emerge victorious. But, the underlying message is deeper and more significant than just winning a game of basketball. The film serves as a revolutionary vehicle, telling the story of a diverse team united by sport in a world obsessed with racial segregation. Glory Road succeeds in establishing a true sense of tension between racial groups outside of the team and contrasts this with how the teammates overlook, but do not condone, this conflict. The emotional and dramatic appeal created by the outstanding cast performance and cinematography techniques add to this masterpiece and make it an enticing film to watch."

","Glory Road, directed by James Gartner, tells the story of the 1965-1966 Texas Western boys basketball team and their journey to win an NCAA division one championship with a predominately African American team. The coach, Don Haskins, leads the Miners to become national champions playing only the African Americans, in the championship game, and in an extremely prejudice and racist society. Josh Lucas does a wonderful job of becoming Don Haskins and fully embracing this role. Compared to his roles in others films, he proves he is a very versatile actor. Part of what makes this film great is the great line of actors. The cast includes Derek Luke, Emily Deschanel, Mechad Brooks, and John Voit. Though all of the basketball players are amateurs in the acting business, they prove their acting and abilities and talents by truly becoming the characters assigned to them. Viewers see personalities of the actual people, Bobby Joe Hill and Louis Baudoin.The costumes, haircuts, montages, and scenery must be applauded showing an accurate depiction of the time period. The short basketball shorts, the hair cut of Bobby Joe Hill, the black and white newspaper montages, and vintage cars give viewers a recollection of the time period the movie is set in. The soulful soundtrack with artists like Alicia Key and Mahalia Jackson contribute to the dramatic effect and the feeling and interpretation that the team is on a road to glory. The use of bright camera flashes, quick cuts and transitions between shots during the games, and portrayal of racist and discriminatory conflict all the players (including the non-black) faced, also make this a great film. The only downfall of the film is the continued use of comedy takes away from the seriousness and intensity of the film. When players repeatedly make jokes about the Mexicans in Texas or in the final scene when Shed says, ""I'm a national champion"" in a quiet, high pitched voice, viewers concentrate more on the comical meaning of this statement rather than the literal and symbolic meaning of this statement. Overall the film is very well created and truly helps viewers relive this significant event of the past."

Fighting through adversity from within the team and from some towns they visit, the players ban together and win the National Championship. This is the first to team to win with only black players. Good acting and directing creates a compelling movie with and exciting atmosphere. Beginning with almost nothing Lucas goes on a recruiting trip to find his players. Here he meets the soon to be stars. These scenes of him in the living room, on the hardwood, or on the streets connect the viewer to the coach. Once he has the team together the first game the players are announced, as they walk on to the court the get applause, until the first black players walk on. This sets the stage for their battle against racism throughout the whole movie. One emotional scene occurs in a diner where one of the players is jumped. Just before the title game with an all white Kentucky, the players get lectured on how they are not supposed to be able to play for a title and should not be there. The next day they go out and do the impossible; beat perennial power Kentucky and capture the title with all black players. Although it followed the tradition underdog sports story closely, this movie stood out through its involvement of racial issues. The game scenes were shot from three different perspectives, the coach, the players, and the fans. By doing this the director allowed more view points to be seen and the viewer to follow the game better. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone in search of a good sports movie with a little more to it."

","When it comes to racial equality, Glory Road creates a very inspirational picture of how much the United States was against it. Coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) was known as the 'color blind"" coach. In the 1966 Championship Game, he put his all black line-up against powerhouse Kentucky, who was all white. It was the first National Championship won by an all black starting line-up. <br/><br/>Glory Road follows the season of the Texas Western basketball team. It not only focuses on the basketball, but the racism and hatred faced by the entire team. You also understand fully how the players are feeling throughout the movie. At first, the black and white players don't mesh very well, but when the white players see how the African American players are treated they begin to understand and back them up. This seemed to be the focus of the movie.<br/><br/>I also liked the emphasis put on the fact that University Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp was a very racial coach. Haskins has only a few encounters with Rupp throughout the movie, and they aren't very friendly ones. Rupp seems to feel bad for the coach and what he is doing to himself and his players thus giving them no respect. While watching the film there was a quote that our group found funny. Texas Western was being criticized by coaches and one opposing coach said, ""Basketball will never be a black man's game."" Living in the time we do now, we realize how false this comment is. African American players are just as athletic as and maybe even more athletic than some white players. It is an even playing field in society now, and Don Haskins helped propel that movement."

","It's unfortunate that there have been other similar stories to this that have already been told - for example, Remember THE TITANS. I think it makes this story less impactful since it feels like we sort of watched it before.<br/><br/>But nonetheless, this was still a good movie with some good performances - especially Josh Lucas as the Coach. I think the players were all well cast and some even resembled the actual players - which was a nice touch.<br/><br/>I think RTT did a better job in the script in creating a solid plot and interesting dialogue. But maybe again I'm not rating this as high since it appears to be a rehashing somewhat of the same themes in RTT. Also, RTT had Denzel Washington - and who can top that.<br/><br/>I'm still appalled at this chapter of racism in our country's history and do think it is important to tell these stories - especially for the younger generation who either don't remember or it was before their time.<br/><br/>To me, the most memorable line from the whole film is when the Asst. coach says something incredulous,to the effect that ""So you think the future of basketball is the black man?"" - as though he was saying that could NEVER be possible! My how far we've come!"

","All March Madness means to me is that I probably have to extend the recording time for 60 Minutes on my DVR because there will probably be some basketball game running overtime when the program is to start.<br/><br/>Glory Road played the other night on a cable channel. I decided to watch it again, and it reminded me that you can even hate basketball - which I pretty much do - and still really enjoy this film. The actual game of basketball has very little to do with what makes Glory Road a must-see film - especially for the younger generations for this is a true story of how prejudice is overcome by principle and strong will.<br/><br/>Those who do know of the basketball season depicted in Glory Road will know of Don Haskins who was the coach at Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso). Texas Western was one of the first southern colleges to integrate its sports teams, and the final championship game of the 1966 season was the first in which all starting players were Black.<br/><br/>Haskins is depicted as a strong-willed man set upon his proved strategies as a coach who learns some new things from the cocky Black players recruited to bring life to a failing team. He is played by Josh Lucas who gives us a man who might look young and unsure on the outside but is strongly willed and principled. Haskins was thirty-five at the time of the game as was Lucas at the making of the film making him perfect for the part.<br/><br/>Another strong, though short, performance in the film is by Jon Voight as Adolph Rupp, the opposing coach in the NCAA Championship game. Rupp was sixty-one at the time of the game and noted as one of the greatest coaches of all time. Voight's depiction of Rupp as a man of an earlier generation disdainful of a young coach breaking the rules and the color barrier is chilling.<br/><br/>If you haven't had the opportunity to see Glory Road, I recommend a viewing for it is an inspirational sports story as well as an insightful lesson in history. If you have seen it, take some time from watching The Big Dance and watch it again."

","When I was in high school, I was offered a scholarship to play basketball for the NJCAA. Being an African American, I never really thought about not being able to start because of my skin color. About forty years ago, this was something men thought about before entering the college level. That explains why many African Americans did not even bother playing for the NCAA. The movie ""Glory Road"" (2006) showed how one coach changed things for African Americans who wanted to play college basketball in 1961.<br/><br/>In ""Glory Road"" Don Haskins (Josh Lucas), a Texas Western coach, led the first African American starters to a NCAA final championship game. He goes through many obstacles trying to get African Americans on his team. He receives threatening phone calls, and he is called many names. One of the players on the team is even beaten by an upset man, because of skin color. These are some of the negative parts in the movie. The team also goes through many obstacles. The challenge in the film is whether or not the team will win the national championship.<br/><br/>This movie was directed by James Gartner. He may have wanted to show how a rebel can turn out being a hero. In ""Glory Road"" Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke) was the point guard on the team. He was very cocky, and he was the rebel on the team. The players followed Bobby Joe in what he did. There was one scene when the team had a morning practice, and Bobby Joe wanted to go out. The whole team went out and the next morning practice was horrible for them because the coach Haskins had found out. He made the team run all day and he even made Bobby Joe run bleachers. After this had happened, Bobby Joe became a great leader and led the team to the national championship. The director may have tried to send a message to kids that practice can make you good. One of the characters in the movie by the name of Orsten Artis (Alphonso McAuley) was not the best player in the beginning of the movie. He had low self esteem and was always picked on by the other players. The coach changed that by making him stay in the gym and practice. In the national championship Orsten Artis was one of the main scorers in the game. <br/><br/>Many people can relate to ""Glory Road."" The director did a good job so that anyone could sit down and watch the movie to a point they would leave with a upbeat mind. This was a positive thing the director showed. Towards the end, everyone had each others back. The players even entered their classrooms with confidence. This was a symbol that when we as a people start being positive about things nothing but good will happen to us."

","In a state that's so football crazy, whether it's high school, college or professional, it's great to see a movie that celebrates a Texas team that won the state's only NCAA tournament championship. Actually, in 15 of the first 20 NCAA tournaments, there was at least one school from the Lone Star state, but none made it past the Final Four until that magical 1965-66 season. It was no overnight feat that Haskins accomplished (this film shows him starting in 1965, when in actuality his Texas Western team had reached the NCAA Sweet Sixteen a year before that.) When you see the beginning disclaimer ""Based on the true story..."" you know there will be scenes that are either untrue or overly dramatized for effect, but it still amazes me that films like this and SEABISCUIT contain gross historical inaccuracies. But history never stood in the way of a good Hollywood film and it probably never will. All that being said, I was mildly disappointed in this movie. The characters never really engaged me on an emotional level. There was no real effort to bring much humor or romance into the movie, and it could have used more of either or both as a contrast to the racial tensions that were all too real back then. Still, it makes for an interesting look at how the culture has changed in 40-plus years and it does OK as a sports movie. But it's a long way from being up there with some of the truly great ones like THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES or the aforementioned SEABISCUIT. And as an overall lover of movies, I feel it's worth watching as a better-than-average sports movie, but not particularly great for those who aren't interested in that genre. Dale Roloff"

","""Glory Road"" tells the true (though as with any such movie, apparently partially fictionalized) story of the Texas Western basketball team's 1966 season as it startled the nation with its march to the national championship. Though it takes place after passage of the Civil Rights Act and during the brotherhood speeches of Martin Luther King Jr., the blatant racism of earlier times lingered more than a little. The film does a good job of providing viewers with a taste of that fact. It is certainly an inspirational story and the cast does as well as can be expected in a movie that necessarily must attempt to explore a number of characters. On the negative side, the game scenes sometimes seemed poorly filmed and some of the dialog - especially the radio and television announcers - was stilted and felt awkward.

","Based on true events, Bruckheimer-produced 'Glory Road' tells the Disney-fied story of the underdog Texas Western University men's basketball team that won the National Championship in 1966 while starting, for the first time in NCAA history, five African-American players. Here we are offered a slice of racial prejudice, team spirit and overcoming odds, all bundled up under the fatherly banner of coach Don Hoskins (Josh Lucas).<br/><br/>First let me begin by saying that I do not know much about the circumstances surrounding or account of events that took place on the basketball scene in 1960's America, but it becomes clear that its content is a relentless, classic underdog story readily-molded to be milked by Disney's peachy P.C. outlook. 'Glory Road' is sport movie by the numbers, featuring an earnest, hard-working rookie coach, reluctant but idealist players, ups and downs, swelly climactic basketball games and newspaper montages of the team's national success. It is of course not so much a sports romp as it is a treatment of racial prejudice in the American sport scene and the latter is well-executed with the marginalized black Americans always taking a backseat to the white boys, in clubs, in competitions, in caf√©s and in dorms. It's mostly a rehash of 'Remember the Titans', but it is also a rather compelling set-up that is bound to elicit a response.<br/><br/>About the rehash issue regrettably, 'Glory Road' has perfected the art. James Gartner is a debut director and it shows in the safe, derivative plotturns that he steers the film with, proceeding down a militantly formulaic trajectory. There are the coach's dutiful locker-room rallying speeches about discipline and about how he ""does not see colour"" and hallmark staples such as ""it's not about talent, it's about heart."", there are race-specific confrontations between the players, there is that one excellent player who wants to quit, and there are lofty political events framing the story. There is in this way a few too many Disney notions, and certainly you will find more corn than Kellogg's in the purposely poignant buddy moments. Similarly, the film boasts of no accolades in subtlety: the good guys (Josh Lucas) are really, really good and the bad guys (the racist coach Jon Voigh with prosthetic nose and ears) are really, really bad and his contingent of sinister white players resembles a Klan rally.<br/><br/>Having said that, 'Glory Road' is well written in terms of dialogue and story. I know I said the characters are polarized in terms of alignment and that there are cheesy gems interwoven in the dialogue, but the truth is that the rest of the script is actually quite catchy. For one, it is simply much funnier than I could ever have hoped for with comic situations and good one-liners en masse. The characters may not be the most original ever but they are superbly supported by the cast's performances. Josh Lucas turns in a likable, earnest interpretation of the dirt-poor but hopeful coach, although I may be swayed by the fact that I an in love with this man. Derek Luke is emotionally transparent as ever. Jon Voight has limited screen time, but communicates so much in his scenes. Best of all however, in spite of the PG rating, 'Glory Road' is never desperately Disney cutesy or silly. Lastly, there is an excellent vintage soundtrack.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"ciscokid1970","10","0","0","6 December 2006"," Fantastic sports movie about a monumental event
","This is certainly one of the greatest sports movies ever made. The only thing more phenomenal is that it is completely true. <br/><br/>Yes they modified the story a little for drama purposes. The movie is well acted and the story line is smooth and entertaining. But this is one of those movies that is dominated by the story line which had a monumental impact in college and pro sports.<br/><br/>This movie chronicles the story of the School, Coach and Team that contained the first All Black starting lineup to win a NCAA championship. It is also the first championship team to contain a Mexican American. This event that showed change and opportunities for Black athletes in college and pro sports.<br/><br/>But to me the most meaningfull part of this story was the environment that allowed this team to prosper. The University, the Coach, supporters and the city all worked to make this possible. Texas Western College of Mines (now known as University of Texas at El Paso) had Black players on its team before Don Haskins arrived. Don Haskins was receptive and recurited more of them. The University is located in a city with friendly and diverse people, being poor and being a minority did not matter so much.<br/><br/>It is also a story of David and Goliath, Texas Western was a small school by population and money. It built its program over 5 years before it soundly defeated Kentucky in the NCAA championship. In fact when they won they had a 27 and 1 record. <br/><br/>The movie had a bit more negativity than I would have liked, they never really indicated how much the University and city embraced this team and still does. The movie could have shown more teamwork and positive impact that white and Hispanic players made to that championship year. The movie also failed to mention that Texas Western made it to the NCAA tournament in 63 and 64. The movie not really show how much Haskins cared about all his players, and failed to mention that he played basketball as a boy with black friends.<br/><br/>The DVD also contains some great extras like interviews with players of that team and inverviews with the coach and his wife.<br/><br/>Of course I am a Proud graduate of UTEP...Go Miners."

But there were so many inaccuracies that I couldn't get into the movie as much as I had hoped. Not only the facts of how the game transpired, but much of the way the game was played, the dialog, and the general feel of the movie just was wrong for era in which it takes place. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the term ""Division One"" was used at this time; there were just ""major"" and ""small"" colleges. Other terms like ""stops"", and some of the moves such as behind-the-back dribbles, were just out of place.<br/><br/>This movie is like a cover version of an old hit; its for younger people who aren't familiar with the original version.

","Thought it was very good. The previous commenter obviously missed the point of the movie. That point was that Texas Western was going against 5 white players that were very good and a coach(Adolph Rupp) who was REPUTED to be racist. However Pat Riley has said publicly that he never heard Rupp make a negative comment about blacks and by virtue of the fact that he played for Rupp for 4 years doubts the veracity of this claim. Blacks were an established part of College basketball at this time because Cinncinati had one 1 National Championship and been to 2 other final 4's with Oscar Robertson. The other big point is this was a southern team and Loyola and Cincinati were northern teams. Don't forget historically this is 2 years after LBJ passed the civil rights act of 1964 and 2 years before MLK JR was shot. The south was very inflamed @ the time because they were against the civil rights act. Also this was the year that interrupted the UCLA run of championships. Some people at the time felt that the reason UCLA was not involved was because their National Championship team had just been DISMANTLED BY THEIR FRESHMAN TEAM in a scrimmage which was led by Lew Alcindor(the future Kareem Abdul Jabbar) and they didn't even make the tournament. Also the previous commenter fails to point out that while yes Kansas has a black player who is an all-American they are also in the North. The one inconsistency is that in the final game Jon Voight(Rupp) calls for a flagrant foul. There was no such thing as a flagrant foul in 1966.<br/><br/>2 casting things Emily Deschanel was Don Haskins' wife Mary and Tatyana M. Ali was Bobby Jo Hill's girlfriend(don't remember hearing her character's name in the movie though)"

While the histrionics formulaic storyline is hindered by a telegraphed plot (the team would go on to be an underdog resulting in what is maintained as one of college basketball's - and all major sports for that matter- upsets in history) the engaging acting and energetic final act by filmmaker James Gartner forgives its pedestrian script by Chris Cleveland and Bettina Gilois."

Josh Lucas has proved himself to be more of an actor than he was in The Hulk. He is good and perhaps will be the next Charlie Sheen if he plays his cars right.

","This movie is without a doubt one of the best basketball movies ever made. Period. But, how many basketball films are there? Glory Road can best be compared to Remember the Titans, as the story is similar, and even the plot structures parallel. Like Remember the Titans, the key issue of the film is racism, and the film had every person on their feet by the end when I saw it. Bruckheimer, a decent director, does a good job of painting the opponents as racists and the Texas Western team as the shining light in the darkness. And, he does a very convincing job. However, the inclusion of a black player on KU's starting line-up is glossed over, and Kentucky's coach, Adolph Rupp, is portrayed as merely a prejudiced old man, disregarding his place as the 2nd all-time winningest coach in the NCAA. Bruckheimer's greatest strength in this film comes from the performance of Josh Lucas, who does an excellent job of portraying Coach Haskins. The in-game sequences are good, but definitely could have been greater. There are definitely some great shots, and the editing is also quite well done. This film also has an excellent message for viewers, and is one of the best anti-racism movies I've seen. The fear felt by team mates is easily transferable across the screen to the audiences. This film is also extremely uplifting. For basketball players and other athletes, it's easily to relate to the members of the Texas Western team. This is definitely a film anyone should go out and see some weekend, or rent for an open night."

This really happened. Where is the courageous story of these men, and their coach, whom I had the pleasure to meet, George Ireland? It doesn't subtract from the entertainment value of Glory Road, but why can't Disney tell the truth about the team, Coach Haskins, and just about everything in the film. They were a great team, and Coach Haskins was legendary as well. The truth was, as many have pointed out, there were none of these close games in the beginning..Coach Haskins did not come from coaching a girl's team to the NCAA Championship in one year. It's a great story just as it really happened. It's a shame that the only recognition Loyola gets is that Texas Western beat them (in a newspaper headline) and seen in the top ten rankings that year. They both deserve credit. So does Mississippi State for their courage in coming to play Loyola. This really happened, and it's a great story. Where is it?"

"keyslaw2","4","2","7","31 January 2006"," A very quick opinion
","I think people vote on what comments are useful based on whether they agree with the reviewer on whether the movie was good or a waste of time. Nevertheless, at the risk of having 0 out of 15 people find this comment useful, I'll say the following: Apparently, somebody remembered the success of ""Hoosiers"" and ""Miricle"" and decided they needed to slap together something to compete. While we all love an occasional Little-Engine-That-Could,"" story, it should be original, not just a re-tooling of something successful in the past.<br/><br/>What could have made this movie fantastic would be a real subplot. True, the movie shows some racism, but racism from sources outside the main characters amounts to just background. Had the plot really gone into the problems Coach Haskins had with the school's administration (if he had any); if there had been something to imply that the coach's job was on the line day after day or game after game; or if the movie had gone into the struggles of the white teammates to accept their black counterparts, we might be dealing with a great movie. None of this played out, though. Instead, any problem Coach Haskins faced was simply dismissed by a cut-and-paste inspiring one-liner. What, then, was there to keep the audience on the edge of its seat throughout the film? Josh's acting was a little flat. All he really had to do was deliver the inspiring one-liners. No one else really stood out either.<br/><br/>This movie--which bills itself as based on a true story--climaxes with the all-black team going against the all-white team and prevailing. If, as I read in another comment, the movie failed to accurately portray Kentucky as starting with a black player, then the movie simply betrayed the truth. I don't expect movies to portray historical events with 100% accuracy, but if a movie labels itself as ""based on a true story,"" and then omits a big part of the truth, it loses whatever inspiration it might have had.<br/><br/>My advice: eat popcorn at home tonight and save your money for something truly worthwhile."

Granted it's not like a Bad Boys 2 or a Kangaroo Jack in its badness, but it covers up its ineptitude with schmaltzy moments of saccharine a la Remember the Titans. Fortunately, this only happens in the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>While we get stuck in the usual merry-go-round of sports movie paradigms, the second half of the film takes on a personality of its own. While the racial in fighting between the team members have been verified as false, it provides an interesting allegory about the times they played in. Coach Don Haskins has also stated his intentions weren't about bucking the system, this was the angle that was placed upon the viewer.<br/><br/>What do wish is they had made this movie with a more serious tone to it, much like the second half of the movie. I felt the story would have been more powerful and maybe an Oscar worthy film. Unfortunately, we'll have to stick with this version for the moment until a true sports movie dumps the usual plot points."

What I did like about the film was that it was the first college basketball film made in a long time and it actually did something that I have never seen in a sports film and that is the recruiting process which I found to be original and entertaining. I found it to be quite interesting to see the coach's point of view on winning, but found the deal on racism to be a little over-eccentric. I didn't understand why fans had problems with three or four colored players on the team if some opposing team's best players were colored. The message of the film didn't really come together very well.<br/><br/>The acting of the film was overall mediocre. Josh Lucas did not impress with me with his first star dramatic role at all. He just kind of flowed with the movie without actually making a difference in the film. Derek Luke also fell short of his last performance in Friday Night Lights which was incredible and Jon Voight also gave a pretty weak performance. Overall, the film was just an average film that deserves a recommendation for its entertainment value.<br/><br/>I recommend this film."

","I watched this movie yesterday at the sneak preview and it was great! Although you know how it is going to end, the intensity of the story does not falter. The story also tells you why this team was and will forever be the greatest NCAA Men's Basketball team of all time. I know people will disagree, but after you see this movie...just know that no other team could have gone through what this team went through and been successful. It also proves what I've said my entire life...Don Haskins may just be the best NCAA coach of all time. El Paso will forever be grateful to Don Haskins for taking a chance on a small university and not settling for 2nd best. He is a hero to El Paso and and inspiration to all."
"eichelbergersports","6","4","21","6 January 2006"," Historical event, yes; memorable film, not quite
","Okay, I suppose I should have a little more awe and respect for this film, considering it chronicles a major step in the civil rights movement ¬ñ the first time an all-black college basketball starting team won an NCCA championship (in 1966).<br/><br/>The problem wasn't the event, it was the movie. I didn't like any of the characters. The whites (except for the head coach and the Caucasion players) were universally violent and ignorant, while the black players were whining, militant crybabies.<br/><br/>True, there were certainly obstacles for the African-American athletes (mostly from Nothern venues like Indiana, Michigan and New York), to overcome; and there were obviously idiot rednecks to deal with, but the black players seemed just as prejudiced and disrespectful towards their white teammates (even losing their only game of the season because of this attitude).<br/><br/>There's even a scene in which one player, Willie Worsley, tells another that they should be more like Malcolm Little (Malcolm X) than Dr. Martin Luther King. Not a subtle message here, friends.<br/><br/>There's just no empathy for anyone. Plus, as far as sports drama goes, there really isn't much here, either. The Texas Western (now the University of Texas, El Paso) Miners of that season, coached by Don Haskins (Josh Lucas, ""Stealth,"" ""An Unfinished Life""), was a top 10 team most of the season. They were not recognized by most of the country not so much because of their starting black players, but they were a small school from deep in the heart of Texas. It was more of a geographical situation.<br/><br/>Sure some uninitiated dopes in the country at the time (especially in the South) did not put much stock in black athletes, but they were already proving themselves in the NBA (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Lenny Wilkins, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robinson, among others), as well as other sports, pro and college, so some of the resentment doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.<br/><br/>By the time the Miners met Kentucky (coached by the legendary Adoulph Rupp, a short but well-done performance by Jon Voight) in the NCAA finals that year, they were a tough, battle-seasoned squad that could compete with any team in the nation.<br/><br/>Sadly, that concluding game had little drama as Texas Western won by seven, although director James Gartner tries to make this as compelling as possible. The most interesting game was 1966 Midwest regional finals, in which Kansas' Jo Jo White hit a last-second basket to beat TW, but it was called off as he supposedly stepped out of bounds. The Miners also barely got by the Cincinnati Bearcats in overtime in an earlier NCAA tournament contest not mentioned in the movie.<br/><br/>I also did not like the fact that Haskins (according to this picture) precluded his white players from even participating in the title game (the only time those young men would ever be at such a venue), as if they made no contributions whatsoever. It seemed pretty intolerant and weird to me. Not even giving them a chance to step on the court and cherish the glory of one minute's playing time was a bizarre strategy.<br/><br/>As hotshot point guard Billy Joe Hill, Derek Luke (""Antwone Fisher,"" ""Friday Night Lights"") gives the best performance, but Lucas' Haskins is the clich√©d tough guy coach with a heart of gold we've seen in countless such movies.<br/><br/>Overall, while this is an interesting film that I recommend people to see (if for the historical element, if nothing else), I still think ""Hoosiers"" is the definitive underdog basketball motion picture, hands down. And while Disney gives it a yeoman's effort here, I even enjoyed their last sports film, ""The Greatest Game Ever Played,"" more than this one.<br/><br/>As a side note, look for the real Haskins (who coached UTEP into the late 90s) in a cameo as an NBC analyst during the final contest."

","I just caught this flick. This movie is so awesome. Like ""Remember The Titans"", this film was also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It's basically about a high school girls' basketball coach, who coaches Texas Western basketball team. He scouts mostly African-American boys with full basketball potential. This film is basically ""Remember The Titans"" with basketball, mainly because this film contains ethnic issues. Many viewers will be horrified with the use of ethnic slurs. The story takes place in the 1960's. You should see the ending sequence, because it simply tells you where those basketball players are now. (Just like Miracle, Rookie & Remember The Titans)."

","Americans love underdogs. After this film, they will love Miners. That's the nickname of the Texas Western College basketball team that was the first NCAA Division 1 team to win the National Championship by using only black players in the final game. This Disney film chronicles that team's achievement which culminated in the 1966 NCAA championship. At a special preview sponsored by Richmond, Virginia, Clear Channel radio stations, a fairly packed house applauded the film no less than three times at emotionally gratifying moments. After the film, large numbers of the audience lingered in the theater watching the credits roll ... and were pleased when a small ""window"" in the big screen showed interviews with members of that 1966 team as they are today. Not embittered by the racism they encountered, these men today provide great examples of sportsmanship combined with a positive outlook that has made them successful and -- to all appearances -- happy people. Seeing this film makes you realize how far we've come as a nation since that period of time in terms of race relations. Are there still problems? Sure. Can we do better? Of course. But the racially mixed audience at this screening seemed to share the same feelings of outrage at past racism, and the same feelings of elation when the underdog Miners defeated the mighty Kentucky Wildcats in what's been described as the upset of the century. It's also considered by some a turning point in the game of basketball -- a point well made by Pat Riley (former Lakers coach), who was on the Kentucky team that was defeated by the Miners. Excellent performances throughout. Great and uplifting message. Glory Road is a slam dunk."

Josh Lucas really shines as the coach and shows his skills as one of the finest actors in film. Set in 1966, it actually seems to be a logical progression from Hoosiers, which took place in the 1950's. One should make sure to stay for the credits, which feature some of the real players offering their memories. There are also some film clips from the actual final game. I hope the entire game is on the DVD release. This movie is highly recommended to film and basketball fans alike."

At the end of the film the credits started to roll and the theater was emptying quickly. Then unexpectedly, the screen began showing photos of the real people involved in the story with a line or two about how their life progressed from the time of the final game until now. The remaining audience froze in their steps to drink in the personal information being shared. The characters had been portrayed in such depth, we wanted to know what happened to them. We knew them.

The movie, especially the first half, is very entertaining--I was laughing out loud often! I loved it. I also really liked how they made it seem like the time period. I hate it when you are watching a movie that is supposed to take place in the 60s or 70s or something but looks just like 2005. This is not one of those movies!!

(actually took place during the Coach's 6th season, not his first) It definitely brings out the ""oppression"" and stress that blacks went through in the 60s.

","**1/2 Josh Lucas, Gary Grubbs, Wes Brown, James Aaron, Mitch Eakins. Directed by James Gartner. After ""Remember the Titans"" came out everyone including Jerry Bruckhemier, wants to make a sports movie dealing with racism amongst the team.

But with one saving grace Josh Lucas who play Coach Don Haskins.

","Glory Road is much better than I expected! I must admit I went in expecting some dorky moments and weak acting, because so many sports-oriented films in the past have had those moments when you roll your eyes and smirk. But this movie only has a couple of those moments, and they're fleeting ones. Overall, I found myself emotionally touched and very moved by the story and it's portrayal.<br/><br/>And don't pass it up because you think it's just a sports movie! It's not. It's MUCH more than that. It does a wonderful job of portraying the racial tensions that existed in the mid-1960's, and it can be a fine teaching tool for a younger generation that may not be familiar with the civil rights struggle and how we really CAN live together and love one another. And kids older than 7 or 8 should be fine...there's no foul language other than some racial epithets that unfortunately are necessary to portray the tensions of that time...and you can discuss this with the kids after the movie.<br/><br/>And don't leave the theater early...stay through the credits...because there are numerous clips with Pat Riley (who played on the Kentucky team in the NCAA Finals against Texas Western), Coach Don Haskins of Texas Western (now UTEP), and many of the Texas Western players from that team.

"AshRoseIU","6","2","12","18 January 2006"," Glory Road: The Poor Man's Remember the Titans
","There are some things you just expect when going to see an inspirational sports movie-- slow motion, the old ""flashing newspapers on the screen to signal the passing of time"" trick, a musical training montage, and of course, the hard-ass coach who, deep down, really cares about his players. Glory Road has all of these things and executes them with perfect mediocrity. The film lacks originality. The plot feels overdone. This story's been told before and told much better in Bruckheimer's other inspirational sports story full of racial conflict, ""Remember the Titans."" My advice: instead of spending $8 on ""Glory Road"", go rent ""Remember the Titans""."

"schappe1","8","2","13","25 January 2006"," Historical Accuracy in Movies
","Whenever a film comes out based on real events these days, it comes under intense scrutiny from people who demand 100% historical accuracy. If the film comes up short, these historical critics are all over it, pointing out every discrepancy. ""Glory Road"" tells us that Don Haskins took over a Texas Western team that had never recruited blacks before, brought in a bus load of them and won the national championship in his first year. In fact they won the national title in his fifth year and the school had used blacks before he ever showed up. In ""A Beautiful Mind"", we see a massive oversimplification of schizophrenia: you just have to sort out who is real and who isn't. One of the people who isn't is Jennifer Connelly, who is playing a composite character. In ""Cinderella Man"" Max Baer is presented as a sort of Clubber Lang, (Mr. T in Rocky III), character who is easy to hate when in real life he seems to have been a nice guy who's greatest fault is that he never took himself or his profession seriously enough.<br/><br/>The amateur historians like to point these things out by way of expressing their moral superiority over the filmmakers and those who liked their film. But a life is not a movie. It's a kaleidoscoping stream of stories in which the person is sometimes the star and sometimes a bit player. The stories all have middles but don't always have a beginning or an end. To make a movie of a life or from a life, the filmmaker is going to have to edit that life. He's going to have to use devices like telescoping time or creating composite characters. That doesn't make him or those who enjoy his film inferior to people who like to look things up.<br/><br/>At one time, storytelling was the major means of entertainment in this country. There were no movies or TV shows or records or computers. People entertained themselves by telling each other stories. To some extent this was a way of spreading ""news"" but the entertainment value of the story was paramount. Accuracy was not required, especially if it was boring. This carried over into popular entertainment in the 20th century. People didn't care if ""My Darling Clementine"" or ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" were historically accurate depictions of the confrontation that was key to their story, (and they sure weren't). ""Wyatt Earp"" and ""Tombstone"" were more accurate but they weren't necessarily better movies. But in the information age, people know more history than they ever did before and they want to see the historical benchmarks they are looking for and nothing that doesn't look right.<br/><br/>So what standards should we apply? I'd say there are five levels of ""reality"" or the lack of it: (1) Things we know happened. There is no historical debate about it. (2) Things that could have happened. This could include entirely fictional situations involving entirely fictional characters set in a realistic historical setting which don't contradict any known facts. (3) Things that may have happened. There may be some historical debate about them but it's not been resolved. (4) Things that probably didn't happen. It hasn't been proved that they didn't happen but there is considerable doubt about it. (5) Things that clearly didn't happen. They have been proved to be apocryphal or clearly contradict known facts. I would say that if the filmmaker stays within the first three categories, he needn't be criticized. The amateur historians will nail him by choosing different interpretations of #3 and asserting that the filmmaker is ""wrong"". But if he has a compelling dramatic reason for his interpretation, he's fine. If he ventures into #4 he'd better have really good dramatic reasons for doing so. He should avoid #5 if at all possible. He should also avoid libeling people and not announce that his film is the ""truth"" and that everything else they've heard is a ""lie"", (Hear that, Oliver Stone?) In ""Glory Road"", I see no reason why the story had to have been depicted as taking place in a single year. The fact that TW had used black players before could be noted. It was the shear number of them that was unprecedented. The true attitudes of Adolph Rupp clearly fall under #3. He's treated much better than Max Baer was.<br/><br/>In the end is to see the forest for the trees. Don't sweat the details so much you forget to enjoy a good movie, which ""Glory Road"" is."
"Ken_S","5","2","13","23 January 2006"," quite disappointed
","The movie was way too similar to Remember the Titans and they're portrayal of coach Rupp was disturbing. I agree with one of the previous posts that they changed a lot just to make the movie more appealing. The movie made it seem as if black players were a whole new thing when coach Haskins introduced this team when in reality there were many black players. But i digress since these faults were already discussed in another post.<br/><br/>Had Remember the Titans not been released, i may rate this movie higher, and since some of the same people worked on the two films i find it even more surprising that the two were THAT similar. Some of the acting was a little off as well (some parts just seemed like a home movie with amateur actors). Some of the team scenes were funny at times though giving a little plus to the movie.<br/><br/>So, if you really enjoy movies like Coach Carter and Remember the Titans, and don't mind watching the same movie with a different sport and different actors then maybe this movie would be better for you than it was for me but i have a hard time giving it a good rating."

Shakespeare, The Tempest<br/><br/>Glory Road, the new film about Texas Western's astounding NCAA basketball championship in 1966 with the first all black starting lineup goes beyond the usual ""Coach Carter"" nail biter about ghetto kids overcoming odds. It underscores the meanness of the culture, embodied in the benign prejudice of U of Kentucky's legendary Adolph Rupp (Jon Voight), who states in the film that five black starters couldnot beat five whites.<br/><br/>Well, they did and Josh Lucas as Coach Don Haskins, who had previously coached only girls' high school ball, showed that determination, beyond experience, just like the players themselves, was the key ingredient in a great team. As Lucas portrays him, he is a good man with a vision, who has to overcome the ill will of his own campus toward fielding a predominantly black team as well as the poverty of a program without even recruiting money.<br/><br/>Glory Road has no memorable lines; in fact, nothing the coach says here could have been reason for the success of the team, perhaps a deficiency in a work of art that tries to relay the truth of the excellence leading a little team to national championship. What the film does do better than most is show the cultural context as it affects the team and its individual members. Neither strident nor superficial, the film seems an honest and exciting ""inspired-by-real-events"" effort to depict an era filled with heroes.<br/><br/>The film joins other sports films depicting an unremarkable team's rise to greatness such as Remember the Titans, Miracle, and, of course, Hoosiers.

","After reading several reviews on this site, people need to realize that this movie is ""BASED"" on a true story. Which basically means, not everything is going to be completely ACCURATE. People need to stop reviewing the movie on accuracy and everything being a FACT. There has never been a movie made that was truly and complete accurate. NEVER!! So stop trying to review this movie on facts. No one cares if Kentucky was trailer by 11 points in the championship.<br/><br/>Glory Road is an excellent telling of the 1966 Texas Western NCAA Championship win against Kentucky. It's true that Don Haskins didn't win the championship his first year. Because of the recruiting budget he decided to venture northeast to the playgrounds of New York & Philadephia and recruit prominent black players to play for Texas Western. These players had to struggle with not only a tough coach, but also racism, other players and a new surrounding. For people to say that these players didn't face what was shown in the film, are either idiots or were born in the 80's and don't have a clue. There is still racism TODAY in Texas and other southern states.<br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job of showing what the coach and players had to go through to reach the final championship game. Whether each game was accurate point for point is irrelevant, as the story is more about the team and the coach, and not really each game that was played. Even though some of the players weren't professional actors, I thought this did an admirable job portraying there counterparts. Josh Lucas was excellent as the hard nosed Don Haskins who gave strong leadership to the boys. I thought they could have done more with Emily Deschanel role as Don Haskin's wife. They also should have showed Don Haskin's first 4 yrs and what the team was like prior to all the recruiting.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that this Texas Western team paved the road for the black players of today. True, other college teams had 1-2 black players on their team back in 1966, but most of them were just tokens at the time, and saw very little playing time, if any at all. There had never been 5 black starters. Yes, teams had won championships with black players on the team, but never with 5 starting and playing the whole game. That was the point. Back in 1966, most southern state coaches didn't believe black players were athletic or intelligent enough to play at the college basketball level. Texas Western proved these coaches wrong. Now more then 75% of the NBA are minority (black, Asian, hispanic, etc.) players.<br/><br/>Who Ever Heard Of Texas Western? I hadn't until now. Now everyone knows."

However, to top that off you have great basketball sequences, sequences that are just hilarious, and some of what I would call a kind of ""pun"". It's a good anti-racism movie as well, because it shows the lengths that some jealous people were willing to go to to prevent five great players from proving that they can make it at the national level simply because they were of African-American descent. From what I've read here, some of the scenes aren't so factual but I am definitely going to read the book so from there I will straighten things out. I do know that there were death threats to some of the players and the coach, and hatred from peers at Texas Western. That's all I know, but I also know that I was truly moved by the outcome of the movie, as well as the personal dynamics within the team and some other people close to the situation and how they changed throughout the course of the movie. Definitely worthwhile."

","Greetings again from the darkness. If you are looking for a history lesson on the truly amazing story of Don Haskins and his 1966 Texas Western basketball championship team, then the closest you will get is the closing credits which feature quotes from Don Haskins, Pat Reilly and the real TWU players. If you are in the mood for a feel-good, underdog story presented in full Jerry Bruckheimer mode then ""Glory Road"" aims to please.<br/><br/>First time director James Gartner shows some attention to detail but admittedly takes some creative license while presenting the story of the first all black team to win a NCAA championship. Of course the team was not all black, but coach Don Haskins made the decision to play only black players in this historic game. The best part of the film is watching Josh Lucas as Don Haskins and Jon Voight as Adolph Rupp stalk the sidelines during the big game. Lucas with his gut and mannerisms and Voight with his pompous poses really capture the essence of the public image of these two men. Also, Red West (former Elvis bodyguard) does a nice job as Ross.<br/><br/>There are many other parts I don't really understand. Emily Deschanel is totally wasted as Haskins' wife. Most of the black players look at least 5 years too old for college. In fact, Derek Luke (""Antwone Fisher"") is almost 32 years old. Also, the time frame for Haskins at Texas Western is quite misleading. None of those really matter in a glossy Hollywood production, but they do matter when presenting history.<br/><br/>Nothing at all wrong with the crowd-pleasing, root-for-the-underdog movie, although it is a bit frustrating when it deals so lightly with historic facts. Also, don't miss Don Haskins as the gas station attendant who asks Lucas is he wants his tank filled up and definitely stay for the closing credits."

It was the semi-finals that everyone had been looking forward to - the throwaway game was Texas Western vs Utah - the headline game was Kentucky vs. Duke. Texas Western earned no respect by beating a weak Utah team and for the championship game, the scalpers couldn't even get face value for tickets. The director missed the boat by not capturing the fan reaction at the Final Four - as the game was played out, Texas Western won over all but the die hard Kentucky fans. The biggest flaw i saw in the movie was the way the Kentucky team was portrayed. From the opening tip, it was obvious that Kentucky had never encountered the type of play that Texas Western brought to the court."

","I liked Remember the Titans, so I also like this movie. I went to a sneak preview on Jan 9 with my sons (9 & 12), my friend and his 12 YO son.<br/><br/>Everyone was pleased with the movie. The 9 YO didn't remember 'Titans' so this subject was new for him and it sparked many questions about race relations and that era. I was only 3 YO when the movie took place, so it was difficult to explain, but I think the point(s) were made.<br/><br/>I am not a movie critic, but I know what I like, sports and movies. So it was a natural fit. I did not know the story line, but found it interesting and did find a way to make the same events different than Titans.<br/><br/>No academy awards here, but I felt it was well acted and directed.<br/><br/>It makes you think and being Caucasian I felt ashamed at times during this movie."

","I really liked this movie for one simple reason: No matter what's the color of your skin, we are all equal. No one should be underestimated.<br/><br/>This movie shows that old, and sadly sometimes not so old, mentality and belief that white people are superior. It shows how white people didn't believe a team based on black players could beat a white team. They believed they didn't have both the quality and the intelligence to play basketball. <br/><br/>I would strongly recommend this movie since it shows how society was back in the 60s and how it has changed throughout the years. If you are looking for a sports movie with some message, this is definitely a good choice."
"leonblackwood","4","0","1","30 August 2015"," Touching but predictable! 4/10
","Although the storyline is quite touching, I did find the movie predictable and corny in parts. The fact that it's based on a true story, saved the film but I have seen this type of concept many times before. The movie was released at the peak of heroic sport movies like Gridiron Gang, We Are Marshall and Invicible so it went down well with audiences and it made a healthy profit. Anyway, the film is about a basketball coach, Don Haskins, who is out to find the best players to play for a small Texas Western College. After looking at many players, he finally recruits a few black players to join his team, which doesn't go down well with the people of that state. Whilst out on the road playing against various teams, the players have to go through some gruesome racism which nearly breaks there moral but the tough couch holds the team together and he makes them focus on the things that are important. Against all odds, the successful team changed history by becoming the first all black team to win a championship so it's quite an emotional film, especially the bonus footage of the real Don Haskins. After watching movies like Coach Carter with Samuel L. and Remember the Titans with Denzel, I honestly don't think that Josh Lucas was the perfect choice to portray such a powerful individual. I liked the chemistry between the players and they did pull of some good moves on the court but there's been too many movies after this, that have been a lot better. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: What happened to Josh Lucas's career? At one point, he was in big movies like A Beautiful Mind, the Lincoln Lawyer, J.Edgar and Hulk but he wasn't the leading actor in those films. At 44, he still has a way to go before he becomes a household name but he has a Kevin Costner style of acting which is always needed in movies. As this movie was made under the Walt Disney umbrella, it was obvious that it was going to be a feel good movie that will touch your heart. It's the only movie directed by James Gartner so I can't really compare his previous work to this film. His only experience was on a short in 1983 as a producer so he really hasn't got that much experience in the movie making world. With that in mind, this movie made quite a bit of money at the box office so I'm surprised that he hasn't made any other movies. Anyway, it's a feel good movie about a man who searched for perfection from all of his players, no matter what colour they were and his determination and brutal training paid off at the end.<br/><br/>Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $43million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their sports/biopic movies about a basketball coach who hired the first black players to try and get the perfect team. 4/10"

","I suppose these days no Hollywood Studio will green-light a sports film unless it's about the struggle of black minorities to overcome prejudice in the past and make a breakthrough in integrated teams.<br/><br/>I suppose in 20 years time we might have similar themed sports films that deal with homosexuality gaining acceptance in sports or female coaches in a male dominated world of team sports. Who knows.<br/><br/>Glory Road is based on a true events leading to the 1966 College Men's Basketball Championship. Head Coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) of Texas Western College recruits the best players irrespective of race due to a lack of financial resources.<br/><br/>By recruiting black players the Coach has to deal with issues of integration, getting the team to bond and racism.<br/><br/>Following initial wins against poor teams, Haskins realizes that the black players perform better with more freer movements at the court. His team play with a flamboyant style but this also leads to racial hatred against the team, threats to his family and ransacking of his team's hotel rooms during an away game.<br/><br/>The film is made from the producers of Remember the Titans which dealt with similar themes in American Football in College.<br/><br/>Josh Lucas holds the film together of what is now a similar narrative path.

Don't go into this thing expecting a history lesson and you should leave having a pretty good time. Lucas is very good in the role of Haskins, which also had him gaining over thirty pounds. The supporting cast of kids do nice work and it's rather interesting seeing John Voight under all that make up to the play the legendary Rupp. The ""black vs. white"" story takes a lot of liberties but it remains fun throughout."

","This is a decent basketball movie, although I found out that it is virtually inaccurate. Don't take any of it as historically accurate. Now that doesn't diminish what Don Haskins accomplished. He just took longer than the time frame. The other thing that disappointed me was characterization. I never felt close to any of the players. They seemed to be a racial entity. The game scenes were OK but there just seemed to be a missing element. One of the biggest turnoffs for me was the pomposity of the coach. His endless speech making and philosophizing. Maybe he was like this, but I don't know how much of that stuff really inspires anyone. The film needed some other conflict than the usual racism of the south. I'd like to find out more about Adolph Rupp. How accurately was he portrayed? Anyway, when compared to ""Hoosiers,"" or ""Remember the Titans,"" this doesn't have the substructure of those sports films."

","The Roland E. Zwick review of Disney's Glory Road is a good, solid opinion piece, so my addition will be simply to acknowledge that this movie is a basket-shooting, rebounding clich√©, but a visually impressive one.<br/><br/>I don't know a lot about cameras, lenses, and film stock (if movies still use film anymore?), but there's a grainy, orangey patina to the movie that gives it its old feel, and it's very effective.<br/><br/>Besides that, it's a solid, journeyman, underdog sports movie (with a whole lot of racial tension thrown in). Besides the color of the film, there's a laying open of the frustration and surrender black players felt after a relentless barrage of hate from opposing teams and their respective communities. Finally, key members of the team surrender to reverse hatred and lump all ""crackers"" together.<br/><br/>That was intellectually honest for the screenwriters to put in to Glory Road, the knee-jerk response to bigotry being more bigotry. This struggle--and the response to it by the coaches--raises the movie above its fairly low performance.<br/><br/>There's just a bit more to this clich√© fest than first meets the eye."

No way there can be a spoiler in a movie such as this.<br/><br/>Afterwards, I did a little research and discovered that the movie had taken a lot of liberties with the facts. I don't think this was necessary since this was a truly historic event any way the story was told. Presenting a factual account would have been just as entertaining.

","Full disclosure: I have not seen this movie, though from the splendid reviews I would like to. But I watched them filming this just off Bourbon Street in New Orleans in the summer of 2005, not long before Hurricane Katrina destroyed most of the city. We were staying at a hotel on Bourbon, and one fine evening I looked out the window of our room to see a white globe floating over the buildings across the street.<br/><br/>Hokay, it's a UFO. Or something. But it didn't fly around or drop off aliens, so I went out to investigate. The fellow sitting on a folding chair guarding some cables said that indeed, they were shooting a movie named 'Glory Road.' The great globe turned out to be a helium-filled balloon worthy of space exploration. They had it tethered in the parking lot of a tire store with dozens of helium tanks and a generator to run the lights inside. It was, said the fellow, an artificial moon. So if you see a scene with the moon on the horizon in this movie, that's what it was. The balloon undulated slightly in the wind, but I suppose it's okay to have rubbery-looking astronomical objects in a basketball movie."

I know the director added the hotel room scene and bathroom scene for dramatic effect, but if it didn't happen, it should not have been included. Also, the fact the movie makes it seem like Coach Haskins came in his first year and won the championship, which wasn't true.<br/><br/>Josh Lucas did a good job and was fun to watch. Since he was the central character, you needed a good performance to make the movie watchable. He did a good enough job.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you love sports, definitely see it.

","I was a college junior in 1965, at a deep southern university. We had an outstanding basketball team, and one star was Elvin Ivory, a tall black player. The only black player on our team. There was no controversy, probably because the team remained mostly white. That is fact, not judgement.<br/><br/>This movie, ""Glory Road"", begins in 1965, where the new coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) inherits an all-white basketball team that expects to lose most games in this El Paso college, and do. But Haskins loves basketball and loves winning, and refuses to stand still. He and his assistants go nationwide, as far as inner city New York, to find capable black players who are mostly neglected by major schools which are typically still all white, as was Kentucky for example. It wasn't that Haskins was trying to make a statement, because he wasn't. He just couldn't get white players interested in his ""loser"" school, and his only hope was to recruit the black players.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so good is the genuine and fantastic true story, one that could not have been believed, had it been fabricated. Plus, the basketball scenes are very well shot and edited, showing what each coach may have been telling players during the brief time outs when strategy was set.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW, although history records what happened. Coach Haskins was a tough taskmaster, insisted that his players play HIS way. But while his way worked with a championship girls team the year before, had them losing their first game badly. With nothing to lose, he let his players do it THEIR way, they came from behind and won, to everyone's surprise. In fact they reached a record of 17-0 that season and were ranked in the national top 10 of major colleges before they lost a game. Regrouping they made it to the NCAA final four, and ultimately played multi-champion Kentucky, coached by famous Adolph Rupp (Jon Voight), for the championship. Coach Haskins started 5 black players, unheard of!! And they won in double overtime, for the completion of perhaps the biggest surprise season ever, going from traditional losers to the best team in the NCAA. The ending credits has a nice touch, snippets of interview from the real Haskins and many of the players who were on that team, plus Pat Riley who played for Kentucky in 1966 and became one of the better NBA coaches."

Maybe it's me, but I didn't feel that coach Don Haskins really had his plan for the game to well thought out, the way coach Herb Brooks from Miracle did. At times this movie is not to easy to sit through, This story was in 1966, and racism was high, and thank goodness I was not born in that time. It may not be the sports movie around, but it was not the worst. The Basketball scenes were good, and exciting. Josh Lucas gave quite a good performance has Don Haskins, but he soon gets overshadowed by Derek Luke(Friday Night Lights) as Bobby Joe Hill, the team leader, his performance was very Oscar worthy."

The plot is about a girls college basketball coach, Coach Don Haskins, who picks boys to play basketball for him. The story is set in 1965, when racism was unfortunately high. What Don says is that he doesn't see color when he picks for boys to play. He picks skill, hard work, etc. His family has to move into a mens college doormroom so he can coach. He picks seven African-American boys to play for him. They have skill, and they can work hard. Don picks five white boys to play for him. They work hard, and have skill. Unfortunately, some people only saw color. They didn't see hard work or skill. They only saw the color of their skin. The team faced racism. A ton of racism. However, their incredible story made history.<br/><br/>This is a very high quality movie. It is a great movie for anyone 12 and over. The acting is superb!

The people and the school are upset but he does what he feels is right and he ends up starting three black players in the first game. They win all of the regular season games except for one. They end up winning the NCAA Championship and the coach only plays the black players. It is an excellent movie and it teaches us a very important lesson and that is that we should judge a person by who they are and not by the color of their skin."
"bob-rutzel","9","0","1","18 June 2006"," Terrific
","This is based upon a true story. You don't have to be a basketball fan to like this movie.<br/><br/>Don Haskins (Lucas) takes an almost non-existent Division 1 Basketball team, Texas Western Miners, all the way to the NCAA Finals.<br/><br/>This movie is about racism first, basketball second and shows the country that segregation is not the way to go. Okay, okay, it's about basketball and the racism thing just worked itself out. Don Haskins changed the way basketball is played in the United States, and yes, there were many bumps along the way, but things smoothed out in the long run. And, yes, ""things"" are still in the process of being smoothed out. Yes, Haskins changed the way basketball is played, but the players were the ones to let Haskins know that, "" if you want to win, let us play our game."" And Haskins, to his credit, saw the wisdom in that.<br/><br/>I couldn't get over how well put together this movie is. It simply flowed as though it had a life of its own, and maybe it did. Since basketball and racism were the two main things in here there wasn't much room for character development, as for say Haskins, but who cares? This moved along at such a lively pace that you weren't aware that anything was missing.<br/><br/>Terrific cast, dialogue and acting performances all around. The games themselves were like they were live before us and the choreography and editing were nothing short of fantastic.<br/><br/>Is it just me or does Josh Lucas sometimes remind you of both Matthew McConaughey and Kevin Costner almost at the same time? Look again. And, although her part as Haskins's wife, was small, Emily Deschanel comes across as extremely sexy as well as beautiful. She reminded me of Gena Davis when she started out in TV and movies. I am sure we shall see more of her in the future. Jon Voight was exceptional and we need to see more of him.<br/><br/>Stay tuned at the end of the story to find out what happened to the real life players. But, there is one criticism I have regarding sub-titles or captions when this is done. The Directors must know these movies are going to DVD so stop with the small lettering and white on white. Give us a chance to read the thing without binoculars or significant eye-strain."

While Derek Luke is wonderful, I'm beginning to think he might be typecast. . .he was in Friday Night Lights as a football player. Either way, the acting from on the unknown actors are great considering they haven't really been in anything else. Someone posted on how angry there were about finding out that some of the hatred scenes were made up or whatever. Please, maybe it wasn't ever reported by people from that time, but don't deny that it never happened. Movies and shows these days use the phrase ""inspired by a true story"", so producers and directors don't get in trouble for inaccuracies For those who keep griping about the inaccuracies, I say if you want all the facts, then go watch a documentary.

I'll admit it. He's not a great actor. You might as well should have given the role to Matthew McCoughney, that makes a bit more sense.

This movie was anything but. I was a college freshmen the year Texas Western won their NCAA title and remember watching the game at a beer bar not far from campus. If I recall correctly most everyone was for the Miners since I went to school north of the Mason Dixon line in the American West. I believe the movie portrays the sentiments and feeling of the times quite well and the soundtrack is most appropriate and highly contagious. True, liberties are taken with some of the history of actual occurrences but overall the movie is well acted and will not disappoint. I actually believe Coach Haskins was even a stronger personality than the movie portrays. The team players and actors are excellent. If you were a college student in the mid to late 60's this may well be the movie that you have been waiting to see, especially if you were into collegiate sports at that time."

I know it's a true story (well at least most of it is) but it is a lot like remember the Titans, but I thought the sports part of the movie was not not as good. Also, there is no way that in 1966 there was that much dunking or anyone throwing a pass off of the backboard. That bugged me as a sports enthusiast. Overall the acting was good but some of the story lines were very predictable. I also thought the love story was somewhat forced. There was not enough emphasis on Coach Haskins and his family either and what was shown looked forced as well. I'm actually surprised how they did not make Rupp (Kentucky coach) out to be all that bad, not that he was in real life but in Hollywood they seem to want more villainous anti-heroes. While I recommend the movie, the race and teamwork issues are better covered in Remember the Titans and basketball is better in Hoosiers."
