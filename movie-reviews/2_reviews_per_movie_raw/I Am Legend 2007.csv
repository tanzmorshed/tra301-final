"MR_Heraclius","8","53","58","22 February 2020"," This movie was pretty brilliant...right up to the end.
","The legendary book comes to life, in this Francis Lawrence adaption. A perfect decision in casting Will Smith as the main protagonist greatly improves the film. The movie's visuals are pretty good even though some people may say otherwise. All in all, it's a great adaption of a terrific novel."
"leoncielo","7","264","311","15 December 2007"," I Am Legend: The Movie With So Much Potential That Was Ruined
","Normally I have an opinion on a movie when it's over, I can reflect on it for a few minutes and then I'm done with. It becomes cataloged in my brain as 'awesome' 'pretty good' 'worst.movie.ever.' or a host of other standard issue classifications.<br/><br/>Not so with 'I Am Legend.' I can't recall the last time I was this frustrated by a movie.<br/><br/>It had so much potential to be so great, and then just fell apart in the last third of the movie with every summer blockbuster/zombie movie cliché known to man, run one after the other.<br/><br/>The movie creates a fantastic atmosphere of post-apocalyptic New York and requires your patience as Will Smith's character begins to unravel as the monsters around him begin to become more aggressive and intelligent. Before heading out to see the movie, I did some research on the book the movie is based on and the reason it is such a well known classic story is because of the twists, perspectives and grim ending. What you find out towards the book is that Neville really is the last man on Earth, and the rest of society are now these zombie/vampires, and Neville's ability to walk around in the daylight and kill them has basically made him the monster. He is the one feared by them, he is the villain, and they will stop at nothing to eradicate this day walker who preys on them.<br/><br/>Keeping that in mind, I was super impressed by how the movie seemed to be heading in that direction with that head Zombie guy's heated animosity towards Neville as if it were personal (and perhaps the zombie Neville captured were his significant other, thus lending the zombies an actual 'society), and not merely 'meee hungry for flesh.' The movie basically went right down the tubes when Will Smith decided after he had to kill his dog that he was going to go on a suicide mission at the docks playing Destruction Derby with his Explorer. All of the haunting, edge-of-your-seat suspense and fear created brilliantly with the scene in the abandoned bank, and with the zombie dogs clamoring for the last sliver of daylight to cede, and creepy subtle atmospheric effects throughout went right out the darn window and we suddenly found ourselves in '28 Days Later.' With some random chick coming out of nowhere to somehow scare off 100 angry zombies (who had just blown his UV truck to hell mind you; but apparently she had outfitted a better one than an incredibly resourceful Military Soldier/Scientist), carry Will Smith, who weighs twice as much as her, into her car, and somehow drive them to safety.<br/><br/>So we find ourselves in an incredibly uncomfortable scenario with the Brazilian chick and her creepy Columbine son, and some Bob Marley metaphors laid on top of terrible dialog. Then, instead of a suspense-ridden in-the-dark atmospheric climax, with heavy breathing, flashes of gore, heart pounding scene, we're left with cheesy CG explosions, zombies body slamming people, no one keeping a gun on them when there's about 50 scattered across the house, and other usual stupid horror/action movie miss-steps.<br/><br/>We finally find ourselves with Neville, back against the wall, Zombie leader separated from Smith's neck by a rapidly deteriorating inch of glass and I'm hoping the movie will be somehow salvaged with a great twist, a grim conclusion, or at worst, a convoluted piece of foreshadowing from the first twenty minutes of the movie being pulled out of the scriptwriters pie hole to be played out here. (I personally thought he could have awakened the zombie girl he was curing and seen if the reaction of the intelligent zombie would have caused a reaction, or if some communication could have been made between Neville and his antagonist who at this point we've come to realize is moderately intelligent). I'm an idiot for expecting anything but 'yo, hide in the chimney while i blow myself up.' Don't even get me started on the Utopian Vermont safe-haven, seriously. You're going to tell me 1 million zombies couldn't overrun some 20 foot walls spanning what would approximate 2 miles of land? Christ. I could have written a better ending in 20 minutes on the back of a cocktail napkin."
"rogerdarlington","Null","310","432","29 December 2007"," Should have been better
","The 1954 sci-fi/vampire novel ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson has now been filmed three times: as ""The Last Man On Earth"" in 1964 originally scripted by Matheson himself (which I have never seen), as ""The Omega Man"" in 1971 without the vampire elements (which I have viewed three times), and now with the original title and expensive sets and special effects. This time the seemingly sole survivor of the worldwide pandemic Robert Neville is played by Will Smith who is an actor with real charisma and charm and considerable box office appeal who has beefed himself up for the role.<br/><br/>The main strength of this version is the location shots in a deserted New York City (a move from the Los Angeles of the book and earlier films) and, although the filming of these scenes apparently caused traffic chaos and much anger for local residents, they chillingly set the tone for this dystopian thriller. To see the silent streets around Times Square or South Street Seaport or the lone scientist fishing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art or playing golf on the ""USS Intrepid"" is to view this heaving metropolis as we have never experienced it before. The German shepherd dog who is Neville's sole companion deserves an honourable mention for showing greater thespian skills than most of the extras and stunt men.<br/><br/>The principal weakness of the movie, however, is the realisation of the surviving victims of the virus. The CGI characters are almost as silly as they are scary but, above all, they are presented as more animalistic than human. ""The Omega Man"" handled these characters much better presenting them as sad as well as scary. The other serious fault is the lack of clarity in the narrative - at times, it is simply unclear what is happening and why and a longer director's cut would be welcome. Finally the references to Ground Zero and God may play well with American audiences but will not be so resonant to audiences elsewhere in the world."
"atredbaron","5","197","286","13 December 2007"," A mixed bag
","Just finished a pre-screening here and I'm actually pretty disappointed. The first half of the movie was great and started to build something interesting despite the glaring lack of any background regarding the story. Yes, I realize that you get a few flashbacks but the writers decided not to include any flashbacks of how the disease started, no clips of people progressing through the stages of illness, in essence, everything that led to the point Will Smith ultimately arrived at. <br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT* While this certainly was a drawback, it is nothing compared to the non-events that surrounded the relationship between Smith's character and what seemed to be the head of the vampire/zombie/darkstalkers. Just as the plot was beginning to develop between them, the film took an epic dive right around the time Smith's dog died. There was absolutely no further development and even though the darkstalkers seem to show some intelligence and evolution, the movie is concluded with their leader banging his head against the glass and screaming like an idiot. It all leads to an ending that seems like a cop-out and left me feeling wholly unsatisfied. *End Spoilers*<br/><br/>There were definitely some great parts, the cinematography was fantastic and the computer generated scenes of a dilapidated and ""uninhabited"" New York were amazing. It most certainly was scary and there were times that made me jump though the animation on the darkstalkers was not particularly impressive; in fact, it reminded me a lot of the movie ""The Mummy"" with Brendan Frasier. Smith once again proved himself a very capable and believable actor. The first half is great, though the second will definitely leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. My advice: leave halfway through and you won't be disappointed!"
"kergrease","9","476","727","14 December 2007"," Really well acted, well done film
","At first, I thought that this movie would be okay at best, abysmal at worst. But I was pleasantly surprised to see Will Smith, ""Robert Neville,"" give a spectacular performance, full of emotion and anger, and bordering a bit on the insane side. I take off points only because it seems like a film that's been done before (and it has, I know, but I don't mean literally). What sets it apart from the rest of the post-apocalyptic man made human killing virus that zombifies people films is the depth of Will Smith's character. With cross-cuts to dreams and the portrayal of Robert Neville's loneliness, the audience connects with him on both a deep mental level and a more surface level driven by pathos. You both laugh and cry with him, you jump out of your seat when he gets scared, and you cheer for him throughout. I walked in expecting a zombie shoot-em-up and settled into something much more thought provoking and intense. It wasn't perfect, but it certainly deserves a look, even if you're not into the whole undead thing."
"dkerwood","6","577","891","15 December 2007"," Surface is great, but...
","This film could easily have filled 2.5 hours of content. Why did it only last 1.5? I want more back story. I want more character development, especially toward the end. I want to know more about what happened, and how Will Smith's character is dealing with it. In short, I just want MORE.<br/><br/>All in all, this film left me feeling a lot like I did in Spider-Man 3: A lot happened, but none of it was really EXPLAINED.<br/><br/>It's a shame, really, because the concept is golden... and Will Smith's films usually feel quite epic and full. I'll definitely pick up the novel... hopefully it will give me the depth that I want."
"bob the moo","Null","57","79","17 February 2008"," Excellent until it starts moving the narrative beyond a concept and stumbles and falls badly
","Cancer has been cured by genetically modifying the measles virus to benefit mankind  the results are impressive. However the downside is that the virus mutates killing 90% of humanity, turning 9% into light-phobic monsters and leaving only 1% untouched due to natural immunity. Robert Neville is one of that 1% and also the military biochemist charged with stopping the virus but he has failed and now is the only person alive in what remains of NYC. Working on a cure in his basement and broadcasting fruitlessly into the sky, Neville spends his days surviving and his nights hiding.<br/><br/>Despite my fear of most zombie style films, I came to I Am Legend drawn mostly by the interest in the effects. Having been impressed by an empty London in 28 Days Later, I was curious to see what more money could do. In terms of impact the answer is ""the same"" but in terms of scale it is ""much more"". New York looks amazing and even those who only know it from films will feel the emptiness of the place. The irony is that, due to the sheer scale of it, visually it looks ""unreal"" whereas the smaller scale 28 Days Later was just plain eerie as it involved nothing generated by computer. This will sound like a criticism but it is not because I do think that this sense of emptiness is the thing that makes I Am Legend excellent for part of the running time.<br/><br/>The effects are only part of it but roundly the delivery makes this aspect work. The plot sits back and lets us just be with Neville in his isolation and semi-madness; talking to manikins, treating his dog as a child and so on. This is greatly helped by a performance from Will Smith that is close to towering; he is utterly convincing in his character and the film brings us an understand of his situation gradually. As we get used to his eccentric lifestyle, the reality is brought home in a moment where he goes from sun to a sweat soaked scene in a dark room, a brilliant moment where we the audience experience the fear he is living with first hand.<br/><br/>So why is the film itself not brilliant? Well, this comes down to the second half or so where the writers start to take steps to bring out a narrative that will go somewhere in the traditional sense rather than exploring the character of Neville as its sole reason for being. In doing this the script made many jumps that were convenient, illogical or just plain lazy and it is disappointing. Bear in mind that this is a film that had managed to convince me that the majority of humanity was dead due to Emma Thompson, the man responsible for finding the cure was one of the few left alive and that New York was completely empty  I never questioned any of this so how much of a dropped ball is it to suddenly introduce a narrative that has the audience looking at each other saying ""yeah right""? It is not as bad as I make it sound though because at this point the action steps up and provides sufficient noise and explosions that perhaps many viewers will find themselves distracted away from the problems with the story telling. However these are too obvious and too big and contrast badly with the patience and emptiness of the first half and, with the rush to a conclusion the film does really feel like the majority of the work was done on the concept and this plot was an afterthought. The writers don't help themselves with some of the dialogue anyway. Having got it so perfect with so little early on, a massive shoehorn is used to get Bob Marley in there  one of several things that conspire to undermine all the good character development that had been done in the first half.<br/><br/>Overall though the film is worth seeing. The first half is very impressive thanks to patience, special effects and a very strong turn from Smith. Sadly the second half lets it all down as the plot devices used to provide a tradition flow and ending are clumsy and unconvincing and the noisy action sequences that are produced didn't manage to distract me from them."
"tesnitaylor","8","552","862","14 December 2007"," An acting buffet of Will Smith
","If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, it would be this: Go Will. Will Smith is the driving force of I Am Legend. His performance as Dr. Robert Neville is impeccable. Living in a deserted NY city, his acting is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of a volleyball, he has mannequins and a faithful German Shepard named Sam. His basement, a retro-fitted, high-tech lab to find a cure for the disease that has turned the population of the entire planet into mutant, zombie-like, hive mind, blood-thirsty monsters, and, for some reason, Robert is immune. His days, spent hunting. His nights, sleeping with a high-powered rifle and hoping that the mutants don't find him. Keeping the movie flowing are well placed flashbacks that show what happened to Robert's family and why he is there. The movie falters a bit at the end, maybe at the last 5 minutes, but it doesn't ruin the plot or acting put forth. Containing wonderful cinematography and CG, I Am Legend is a spectacular film that I will be seeing again! PS - Shout out to my NY National Guardsmen in this film! Great job!"
"Brent_P","8","434","677","14 December 2007"," ""Legend"" really separates itself from all other post-apocalyptic films.
","Is it me, or does every movie that portrays the future, it's always some post-apocalyptic setting or the fall of man with man itself to blame? Not a lot to look forward to is it? Anyways, after years of being let down by so called scary zombie/virus movie genres and other blockbuster thriller debacles, ""I Am Legend"" really separates itself from the group.<br/><br/>Without giving too much way, Will Smith plays a sole survivor of a world dominating virus created by man that was originally created to cure cancer. Three years into the ""new"" world, Smith (who was a former doctor) dedicates his life to survival, finding a cure....and talking to mannequins. In order to find a cure he seeks out the infected, who only come out at night, and hoping to correct man's mistake.<br/><br/>""Legend"" was the first truly scary movie I've seen in some time. Realism is the main factor in scary movies in my opinion. If it can happen, than that's pretty scary. Also, Smith's portrayal of despair and borderline insanity of three years of seclusion added to the effect. With the exception of his dog, Smith had no live contact with constant failure attempts of his cure only leading to his insanity. It had a ""Cast Away"" feel to it with his dog as to Hank's volleyball and his house reminding you of that stranded island.<br/><br/>The action/suspense scenes coupled with superb sound direction were also heart pounding and unexpected which added to the ""scare"" factor. Whenever Smith engaged with the zombie-like survivors, there was that claustrophobic feeling that I haven't felt since ""Alien."" My only real complaint was the overuse of CGI over real actors for these characters, but with their speed and strength that these things showed if may have not been possible.<br/><br/>""Legend"" overall is one of the better movies of 2007 and a must see. Not Oscar-worthy by any stretch of the imagination, but it's certainly entertaining, realistically tense and maybe even thought provoking."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","4","132","200","14 December 2007"," I Am Disappointed
","I Am Legend was the best looking film release for early December; I was looking forward to it, like many others I am sure. So I saw I Am Legend tonite with my boyfriend, now after the movie we just looked at each other and had that disappointed look and then the audience just looked around and just walked out grunting and I heard nothing but ""that was a waste of money"". That's definitely not a good thing. I think the problem was definitely the script, the story was not explained well as well as the character development needed improvement. The way that I Am Legend was shot very well, it had a very isolated and cold feeling. Will Smith does a fine job of acting; his best though? Not so much. The story also took a strange turn from Sci-Fi to religion towards the end. Not to mention, was this a zombie film? I don't know, because it was never explained.<br/><br/>Robert Neville is a scientist who is the last man alive in New York City. A cure of cancer has gone horribly wrong and killed off almost 90% of the human population. The cure has turned people rabid and has made them feed on humans. Robert has lost his family in trying to get them out of New York during the evacuation, but he is dedicated to finding a cure for this virus. Along with his only companion, his dog, Samantha, he has to survive this scary and isolated world and try to find the last survivors before he goes insane or gets attacked by these creatures.<br/><br/>I Am Legend had good ideas, like I said, the script just needed major work. Like with Robert's flash backs, it seemed like they just stopped the story at that point and didn't explain how the rest of the population died out and how he was really the ONE and ONLY person who survived New York's virus. I know he said he was immune, but no one else was? Major spoiler: they killed his dog off almost in the beginning of the film which didn't seem right to me. I Am Legend is one of the year's biggest disappointments with me, I guess not everything Will Smith touches is gold. If you want to see I Am Legend, please just expect a lot of confusion and not much of a story, I am very disappointed.<br/><br/>4/10"
"cdelacroix1","8","629","1019","14 December 2007"," Gut-wrenching movie full of adventure and heart
","I just saw this movie today, the day it opened here. And was deeply, deeply moved.<br/><br/>I've got to start with the scenes of a deserted New York City post-apocalypse. These were so very, very moving; and very, very convincing. The clips in the trailers for the movie were good, but you really have to see the full panoply of close-up shots, distance shots, etc to really appreciate the sheer scale of what this movie is depicting. There's something of On the Beach and Resident Evil and of any number of disaster movies and zombie movies here. But none of them do justice to the New York depicted here. This is a New York City we see large-scale and micro-scale in order to show us the environment in which the main character is acting.<br/><br/>And Will Smith is simply brilliant as the sole survivor, Robert Neville. Will delivers movingly and convincingly on a script that really focuses on giving us a picture of ""what it would be like"" ... to be the last man on earth, living off the land in NYC. This is the real strength of this movie: there's really not a lot of blood or gore or zombie scenes at all. Yet I was riveted as Robert goes through his ""typical days"" in NYC. Every moment was full of pathos and full of menace, too. And occasionally we got some relief from Smith's trademark humor that blended seamlessly with the rest of his performance to give us ""what it would be like"" with a powerful delivery that just leaves me almost breathless.<br/><br/>There's an effective use of flashbacks that partly tell us the story of how we got to where we're at in this grim New York City; and the flashbacks also serve to give us an overwhelming contrast between Life Before and Life After the apocalyptic disaster wiped out the city. Yet use of flashback was sparing, which I found all the more effective.<br/><br/>Cinematography was excellent throughout, the storyline and script are brilliant, the use of a dog, Samantha, as a key actor was perfect to show us both Robert as companion and Robert as lonely, isolated survivor.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending, but think it was satisfying as far as it goes, but not nearly as appealing, from my angle, as the foregoing material. That brings up my one complaint: the title. By the end of the movie, we have some sense of the meaning of the title. Yet it still seems to me to feel cheesy and really unworthy of the movie.<br/><br/>But that's a minor plaint. If you haven't seen this movie, and would enjoy seeing a really powerful story about a survivor in post-apocalypse New York City, hey, go check out this flick. It's really worth it."
"zardoz-13","1","156","244","20 December 2007"," Legendarily Lame Science Fiction Remake!!!
","Hollywood has never had much luck adapting science fiction author Richard Matheson's cult 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"" successfully for the screen. Iconic horror movie star Vincent Price headlined the first version; the Italian-lensed ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) ranked as an austere, but depressing widescreen, black & white epic with vampire/zombies as our hero's antagonists. Call them zompires! Price impersonated a valiant scientist, Robert Morgan, with an acquired immunity to a deadly virus that had devastated mankind. Morgan struggled desperately not only to survive acute loneliness but also to cure the survivors. Full-frame copies of this opus are available everywhere in DVD bargain box sets. Not-surprisingly, Price perished in the end.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston retooled the role for the 1971 remake, ""The Omega Man,"" released by Warner Brothers. Heston turned immunologist Robert Neville into a brawny, bare-chested, romantic, action stud hero who cavorted in a blue flight suit with a dress uniform cap complete with scrambled eggs on the visor. Watch ""The Omega Man"" and see if Neville doesn't resemble a Marvel Comics character. Naturally, Heston brought the messianic allure that he had gained from ""The 10 Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"" to the role. Along the way, Heston's Neville indulged in one of the first interracial big-screen romances with African-American actress Rosalind Cash. An army of heavily robed, non-vampiric mutants led by Matthias (Anthony Zerbe) triumphed over him, and he died tragically as a misunderstood Christ figure.<br/><br/>Will Smith fares even worse in the third and least well-done version, ""I Am Legend"" which finally uses the original title of Matheson's novel. Essentially, Smith imitates the Heston hero as a weapons reliant action hero/virologist. They differ in how they contend with loneliness. Heston played chess with a bust of Julius Caesar and fed images of himself via a surveillance camera onto a big-screen television. Smith's Neville dresses up mannequins at a local video rental store and converses with them when he selects a movie. Unlike both Price and Heston, Smith doesn't enjoy a post-apocalyptic romance. Instead of female companionship, Smith has to settle for a German shepherd; canine lovers are warned ahead of time to expect the worst. Even when a woman, Anna (Alice Braga of ""City of God""), does show up near the end, our hero doesn't take the time to sweep her off her feet.<br/><br/>Generally, the problem with all three movies is that the star has to bear the movie on his shoulders for the brunt of the action. Remember that hideous Tom Hanks' movie ""Castaway?"" Half of ""I Am Legend"" looks like ""Castaway"" with Will Smith performing monologues devoid of humor. Sadly, despite a strong performance, Smith has to confront adversaries that neither Price nor Heston contended with—namely, colorless, chrome-domed, computer-generated cannibals. ""I Am Legend"" forfeits any semblance of dramatic impact, much as ""I, Robot"" did, with its cartoon-like CGI villains. Smith wages an eternal war against video game antagonists who cannot speak, making them dim-witted, lowest-common-denominator dolts.<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" opens on an ironic note. Scientists have discovered a cure for cancer. Things go incredibly amiss, however, and Dr. Krippen (an unbilled Emma Thompson of ""Sense and Sensibility"") winds up unleashing a man-made virus in the year 2009 that transforms humanity into homicidal mutants that plunder and destroy everything in sight. Incidentally, these mutants don't appear until midway in the movie after scenarists Mark Protosevich of ""Poseidon"" and Akiva Goldman of ""Batman & Robin"" have established Smith's character and his predicament. The filmmakers rely on occasional flashbacks to fracture that storyline and show how Smith became the last man on Earth. We learn that his wife (Salli Richardson of TV's ""Eureka"") and daughter (Smith's real-life daughter Willow) died in a helicopter collision around the same time that the military quarantined Manhattan Island and sealed off access to it. The military destroy the two landmark Big Apple bridges, but Neville (Will Smith) vows to remain at ground zero and devise a cure.<br/><br/>Three years later, in 2012, Neville and his dog venture outside by day to search for non-infected survivors as well as to forage for food and lock themselves up at night. In an early scene, Neville hunts for fresh meat by pursuing escaped zoo animals through the cluttered, weed-choked canyons of Manhattan in a red Ford Mustang with a high powered rifle. He watches old television shows that he has recorded before the apocalypse while he eats. The mutants themselves are not very interesting. In ""Last Man on Earth,"" the mutants were vampire/zombies that besieged the hero's house at night. In ""The Omega Man,"" the villains were the equivalent of albino Klansmen that terrorized the streets after dark and clashed constantly with Neville.<br/><br/>Like the previous versions, ""I Am Legend"" delivers a dour, downbeat ending that will bum you out beyond belief. The special effects are shoddy and superficial; the villains emerge as a mob of one-dimensional, head-banging morons, and the hero degenerates into an ignoble, unsympathetic, atheistic lout. There is nothing exciting or suspenseful about our hero's late-night encounter with the mutants on the docks where he uses his SUV as a weapon to smash them. Even more implausible is the way that he gets out of this cliffhanger confrontation. ""Constantine"" director Francis Lawrence provides several startling, gotcha-by-the-gullet, scare scenes that will frighten the squeamish, but seasoned gorehounds won't find anything different or dazzling about this drivel.<br/><br/>Will Smith's track record with science fiction is faltering badly these days. ""I Am Legend"" is nowhere near as memorable or entertaining as either ""Independence Day"" or his ""Men in Black"" movies. Instead, ""I Am Legend"" is legendarily lame!"

","""I Am Legend,"" an inexplicable remake of the Charlton Heston minor classic ""The Omega Man"", posits itself as another mass-marketed star vehicle for the always likable Will Smith. Here the mega-star who can do no wrong plays the last man on earth (SPOILER: HE'S NOT!) after a nasty virus wipes out the world population and leaves behind some infected sourpusses in the vein of ""28 Days Later"". This movie has all the key ingredients for a Will Smith box office behemoth (which no doubt it will be), but fails to engage on any higher level. <br/><br/>Here's the recipe:<br/><br/>1. Will Smith playing Will Smith: No other movie star can be such an egotistical show-off and get away with it as well as Will Smith does. No matter how many times we see him do his funny little bits, show off his buff bod, or watch him stretch his acting muscle with an unnecessary emotional breakdown scene, the audience still loves him. He carries ""I Am Legend"" and makes it watchable even when he starts doing a ""Shrek"" impersonation (don't ask) or carries on conversations with mannequins (think Tom Hanks and Wilson the volleyball from ""Cast Away"").<br/><br/>2. A futuristic setting: The set designers do a fantastic job here with a post-apocalyptic New York tableau that is expansive and eerie and will leave you wondering, ""How in blue blazes did they film that?"" Sadly, the special effects team and creature designers didn't do a complimentary job. The zombie/vampire/whatever-the-heck-they-are monsters look like something from a second rate video game circa 1999. Given the PG-13 rating, they are only allowed a moderate amount of fun. Gore hounds and horror buffs will be greatly disappointed. Sci-fi fans will also be angered that after a decent set-up, the film devolves into a preachy messianic family-friendly death-fetish film.<br/><br/>3. A kick-ass dog: Remember how everyone rooted for that dog from ""Independence Day?"" Well, this German Sheperd named Sam puts that dog to shame. However, you know there's a problem when the dog becomes the most dynamic and sympathetic character in a film. I won't carelessly give away what happens to Sam in any explicit detail, but suffice it to say, when two non-characters named Anna and Ethan show up in the film's final moments, you'll be wishing Sam was there to keep it real.<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" offers nothing new but is diverting enough as a matinée. In its depiction of a man and a dog in a post-apocalyptic city, it scores as populist entertainment. As a monster movie, it's a joke. As some sort of end-of-the-world message film, it's abhorrent. But with Will Smith headlining, expect it to be the biggest hit of the holiday season."

"ytee_996","5","134","214","25 December 2007"," Entertaining but misses the point.
","If you are fan of Matheson's book prepare to be disappointed as the film entirely misses the point, especially when it comes to the title itself. Having said that, taken on it's own merits the film is not all that bad. The opening half hour is well constructed and the lingering shots of a deserted NYC are quite effective. Will Smith reigns in his usual on-screen persona to deliver a good performance as Robert Neville, although at times it does seem as though he's playing to an audience which is at odds with the permeating sense of isolation (problems with the script rather than Smith himself). Aside from it's deviation from the book, the film's most glaring problem are the dark seekers themselves. They are entirely rendered in by today's standards unconvincing cgi and therefore never quite achieve the feeling of menace we're supposed to feel. Real actors in make-up with perhaps a little cgi augmentation would've been far better. Also the attempt to create an antagonist for Neville falls a little flat, as he comes across as nothing more than a slighter smarter creature with a grudge. What does work though is Neville's relationship with his dog, Sam. Considering they spend the majority of their screen time together it was important it felt like they had a genuine bond and they do. Also Neville's flashbacks to a time shortly before the worst of the outbreak are well-implemented, never interrupting the pace of the narrative. Ultimately it's the last predictable half hour of the film that falls flat and undoes most of the good work. It's worth seeing but for all Richard Matheson fans it will be frustrating at best. In fact, for anyone who read Mark Protosevich's script that leaked online a few years back you'll probably wish they made that film instead."
"sarri_chelsea","6","36","53","14 December 2007"," Very good until the dumbed down ending
","So, first off, for all those supposed horror movie/book, zombie or vampire fans: this is not a knock off of 28 days later. It's based off I Am Legend, a FANTASTIC book by Richard Matheson, written in 1954... a very LONG time before 28 days later. And, in case you don't know, it very clearly inspired Night of the Living dead, which has influenced most zombie movies since. But anyway, this movie is very good-AT FIRST. It has a fantastic opening, sets the tone AMAZINGLY well, and the effects of NYC that everyone is raving about are in fact worth the praise. The use of sound or lack of it creates such a great effect, and it even adds some subtle nuances from the book that I wouldn't expect the movie to have (such as implying that the vampires were smart, and in my opinion, though it could just be the fact I read the book, it seemed as if it was implying that they were in fact forming the society they did in the book, or at least some organization, though it never followed through with it...). The CGI while, not convincing, is done at such appropriate times that the way the scenes were done makes up for it. However, the only complaint I really have to make is the pathetic excuse of an ending. For those who have read the book they know why it is called ""I am Legend."" the movie tried to follow through with that, only they changed it to some pathetic excuse of an ending. Rather then giving it the intelligence of the book, they ended it with some dumbed down ending for the masses, and no one who sees it could be satisfied by such a cheesy, pathetic attempt at something deep. My advice for people who see it: Watch until the girl shows up, then read the last few chapters of the book, you'll be much the better for it."
"athihor","1","128","210","29 December 2007"," First review ever written. Worst movie.
","*contains spoilers*<br/><br/>This is the first movie I ever cared to review, but it's also one of the worst I've seen. So in ways... It really deserves this. Sorry if my English isn't all perfect, I'm from Denmark, but doing my best.<br/><br/>This is a movie full of odd plot holes and one of the most disappointing endings I've ever seen. The director has got to be more stupid, than what he THINKS we viewers are.<br/><br/>It starts out nicely, I was quite excited to watch this flick, the trailer looked decent. Tho, I already feared that the CGI in it would be rather bad. I sat down in the cinema, leaned back, and hoped for a clever and somewhat chilling movie, about the end of humanity, about the legend this last man would become, in his affords to live trough the end.<br/><br/>....movie starts....<br/><br/>The deer hunt seemed clever in the start, the man needs food! Sure!... But later you see how damn much food he has stored in his house, why would he care to hunt deer? Why waste surely precious gasoline on a car like that when it's not needed at all? Then the lions came, and we get close to the animals.. And what is this I see? CRAPPY CGI?? It's deer! It's lions! No need for CGI! It looks worse than what you on The Discovery Channel, in their ""Dinosaur"" programs. Quickly you see more bad CGI coming at you, ugly zombie/the mummy/vamps. *Sigh* Just dress up a few skinny or toned people, and you would get a much scarier result than these (brownish?) Hulks. A vampire mask from Toys'r'us is more frightening.<br/><br/>We see a lot of half decent acting from Smith, then more crappy CGI. Some nasty shots of Smith working out. More crappy CGI (Now with crappy CGI dogs, that seem taken out of Resident Evil 1) The best actor (The REAL dog) dies... And then the movie turns from being a decent action movie, to a Christian propaganda film. <br/><br/>Smith gets hurt in a revenge rampage on the ugly CGI monsters, and some Christian girl, with the amazing superpower to somehow scare all the monsters away, saves him.. Smith blackouts, sees a little cross hanging around for a while, then wakes up too meet a woman and some kid who magically came to Manhattan, can drive around in the middle of the night, and seem completely healthy, WOW!. Some imaginary character from a 2000 years old fairy tale (God) seems to tell this woman his grand plan, how to find Smith and where to find more people, even a safe-place of sorts, I bet she can see the face of Jesus in that bacon she makes as well. Smith (the none believer) makes some clever points about how sucky this plan of God seems. ""KILL 99% of all people, also innocent kids (especially innocent kids!), save few?.. Ah. I'm a frigging genius!!""<br/><br/>Great plan...<br/><br/>Anyhow.. Ofcause everything she says turn out to be 100% true God is REAL!!! (Yeah, as real as those damn CGI zombies)... Proof? Smith sees a butterfly on some broken glass and a butterfly tattoo the Christian nuts neck... (I thought tattoos where a symbol of Satan?)<br/><br/>He then decides to become a martyr? Yes. He goes Jihad on those evil CGI zombies, that don't understand him and don't want a cure, those evil zombies made by a evil British scientist... <br/><br/>Amazingly, it seems Smith kills ALL the zombies with that grenade, because the Christian woman seems safe and snug in that little hiding place of hers all night... (Actually, how will she get out? Does that place he locked her inside really have a doorknob on the inside? Wouldn't that be like making a handle and lock INSIDE a oven or fireplace? (Just in chance that you hide in them?) In the end she... Drives away from Manhattan??? In that same truck she started of with? How the heck is that even possible? Does she have a private boat or is that ""God"" teleporting her around all this time? <br/><br/>Who knows?? But in the happy happy ending we get our share of a lovely white Church, stars and stripes, and even this whole Amish like village, God told the Christian nut about in the first place.... And of cause playing happy kids and a fluffy dog! Awesome...<br/><br/>The End. <br/><br/>Morale: 1.Don't waste you money this movie. 2.Don't trust God if you're an innocent kid."
"jack-964","1","96","155","21 December 2007"," I am waste of time and money
","I am legend is a very predictable story of what happens when an engineered cure for cancer turns malign. The resulting virus, which mostly resembles rabies, kills most of the population worldwide, except for some 500 million that turn into... of course, a sort of werewolves that feed on the remaining million that are immune. This in itself is a very worn out and unrealistic theme by now and the werewolf angle only makes it more silly.<br/><br/>Our 'hero' is living in the remains of a big city (NY) and luckily for us he is a biological engineer working for the military. In his house he has a laboratory (¿) to find a cure, which he has time for, when he is not out shooting deer, weredogs and -wolves, or is engaged in another boring 'activity'. The dramatic height of the movie is when his dog dies, which had about the same impact on me as when i see i stepped on an ant; boring. There is hardly any character development and well, it's Will Smith, which usually plays Will Smith. The acting is mediocre, at best.<br/><br/>The camera-work is less than mediocre. There are too many scenes that play in the dark, so you can just guess whats going on, which is not so hard, because its all terribly predictable. They spent way too much money on the making of this movie, for it to look so bad. It may be nice if you live in NY to see what your city would become, but to me that means nothing. (and why is there a Lockheed SR71 blackbird on an aircraft carrier? The thing can't land there and they've been out of use for quite a while now *edit* i found it is Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, in NY. Nice if you live in NY and know these things, otherwise useless *end edit*). I watch a movie to see nice images, not 15 minutes of utter darkness...<br/><br/>The end comes pretty hastily with a few narrated lines that should give the whole thing meaning. Should, but doesn't. Along the way there are a few lines that attempt to give it some depth, as in philosophical truths or meaning of which the best is: 'I didn't do it, we did', i want to reply; 'no really, you did!'<br/><br/>I think they tried to copy the i robot feel-style with the music of Bob Marley (Was stevie wonder in I Robot) and they added an anecdote of Bob to give it some 'depth'. Bob was great at making music, but that doesn't imply he was a great philosopher. In the Netherlands we have Johan Cruyff, maybe you heard of him; an ex great football (soccer) player which tends to say things in the media. So now he is quoted for his 'wise' saying: ""Every disadvantage has it's advantage"" (pronounced with Amsterdam accent for dramatic effect). Goes to show that someone great in one field isn't necessarily great in another.<br/><br/>As for humor, there isn't any. I think they tried a few times... ""I wanted to save the bacon"".... but... no.<br/><br/>Very, very disappointing movie. I even wanted to stop watching a number of times, but didn't because i kept hoping a movie with Will Smith in it would get better at some point. It only got worse.<br/><br/>My advise: You can miss this one. There are a lot of better movies already made about virus outbreaks and apocalypses. Watch one of those again, saves money and its less boring. Unless of course you want to be apocalypticly bored."
"Joecuba","1","62","97","13 January 2008"," I Am A Sucky Film
","Really bad movie that I wish I hadn't wasted my money on. The plot is so full of hole it's ridiculous: * 3 years into the apocalyptic future, and Neville is driving about in just-waxed cars? How? Fuel oxidises in a few months, and certainly after 3 years would be fairly useless. Guess that doesn't matter? Guess product placement is more important than realism? * Neville has useless 'pastimes' with no explanation. Just juvenile fulfilment? Again, driving shiny fast cars through overgrown NYC. Hitting golf balls of an aircraft wing on top of an aircraft carrier? Hunting deer through the streets? All with no reason or explanation, just playboy fantasy.<br/><br/>*Everyone else has been eaten by the darkseekers or killed by the virus, but Neville somehow has a very flash 'pad' in the middle of the city that hasn't been breached by the night stalkers or looted by others? * The darkseekers purportedly cannot survive cold temperatures, yet have lived in NYC for 3 years where the temperature is minus during the winter. No explanation.<br/><br/>* Houses and stores are neat and dust free... after 3 years? Who is doing the cleaning? * Darkseekers have somehow superhuman skills, and can bound about like small monkeys, hang from the ceiling, and see in pitch dark. Totally out with the bounds of sense for what a virus could do to a human.<br/><br/>* The non-characters Anna and Ethan appear out of nowhere. Did they use a boat? A boat that, presumably, can carry a SUV, as they arrive in Vermont in the same vehicle.<br/><br/>* Anna pulls Neville out of his car wreck and into her car, even though he is twice her weight.<br/><br/>* Neville's home lab is well fitted out, with even a glass fronted 'cage' for restraining the darkseekers, how was this possible in the time leading up to the crisis? Or does everyone who is in the military medical division have their own fully kitted out private lab in the basement of their posh Manhattan home? * Neville is hung upside down by his leg for, presumably, several hours, yet is able to recover, cut himself loose, and regain the use of his foot. His foot would have been severely, probably permanently, damaged by the constriction.<br/><br/>* Somehow Nevilles house has remained a safe haven from the darkseekers for 3 years, yet they are able to breach it by chewing through the ceiling? * Why does Neville sprinkle a liquid on the steps of his home? No explanation.<br/><br/>* Nevilles blood is given to Anna, but not the formula for the cure? Doh! * Anna has heard of Damian Marley but not Bob Marley? Why? * There is more goofs at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/goofs I am sure there are many more blunders, but these are the ones I remember from a day ago.<br/><br/>This film really sucks the big one. As everyone says, the CGI graphic animals and darkseekers are cartoon-like and badly done. The gee-whizz overgrown NYC scenes are OK, but unless you live there, it doesn't really matter. The plot is thin for the first 2/3, then deteriorates rapidly with Anna the 'angel' spreading her gospel. The anti-scientific and pro-Christian undertones are obvious and preachy, and don't help the story at all. The flashbacks are annoying and serve no purpose other than to tell a boring story of how Neville's wife and daughter were killed, and the film fails to make us feel any sympathy at all for them (and shows us no reaction from Neville to the incident). The ending and meaning to the 'legend' is trite and cheesy. The dog dying is cheap emotion. We feel very little sympathy for Neville. There really is so much to dislike about this film. Utter nonsense, not worth watching unless it is shown on TV and you don't mind spending 1 1/2 hours of your life getting annoyed!"
"fosterino","1","79","126","31 December 2007"," the bad grammar in the title should be a giveaway
","I have three major gripes about this film, all of which have numerous sub-gripes. The first and most obvious is the extremely terrible quality and extremely high quantity of Computer Generated effects. When I say the effects are bad, I refer to the zombie like ""infected,"" zombie dogs, the deer that roam the streets, the lions that escaped from the zoo, right down to the butterfly that Will Smith's dog looks at. These have to be the worst special effects of the 21st century. Not a single thing is convincing for one second. What's even more puzzling than the inexplicably poor effects is the sheer amount of them. Will Smith captures a zombie and brings it to his lab. Even the body on the table is computer generated. Could they REALLY not get a person to lay on table and do nothing for a few minutes? I'm not the type of person who goes to the movies to see special effects, but when they are so bad as to ruin any suspense or drama by taking you out of the movie, then they are an unquestionably bad part of the film.<br/><br/>All this talk about the ""infected"" brings me to my second major gripe: the screenplay. Basically, it makes no sense. Never mind that zombies are boring movie villains anyway, but the script attributes a certain set of characteristics to them and they act completely differently from those. Will Smith's character, after an un-scary run in with a pack of them, describes how ""social devolution is complete,"" and that ""all traces of human behavior are gone."" This would suggest to the viewer that these zombies would have no community, communication, or group mentality, right? WRONG! These zombies are actually kind of the opposite of how the movie describes them. They live and work in groups, have a pretty well defined leader, can coordinate, organize, and execute a pretty elaborate plan to trap Will Smith, and they have apparently managed to domesticate murderous zombie-dogs. Okay, so you'd think these sort of smart zombies aren't that lame after all, right? WRONG AGAIN!! Despite all this, they still fall victim to the trappings of a Hollywood movie that caters to the lowest possible denominator. These infected humans have apparently forgotten how to speak, so instead they run really fast and yell loudly, entering rooms only to tear out the insulation from the wall, or breaking through glass by banging their heads on it, I suppose all in a grand attempt to ""scare"" the audience.<br/><br/>The script is terrible for reasons other than the ""infected"" too. Towards the end, two random human survivors show up and ""rescue"" Will Smith. In the minutes immediately preceding this, the action flashes back to the evacuation of Manhattan, during which all the bridges connecting the island to anywhere else are demolished. The very first shot of the film shows the flooded entrance to the Holland Tunnel. These mysterious survivors brought a car of their own and came from Maryland, so this begs the question HOW THE HELL DID THEY GET HERE? Needless to say, this question is never answered and doesn't really need to be, because these two survivors are so annoying that you'll be praying for them to leave. The kid is the generic creepy type who doesn't say a damn thing, and his mom is the generic ""God is killing us all but God can save us"" person who exists in all apocalypse-related movies. It also just so happens that these two morons accidentally lead the blood thirsty CG zombies to Will Smith's house. They crash his party, leading to a dumb, clichéd ending that is clearly trying to emulate better films like 28 Days Later or Children of Men.<br/><br/>I guess my third gripe is that the film creates no drama or atmosphere at all. The director resorts to really lame horror movie tricks to ""keep the audience on edge,"" although all he managed to do was keep me from falling asleep. For example, and this is used an awful lot, when Will Smith is closing his windows at night, they make an unnecessarily loud noise. Creepy... He also creates a lot of false tension: when Will Smith is evacuating his family (in a flashback) people are being tested for the killer virus. His wife is marked as infected, but 30 seconds later, after Will screams for a little bit, she is scanned again and this time she's fine. Oh, Francis Lawrence, you sure are a clever one... But perhaps the lamest and most mood- killing flaw like this is how the movie tries to (and fails at) being symbolic or meaningful. Will Smith comparing himself to a Bob Marley song is especially cringe-worthy, but not so much as the false imagery of a butterfly (explaining it would require a lot of effort that I frankly don't want to devote to reviewing a movie as awful as this, so just take my word for it, please.). The only scene that does hold any meaningful drama is when Will Smith has to kill his dog. Even still I can't escape the feeling that the plot device of a dead dog is almost like a ""free pass"" that the film uses to involve the audience. Nevertheless, when that is the best scene from your movie, you've failed on an epic level.<br/><br/>The saddest part about all this is that the basic premise is actually pretty intriguing, even worse is how Will Smith, who I really like in other movies, is betrayed by the material as he tries to work up the courage to say hello to a mannequin woman. <br/><br/>This movie is just a complete failure, an example of the Law of Diminishing Returns, the phenomenon of getting less output out of more and more input. This movie cost $150 million to make, and is just a shadow of the classic films it wants so desperately to be."

","The religious message that this film tries to shove down your throat is just disgusting. The implication that scientists don't know what they are doing and are the cause of the troubles of society is just ludicrous and wrong.<br/><br/>The fact that it is only when he gives into faith that Neville is truly ably to sacrifice himself to save the human race (sound familiar?) is a complete joke that happens in about 4 minutes of movie time and isn't developed at all.<br/><br/>(Want to see a true Christ symbol? Watch Cool Hand Luke Mr. Lawrence!)<br/><br/>Lastly; the final shot of the big doors opening upon a church steeple and salvation made me want to vomit. As if faith and god are all that can save us from the evils of science. This is just total crap movie making.<br/><br/>To have even approached the themes of Mathison's novella is way more than director Francis Lawrence is capable of. Instead he goes off on his own religious crusade.<br/><br/>Oh yeah and finally: The CGI on this film was terrible!! I couldn't tell if those were vampire monsters or Goofy from Disney."

","First off, I'm glad to see I'm not the only one disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>For as much hype as their was, this movie is only just over an hour and a half long. With a movie that could quite easily be an epic, you'd expect more. The movie watching audience is used to hour and a half movies. Let's save that time span for comedies, can we? <br/><br/>What's with the CG creatures throughout this movie? The animals I can understand. But when you're looking at all the ""villians"" in this movie, they look lousy. I only say this because they could easily have been portrayed by humans but instead they're computer generated. Why? I have no clue. Emotions can be shown so much stronger through humans. With CG, I don't feel any connection to the character(s) because I know that I'm watching a non-real figure and, hence, I start not caring as much as I would. How hard would it have been to make the close ups on the creatures be humans in makeup? Not at all and it would have been fantastic!<br/><br/>I was somewhat bored with this movie and I just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would have. The movie industry seems to be relying too much on CG to fill in holes and when it's a hole as big as what is the main focus of I Am Legend, it's embarrassing to see monsters that are almost cartoon-like.<br/><br/>Sorry guys, I'm just not impressed with CG, anymore. Bring back the humans."

","This was like Spike Lee directing a George Romero movie that could have been an hour shorter. All of the ""infected"" looked like Gollum from Lord of the Rings mixed with Beowulf. If the flashbacks were framed near the beginning, maybe I would have cared if he was alone. With the lack of soundtrack, it made the movie drag on like it was four hours long and do we need to place the camera on Will Smith for two minutes, watching him stare at nothing? He only has about two expressions in his repertoire anyway. This movie could have been great but it was edited all weird and could have used some music to heighten his alone time to pull us into his miserable world. If you want to see the concept done correctly, in my opinion, check out The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price. Same thing done well. Or even Omega Man with Charlton Heston. They were actually more real and scarier, just another example of Hollywood putting style over substance to give The Fresh Prince an Oscar nod."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","45","70","7 November 2008"," Has its share of thrills and poignancy
","I am aware of the fact that this 2007 blockbuster is a remake of a remake. It's a remake of ""The Omega Man"", which is a remake of ""The Last Man on Earth"". All three films are adaptations of the novel, ""I Am Legend"", by Richard Matheson. I haven't seen the previous two versions, but definitely intend to. However, for now, since I've just seen this 2007 version of ""I Am Legend"", and haven't seen the rest, I'll just have to judge it strictly as a movie, not how it compares to the previous two, or the book. So, while this particular version of the story seems to be polarizing, I was definitely impressed.<br/><br/>In 2012, three years after a genetically modified virus which was supposed to cure cancer ended up wiping out most of the world's population, a scientist named Robert Neville, immune to this virus, appears to be the only uninfected human left in New York City, maybe even the world, and his only companion is his dog, Sam! Neville does research in his basement laboratory to try and find a cure for the virus, and regularly sends out radio messages, calling for other survivors to come and meet him, if there are any out there, but so far, this has not worked. Eventually, the scientist discovers people in New York who have not been killed by the virus, but have been mutated by it, and as a result, they have become dangerous monsters! Worse still, there are many of them in the city, and Neville is still waiting to see another uninfected human, so he is grossly outnumbered! <br/><br/>This film is slow-paced around the beginning, but this works well, starting with the introduction to the virus which was yet to fail, and going from there to views of a deserted New York, which are reasonably intriguing. Some scenes may be a bit tedious, such as Robert Neville looking through the dark building before finding the mutants, and the camera is sometimes a bit unsteady, but to make up for the flaws, there's quite a bit of tension (which includes scenes with the mutated, zombie-like humans and they're chases and attacks, even though I'm sure we've seen scenes like that before in movies), as well as some poignant moments, with Neville and his loneliness. Also, for Bob Marley fans, the main character is a big fan of his, and at one point, he talks about Marley and his philosophies. As someone who listens to his music and has read a lot about his short life, this part definitely touched me, and it obviously isn't featured in the previous two adaptations, as they were both made before Marley became an international superstar.<br/><br/>Yes, this film has its flaws, and seems to have gotten a lot of positive feedback as well as negative, but personally, I have to give it a positive review. While not quite a masterpiece, I still found it to be a memorable sci-fi/horror film, with a fair amount of suspense, action, and poignancy. Once again, I don't know how it compares to the book or the previous two adaptations of it, and clearly, it seems to be widely considered inferior to those, but while that may be true, I cannot join the naysayers on this one. If you see this version of ""I Am Legend"", I guess you could easily end up on either side, but if you want to see a combination of sci-fi, horror, and drama, and you're a Will Smith fan, I think it's worth a try, and yes, it just MIGHT help a BIT if you're a Bob Marley fan."
"john_sinbad","5","26","38","28 December 2007"," First half good, second half embarrassing.
","Having seen some promising trailers I today decided to go and see I Am Legend. The film kicks off with a newscaster interviewing a scientist about what is thought to be a cure for cancer. The scientist's amateurish method of helping the layman understand how the cure actually works - using the simile of a car and its driver - made me wonder whether the film would persist with this kind of dumbing down.<br/><br/>We are then taken instantly to the post-apocalyptic New York in which Robert Neville (Will Smith) lives. Just about everyone has either died or contracted some sort of zombie-ism because of KV, a virus originating from the genetically-modified measles virus which was used to try and cure cancer. This part having been brought in so soon you are hoping that the director will be able to quickly establish the sense of complete human absence, and at first the broken skyscrapers and the overgrown grass make you think that yes this is will make a nice backdrop for Will Smith to do his thing. But then come the zoo animals, the first of many CGI cock ups that this film will probably become famous for one day. We have deers, lions and, well, a distracting, generic looking computer-generated animal that looks like a cross between a bear and a liger.<br/><br/>Will Smith's interaction with his dog companion Sam is probably the best thing about the film, and it all happens within the first half hour or so. Will Smith does a very good job of conveying Neville's dependence on Sam for interaction and companionship, especially in an amusing scene involving Neville giving Sam a dog bath while listening to Bob Marley's 'Three Little Birds' (every little thing's gonna be alright).<br/><br/>During the first half of the film we are every now and then treated to a few emotionally charged flash backs that detail the evacuation of Manhattan and the separation of Neville from his family. A particularly touching scene involves a woman and her child frantically trying to beat the checkpoint despite the fact that she is infected.<br/><br/>The first interaction with a zombie occurs when Sam takes a detour through a dark area of town and into some building. Neville enters the building himself to rescue his friend and soon comes face to face with a horde of horrifically tame looking CGI zombies. An unflattering close-up of one the zombie's faces reveals every last computer-generated flaw, from their ridiculously fast animation frame rate to their laboured and drawn out facial expressions. Every time a zombie appears in this film you can't help but think you're playing a first-generation Xbox 360 game.<br/><br/>The final decent scene of the film has Neville hanging upside from a trap, and he and Sam have to escape from a tactical ambush that the zombies had planned out. Sam gets bitten by one of the zombie dogs while protecting his master and contracts KV, thus marking the end of a decent first half of the film.<br/><br/>Neville takes a mortally wounded Sam back to his home and holds him in his arms. A few moments of silence occurs and I thought to myself right there and then ""I bet any second now, Will Smith will start singing Three Little Birds,"" and just as if by magic Will Smith read my mind and decided to give a broken, 'emotional' performance of that very song. If you had to state an exact point in the film at which the quality suddenly took a turn for the worse, this was it. A whole scene exhibiting a cringe-worthy caricature of the relationship that carried the first portion of the film. Neville then strangles his zombie-infected dog to death, but instead of seeing this scene we are treated to a two minutes mini-film of Will Smith's gurning face.<br/><br/>More fights with zombies in the dark ensue, and then out of nowhere Neville is saved by a woman called Anna who had responded to a radio message that Will had sent out. Her plan is to reach Vermont to live in a survivor's refuge community. Anna takes Neville back to his place and makes him a Sunday morning fry up. The film's director suddenly decides to remove all of the social skills and optimism that Neville had evidentially maintained in his interactions with his dog and have him turn into an unsympathetic and hopeless loser.<br/><br/>The film's biggest 'sin' is the utterly blunt pro-Christian subtext that is introduced after Sam's death. When Neville is saved, we see his rescuer's cross necklace dangle before his eyes. Later, we see some of Neville's wounds: punctures on his wrists. Then a chat between Anna and Neville reveals that Anna believes that God sent her there and that God will save them. In the second to last scene, Neville hands Anna a gourde containing the antidote to KV that he created in his laboratory, sends her out into the world and then becomes a martyr by hurling himself into a mob of computer-generated zombies, a scene that draws allegorical parallels with Jesus in the bible sacrificing himself to save mankind. Anna's journey from Brazil through the east coast of the America's locating survivors represents the Christian preaching work, and her eventual arrival at Vermont represents the ascendancy to heaven: the first building we see behind the huge gates is a Christian church.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying that Christianity is a bad thing, or even that pro-Christian subtext in a film is a bad thing. What's bad is the fact that the subtext is so unsubtle that even Christians would take offence.

"drman321","5","32","48","15 December 2007"," If only I hadn't read the book
","This movie could have been perfectly enjoyable in its entirety if I had never read the book. As long as I live I will never understand why certain scenes which only add to the suspense and overall feel of a story, are changed or cut out entirely when a book is made into a movie. In the case of ""I am Legend"" the entire third act is changed dramatically. The end of the book offers us a bitterly introspective look at good and evil, what it means to be the good guy, the bad guy, and the last guy, and even a twisted glimmer of hope for society. It has its action moments too, there is a midnight raid on Neville's house, a close companion betrays him, he has a last stand with the vampires. It is just as action packed as any summer blockbuster. In the movie we are given a mindless orgy of explosions and overly CG'd creatures smashing things. The entire reason the title of the story is fitting is found at the end of the book. Neville realizes he is a legend to the vampire society which has sprung up from the ashes of humanity. He realizes he is a story used to frighten the vampires because he comes in the day and kills them while they sleep. In the movie we are told he is a legend because he finds a cure. The two explanations just don't stack up. I can understand when some things need to be changed to make a movie appealing to the masses or because a certain shot would be very difficult to perform while in a book it can just be written, but the things changed and cut out of ""I am Legend"" were unnecessary and took away from the quality of one of the most poignant stories in American literature. If you have not read the book, do yourself a favor and hold off until after watching the movie, you will enjoy both much more."

","Having gone out last night at 11:59pm to see this movie on its debut in my local area I was excited and positive of mind in sitting down to view it. I love end of the world disaster type movies, when they are good or interesting and was looking forward to losing myself in a well thought out fantasy world.<br/><br/>Sadly ""I Am Legend"" was so preoccupied with doing every cliché thing one could think of in this kind of movie that it missed on every count any possibility of being interesting or even tense, and instead was trite, boring, egotistical cliché, and just plain stupid.<br/><br/>I loved Will Smith in ""Enemy of the State"" which is one of my all-time favorite movies, but Will Smith has a tendency to overact and with the dumbed down corny script this movie was not even bad enough to be funny.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is only lightly explained, and that could have been an interesting plot twist, but apparently they thought the audience for this movie would be morons, so it is was all about Will Smith talking to the dog, and hanging out, trying to look like a world renowned scientist ... hahahaha. Yet he could have pulled it off with a better script and a deeper story.<br/><br/>The scenes of the empty dead city were great, but often ruined with the bad computer graphic effects which were overused and poor. Also, the bad guys, the zombies, whatever you wanted to call them were supercharged hyped up remakes of the robots in I-Robot, it was so obvious I almost laughed, and they did the most stupid things. They were not believable at all ...<br/><br/>Go see the ""Omega Man"" with Charleton Heston, that is an absorbing movie that will not turn your stomach or put you to sleep. Even ""28 Days Later"" is good, but avoid like the plague the new ""28 Months Later"". What is with Hollywood, who cares if the writers go on strike when they write garbage like this?"
"chadconnellmail","3","9","11","6 January 2008"," Disappointed
","First off, do not expect this movie to be anything like the book - it is almost nothing like the book. With that said, I can handle movies that are based off books and change some stuff around...but just not to this extreme. The book by Richard Matheson is a classic, and one of my favorites in the genre. This movie was typical blockbuster Hollywood. It gave the audience a happy ending (which the book was anything but). I found this to be unacceptable. He was supposed to be the last human on Earth! That is why it is titled ""I am Legend"". Those are his final words before he is killed in front of thousands and thousands of vampires! Now, the actual content - horrible. Is this really the best we can do with CGI now? Honestly, I felt like I was watching a movie from 10 years ago. The ""infected"" or vampires were downright stupid looking. They were the most unrealistic CGI work I have seen in the last 5 years or so. They would have been much better using real people for the infected. Very poorly done."

","This is yet another movie where scientist create or do something bad that threatens to kill all people on the planet and then somehow end up getting a pat on the back for ""saving us all"" at the end.<br/><br/>This is yet another psychopathic fantasy. How is it not psychopathic to imagine someone creating mass death beyond belief and then being regarded as a hero for ""kinda"" fixing what they caused in the end? So if I strangle a family of 10 then go around and revive them all with CPR, would I then be a hero, my crimes forgotten after that? Come on people!! <br/><br/>And why so many movies where there is an ""infection"" of rage? If writers are trying to make a point about our out of control violent society then why does the rest of the movie end up as some psychopathic fantasy about the nobility of man? <br/><br/>And of course there is also trend of every horror, thriller, suspense movie turning into some kind of religious brainwashing session. It always comes down to some ol' silly god-mess even if it doesn't even fit anywhere in the storyline. Which is just what happened in this film. It was just some random ""insert god here"" mess.<br/><br/>This movie was long and boring. How shocking. And I'm sorry, CG monsters and animals are lame. They always will be. Seemed like every shot in the movie looked the same. There is also some foolishness I'd like to point out.<br/><br/>1. How was this woman and her son REALLY able to get will smith out of that overturned car with those things around? 2. How can he beg a dummy to talk to him but then bug out when there are real people around? 3. Was this part written for Tom Hanks? 4. Why was his daughter such an annoying idiot? 5. Why do we have to see Will Smith half naked in every movie since he did Ali? 6. What were his plans for the deer he was chasing around forever? 7. How did that woman get to Vermont? 8. Why didn't he just shoot the aggressive thing in the head, then chuck the grenade through the hole for the rest of them, and jump in the oven thing real quick? <br/><br/>Whatever."
"fuzzhead72","3","50","79","21 December 2007"," very disappointing
","I must admit that I was looking forward to this movie, since I had read the book about 6 months ago, before I even knew about the upcoming movie. As such, I probably had high expectations.<br/><br/>I was especially interested in seeing it since it was: A) one of the few books where the main character dies in the end, and B) one of the few times where the entire human race is destroyed at the end of the story. In the book version, humanity is completely wiped out, and a new race of mutant vampires takes humanity's place in the world.<br/><br/>Not much of that is present in the movie. Oh, sure, there are zombie mutants. Yes, they come out at night. However, it is only alluded to that they could be becoming more resistant to light - that aspect of the movie is not explored, as it is in the book.<br/><br/>One of the main plot points they left out of the movie was the fact that one of Neville's co-workers had become infected, returned from the dead, or what have you - in other words, he was a vampire. Every night, he would come out of hiding and scream Neville's name, trying to get him to come out. It was obvious that his co-worker remembered some things about Neville and their life together. This whole aspect was ignored in the film.<br/><br/>Another main point of the book was where the vampires used drugs to make one of their woman look more like a regular human, and sent her in to spy on Neville. This was one of the scariest parts of the book to me, when he realized she wasn't human, but he had trusted her, and let her into his life.<br/><br/>Finally, the worst part of the film was how they twisted the meaning of the book. In the book, the vampires finally capture Neville, and sentence him to death. He doesn't give them the satisfaction, opting to take some poison pills and commit suicide instead. However, before he dies, he learns that he will always be the stuff of legend to the new race of mutant vampires - he will always be remembered as the awful ""last man"", in stories told to children - about how he came in the day while people slept, and killed entire families of vampires.<br/><br/>The twisted ending of the movie, where he manages to find a cure and save humanity, almost seems like they changed the ending after shooting one more like the book. It's probably a change forced by the studio heads, in order to make the ending more acceptable to the everyday person. Instead, a bunch of people stood up and laughed at the ending in the theater where I was watching it. I really can't recommend this movie to anyone who has read the original book. In fact, I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends or relatives, either. The movie doesn't really get what the book was trying to relate."

","I am Legend stars Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville, a military virologist living in New York City in 2012, who is the last known survivor of a worldwide viral epidemic called KV that has infected or killed nearly all of earth's population. KV, originally developed as a cure for cancer, caused severe side effects in test patients which resulted in mutations as well as physiological and biological changes in the human body structure. Humans infected with KV have become nonsensical, irrational, and bloodthirsty nocturnal monsters that will hunt, mutilate, and devour any living thing that is not also infected. KV proved to be highly contagious and became airborne at its epicenter in New York City. For some reason, Neville is one of the small percent of humans which is immune to KV and this allows him to traverse the empty streets and buildings of NYC without worrying about contracting the disease. <br/><br/>The film focuses heavily on Neville's methods of survival and his noticeably deteriorating psyche. When he is not preoccupied with seeking basic necessities, Neville works in his basement lab attempting to develop a vaccine for the disease. Will Smith does a superb job of portraying Neville's solitary character, who everyday is searching for solutions to the problems in his future as well as the future of mankind. Smith's acting is the highlight of the film and is really the driving force that could have actually made this film legendary.<br/><br/>Now for the bad stuff.<br/><br/>I am Legend is severely hindered by its sub-par screenplay. The first 1/3 to 1/2 of the film is a joy to watch, but suddenly holes and diversions become extremely visible. <br/><br/>The climax of the film is very rushed and the ending was typical clichéd nonsense. Pointless religious and philosophical overtones and dialogue are added to try and create a moral- based story, but just turn into fodder that is annoying to have to listen to. Certain important questions are never even answered like why certain people like Neville are immune or why KV drives its victims insane. Finally, the infected humans look more like sci-fi monsters than actual mutated and deranged beings and are not present nearly enough until the end of the film.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 5/10. Pretty much only worth seeing for the first half of the film and for Willy's powerhouse acting. Such a shame really. The post-apocalyptic genre is very interesting to me and I love films like 28 Days Later, Mad Max, or Escape from New York, but Legend's poor narrative pulls it down."

","Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way - Will Smith is excellent, as usual. The scenes of an abandoned New York are amazing, in much the same way as the shots of a deserted London in 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Now on to the disappointing stuff - the CGI work throughout the film is terrible. 14 years after Jurassic Park, and this is seriously the best they could do? I could live with the CGI animals, but the CGI 'infected' are just beyond belief. They all look the same, they all behave in ways that are clearly opposed to the laws of physics, and they all look as though they've stepped out of a cartoon or a computer game.<br/><br/>It's hard to overstate just how unconvincing the CGI work is; about half-way through the film stops being 'real' and turns into an absurd mix of the real world and sub-par animation. It's more 'Mary Poppins' than '28 Days Later'.<br/><br/>Real people with prosthetics would have made a much greater impact, and may have added some genuine thrills into what is otherwise a fairly dull film.<br/><br/>The ending - and I won't use any spoilers - is very weak. Ultimately, 'I Am Legend' is a wasted opportunity; worth watching, but only just."
"Theo Robertson","4","16","22","21 March 2009"," Clumsy Adaptation Of An Unfilmable Novel
","The problem with filming Matheson's I AM LEGEND is that the original novel is so difficult to adapt for the silver screen . The novel deals with the last man alive - Neville - who is surrounded by vampires . There's little spoken dialogue and perhaps most problamatic of all is the fact that Neville is effectively the villain meaning that a cinema audience have to identify and empathise with a bad guy maliciously killing benign vampires . Obviously this is a step too far for a mainstream audience so any film producer filming this story needs to make Neville a good guy thereby destroying Matheson's original concept . I suppose movie studio's can justify themselves by the need to make a profit at the box office but there's other flaws that are impossible to tackle <br/><br/>First of all there's the lack of dialogue . Respected reviewers on this site including Bob The Moo have praised the first half of the movie with the isolation of Neville's lonely life as he drives through an empty New York but a story needs character interaction and a protagonist needs someone to talk to and the dialogue light , slow deliberate pace becomes very boring after a while and it's not helped by the lack of a soundtrack . Danny Boyle was much more effective with his dead London scenes in 28 DAY LATER <br/><br/>There is a character for Neville to talk to but it's not actually a human character - it's a dog . You know as soon as the dog is introduced it won't be seeing the end credits and so lack lustre screenwriter Akiva Goldsman mawkishly manipulates the audience in to feeling sorry for Fido when he becomes infected and has to be killed . It's so predictable certain audience members will have to stifle a yawn rather than reach for a tissue to dry their eyes<br/><br/>Even those people who have praised the first half have criticised the second half where we have characters who are introduced out of the blue . There's a lack of logic to this . The characters are aware that there's a sanctuary somewhere so why didn't these characters make a beeline for the sanctuary instead of sitting around hoping to get a radio message from Neville ? You'd think they were clairvoyants , either that or Goldsman is a rather insipid screenwriter <br/><br/>The other problem of the second half is when the infected/mutants/vampires are introduced . There is not one scene as far as I recall where the infected are never anything more than laughably bad CGI effects . It's ridiculous that this film supposedly cost $150 million and the director couldn't employ a few dozen extras in make up . Really if was a "" walk on artiste "" I would be angry about the use of CGI seen here <br/><br/>I AM LEGEND is a near impossible story to adapt but the producers should have at least tried to focus on what type of audience the film was produced for . It's not really a film does the book justice , nor is it one that will really appeal to fans of the post apocalyptic genre . There's also a distinct lack of action and tension and dare I say much entertainment . Despite its many flaws THE OMEGA MAN is a very entertaining movie and much superior to this remake"

","I think this is probably the worst film of 2007 (obviously I haven't seen them all but with source material like this it would hard to be beaten). It's so completely depressing that there still hasn't been an authentic realisation of an absolutely classic book. It's only 160 pages long! How hard can that be to put on film in two and a half hours. The book is full of imagery and about a million different ideas that could be told brilliantly on film with a little bit of thought, a considerably smaller budget and a decent screenwriter. The worst thing about rubbish like this is that now no one will be able to raise the money to take the source material and make something mind blowing with it. The whole thing leaves me feeling like I've opened a Christmas present, it's a puppy.....and it's dead."
"zillabob","10","189","333","14 December 2007"," Beyond The Omega Man...(***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***)
","Years ago, THE OMEGA MAN scared the bejeezus out of me, then again, I was young and even seeing somewhat dated visions of an empty world and rather badly done shots of people collapsing from a viral attack, still scared me. I AM LEGEND, which is the third movie based on the Matheson book, I Am Legend, really is scary for the here and now and thanks to some inventive photography and CG effects, we see a grim but fascinating vision of a completely abandoned New York City from the get-go. A well intentioned virologist Dr Krippen(played uncredited by Emma Thompson) in a news clip as the film's opening production tags play, shows a quick ""human interest"" story as a TV host talks innocently(and somewhat disbelievingly) with her, about her success with ""curing cancer with a genetically engineered 'friendly' Measles virus"" and that this was administered to over 10,000 cancer patients who are now ""Cancer free"". Cut to three years later and a dead, overgrown NYC with Will Smith speeding around it in a new Mustang(In THE OMEGA MAN, Chuck Heston sped around LA in a new 1972 Mustang, one of the film's many homages to it's predecessor) we see the extent of Krippen's horrible mistake to mess with and trust the nature of viruses-which can do mutate without prediction. Will Smith is Robert Neville, military virologist who witnessed the end of mankind-he's watching a tape of news as the illness begins to mutate and media is becoming alarmed. Krippen's Virus had a bizarre side effect-it mutated and became a contagious, airborne rabies-like illness that either kills outright or drives it's victims to become rage-filled, blood/fluid drinking mutants who hide in the shadows and only come out at night. (In THE OMEGA MAN it turned them into psychotic hippies called ""The Family"" styled after Charles Manson who was still hot news at the time-films are products of their own time) The virus spread very fast as we see in quick flashbacks(Omega Man was told in several flashbacks as effective). Mannequins play a role in THE OMEGA MAN, and they do in I AM LEGEND.<br/><br/>It is Smith's amazing acting talent that holds one riveted. It did me. The ""mutants"" are styled after the running infected in 28 DAYS LATER the only difference-and the film's drawback-is that too much CGI is used here and we're now so used to seeing CG in movies, that it appears that is what it is. In 28 DAYS LATER and it's sequel 28 WEEKS LATER, dancers were used as the running, screaming rage infected victims to much better effect. The CG FX shine in the visions of a ruined NYC, with grass and weeds everywhere, wildlife roaming, and destroyed bridges thanks to the military quarantine of the city. Obviously, it did little good as we overhear in a flashback, the President saying that ""every major world city has taken the same action"". Smith reminds us later, in dialog, ""nothing was supposed to happen the way it did"" It's a frightening vision, and I think the point being made was if, in reality, the Bird Flu hit and became easy to transmit, such scenes of sheer pandemonium, in larger cities would not be so much fiction. It's a terrific film."

Not of course to mention the beguining part with will smith driving a fast car in the street of new york. If you compare this movie with some movies of the same kind such as 28 days later you have on one side the perfectly clean and religious American version of a biological apocalypse and on the other side the good stuff. This is sad. This movie could have been so much better. There is missing plots and unfortunately will smith is not the kind of actor that can support that kind of movie.

","""I am Legend"" is one of the most depressing movies ever made. I'm torn between reviews. Part of me wants to give a RICE CAKE review, and another part of me wants to give it a BIRTHDAY CAKE review.<br/><br/>Why? You may ask, is ""I am Legend"" depressing? Well, funny you should ask. I'll tell you why. Because ""I am Legend"" could have been one of the most entertaining, most fun Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movies to come along since ""Batman Begins"". <br/><br/>It could have been great. I might have adored the movie. But it wasn't, and I didn't, because of one simple thing- an acronym- three insignificant letters separately, but together they are: C.G.I.; which means- Computer Generated Image.<br/><br/>Will Smith is wonderful. His depiction of loneliness scratching the very fabric of madness, his love, and fear for his only friend, his dog Samantha, his realism and believability, were palpable. The scenes of desolation were good. The fright was well done. The whole movie was fabulous; up until the point some dunderhead (I put the blame directly on the director's shoulders) decided to make the monsters (in the book they're vampires, in the movie they're infected humans) C.-FREAKIN'-G.I.! <br/><br/>Now, not only did the director take the cheap, easy, lazy way out, but he seemed to have employed the worst effects shop in the history of all movie making. I mean, the monsters may as well have been Scooby and Scrappy Doo they looked so Damn ""cartoony"". All the realism that had been adroitly built up in the first half of the movie, all the terror, danger, and tension, had been instantly destroyed when these bumbling cartoon creatures stepped into frame.<br/><br/>I think back on some of my favorite movies; movies like ""Blade Runner"", ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", ""The Thing""; think back on how incredible those films were, and still are. Imagine ""Aliens"" if it had been done today. I guarantee they would make the Queen a bloody C.G.I. monster, and movie history would never have such a wonderfully crafted, beautiful really, Alien Queen. I will never understand how a director can make such a monumentally stupid decision, as Francis Lawrence did in ""I am Legend"", and make his human monsters C.G.I. For Christ's sake, they're infected humans! Not dragons or dinosaurs the size of a 747! Prosthetic's, and monster making, are better than they ever have been; just look at the two ""Under World"" movies, ""Hell Boy"", all the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies.<br/><br/>For shame, Francis Lawrence. You could have had a film that would be a timeless testament to your artistry and craft. Instead, you come off as a cheap hack.<br/><br/>""I am Legend"" gets my worst review, a RICE CAKE review.

But instead I saw a sad and quit frightening twist on, what may be, our future. I watched it when I was 13 years old, which might have been a mistake. There were some extremely frighting and sad scenes in the movie which might not be for everybody. At a point in the movie, when Robert Neville (Will Smith) was in a dark building looking for his dog, Sam, I was shaking from fear, not only for him, but for Sam. I decided to drop a star due to Sam (the dog) dying halfway in, which put me in major tears. I will definitely never forget this movie."

THE END OF THE FILM is a joke. The butterfly lady with her son get into fireplace metal door and she clearly say there is enough room for him. Mean while the Zombies are smashing at the window. He could of very simply got the frag grenade that he so idiotically martyred himself with, and hid with his body in the fireplace with his head and arm out and thrown it the moment they broke through and quickly got inside and survived. So many other stupid little thing annoyed me like the dogs and the main zombie holding them and stopping when they reach a 2 foot wide sun-ray and will smith getting bit in the neck and the end and thrown against walls, downstairs etc. and nothing happens to him. the only thing that made this movie bearable was the BOB MARLEY music."

But this movie was terrible on so many levels I couldn't help but put pen to paper! Nothing wrong with the premise - great concept but that is where it ends.<br/><br/>So what was the main problem - well first thing  Will Smith  he isn't a great actor but normally you can rely on him to bring an element of warmth and humor to a role  somehow the director managed to make him incredibly bland  in fact I would be hard pressed to think of a role where he has been less engaging.<br/><br/>Second  he was a military man  it was bad enough that he didn't actually go out and try and purge the area during the daylight hours of infected/vampire/zombie 'whatevers' but he couldn't even manage to successfully hunt down a deer (or were they antelope  the CGI was so bad it was hard to tell!) We are supposed to believe this genius is going to save the human race!? <br/><br/>Thirdly  again coming back to the questionable IQ of the character  all of Manhattan and he couldn't find a place that could keep the infected out at night!? Which brings us to the fourth complaint  apparently these ""infected"" where devoid of ""any human tendencies"" - strange really as they where not only smart enough to set a trap that caught the genius but also managed to show structure and leadership in their assaults  in particular taking out UV lights.<br/><br/>What was good about the film  the dog was great. Unfortunately however the antidote which worked on rats  and ultimately humans simply didn't work on dogs!? <br/><br/>Finally  the most unrealistic moment in the movie  after 3 years on his own he walks into the kitchen and finds an attractive South American cooking his breakfast  he ends up spitting the dummy because she has used his bacon!?

And, in the end, the heavenly Jerusalem where the survivors find refuge, of course looks remarkably like a 19th-century Amish village - with a picturesque wooden chapel in the middle and surrounded by a concrete wall like the one which the Israelis built to confine the Palestinians. So, this is what the future looks like, according to the makers of this film?!?<br/><br/>It's such a pity!<br/><br/>Additional flaws: The opening is the most pathetic, most overdone product-placement sequence in recent years. And, finally, the man-eating human mutants - pathetic, once again. Having superhuman physical power, but unable to talk, their only feature is their constant, unarticulated yells at the audience. What's the point, there?!?<br/><br/>A total disgrace, altogether."

","Whenever a book is adapted into a film, there is some dread. Some deviations from the source material are unavoidable, but clever scripting and a good cast can, in some instances, still make a good film. This is not one of those instances.<br/><br/>The charmingly blue-collar Robert Neville is gone, replaced with soldier/scientist Will Smith. The virus, rather than creating vampires, apparently turns people into poorly-textured CGI abominations. Gone even is the nightly terror of having the vampires standing about on his lawn, taunting him. Despite being able to smell blood from a great distance off and move like only modern CGI monsters can, the vampires ""don't know where he lives"". As a matter of fact, the only holdovers from the book are the name of the character and the idea of a virus turning people into something. It is, in that sense, very similar to the ""work"" the director did on ""Constantine (2005)"".<br/><br/>Now, you may wonder if the film is worthwhile if you haven't read the book, and thus have nothing for it to spoil. The answer is ... still a resounding no. If you haven't read the book, this film will simply insult your intelligence and waste your time rather than insulting your intelligence, wasting your time, and butchering a great read.<br/><br/>There isn't enough time or prose to explain all the reasons why the movie-going public shouldn't pay to see this utter dreck. I implore you to skip it, for the sake of your mind and well-being. This film may, indeed, become a legend, but only in the sense that a great many people paid a shocking amount of money to see something so indescribably wretched."

","I was sadly disappointed by this movie. Back when I first heard about it, I picked up the book since it sounded interesting. It was immediately a favorite, but the movie was a travesty.<br/><br/>It seemed to have hope for the first half. I can deal with minor story variations, but by the end of the movie, they have completely changed the ending so as to destroy the entire build-up/meaning behind the title. Sure, they try to tie it in, but it's ultimately not satisfying. The sad part is that I could really see it succeeding if they had not strayed so far. I thought Will Smith gave a great performance, and they did an excellent job building the atmosphere of the film. If you have not read the book, you may be able to enjoy it. But if you have read the book, I would go so far as to say don't even bother, because it is so loosely ""based on"" the book that they should not have even used the title.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book and do see it, I highly suggest reading the book! It's great. My hope is that the movie may at least spur some to pick up the book, in which case they're in for a treat."
"petra_ste","5","10","13","11 May 2008"," Legend, he ain't
","First Asimov's I, Robot, now Matheson's I Am Legend; one has to wonder which sci-fi classic scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman will desecrate next, turning it into a lowbrow action movie starring Will Smith. Stranger in a Strange Land? Ubik? The new Fahrenheit 451 adaptation? *shudder* <br/><br/>The way I Am Legend follows only the bare-bone premise of the book, leveling every finer detail to the lowest common denominator, feels actually quite disturbing - a nasty middle finger shown to the audience (and to Matheson), the equivalent of saying ""you don't deserve anything deeper"".<br/><br/>Last human survivor of vampire/zombie apocalypse Neville (Will Smith) has been turned from resourceful everyman into a superscientist/action hero (a ridiculous character if ever there was one); his canine companion goes from miserable beggar to highly trained German shepherd; most disappointingly, the creatures crawling out at night are all simply evil monsters (and very poor CGI monsters), erasing any moral ambiguity. The whole point of the novel is lost: the very phrase ""I am legend"" implied that Neville had become the anomaly, the monster; in the movie, the title is reinterpreted with a dumb ""I am the man!"" meaning. Originally the ending was different (not identical to the book's, but at least thematically consistent with it) but it was received poorly by test audiences. Just sad.<br/><br/>Regardless of its value as adaptation, does the movie work as sci-fi/action entertainment? Well, the premise is ripe with potential, but the result is lightweight. One example can clarify this. There is a cool (in theory) scene in which Neville falls into a trap prepared by the monsters - never mind they had been described and portrayed as mindless morons: the script doesn't have clear ideas about their nature - dusk is approaching and three infected dogs are lurking in the darkness, ready to attack. The scene should be edge-of-your-seat stuff. However, since Goldsman has no clue of how to develop this material and director Francis Lawrence no idea of how to film it, it's simply another mildly suspenseful, ""there goes my doggy, let's shoot the baddie"" action scene, doing the absolute minimum with a solid concept - a description which fits the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Smith gives a charismatic performance; however, he was probably not the best choice to play Neville. Smith's greatest asset as a star is the easy chemistry he develops with his fellows actors - trouble is, here his fellows actors are a dog and some mannequins. Smith is not a very introspective thespian (unlike, say, Denzel Washington), so casting him as the last man of Earth (kind of) was a rather poor idea.<br/><br/>Since Goldsman is also responsible for the assassination of Asimov's works, Batman & Robin and The Da Vinci Code, while Lawrence's pedigree includes some Britney Spears videos and Constantine, it would probably be a good idea to lock them together in a high security prison to prevent them from making other movies; and, for all I care, after Men in Black 2, The Pursuit of Happiness and I Robot, Will Smith can join them.<br/><br/>So, who's the next revered sci-fi author to murder? Bradbury? Dick? Fredric Brown? Time will tell.<br/><br/>Rating: As an ""independent"" movie: 5,5/10 <br/><br/>As an adaptation of Matheson's novel: 3/10"

","An absolute waste of time. This film is slow. It has a stupid story and a spoiled main character who's redemption comes from his finding a cure for the disease he created that killed most of the planet. For a character who should be tortured for killing off the rest of humanity, he seems to be having a good time. Way to go. Smith gives a dry performance that is unconvincing and not endearing in any way. His dog costar outshines him in every scene. The film makes up for its slow pacing by blasting its raised sound effects to highlight supposed scenes of surprise and ""horror"". A very cheap trick for a very bad film.

"the-goop","2","22","33","18 December 2007"," Soared High, But Fell Hard
","The brief response: This movie soared very high, but just as everything that rises must fall, so did this film's story. And when it fell, baby, it fell hard.<br/><br/>The abundantly lengthy response: I Am Legend. At the end of Richard Matheson's novel, these were the words that send chills running along the back of your neck, and made you break out in goosebumps. Because these were the words of the last human being on the face of the earth, a remnant of a much older, and much more familiar age.<br/><br/>Sadly, these words do not have the same effect upon the film's audience that it does with those who have read the book. In fact, those three words, which simply define the movie and it's rather morbid sense of humor perfectly, make absolutely no sense in the film adaption. Or, at least, the only sense they make is unbelievably trite and cliché. Because in Matheson's I Am Legend, Robert Neville is a legend amongst the last living (or otherwise) inheritors of the earth; vampires. The entire story revolves around this fact, of the earth passing from one set of hands to the next, with Robert being eventually one of the casualties of the age, and being blessed (or cursed) with the ability to watch the transition with his own eyes. Essentially, if you do not have at least this one fact, you do not have I Am Legend.<br/><br/>Which is why I would have been happier if the film's crew had simply changed some minor facts, shamelessly stealing the story's plot devices of course, under a different, less recognizable name. Essentially, a remake of Omega Man.<br/><br/>When this movie began, I was extremely hopeful. Of course, there were small changes. Making his companion the dog fated to starvation in the novel gave Smith more to work with for Neville's characterization, and to portray his slow spiral into insanity and back again with more brevity. Changing the main character from a factory-worker-turned-scientist into a soldier-turned-scientist was not a terribly big deal either, and in my opinion helped to lend slightly more credibility to the fact he cured the ""incurable"" virus in three years. Which brings me to the virus itself, which I found very interesting. Though the vampires themselves were dreadfully done in the movie, the idea behind the virus being a cure for cancer was very clever, though given the choice between Matheson's genuinely fresh and interesting vampires and the film's recycled ""viral zombie"" horde, I would stick strictly to the literature.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending. This was were I found myself the most in disagreement with. Because up until the film's ending, I was still hopeful. Yes, serious changes had been made, but I had still believed that the film's link to the novel could be maintained, and still produce a quality film to boot. Unfortunately, my hopes were shattered. I will admit though, they had me fooled for quite some time. I had believed that the two sole survivors (only the woman, in the novel) would prove to be the spies cleverly sent in by the more intelligent vampires to take Neville, as it was in the book. I was surprised to find that this was not the case; indeed, many hints had been let that she was not entirely truthful about where she had come from, and her distinct lack of knowledge with popular culture led me to believe that the movie would try to remain as close to the book as possible, while still maintaining a blockbuster status. It was to my displeasure, and shock, to find that the film's script completely coped out, with a half assed ending and a cliché message, in which the entire focus of the movie is lost to the film trying desperately to patch up the metaphorical holes it rent into the story. The final spoken words in the film are what proved to me that there must have been some kind of dispute which led to this final outcome. Because up until a certain point, I believe the movie was still salvageable. But I am led to believe that a certain person, or group, got involved and turned this gripping and compelling story straight out of the sky, and into the ground. It's a pity, I had hoped that the story would get a better treatment. Oh well, maybe they'll get it right with the next book to movie adaptation.<br/><br/>I highly doubt it though."

","First of all, I have to say that I was so excited to see this movie. The previews for it kept everyone guessing, and made people wonder ""what in the world is this movie about?"". If I would have known it was just another zombie movie, I would have saved myself the time and money. I have lost over 2 hours of my life to watch this awful, horrible movie. We did not get attached to Will Smith's wife or daughter, but yet they kept showing pictures of them, like we were supposed to feel sorry for him. WE ONLY SEE THEM FOR A TOTAL OF ABOUT 2 MINUTES!!! The best part of the movie was when he was quoting Shrek. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! For a movie with basically only one character, there was no character development at all! I went to this movie with 7 other people, and we all hated it. If you do go to see this movie, please do not have high expectations. They will not be met."
"AboundInGoodness","1","19","28","29 December 2007"," This movie sucked!
","This movie sucked! Halfway through the movie, I'm like is this crap over with yet? Well, there wasn't much dialogue to begin with. Smith mainly talked to his dog and some mannequins.<br/><br/>I guess I just had a hard time believing the whole story line...that a virus kills most of humanity. Some, like Will Smith's character, are immune to the virus. Then the rest are changed into ""rabid"" superhumans with no hair and can't live in sunlight.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie has Will Smith hunting deer, doing his other daily routines, chatting with his dog and mannequins, etc. Another poor writing tactic is that Will Smith chases after his dog into a dark building where he knows there are going to be these ""rabid"" superhumans. I'm like nobody is going to be chasing their dog into that building. And I don't care if it is his only friend in the world! The ending was pretty lame also."
"Ozzy2000","1","8","10","6 July 2008"," I am Lame
","This should be renamed ""I am Lemon"" as it is just another really stupid Zombie movie. Will Smith plays the main character, Robert Neville, and is supposed to be one of the few surviving humans who happens to be a Military Scientist. One assumes he is naturally immune but then he takes a blood sample from an almost cured zombie as a last salvation for the human race to use to save itself. It does not medically or scientifically make any sense. Neville discovery that he is not the last human survivor of the earth's population six billion when another survivor saves him is the most pathetic part of the film. His behavior is at this stage is juvenile inarticulate and mentally challenged and sinks to its lowest point when he attempts to sum up human civilization with a Bob Marley Album.<br/><br/>The alpha Zombie like the one in ""Resident Evil: extinction"" bears amazing resemblance to Midnight Oil's Pete Garret and appears to be as Manic. The aggressive Zombie dogs are also taken from the first Resident Evil. If you are into the usual gory scenes of human flesh eating frenzies and screaming zombies and the usual scenes of major cities evacuated and dead then see this one for your entertainment.<br/><br/>I have given this one star for the performance by the German shepherd, ""Sam"" , that lifted the dull acting of the other characters.I now know who played Sam in""I am Lemon"" it was Abby and Will Smith try to buy the dog when he finished the film but great actors are not for sale so Will will just have to go to Drama school.<br/><br/>As for all the other reviewers who thought this was a great movie you must all be as thick as a brick or have really simple minds.<br/><br/>Finally I think that Abby should win an Oscar for acting since he will be against Russel ""flabby two expressions"" Crowe."
"Jetset971","3","8","10","22 April 2008"," Doesn't even come close to OMEGA MAN!
","Folks, I have to be honest with you. I was so looking forward to seeing this remake, that its all I thought about for weeks. I figured Will Smith was a good choice and what wonderful things they could do with todays cinematic technology. Being a huge fan of the 1971 classic ""The Omega Man"", a far superior concept, I was really anxious to see what they could come up with. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Now I know some people will say that this movie was not meant to be a carbon copy of Omega, and that I am judging it based on a unfair criteria. My response is this, if you try to remake a classic and you fail miserably, you desevere all the razzing you get. Being as specific as possible, here are my main complaints.<br/><br/>1. VERY POOR SGI. I have to say that the SGI in this movie was not in the least bit convincing. The plague victims looked like cheaply made Zombies that were scraped from a cheesy rendition of House of the dead. Even the freaking animals, that became infected, were crudely done. <br/><br/>2. LAME Villains. There is an old saying, ""A movie is only as good as it's Villain."", And in this movie the villains are boring as hell. One dimensional blood thirsty mutants that look like rejects from the Curly Stooge fan club, running around trying to suck Nevelles blood when all they actually do is just suck. Remember Omega Man? Yes the mutants were dressed in black robes and had heavy white makeup on and white contact lences but compared to this movie it looked far more real. Furthermore, in Omega Man, the mutants actually TALKED! Yeah, they were homicidal savages but they had character! With names like Mathias, Zachery, and so forth! Mathias and his ""Family"" may have been completely crazy but at least they could dialoge with nevelle. I really hated they way they went with the mutants in this remake.<br/><br/>3. Social Commentary. Very weak social Commentary in this remake. Will smith does a fair job with what little he's given here. In the Omega Man, The first half of the movie superbly shows the desolation and melencoly that has come over society as Charlton Heston drives aimlessly through the deserted streets and buildings looking at whats left of mans legacy. But here, The scripts doesn't go nearly far enough, I never felt the same poinentcy that Omega man displayed. Backpeddling a little, maybe if some interesting villains were added like in Omega Man, You could feel more meaning into what has been lost in this world and what remains. Let me give an example, In Omega man, When the mutants first capture nevelle, he says to them that he is a scientist, Despite being a homicidal maniac, the head mutant Mathias answers, ""Definition of a scientist, a Man that understood nothing, till there was nothing left to understand!"" Sheer brilliance. In I Am Legend The best dialoge the mutants can muster is ""Grr, snarl, Rahhh,"".<br/><br/>3. Slaped together ending. This is my biggest complaint. And to be fair I thought Omega Man suffered a LITTLE bit of this too. However, I am Legend is much worse off. After two thirds of this movies Lame villains and their CGI, and lame social commentary, we finally Meet the uninfected survivors like in Omega Man. Unlike in Omega Man, They zip in and out giving us no time to really get to know them or care about them. You know nevelle has got to sacrifice himself for them but its done so hastely that you feel like the movies saying ""Hurry up and die already, I am running out film"". I know that had to rap it up sometime but jeez in Omega Man You got to get to know the human survivors a lot better and felt a lot more sympathy than in this shoddy remake. <br/><br/>All in all, for reasons I have already stated, this remake was at worst a traviesty and at best extremely mediocre. My advise to anyone about to see this movie, do yourself a favor, rent The Omega Man watch it and then watch this movie. You will see that everything I have stated is a fact. One last comment, After seeing this movie I walked out of the theatre and was reminded of the final words of Mathias in omega Man, ""The Bad Dream is over...Now we must sleep""! AMEN!!!! Oh I almost forgot to metion the Black and white version with vicent price...Well, let me sum it up quick. Not as good as Omega Man, but unlike I am Legend, not meant to be campy and cheesy!"

","This movie does not measure up to the nuances of the book. And some parts of the narrative are inconsistent and weird... And of course, they changed the ending completely, and erased the entire point of the book...<br/><br/>Inconsistencies: 1) how did the woman that rescued him on the docks stay there all night and remain safe? 2) Where did she even come from? And how did she travel? How did she find out about the survivor colony, and not Will Smith? 3) Will Smith barricaded his house with impressive steel doors and bars... But the zombies broke in in about two seconds! 4) What's the deal with the boss zombie??? How did he retain his intelligence? 5) Why is the city totally clean and organized? Wouldn't you expect like total chaos and bodies everywhere when 8 million people die of a horrible disease and/or get eaten by zombies? Instead, it was like Disneyland at 2 AM.<br/><br/>All told, it was a fancy Hollywood production without any depth. And I thought Will Smith's acting was rather sub-par as well. His character was rather unbelievable and surreal. In fact, I liked the dog better than him.<br/><br/>My final pronouncement: Horrible and not worth paying 10 bucks for."

","I was really looking forward to this one, the review in the newspaper was good, and the trailer was promising. Did the hype do it justice? I don't think it did. I must say that the movie started out quite nice. What would you do if you were alone on this planet? Probably drive every car you liked, fast, driving 100 in the city, whoa. So this part of the movie was OK. Then the next scene. He was hunting deer in New York, from his car doing 100. But why? Well, he was hunting for food! Excuse me? Hunting for food? Never heard of canned food? Maybe he wanted some fresh meat? Then not why pick them off from a window, much much easier... Anyway, so far so good. The reason why he would be the only one left in the world was understandable too. A mutation in a virus who supposed to help human kind by curing cancer, killed everybody. Nice touch. If they would have used flashbacks on how things evolved from the start of the cure to the discovering of the mutation and see the effect of it on humans, would have made this a great movie. Instead we see Dr. Neville fight Zombies and trying to find a cure for the virus. Besides that, there were some strange things what confused me... 1. Dr. Neville opens the door of a movie rental shop with keys and brings back a rented movie, and looks for another... Why is the store locked, and why does he brings back rentals? 2. He is only alone for 3 years, and is already getting mad. 3. Most of the rooms he enters have no dust at all, or spiderwebs, most of them are tidy. How come? 4. There are no bodies at all, are they all eaten by the zombies? 5. At a certain point they are no longer stupid zombies, and they even have a leader who hates Dr. Neville. They are even no longer afraid of the light. It is never explained how that is possible. 6. When he is trying to kill off the zombies, why is he not using a tank? 7. He is hoping to find out if he is not the only one left on this planet by broadcasting messages every day. And when a lady with her kid shows up, he is not happy or in ecstasy, no he criticizes her for using his bacon. 8. How did that lady get in the city? How did she get out? And if she managed to do it, why didn't Dr. Neville did earlier? 9. Why is this movie so hyped? 10. Why did I watch this movie 'till the end? Do yourself a favor, and wait until you can rent the DVD. Then watch the first 20 minutes, and skip the rest. The only reason I gave this movie 4 points was because Will Smith was in it."

Overall, this movie delivers great action sequences and a great story, along with a shocking ending. Will Smith's performance is outstanding and makes a great Robert Neville. There are a lot of sequences in the film that are disturbing but along with that, takes you to the edge of your seat! I would have to say that this is one of the best films out this year. It's nice to see an original, amazing movie released before the end of the year. You don't really get a lot of those these days in general.

Oh dear, oh dear... What happened to the mosquitoes in the book I wonder? We are told that Will Smith's character can't get infected but that his dog (the only other character) can. No surprise then what happens in the next scene.<br/><br/>There is no satisfactory explanation of why he should go off on one with the Darkseekers on the pier.<br/><br/>Whatever was that weird part about Bob Marley for? Did Will Smitth insist on adding this? Everybody knows who Bob Marley is. But to have heard of Damian and not Bob is just bizarre. The quote about the need not to take a day off is kind of relevant, in a cheesy way, but basically, the rest is pants.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Get the other versions Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth instead."

"careercollegestudent","6","25","39","16 December 2007"," Decent look, but a C+
","An excellent movie, if you're a kid! It's even an excellent movie if you're an adult, especially a logical thinking adult, for fantasy to recollect when you were a kid.<br/><br/>This movie starts out great, and stays fairly decent especially with the stunning and gripping visual effects supporting the lags in common sense, and even though the logical and bibliographical explanations become apparent and try to ruin it if you let them. What it is, is a great watch for the seven dollars (fourteen for my wife and I) if you have nothing better to do.<br/><br/>I like Will Smith, especially for the physical portions he played in this movie. But, he does not have the portrayal characteristics of a Lt. Colonel, and especially a brilliant virologist. Samuel Jackson, or better yet Morgan Freeman however, 20 years younger and looking like they do today, would fit the bill so much better for this movie. Unfortunately, they picked Will.<br/><br/>The movie starts out as a typical viral Armageddon, and progressing with relapses from Will's dreams before the end of the world of what happened and what is happening three years later as the only survivor in New York City. He and his dog Sam (Samantha) hunt by day apparently for food by the run of deer and foliage that now inhabit vacant NYC. Obviously later on, this if for fun and to kill time, because of the solitude and boredom from being the only survivor in the city filled with enough canned food to supply a small army for life.<br/><br/>But it progresses into the typical stereotypical movie theme of ""He is not alone."" He hides at night with his dog in his highly renovated house from the survivors that did not die from the virus, but were mutated into flesh eating steroid enhanced super zombies. These zombies have a vampire weakness of the sun, hence all ultraviolet rays, and manifest in their darkened hives during the day. So Will is forced to reinforce his house with inside sliding guards, ultraviolet spotlights, and high explosives in case they find out where he lives. In his other time spent, he tries to find a cure for the virus for potential infected survivor if any, as well as the mutant zombies in his downstairs high tech lab.<br/><br/>His house is also equipped with generators to run the flood of electricity and electronics, as well as his basements high tech lab that I am sure the military did not supply him to play with before the viral storm. <br/><br/>One of the biggest Faux pas in the movie is where he explains the zombies are of non human nature and simply barbaric flesh eaters trying to survive. But, they trick him with an elaborate engineering and psychological ruse, along with the only communication from them with each other is only being able to shriek and howl, his physical nighttime address when a few zombies discover it. They also have their own leader zombie, and zombie attack dogs that they sic on Will and his dog, but they have no real agenda but to destroy and eat fresh meat.<br/><br/>The movie also has a few other clichés that ruin its chances to stand the test of time. Like the stereotypical heart wrench when his dog gets killed, the survivor that shows up and is the prophet to God's plan, when the heroine realizes he has been ignorant to that fact, and when she makes it to the survivors colony in what I believe was the hills of New Hampshire, and everyone is happy and will survive and repopulate the earth with Christianity in mind. (From all of this being a lesson of what happened to Sodom and Gomorra, can easily happen again)<br/><br/>Here are some of the other bumbling mistakes that the writers, producers, and directors failed to think about.<br/><br/>After 3 years, all petroleum products such as combustible gasoline and diesel go stale and turn to oily products and fail to burn efficiently in vehicles. (I.E, Will or anyone else driving any vehicle.)<br/><br/>Zombies with no hair and no apparent intellect (except what was stated before) that live in vacant dark buildings, will eventually freeze to death in NYC the first winter it drops to 20 degrees, no matter how much food they may have. It gets even colder than that in NYC, and especially without clothes, they will freeze like a cube no matter what their metabolism is.<br/><br/>Escaped lionesses and lions, or anything like that from the zoo from tropical countries such as Africa, will not survive the winters outside, or even in vacant buildings, as stated before no matter how much food they may find. Their bodies were not evolved to that type of cold like other North American and high altitude animals.<br/><br/>Fresh fruit such as pears and oranges (maybe they where the fake ones) on Will's table after three years of living in NYC alone. Fruit such as these are not indigenous, and will not grow like the corn he is shown picking in the fields, that are also nicely planted in straight rows and also in huge fields with a tractor, pro farming equipment, and farm boy training can only do.<br/><br/>Army personnel in the beginning that are evacuating certain high rank personnel and families, do not, will not, and cannot override the President of the United States decision of a FULL QUARANTINE.<br/><br/>SR-22 Blackbirds such as the one Will was knocking golf balls off of, are not placed, and are not launched from aircraft carriers. They also, even if they where transported on them, would not be on the launch deck in full view, especially with a variety of cluttered aircraft around it; especially in NYC harbor.<br/><br/>No Asians, in NYC?"
"thompson77","1","11","15","26 March 2008"," One of the WORST Post Apoc Movies EVER.
","Let me start at the beginning. Will Smith plays Robert Nevell, an Army Sargent/Scientist. The movie opens with Robert attempting to hunt a deer in the city. He chases the deer around town in a mustang firing an automatic rifle out the window. He sneaks up on a deer making so much noise that the CGI deer should run away but doesn't. He grows corn in central park, which the deer would have a feast on but don't. He could use the corn to lure the deer and shoot them. He has a huge pile of books in his house and he didn't read one to figure out how to hunt? He went through basic training and other training for the military and never learned how to hunt? He is intelligent enough to be a scientist and find a cure, but he is not smart enough to learn how to hunt? I'm not buying this.<br/><br/>Secondly there is a scene where one of the infected humans releases 3 infected dogs to attack Robert. The dogs are stopped by a beam of sunlight that is flowing in between two buildings. The dogs stop and as the sun sets the charge forward to attack Robert and his dog Sam. Robert and Sam kill the three dogs, but the infected human is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>The last thing I will complain about is the ending. The worst ending in cinematic history. It is so stupid. I hope that is not how the book ends, I don't even know if I want to read the book after how dumb this movie was.<br/><br/>The special effects were really good, and the concept was cool, but Roberts actions in this movie were idiotic.<br/><br/>TOOTH AND NAIL and DOOMSDAY are recent post apoc movies that are a million times more solid than this pile of Will Smith garbage."

","This movie just got worse as it went along. It started out interesting with Will Smith walking around a deserted New York City. He had man's best friend-- a dog-- right by his side. I'd have given it a seven at that point because it was interesting. The minute he walked into the dark to get his dog, I already knew there were ""creatures"" in the dark, so it was just annoying at that point. I don't like looking at black screen. If I want to look at darkness, I can stay home and turn off the light. This is where I drop the movie down to a six. Creatures in the dark don't interest me. I've seen it before. Then we have to suffer through vague flashbacks and Will Smith talking to mannequins as if they are alive. I was bored with that, but I went along. So we have this brilliant scientist that can juggle microbiology, rigging explosions, hunting for wild game, guns, installing metal doors and gates. This guy can do it all, but he's amazed when he injects one of the creatures and it isn't healed within 5 minutes. I'm no genius, but even I know that cures take time. So I have to ignore the fact a very learned person is an idiot disguised.<br/><br/>Will Smith's character goes the whole movie looking miserable because he's alone, yet a young lady and a kid are surviving fine. They show up and all he does is argue with them.<br/><br/>The creatures have enough social structure to keep their dogs on a leash, but they can't stay calm two seconds otherwise. Why is it that fictional creatures only eat the healthy people. They'll chew their way through a ceiling, but they won't attack each other. What were they eating? The most merciful scene in the movie is when the dog dies. The friend I was with said the movie should have ended there. If it had, I'd give it a 7. Unfortunately didn't, so the best I can give it is a four. I kept wondering if the CGI for the dogs was leftover from some other movie.<br/><br/>This is just my opinion, but heroes and legends don't earn their status by being lucky. The hero in this movie is inept. What happened to heroes having providence? They should have the ability to walk into a dismal situation and fix it because that is who and what they are.<br/><br/>On top of everything else, there appears to be a Christian theme tossed in. It is a hero trying to save the lost. That would be okay if there was some interesting plot, but there isn't.<br/><br/>This movie is not worth buying or renting. Save your money. The visuals are interesting at the start, but it goes nowhere."

","Two thirds of this film is wonderful entertainment, both in scope and story telling, and in Will Smith we have a cracking central performance that carries the film with consummate ease, sadly the final third undoes all the great promise and tension building that had gone before it.<br/><br/>After a genetic engineered cancer curing virus wipes out practically all of mankind, Robert Neville {Will Smith} appears to be the sole surviving human on earth, the only company he has is the family dog and an army of virus infected mutants that can only come out in the dark. That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.<br/><br/>Yes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.<br/><br/>Secondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...<br/><br/>They throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10<br/><br/>Footnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure."

I can't say much about this movie without spoiling it for those who may have not seen it, but the score by James newton Howard is saddening and one of his best.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is full of a silent tension.

","Filmed 3 times, the original story is a classic. I've seen all 3 films multiple times. Also have read the story maybe 10 times. The first follows the story the best and for an old movie the vampires and effects are not bad. The Second movie is also excellent, and again, effects are not bad for a 70s picture. What is so frustrating about todays movies is that they have the ability to do effects that are light years beyond what people had in the 60s and 70s and yet manage to make flat, poorly told stories. In the 60s film you can almost taste how lonely Vincent Price is and he has a scene when he starts to laugh and then rolls into crying and it is just really powerful. Then the second movie, Omega Man with Heston, He has some really great development, the isolation ""There is no phone damn it!"" and spending his days watching the same movie until he can repeat the lines. Then you get to this movie, BLAH, the emotional peak of the movie is when the dog is nailed and he is forced kill it. It's a good scene because they developed some bond between the dog and the audience. I never felt connected to the woman or the little boy...I mean, the boy has no lines in the movie...so you have him there why? Stupid. Then you have the mistake of making the vampires computer generated. They have no soul and just look stupid. Its a bad movie and really, how can you expect me to believe that Will Smith is a scientist? Hes not comfortable with the role, you can tell by how he mutters his lines about the virus, no conviction, you never get the feeling that he knows what he's taking about. If we ever have an out break you can send Will Smith to my house to shoot at the bad guys and make jokes (Men in Black anyone?) but don't send him to find a cure!"

Scenes with shrek and IDing bob marley to a mentally challenged 'surviver' were never envisaged. The idea of watching your wife and child succumb the virus is a nightmare inducing scenario.

","A movie of a book is not the book. Fanboys take note: stop crying, and try reading something not about vampires. Though immensely more competent than any of its film incarnations, Matheson's novel is no literary high point, except within its own tepid genre.<br/><br/>That said, this movie sucks on so many levels it's difficult to calculate what damage I may have done myself by watching it. I just got back from the IMAX experience; since the screen is twice as big, maybe the movie sucks twice as bad. But I doubt it would be better at any size, except too small to see. Perhaps I'll write a more coherent review after I clean the stupidity off my clothes and body.<br/><br/>The wonderful Last Man on Earth premise is subverted by an acute lack of imagination. They had all the architecture of Manhattan to explore and do spooky stuff with, but the interiors are limited to a couple of Ikea kitchens, a lab setup from any Milla Jovovich vehicle, a Blockbuster, and a single warehousy bank vault. The ghouls are straight out of Zombie Central Casting, indistinguishable from those in a hundred other undead movies. The cleverest bit is naming Emma Thompson Dr Crippen. And that's over before the credits are.<br/><br/>All the zombies look like Gollum, and are about as scary; in fact all the CGI is weaker than the budget would seem to afford; even the deer look fake, and the lions are laughable. The dog gives the best performance in the movie. Will Smith's biceps simply aren't big enough to carry this much steaming crap. He cries, yeah, great, he's fine; what am I supposed to do, give him a medal for using all his Hollywood clout to get behind something this lousy? The character with whom we're supposed to sympathize says the zombies show no human tendencies, after we've already seen them in love; later they set traps and keep pets, but he never changes his opinion. It's a bad sign when I'm smarter than the brilliant scientist. And it's a really bad sign when such a remarkable discrepancy remains unexplored in a movie starving for ideas, drama, and innovation. <br/><br/>Oh, hey, and how about a story? Too much trouble?

We are shown small hand-held Honda 1000 generators then he turns on the lights of a lab that could have been on a deck of the Enterprise. He uses this lab in a scene straight out of Auschwitz where he performs human experimentation on an 18 year old without a qualm. There is no explanation about the people left in the city. Are they zombies, vampires, werewolves (because of the dog library scene where when it gets dark you don't see people you see infected dogs) or are they really poor infected people with a virus. If we take the last premise the human experimentation scene is more horrific. Other problems: He is caught in a trap that suspends him in midair and drops his Ar-15. When he wakes up there is no rifle. We are left to assume that the best actor in the movie, the dog, has taken it away to create a dramatic crawling scene back to the SUV. He says the people are starving, but we see a lot of deer. He shows infected rats and dogs but doesn't explain why the birds are unaffected. If Manhattan Island is cut off how does that woman and kid drive off the island to that enclave? A vial of blood stays viable without refrigeration? No explanation of the fluid he is seen spraying on the front steps of the Washington square house. Why don't the infected people attack the woman's car?

","I guess it's not the worst film i've ever seen, but when you take into consideration the kind of movie it could have been, well.... The people who put this together must be complete and utter MORONS. I can't understand how so many people could be so simultaneously stupid to produce this the way they did. First of all, why oh why in god's soiled name did they choose to make ALL the monsters CG, and very poor CG too? The bad guys look ridiculously stupid, fake, and video-gamey. I can't fathom this... why didn't they just use real actors? WHY??!? it would have looked better, it would have made the film scarier, and it probably would have been CHEAPER TOO!! AAAAAGGHHHH!!!! I'd be an extra for a post-apocalyptic movie for $20.... They would be slightly more tolerable if the character design wasn't so bad, but it was terrible. The lead bad guy looks like a steroid-popping leper.<br/><br/>Secondly, interspersing the present in the film with the past was suuuchhh a bad callll. The whole deal is that Neville is the last man on Earth, and the loneliness is supposed to almost be a character in itself, that's why his dog is so important, cuz there's NO ONE ELSE. So, idiots that they are, they cram the movie with scenes from the past that are full of people and action, completely ruining all atmosphere, any semblance of a vibe. They want to show Neville's tragedy , right whatever. As a result we never identify with his desolation, cuz the editing doesn't allow us to, we keep seeing people (from the past).<br/><br/>Lastly, the casting. I'm not a Will Smith hater, i think he's a decent actor but he was SO WRONG for this role. Will Smith, by virtue of being who he is and signifying what he does, automatically makes the movie less dark and mysterious. The minute Will Smith is in a movie, the movie has lost some of its edge. I can see why the studio execs, horrible human beings that they are, thought it was a good idea: ""oh, if we put Will Smith in it more families will think it's OK for their children, it will reach a wider audience and sell more. Oh yeah, he's black, that will make more minorities watch it too, more tickets, Smith's a goldmine, look at his box office numbers, money money money, bla bla etc etc."" Casting the girl from City of God is a bad call too. She works in that film just fine, in her minor supporting role amidst hundreds of Rio De Janeiro locals, but just lacks the star power for this kind of thing. If a friend introduced me to her or something, i'd think hey that's a cute girl, but she has nowhere near the charisma necessary to co-star with Will Smith (who does have charisma, the family-friendly kind) as some of THE LAST PEOPLE ON EARTH.<br/><br/>Finally, this had to be by far the most bloodless, soft-core, toothless horror movie i've ever seen. It doesn't have to be a splatter-fest but if you can't make a horror movie without breaking some heads.<br/><br/>It's so frustrating. They decide they're making a post-apocalyptic horror film, then go about sabotaging their aim every way possible."

I was tempted to turn it off, but I kept thinking that since so many liked it it must get good or have some great twist.

"fung0","4","7","9","3 January 2008"," I Am NOT Legend
","This version of the classic book is certainly well-made. And Will Smith shines as never before, in a virtual solo performance. Unfortunately, in tossing out the original, brilliant ending of the book, the filmmakers have not only abandoned the entire justification for the exercise (not to mention for the title), they've failed to substitute any of their own. The resulting experience is not unlike watching a film called Tale of Two Cities that does NOT end with Sidney Carton doing a ""far, far better thing""... or a remake of Citizen Kane in which Rosebud unaccountably turns out to be Kane's chauffeur.<br/><br/>The film is thus doubly disappointing. Not only does Hollywood cop out on Matheson's profound and widely-admired philosophical observation, it concocts a story that violates every precept of Drama 101. The initial two-thirds of the film presents Matheson's original character arc; the final one-third veers off wildly, and fails to pay off in any way on the lead-up. Conversely, nothing in the conclusion is properly foreshadowed, hence the ending can only seem arbitrary, contrived and unsatisfying. Yet another mindless Spielbergian Deus ex Machina.<br/><br/>Thus, what could easily have been one of the truly great achievements in SF film ends up being merely a rather poor B movie -- slick, action-packed and momentarily diverting... yet ultimately hollow, bland and forgettable.

","As a keen fan of Richard Matheson's seminal vampire novella ""I AM LEGEND"", I was delighted to hear that it was to be filmed for a third occasion after Vincent Price starred in the low budget Italian made ""THE LAST MAN ON EARTH"" (1964) and Charlton Heston fought hooded, psychotic plague victims in ""THE OMEGA MAN"". However, after viewing the Will Smith film I came away quite disappointed and ""I AM LEGEND"" was easily the least faithful adaptation of the novel and something of a hollow movie overall.<br/><br/>( WARNING : POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ) Where did it go wrong ? Personally, for me I am over post-apocalyptic movies that show repeatedly show iconic points of interest in famous cities (New York, London etc) to illustrate the point that the city is deserted. I didn't pay my admission fee to watch a travelogue of a barren New York filled with weeds, rusting cars and free range deer running up Fifth Avenue. I can work it out for myself that the cities buildings and infrastructure have eroded and corroded over several years since the population was exterminated so I don't need it to be shown ad nausea. Secondly, the plague victim ""dark seekers"" of ""I AM LEGEND"" seem to be more closely related to The Incredible Hulk than the vampires of Mathesons novel ! They run like the wind, leap up the side of tall buildings in a single bound, head butt their way through steel shutters, armored glass and flip over fully loaded SUV's.....but they are still susceptible to bullets ???? Boy, that must have been some crazy virus that turned their skulls into armored battering rams, but when they screech they look like enraged cartoon characters with their over-sized dinner plate mouths.<br/><br/>Where was the ""Ben Cortman"" character from the novel - he was nowhere to be seen, and his relationship with Robert Neville was a central component to the entire book. At least in ""THE OMEGA MAN"" Charlton Heston had the sinister ""Mathias"" as his antagonist to hound him in the night time hours with his brethren of fellow nut cases ! As far as the CGI effects of the ""dark seekers"" was concerned - I felt like I was watching an episode of ""BUFFY - THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"". They looked fake and that reduced the scare factor considerably. Their were some wonderful opportunities to really go somewhere new with this film, and they all fell well short of achieving some new benchmark in the horror genre.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, I hope that one day some studio has the guts to film the book with a far higher degree of accuracy. This latest version runs second to ""THE OMEGA MAN"" not just in its lack of faithfulness to the book, but also in that ""I AM LEGEND"" relies too much on showing a decaying New York and computer generated vampires in place of more invigorating story and character development."
"rainman-uk","3","7","9","29 December 2007"," completely failed to hit the mark...
","Sweeping aside the normal PR hype that comes with a marquee film like this, this film had so much potential but completely failed to hit the mark.<br/><br/>Set in 2012, the story revolves around Robert Neville (Smith) the last known survivor of a post-apocalyptic nightmare when the cure for cancer mutates into a deadly virus spreading around the world. We then follow Neviles day-to-day life in a destitute New York City which feels a little like 'Castaway' until we learn that the virus has turned the citys' former inhabitants into zombies.<br/><br/>I can say that Smith, with his canine companion, manages to keep the film together with his ever-so maturing acting skills, but then everything else starts to come apart. The lack of a well-thought-out script and bad direction starts to become apparent as the movie starts unravelling.<br/><br/>I left the film thinking about the number of narrative holes, unrealistic scenarios considering the premise of the film, un-need use of cultural references and most importantly was the unnecessary use of unrealistic CG effects. I'd read somewhere after watching the movie, that music director Francis Lawrence decided after a weeks filming that his human actors made-up as zombies weren't realistic enough so he went down the CG route, I think this is one of his biggest mistakes as the tension he attempts to build-up to is completely brushed aside when we continually get close-ups of CG generated zombies that look like they're from a ten year old music-promo.<br/><br/>A part of me understands that they had to hit the 15 certificate and not go down a darker and edgier narrative/style so not to sway it into an 18 - bums on seats and all that. Honestly wait until it comes out on DVD or TV. This film had so much potential but unfortunately turns into just entertaining fodder.<br/><br/>Note: the much more superior '28 Days Later' cost £5million to produce ($10 million) whilst this supposedly cost $150 million. It really isn't just about style..."
"Island_Critic","2","11","16","7 January 2008"," Robust start, shame about the end
","Is it just me, or did everyone else see a different film? Yes Will Smith was great  he usually is, but the plot was just such a let down. You are the only person alive, that you know of, on the whole planet. And then you meet a girl. Not just any girl, but one who saves your life. And she is the first other human you have spoken to in over 1000 days. And you don't try to 'get your freak on' with her? Don't even TRY? Sheesh, give me a break. Well she is a 'deus ex machina' after all, so maybe that is why.<br/><br/>Then there is how the film ends. It seemed like the plot was written by two different people, one writing up to when Will discovers he has the cure (Mr. Number1) and then the second writer starts (Mr. Number2. Mr. Number2 hates Mr. Number1, he did him some unforgivable wrong, or went on strike or something and so Mr. Number2 says, 'yeah? Well let me finish this MY way.' And proceeds to completely kill any suspense, anticipation or even pulled heartstrings from there on out My rating? Good start, really bad, really bad ending. This is a film to give a miss to.

"greg197","3","11","16","31 December 2007"," Do you consider yourself an intellectual? If so, switch off your brain for the duration of 'I Am Legend'.
","The film starts off as something quite remarkable - deserted Manhattan in 'I Am Legend' somewhat resembles the desolate London in 28 Days Later, but the full impact of the apocalyptic turn of events on the life of the main character is developed far better in 'I Am Legend'. In fact, the portrayal of the trauma against the background of an apocalypse is probably the only reason to see the film.<br/><br/>About 30 minutes in, is when the story goes terribly awry and turns from plausible to utterly implausible. Consider the following: 1) Have you ever heard of a virus which actually makes the human body more able? How about 3 time more able and hard as steel? 2) If our ordinary bodily functions would work at 300% of their usual rate, would you not expect a proportionate rise in the need for nutrition? According to 'I Am Legend', 99% of the POPULATION of NEW YORK fed on the remaining 1% and survived for 36 months! That's like 99 people feeding on 1 person for 36 months! Even the wildlife in the film would not be enough to feed a block of people for that long, let alone feeding a city full of hungry zombies. Now, add the 300% rise in your ordinary demand for nutrition. 3) Oh, and by the way, the viral processes are reversible overnight. WHOOPTY DOO! Lets' pick up the pace a bit: 4) Any high-school physics student will tell you that UV rays do not go through glass. Consider how the writers of the story are totally ignorant of this fact. 5) Are those of your organs which are vital to your survival located somewhere in your skin? Why then, do these zombies get instantly killed by UV light when UV rays never penetrate beyond the skin (you don't exactly get a sunburn on your kidneys when you stay out in the sun for too long, do you now)? 6) Do you know that moonlight also consists of UV rays? 7) And so on..<br/><br/>To speak frankly, I was hurt by the way 'I Am Legend' raised my expectations to a new high in the first 30 minutes and then ridiculed me until the very end for having expected something reasonable. This is yet another mindless film concerning zombies, only this time it takes half an hour to come out with it."
"Samualt","3","11","16","25 December 2007"," This Movie Won't Be A Legend...
","Based very loosely on on the novel ""I am Legend"" by Richard Matheson, this movie falls short when compared to its predecessors: ""Last Man On Earth"" with Vincent Price and ""Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston. It doesn't adhere to the original story like ""Last Man On Earth"" and it doesn't have the flow or original feel like ""Omega Man"".<br/><br/>Never mind that the original story had the victims turning into vampires instead of the PG-13 version of Dawn Of The Dead like zombies. Never mind that there were so many flash backs in this wreck that it just got boring. What bothers me the most is the title. The meaning of the original novel title was that the main character had become the monster, the evil, a killer of vampires and thus a ""Legend"" to them.<br/><br/>Independence Day, I Robot, and I Am Legend all come across as Hollywood cookie cutter flicks. They throw in a big name, a cool title, and release it during the holidays to make big money. The poor quality of the writing is evidently not a issue with them. You can have good production values, great actors and actresses, and the best ad campaign in the world but that won't make it a good or memorable movie. It's just another piece of fluff.<br/><br/>Well, I give Will Smith a ""E"" for effort. But, I have to give the movie a 3 out of 10."

","this movie is nothing like the novel written 53 years ago! if you have not read the book,then who cares go see it. you wont be disappointed because you have nothing to be disappointed about. the name of the title ""I AM LEGEND"" is the entire basis of the story which the movie completely ignores and changes. also it completely ignores the vampire creature as a non intelligent head banging freak. in the book they are a new civilization, some are completely infected which makes them vampire like and evil,but some are almost totally human. robert neville goes out to destroy the vampires thinking there is only the violent ones, but since they all sleep during the day, he kills all he can find including the semi human ones. in that sense he becomes a ""legend""to these people as a ghost story that they tell to each other . <br/><br/>this movie also ignores the scientific explanations they give to the vampire myth. for instance, the sunlight would bother the infected because the virus made their skin very pale and would dehydrate them which would make them weak. another example would be that a chemical in garlic would irritate the virus thus having an effect on the infected. another would be that the virus made their blood congeal very rapidly thus u couldn't really kill them with bullets, you would have to drive something into their chest that was thick and hard , hence the wooden stake. and the last was the mirrors. they would always be disgusted with how they look now compared to what they used to look like so they did not like mirrors.none of this was explained in the movie.<br/><br/>it is almost like Hollywood re-wrote the novel and put it on the big screen thinking nobody had read the original. once again they are wrong thinking that all people are morons and don't read books. i am waiting for the day when Hollywood can actually make an accurate adaptation from a book into a movie. i am surprised that richard matheson is not freaking out about this, i am pretty sure he is still alive. this movie is a huge disappointment. <br/><br/>with the technology we have today in film making this could have been one of the best movies of the year. instead it is a ""cgi drenched"",""post- apocalyptic"", ""run away from the zombies"" pile of crap.only people that are die-hard will smith fans who have no knowledge of movies or books that just want to see special effects will like this film."
"thedevilyouknow00","6","35","62","10 December 2007"," Great first part, loses energy toward the end
","Criticisms about the first part being better than the last part are understandable. The mechanics and struggle depicted kept me wanting more and dreading what the next corner or shadow might bring. As with any LMOE (last man on earth) movie, the set design pertaining to a deserted world are fascinating and subliminally terrifying (the novelty of having New York all to yourself lasts only so long until you'll have New York, all to yourself). The cinematography and look of the picture are top notch. The story starts off with a great ""hook"" that tells you everything you need to know with ONE CUT. Will Smith doesn't have much characterization to work with, but he's a lot more believable here with a low amount of dialog than he has been in some of his previous movies. The movie doesn't have some of the philosophical conceits that Matheson's novel has, but the set-up has been retained along with the character's main purpose- future filmmakers that want to remake this in 20 years won't have to fight against the memory of this film. That said... the movie does contain a needless (and tacked on?) subplot involving ""faith."" I'm not talking about the belief in a creed or idea, I'm talking about the kind of one-dimensional boilerplate you'd find in a ""left behind"" novel where the simple fact that a character says he believes is enough for plot and character development. I've nothing against characters or plots dealing with theocratic concepts, but those ideas and concepts better be at the heart of your story. Here, it's a few lines of dialog inserted to give the characters something to yell at each other about. Oddly, most of this seems like it was inserted. My concerns about this probably stem from the fact that the ""faith"" element randomly pops up where it doesn't need to- the main danger of the story is that scary things are coming to kill you. Deal with that. The main thrust of Dawn of the Dead comes from the idea that there are people locked up from hordes of zombies- all their actions stem from that set-up. In I Am Legend, the main motivator of one man against rampaging ghouls is set aside because one character has ""faith."" Unfortunately, and I'm not sure if this is a drawback, the whole project comes across as a big budget remake of 28 Days Later (so much so that the ghouls of the picture are called ""infected"" in the credits). Is this bad? Only if you don't like the movie. I like most of the movie so I'm not too bothered. Final verdict, not the disaster I was expecting but not something that will stand the test of time. If you're sick of Enchanted and relatives, Joe Bob says ""Check it out."""

I get how the ""god"" angle can work here... but it's so poorly implemented and the last scene so badly played out as to what Will Smith's character would actually do in that moment (ie: not senselessly talking to the zombies but giving the serum to the woman and telling her if that compound actually exists she needs to give this to them)<br/><br/>9/10 movie but forced to 8/10 due to final 10 minutes."

","I can't explain just why the finale of I Am Legend sucks without major spoilers, so search for it on oneguyrambling.com and see exactly why this film is so frustrating to me.<br/><br/>When the initial teasers for this hit the cinema I looked into it, I knew nothing about the book but was still really, really looking forward to it. I wanted it to be ""All-Time"" good.<br/><br/>So it was disappointing when I finally caught it and saw how they managed to still mess it up.<br/><br/>Will.I.Am-Legend Smith, plays Robert Neville, the only apparent survivor of the latest cinematic pandemic. This time a botched cure for cancer backfires, killing a large proportion of the planet and turning most of the rest into enraged zombies by night, and hibernating spooky guys by day.<br/><br/>It is three years since the virus hit, and NYC, the source of the initial outbreak is long since quarantined. Neville walks the deserted streets by day, now overrun by wildlife (Lions?) and vegetation, and hides in his home by night along with the family dog and only buddy Sam. The family and their destiny are introduced and explained piece by piece in Neville's dream sequences.<br/><br/>As Neville was part of the cause of the initial outbreak, (just how responsible is never exactly explained), he feels it is his duty to find a cure, and he runs around the clock experiments in his basement on rats. To date none are successful, though Neville carefully documents all tests and file notes results, and his diary events on camera.<br/><br/>In between experiments and hiding, Neville and Sam roam the streets, hunting, shopping and foraging for supplies and things of use. Scenes were Neville visits the video shop show both how long he has been alone and just how Castaway bored and frazzled he has become.<br/><br/>So where have they gone wrong? Well so far, so good, in fact even though nothing really happens in the first 30 odd minutes we feel like it is building, and we get an idea of Neville's circumstances and feelings of isolation.<br/><br/>In fact around 25-30 minutes in the best scene in the film occurs, in chasing a deer Sam runs into a dark building, despite Neville's cries of stop. Given the choice between running and losing his best friend Neville opts to save his lone amigo and heads in. We don't really know by this time what the bad guys are and what they do, so as Neville creeps carefully through the rooms whispering for Sam we feel genuine tension, even when he finally comes across the huddled, shivering baddies.<br/><br/>In the ensuing escape Neville catches an infected (it is apparent that he has set traps at various places), and takes her back to run further tests.<br/><br/>Things come to a head when Neville falls into one of his own traps, and the subsequent escape doesn't go well.<br/><br/>In my opinion it all goes wrong from here.<br/><br/>Neville decides ""enough"" and takes his death wish to the streets at night, even though he kills many infected he inevitably loses through sheer weight of numbers Except - and without giving the game away - Neville himself says that it has been over 1,000 days since he saw other survivors, and the events that follow are simply too ludicrous to be coincidence, even when they feebly try to explain them away as such.<br/><br/>The bottom line: Stoopid Hollywood.<br/><br/>The ending is over the top and deeply flawed, totally ignoring the source material on which the film is based in favour of BOOM BANG CRASH crapulence.<br/><br/>I've watched this twice now, and each time I enjoyed the build up and let down in a major way by the compromises and short-cuts taken in the second half, even when I know it's coming now.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6 / 10. A golden opportunity to make a big budget zombie movie (with credibility) wasted by a short cut ending.<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

I'll take Ali, Men in Black, Independence Day, thank you.<br/><br/>Special Effects- Disaster: half-and-half. The cityscapes were well-done, evoking that ache which is desirable for this type of apocalyptic theme. However, details! Why are there lions roaming Manhattan? Did someone let out the zoo? And why are there ""herds"" of deer. First place: deer don't congregate like that. Second place: where did they come from? Manhattan's sealed off, remember? A further bone of contention: the deer have *what* to do with the plot? <br/><br/>Special Effects- Zombie/Vampires: terrible. ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) did it right. The returned should be weak, feeble, and feeble-minded. It just makes sense. Also, why do all the creatures look alike? Are they albino? What's with the razor teeth? And how come they can howl like a banshee? Furthermore, the CGI hordes were just ridiculous, regardless of how much work that took. They can climb buildings like Spider-Man? And since when do NYC brownstones crumble like dust? Those buildings are built like tanks.<br/><br/>Logic- As many have pointed out, what's the story with the lack of guns and ammo? How much sense does it make to have autos rigged with explosives right outside your house? Seriously, an electric fence makes much more sense. And how do all the lights in the area work? They shouldn't, since he needs a generator or three to keep his place going. On that, where are these generators?- it seems awful quiet in that house! And how did the vampires cut off power to all the lights at once? I could go on all day about logic.<br/><br/>How did Anna's presence cause the vampires to disperse? Did she have halogen lights? So what if she did? How did she get Wil Smith to the car? They should have showed her strength. <br/><br/>Who is Ethan? We get no background, and ultimately end up not caring about him. How can such a kid survive, one who doesn't know enough to keep his trap shut when a ceiling-hanging zombie is nearby? Oy.<br/><br/>Here's another thought: the grenade at the end. What is it packing, a mini H-bomb? And if the blast is that powerful, shouldn't Anna and Ethan be trapped in the chimney?

","I have to say that remakes are a bad idea at times. This movie was done out of context of The Omega Man with Charlton Heston. And at that time when the movie was made was a more understandable version than this one with will smith. yet will smith did a fantastic job of acting alone for the most part. The creatures that evolved after a cataclysmic epidemic resulting in the deaths of billions of people, his character was to make a antidote to reverse the effects of the mutagen. Not a bad story but lacked more cohesive answers to the questions. Like such as why this outbreak happened during a cancer cure. Or why he was the only man to stay unaffected or why survivors found him after listening to a radio broadcast?. The creatures as far as i understand it in the omega man all talked and no grunts or loud screaming. Now i don't know if the story was to be that way or they changed it for that reason of rage bellowing endless hours after dark. But it was more feasible than todays version, and it also bordered too close to 28 days later for my taste. This movie should have been thought through a little more before production, and using graphic visuals for the creatures was a bit too much as well. You could actually see the mechanical movements border lining each one when they moved. Real people should be used for this sort of thing, acrobatic or not. I would not recommend this film unless you are a will smith fan like i am. And thats all i saw it for."

","I liked this movie much better when it was called ""28 Days Later"".<br/><br/>Seriously, though, ""28"" was an extremely well done movie, where this rip-off/re-make of ""Omega Man"" is the typical load of Hollywood dreck, starring the Stale Prince himself, Will Smith.<br/><br/>Smith just doesn't have the talent to disappear in a role. You always feel like, ""Will is hunting deer. Will's dog just died, etc."" Also, is it written into his contracts that he has to flash his physique in EVERY film he does? Yuck.<br/><br/>There's nothing really creepy about the mutants,or whatever they are, in this film. ""Omega Man"" was wonderfully creepy/cheesy with it's sentient mutants. The mutants in this film look very similar to those in ""The Descent"" (Another superior film), especially when they converge on the Stale Prince's lair in the end. Reminiscent of the scene where Juno is set upon by hordes of the cave mutants.<br/><br/>Really boring, and there just seems to be no purpose to the characters of Ana and Ethan. Too many plot holes to enable you to suspend reality, and a typical Hollywood ending. ""Waterworld"" did post-apocalyptic much better than this, even if it was something of a dog.<br/><br/>Save your money for ""28 Days Later/28Weeks Later"", or ""Dawn of The Dead"", if you like movies of this genre. If you can get past the fact that it's very dated and '70's cheeseball, ""Omega Man"" is so much better than it's re-make."

So many questions came up.<br/><br/>-You're telling me out of over 6 billion people, there is only one person who's immune, And a doctor at that? -These zombies have supposedly de-evolved to the point of ignoring basic instincts, yet they're smart enough to set a trap for Smith? -What I don't get about these zombies movies...if everyone's a zombie, what exactly to they feed on? -Anna shows up out of nowhere with one gun, no supplies, and with a kid??? BTW, how did she get to the island if it was quarantined? Her magic ferry? -Why did Smith not only have to blow himself up, but do it without giving Anna a single piece of research? Sure she gets the vial, but what good is it without his research? -Smith knows every detail about the disease and who it killed.

","By now you have undoubtedly read a million reviews that pretty much say the same thing. This one wont stray to far from the other reviews, but I may add a thing or two...... PLEASE, PLEASE heed my warning when I honestly tell you that this movie is BORING. Like others have said, it starts off well (gotta love the Shelby Mustang) with the NYC post-tragedy blah blah, and if you don't like Sam, then you've really got a sad existence. Heres how it goes: He leaves the Mustang for an Expedition...why?, Sam dies, again, why?, he starts to go nuts, two of the most boring individuals show up out of nowhere I might add, a bunch of the most ridiculous looking CGI zombies who all seem to be wearing the same thing (think The Incredible Hulk from the 70s), multiple scenes with no dialog....well, are you getting the picture? However, here are my ""unique"" gripes. Why, oh why, does everyone seem to think Will Smith is so great? He was remotely funny in The Fresh Prince of Bel Aire, but other than that, whats the big deal with this guy? I will give him this though, at least he's not all ""always bet on black"" bs like Wesley Farrakahn, oops, I mean Snipes. Also, why is it ALWAYS NYC that gets destroyed? What did this city do to deserve always being (and I quote FROM THE MOVIE, ""ground zero""). That city has gone through enough in reality, why not wipe out Atlanta (sorry to the Atlanta readers, I like your city just fine :-) )? Oh and to those who criticize the BORING add on character girl that just popped out of nowhere, yes, she believes in God. If you don't, thats your thing, but not something to make fun of. OK Im off my soapbox now. So, in summary, this movie bored me to tears. Enjoy!"

This movie was poor in all accounts.<br/><br/>I thought the concept was great for a movie. It's not a unique story, but I felt there was a chance of success with Will Smith lending credibility to the main role. He doesn't participate in a lot of Oscar worthy films, but the man can act. (See Six Degrees of Separation).<br/><br/>However, this movie was a huge farce. To try and use a zombie movie in an attempt to create an artistic film about character development is ridiculously paradoxical. It does no justice to the actor(s) or story. <br/><br/>While I agree that Smith's acting was realistic and believable, the content itself was dull and monotonous. The ending was intentionally cut to leave little satisfaction, and as always, the possibility of a sequel. <br/><br/>I sincerely hope for the sake of us all that this drivel does not turn into a multi-installment franchise. <br/><br/>And, as a side note, if I wanted to watch an hour of video footage of Will Smith playing with a dog, I would stalk well-known Hollywood parks, and save myself $10 of admission."

He died of lethal injection, not sacrificing himself, He was captured and to be hanged for killing so many Vampires and not joining them. He found the dog, tried to befriend it, and ultimately got it into his house where it ran under his bed and basically dies. The girl Anna is actually a Vampire in disguise because they are evolving to be the the sunlight. She is sent to trick him and she lets the Vampires into his home where they capture him. Nothing about the movie fallows any of this and they felt free to change it so much that it created an entire new story that doesn't represent the original in the least.

First of all a specialized strain of measles would not be able to be turned into a cure for cancer because it does not directly attack cells, also, a pill or injection could not mutate in the short amount of time between the time the cure is first used and the time it mutates for it to develop an air born strain.

","Let me say first that I am a huge fan of Will Smith, and I think that he did a great job in this movie. It's always a pleasure to watch him work. A fine actor at the top of his game. But I suspect that if you put Casey Afleck as the lead in this one, it doesn't gross 30 million in the complete run.<br/><br/>Hollywood appears to have given up on actors all together, and is moving into complete CGI characters for no reason at all. The main ""villian"" is a CGI character only categorized as a ""monster."" As are the rest of the villains. Impossible to develop, and used only for cheap theatrics (leaping up buildings, really?).<br/><br/>Backdrop: The human population is decimated by a man-made plague that wipes out most of the world in one fell swoop. The remainder are mostly flesh eating creatures, and there are a few survivors who, for some reason, are immune to the virus. For some unexplained reason, Smith is trying to cure the effects of the virus. What is lost, unexplained, or simply not thought of, is the why? The bad guys are never developed as sympathetic victims in need of cure. Thye are just monsters to be avoided or shot. Even that is underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Huge plot holes exist in the story, around nearly every corner. The villains are monsters who have lost the ability to reason, but can work together in groups to construct (unnecessarily) elaborate traps? It reminded me of an old Bond film.<br/><br/>Spoiler here: and why exactly did Smith not just get into the duct work with the woman and child? Apparently his (must have been nuclear) hand grenade was going to blow up the entire building, so what was he sticking around for? Apparently it was safe in the basement fire/duct work....with some sort of escape route too...<br/><br/>The whole film seems like a bad combination of Heston's Omega Man and 28 Days Later - both films that were actually better than this one. At least in Omega Man, they attempted to develop their mutants (cheesy lines and bad makeup, but they gave it a shot).<br/><br/>Once again, a Hollywood blockbuster based on pretty backdrops, heavy CGI graphics, and lots of things blowing up.<br/><br/>It's a good rental if you're in the Hollywood mood, but you'll be left with more questions at the end like, ""did you think that one part (those seven parts) even made sense?"" Ultimately, I believe that this movie, for all the cash that it is making, will be shelved as junk cinema. There are good action/drama high-dollar movies out there, but this isn't one of them."

"MartinHafer","6","8","11","3 May 2009"," Watchable but unnecessary
","The book ""I am Legend"" has supposedly been made into a film three times (THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, THE OMEGA MAN as well as I AM LEGEND). However, all three are quite different from the story and in most ways they are inferior (ultimately missing the point of the book in the process). Had this Will Smith film actually stuck with the original story, it would have been well worth making. However, in many ways it was much closer to OMEGA MAN than the book. Now, considering that OMEGA MAN was a really cool sci-fi film AND the newest film didn't stick all that close to the book, you wonder why it was made in the first place. Oh, wait...it starred Smith, had a huge budget AND lots of special effects--that's apparently the only reason many films are made by Hollywood these days!! According to IMDb, they didn't even have a finished script before they began filming--and this just shows the contempt they had for the source material.<br/><br/>Now I am not saying that this is a bad film. It's very watchable and exciting--particularly if you have never seen OMEGA MAN. And, for people who care far more for special effects than plot, it is a pretty film. The scenes of the bridges leading out of Manhattan and the rest of the ruined city are incredibly realistic--too bad the story was actually supposed to take place in Los Angeles! <br/><br/>And, speaking of changes, he film also takes a lot of liberties including: making the plague victims more like mindless zombies than vampires, adding a dog to the story, completely changing the ending so as to make a point that is the opposite of the novel as well as attributing the plague to an accidental creation due to come cancer drug. Now granted, most of these mistakes (minus the dog) are in the other films--they were flawed as well. But, why keep distorting an excellent story and why make a film that looks better than the previous films BUT is essentially no better?! <br/><br/>My advice? Read the book and watch OMEGA MAN. Sure, OMEGA MAN is so unlike the original but it had a major cool factor. Perhaps it's because I am older, but seeing a crazed Charlton Heston machine gunning the zombies (led by the great Anthony Zerbe--a wonderful villain) is just more exciting than seeing Smith talking to his dog."

Boy is this thing a sad imitation. I noted the lack not only of dead people in a world that has been killed off, but also the lack of a scriptwriter (the strike must have started early for this film!) Many of the scenes we're reincarnations of The Omega Man with a slight twist for the worse. I think that they were hoping that the special computer effects would make up for it, but were without success.<br/><br/>The Omega Man although dated had pace, dialogue and symbolism. it is all three particularly the last item do not feature in I am Legend. The Omega Man was speared at the end of the film and struck a pose in a fountain like Christ on the cross.

But while ""28 days Later"" used stroboscopic effects to heighten the tension when the infected attack, Legend seems to rely on having the camera shaken around resulting in an irritatingly blurred image.<br/><br/>And the reason the movie requires the camera shaking is to attempt to disguise the appallingly bad CGI zombies, hence my Roger Rabbit reference.

","This was the most frustrating kind of movie for me to watch, because I really wanted to like it, and every time I came close there would be a terrific clinker of some kind to completely pull my head out of the film. Mostly the clinkers had to do with setting up the circumstance that Manhattan had been physically isolated from its surroundings. Indeed, we see the destruction of the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, and it's safe to assume the other bridges and the tunnels would have been destroyed as well.<br/><br/>Okay - Manhattan is cut off from Jersey, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. We are told that Manhattan was ""ground zero"" for the outbreak and was quarantined, after which most of its population became infected. Yet somehow it is infested with deer - lots of deer. Doubtful, but, I suppose, possible. We'll give you the deer. Then there are the lions who hunt the deer. Not good old American cougar, but African lions. How the hell did THEY get to Manhattan? On the A train? Last time I went to Central Park Zoo, there were no lions. Polar bears, yes. Lions, no. Oh, back to the deer for a moment. One of them, being hunted for dinner by Neville, does something pretty peculiar. Instead of continuing to flee down the street in the middle of the day, this particular deer runs into a multi-story building that is completely dark and manages, presumably at full-speed and on hooves that miraculously have the traction of sneakers, to successfully negotiate pitch-black hallways and stairs, and in total silence. Neville, on the other hand, has to turn on his flashlight as soon as he enters said building, and then proceed slowly and carefully through the halls and up the stairs. <br/><br/>Then there is Alice Braga's character, who drives to Manhattan from Maryland. How the hell does SHE get onto Manhattan if the bridges and tunnels are gone? And, according to her, she waited all day for Neville at the South Street Seaport, yet somehow managed to miss his setting up his ambush for the ""dark-seekers"".<br/><br/>This is just sloppy writing, backed up by a director who thinks his audience is stupid enough not to notice.<br/><br/>There's more, having to do with the survivors' colony in Vermont that Neville somehow is not aware of, even though he is the most tuned-in guy on the planet.<br/><br/>Rent ""The Omega Man"" if you just have to see a movie version of this.

","This was a run of the mill standard science fiction story that any fan of sci-fi has probably already heard or read several times. As far as the story goes, there was nothing really new or interesting about the tale, except one glaring fatal flaw. The photography was good and the special effects were acceptable but nothing earth shattering. How many times have we seen a devastated earth, or even just devastated New York City? If the filmmakers were expecting a ""Wow, he is growing corn in Central Park"" they better hope that some people have never paid attention to science fiction or the stacks of movies that have similar things.<br/><br/>As for the acting, once again it was acceptable. Will Smith works hard in his role and is believable (glaring error notwithstanding). He has continued to develop as an actor but, once again, the whole ""last man on earth"" scenario has been done numerous times before so it is not breaking any new ground. His attachments to store dummies and a video store are humorous and consistent. However, his logical attitude and believability is what makes the glaring error such a vast glaring error that destroyed the film for me.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT  The Glaring Error  Robert Neville (Will Smith) is a scientist and believes he may be the sole sane survivor of the plague he has dedicated his life to stopping. He maintains his sanity and drive, in large part, by recording everything and focusing on the details of life and survival. This is in his continued efforts to cure the plague and in his daily life. He needs a ""human"" subject to test a cure on so sets out to capture a DarkSeeker (infected humans). He sets a trap and captures one, a female, but a male one I will call Alpha almost braves the sunlight to confront him (sunlight being toxic to DarkSeekers). He even comments on this highly unusual behavior in his notes and hypothesizes that lack of food is causing them to override their survival instincts and that all traces of humanity appear to be gone. All fine so far.<br/><br/>Later, Neville is caught in a trap almost exactly like the trap he set for the DarkSeeker. The bait is one of his store dummy friends. Despite this obvious use of tools and pre-planning and coordination, he never asks such a thing is possible for just animals. Even when Alpha appears and releases some infected dogs into the dimming sunlight, Neville makes no connection and never comments on it in his records or otherwise that we are shown. Neville goes out at night and is attacked by DarkSeekers in an animalistic fashion. Suddenly, Alpha shows up and the attack becomes coordinated and logical. Neville fails to notice the difference. The DarkSeekers attempt to attack his home and it is a haphazard rush toward the house until, you guessed it, Alpha shows up and things become coordinated and the DarkSeekers begin to be able to brave hazards like fire. Still, no apparent recognition of this by Neville.<br/><br/>I could not conceive that a scientist so dedicated to finding cures and links between things, and so dedicated to take notes and making observations, would completely overlook the role of Alpha and the change in behavior. Perhaps there are deleted scenes which show him realizing it but if so, shame on the movie makers for taking that out. Neville was a believable character until he suddenly and inexplicably completely ignores this obvious and important bit of information. This omission is what changed an otherwise acceptable sci-fi tale into something I have to rate so low."

In this story he drives around chasing deer, or some animals, for some reason that's never clear. If it's for food, his hunting skills are pretty poor. Next we need to learn how he copes with being alone. In this, we have the benefit of having Sam, his dog, accompany him. It's not wrong to say that each scene with Sam works, and that when she's gone, the movie falls apart. When we learn that there's an enemy that wants to kill the last man, we suddenly learn that the enemy is so vastly superior in hunting and fighting skills that we wonder how the last man survived for as long as he did. It's here that the whole movie reveals the truth that there really isn't any story that makes sense. We learn that there may be survivors in the north because the virus can't survive the cold, but instead of confirming this news with a simple experiment, the last man and scientist, ignores it. Then we find that the area around his home is booby-trapped for a final confrontation, and again, we have to wonder how his superior enemy never stumbled upon the gigantic spot lights lining the street. Or even how the last man on earth managed to run multiple generators within his home without dying from carbon monoxide poisoning. The problem is that it takes so long to get us to a point where we discover that there really isn't any story that it's hard to admit that I wasted my time. But that's what really happened.

But, as the tagline says, ""the last man on earth is not alone.""<br/><br/>I had heard a lot of bad things about this film before going into it. My colleague, Tristan Sinns, trashed it in his review. I heard it was action-packed (which seems silly when you're by yourself in a desolate city). And it was directed by Francis Lawrence, who made ""Constantine"" (which, unlike everyone else, I don't care for). I tried to have an open mind and not compare it to the past versions I already enjoyed (""Last Man on Earth"" and ""Omega Man""). Clearly, this film doesn't match up to either of its predecessors, so don't watch those first if you want a chance of liking this one.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint I heard from people was what the critics call the ""third-act collapse"". As always, I cannot reveal the end, but I will say that there is some truth to the ""collapse"" -- after a suspenseful beginning and middle, we do spend a fairly short time trying to wrap everything up. And pretty much everyone who saw the film didn't agree with the way it was wrapped up. Myself, I thought it was abrupt but that the manner of the execution was decent and made sense. It certainly could have been much worse, and I'm glad that they chose a serious approach to the subject matter.<br/><br/>Another complaint I heard was about the ""excessive and unrealistic"" CGI. Believe me, I couldn't agree more. My hatred for computer effects is deep, and this film made sure to use every possible computer effect it could. Deer, lions and even infected humans are all computer-generated, and poorly done. If you can't get a real lion or deer, at least make them look good. And why have the people animated? It made them look cheesy and not the least bit scary. It's not hard to get people to be played by... wait for it... people! And it's not hard to make them look infected with a virus, as has been done in hundreds of films before.<br/><br/>If I had to say one good thing about this film, it's Neville's turn from God. Will Smith, in interviews, compared Robert Neville to Job. Except for the big difference: Job loses his family and becomes diseased and still loves God. Neville loses it all and ceases to believe in God. I found this to be somewhat edgy for the film and especially for Smith. There was no need to bring religion into the film, but I'm glad that they chose to do it in this manner: a strong, atheist character who still has impeccable morals despite a lack of faith. That's a bold move.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this film. At all. Watch ""Last Man on Earth"", ""Omega Man"" or ""28 Days Later"". Don't watch this one. It's bringing in high ratings now (for reasons I cannot understand), but I don't see it passing the test of time. A year or two from now and this film will fade into obscurity, or so I hope. Die-hard Will Smith fans will love it, and all others will just be bored."

","I went to the cinema expecting more than I received. I was disappointed that the movie relied on shock treatment every five minutes which broke up the film for me. (extreme 'boo!!!' factor). Every time the film hit on a powerful note it wasted it and resorted to shock treatment.<br/><br/>I really wanted to see more of how he was trying to cope with being alone especially setting up manikins everywhere. The scene where he 'begged' the manikin in the video shop to talk to him was so powerful, but then resorted to another 'boo!!!' set of shocks and 'zombie' killing rampage.<br/><br/>Another disappointment was when we actually got to see the 'zombie' or infected people (whatever you want to call them). It was CGI overload, musclebound things which could climb effortless up the outside of buildings??? and have mad uncontrollable dogs on chains?? and 'boo!!!'ed at the cinema audience a lot.<br/><br/>Then it all ended quite abruptly. His final words ""I know what I have to do"" (or along those lines), said it all........ I assume he was referring to finishing the film as it was not really going anywhere by that point.<br/><br/>I left the cinema not quite sure what it set out to be, which is sad but was a common view from the people leaving the cinema. I am not saying it was bad but someone in the group I was with did say we should have gone to see 'St Trinians' (which was the alternative that night)..... no-one actually commented against that thought."

","So we come to the yearly boxing day movie. Last year, bizarrely, it was Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (or what ever the hell it was) and next year it'll be the reboot of Star Trek. This year it was I Am Legend. Firstly, I want to say that this is in no way a bad film and I have certainly seen much worse this year (Hitman anyone?) but it isn't great either. It kinda fits nicely in the middle as one of these interesting non-entities that could've been so much more.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing straight, the book is much better. Robert Nevill is, in fact the last person on the planet that is now inhabited by Vampires. They taunt him every evening into leaving his home which, at times, he seriously struggles to resist. But it's the scientific take on the vampire legend that I found most interesting. It attempted to find I logical reason for the extreme allergies to sunlight, garlic and holy water.<br/><br/>The movie ditches the vampires and changes the creatures into ""Dark Seekers"", mutated humans that are still allergic to sunlight but are far from the intelligent monsters from the novel. They scream and squeak and are, frankly, a bit rubbish. Director Francis (Constantine) Lawrence opted to ditch the men in make-up for entirely CGI creations. His reasons were that he felt they were not believable. Bit mistake. The CGI on these things is truly terrible. In a year when we've had Transformers and Pirates 3, it shows that special effects can now look REAL. These beasts look less than convincing and, thus, fail to scare. How can you be frightened when they look like they're sculpted from play-doh? Will Smith, however, is terrific. Any lesser actor would've failed at the task ahead of him. He spends the majority of the film talking to his dog. Think Cast Away on a worldwide scale. Smith's Nevill is man about ready to break. One particularly moving scene shows him begging a department store mannequin to say hello.<br/><br/>The opening scenes are excellent too, with Smith wondering around a deserted New York. Visually, the bigger budget has allowed for more impressive deserted city sequences than the 28 Days/Weeks Later films allowed. Take a look at the cheeky nods to other Warner Bros titles that have been in the pipeline over the years (most noticeably, the poster in Time Square for a Batman Vs. Superman film).<br/><br/>Essencially, this is a film of two halves. The first being an excellent post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, the second being your bog standard zombie b-movie. It's a shame as the first half really is very good but all falls apart towards the end. Matherson's book had a very pessimistic view of humanity and his ending really is truly ironic and deeply unnerving. The movie couldn't help being Hollywood. It sh*ts all over the idea as to why it is called I Am Legend, twisting it for a more uplifting finale. It's a shame that Hollywood rarely goes so dark. Had it kept it's ending, the film would've worked much better. Oh well, at least it was better than Constantine.<br/><br/>3/5"

","In 2012, the American scientist and colonel Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the unique healthy survivor in Manhattan, missing his beloved wife and daughter, died in a deadly accident. The human race deceased or became mutants living in the dark due to the outbreak of a virus intended to cure cancer. Dr. Robert Neville keeps a routine life for his own survival with his dog Sam, fighting against his loneliness to maintain mentally sane, and entirely committed in researching an experimental vaccine using his own immune blood to get the cure in the laboratory in the basement of his hideout. When Robert attacked by a large group of ""Darkseekers"", he is rescued by Anna (Alice Braga), another survivor that arrived in Manhattan with the boy Ethan after listening to a message broadcasted by Robert. Her intention is to head to a sanctuary in Vermont, but Robert is reluctant to leave the ground zero and his researches. However his shelter is located by the mutants that break into the place with tragic consequences.<br/><br/>When I was a teenager, ""The Omega Man"" (1971) was a very successful film in the movie theaters and I probably have seen this movie about ten times along my life. In my opinion, it is one of the best Apocalyptic Sci-Fi movies of the 70's (together with 'Soylent Green'), when the world had the cold war to threaten and the population had a great fear of a biological weapons. A couple of years ago, I saw the original ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964), a frightening and dark view of the fate of mankind. In those years, the preoccupation with radiation and biological weapons due to the cold war leaded people to this type of fear and preoccupation.<br/><br/>Both versions are great movies because Richard Matheson's novel ""I Am Legend"" is excellent. Therefore my expectations with this new remake was the greatest possible, especially because of the name of Will Smith in the role of Robert Neville. Unfortunately this version is the weakest among the three foregoing movies. The director Francis Lawrence forgot that a movie is not only explosions and special effects and wasted the opportunity to make a great film. The strong and fast creatures are ridiculous when compared with the zombies in ""The Last Man on Earth"" or the dark sect leaded by Mathias in ""The Omega Man"". Further, the alternative ending on DVD is something ridiculous. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Eu Sou a Lenda"" (""I Am the Legend"")"

"Sebastian1966","6","8","12","16 December 2007"," Yet another opportunity to adapt this great novel falls short!
","Warning! This review is written by a lover of the original novel by Richard Matheson! Right up front. Now, I've been disappointed by the two prior attempts to film this book; ""Last Man On Earth"" (1964) w. Vincent Price (fatally miscast) and ""The Omega Man"" (1971) w. Charlton Heston (better production value; dated script). In every version, the basic story is the same; a lone survivor of a vampiric plague struggling to keep his ebbing sanity intact. With all the money poured into this film, a lot of it did wind up on screen. The deserted Manhattan is breath-taking in scope and realism. You can almost feel the mosquitoes in the air! The desolation really captures a lot of the creepy feeling from the first half of ""Omega Man."" Will Smith turns in an excellent performance (one of his best) and I was pleased he did NOT turn this into another ""ID4"" or ""I, Robot."" Ever since ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" I have a profound respect for his talent. My only problem was with the ""smart-guy glasses"" he wears in his lab. Reminds me of when an attractive woman plays a nerd by donning spectacles! Clark Kent syndrome! It might've been more intriguing if Smith's character, Col. Robert Neville, M.D. had been a layman civilian (as he was in the book) who had to educate himself to combat the plague. This would've played to Smith's benefit; as he is more believable as a likable everyman than a top-notch military doctor. However, the film starts to really falter after we see the ""infecteds,"" or ""night (insert scary plural noun here)."" They are a pack of phony-looking, video-game quality 'Gollums' on steroids. OK, so these former humans are ill; how does this ""illness"" enable them to become strong as horses and to defy physical laws (leaping 20 ft in the air?? Gimme a break! They're supposed to be HALF-DEAD! Did ANYONE involved read the damn book)? This lack of believability killed the tension completely (unless one finds video-game level violence 'scary'). And making them louder did NOT make them scarier! Good makeup, combined with shadowy lighting and judicious editing would've helped A LOT! In the all-digital theater I saw this in (great presentation, ironically), the CGI limitations were glaringly obvious(even the ice surrounding one of the captured creatures had a gelatinous, fake texture). And then there's the dog. The book has a desperately lonely Neville reaching out to a semi-wild stray. The movie begins w. Neville and dog roaming the streets of Manhattan like Mad Max! Gone is the point of the dog in the book; one man's fevered attempt to try to reach out to another living creature. And the months it takes Neville to win its trust. It was a labor of love. Here, it just serves to make Smith more sympathetic; a cheap trick of audience manipulation rather than a slowly earned trust. The ending is pure Hollywood as well. Much more ""hopeful"" and ""warm-fuzzy"" than the darker, more fatalistic tone of the book. None of the betrayal, either. Except to fans of the book, like myself! Well, that makes three strikes (in trying to bring ""Legend"" to the silver screen). I don't suppose they might try to adapt the book again in 10 yrs? Doubt it. Better just to read the book and forget the adaptations. But if there IS a next time, LOSE the phony, CGI vampires. They were both laughable AND embarrassing. I Am Legend (the film), sadly, will NEVER be!"

","I am thoroughly shocked by the sheer amount of positive reviews of this woefully inept film here on the IMDb board, I had the misfortune to sit through this last night and after reading the positive reviews here I thought that I was watching a totally different film. The special effects were terrible and in 6 months time this film will look dated, the whole film was souless, not to mention clichéd, the characterisation was too generic and I can only believe the reason this film got great reviews here on IMDb was because the majority of reviewers were Will Smith fans that would have praised any film in which he starred. The Omega Man while being far from perfect is an easily superior effort and The Last Man on Earth beats it too, 2 classic films in their own right. This latest adaption of the Matheson novel is sadly lacking in all depts, it stinks of Hollywood cliché, no wonder Hollywood is churning out so much crap when this kind of movie gets treated like a masterpiece, long live The Omega Man and The last man on Earth This is an awful awful awful awful film, anyone with half a brain should avoid this like the plague<br/><br/>The fact that the majority of reviews of this film are positive could very possibly be down to Hollywood moles bombarding IMDb with fake reviews in order to attract the gullible"
"petervmeer","3","9","14","10 January 2008"," No, no, NO!
","At first I was really excited when I heard that there would be a remake of Mathesons novella (The first attempt I know of is Omega Man).<br/><br/>Matheson is in my opinion one of the great sci-fi writers of the USA and this short story was just perfect for a film adaptation if done right. And that's where it starts breaking down. The book's story is bleak and depressing. Neville is basically an above average drunk who is coping with solitude, depression, and struggling with the fact he had to kill his wife. Will Smith as the lead character however, is a super smart scientist with the DOD and his wife died in a helicopter accident. He is chiseled, intelligent and has a huge luxurious house in Manhattan, and in the opening scene he races a brand new shiny Ford mustang through the empty streets of NY. <br/><br/>In the book, he is hunter by day and hunted by semi intelligent vampires at night. This added so much suspense to the book that is completely gone in the movie. The woman he meets and who eventually betrays him is turned into a sappy family looking for a knight in shining armor. Again, Hollywood sacrifices fantastic plot, emotion and suspense for safe box office revenue. The final chapter, where Neville is killed to give way to a new race was (to me) deep and profound, so becoming 'Legend'. The last man. <br/><br/>None of that in this Hollywood movie though. They have shareholders to please and therefore movies that don't have a happy ending or where disturbing things happen are a no no and only for indie films. They could make movie goers unhappy. So instead of a great story that makes you think, they replace all of it with candy and a formulaic approach to a horror-thriller; Smith gets to be the hero and saves the day (with the previous paragraphs I have written that's hardly a spoiler). Another great book raped. I gave it 3/10 because I was able to finish it and it killed an hour and a half."
"stoweh","5","9","14","26 December 2007"," *Spoilers* Horrible Adaptation and Ending, Well Acted by Will Smith
","This movie is easy enough to like if you have not read the book it seems to be very loosely based on. Let me preface by saying I went into this movie expecting great things given the nature of the book and what I believed would be something incredibly more insightful and meaningful than a typical zombie flick.<br/><br/>It wasn't long before it became apparent that the movie wasn't going to be faithful to the book. OK. That's fine, a large mistake in my opinion, but not a fatal one. The first 3/4 of the movie sees Will Smith struggling to cope with his loneliness in a post apocalyptic New York city. He is alone, save his canine companion Sam, or so we think until we see that Zombie like, albeit more intelligent and agile creatures hide in the dark and feast at night. This is all well acted by Smith as he shows the effects of paranoia and loneliness on a person. Then the stumbling block falls into play. Enter a woman and child who save Smith from certain death, who shatter the themes and ideas that the film has been developing all along. What we see from this point on, is a typical Hollywood film that seems to relegate Smith more to the role of an action star. The sour cherry on top is when the ending when the woman and child discover a civilization of survivors. All that is lost is smith, and he is made a hero icon. It is at this point that I realized how badly Hollywood butchered the idea of the book.<br/><br/>In the book the I Am Legend title stems from the fact that as many others have pointed out Neville becomes a pariah figure by a race of vampires who view him ironically enough as the outcast, not because he is a hero figure for future generations. Simply Awful."
"mrcohiba","6","13","22","14 December 2007"," Could have been a lot better if plot/logic gaps addressed
","I'll second that the film captures viewers' interest through first 2/3 of the film, and then it goes Hollywood schlocky and looks for a pat ending. Will earned his salary, and the set designers and location scouts did a great job and hopefully were paid well above scale, which must have left insufficient funds for the the CGI folk and the script writers.<br/><br/>So some problems I had with the story -- spoilers for sure: 1) So um, how did the later introduced pair of characters drive to and out of Manhattan? Bridges down, tunnels too (or if not, zombie-infested)...<br/><br/>2) Did the storyline change in the cutting room? Dr. sets animal trap and captures girl zombie, male leader zombie howls, Dr. falls for same but even more creative animal trap set presumably by male leader zombie, male leader zombie captures but doesn't kill Dr. in later dock encounter, male leader zombie tracks Dr. back to his lab.... um, why didn't the whole story line of zombies are evolving and are regaining ""human"" emotions get explored with this ""love rescue"" setup? Who is the monster, etc., etc.<br/><br/>3) Dr. is this Time-magazine-cover superstar virologist. How does handing over a single vial of a problematic test vaccine help without the means or associated research to synthesize more? Hundreds of more zombies on the scent, so hiding in a cubbyhole will save you? 4) Lot of deer in an unbalanced ravenous carnivore environment.<br/><br/>5) I lost the logic where Dr. is flatly reciting the numbers of outright dead, infected, immune -- sounded like no good scientist would believe that given large numbers of theorized immune why he would be the last human on earth. Isolated islands, small population areas, areas with no caves/permanent structures to shield sun's UV, Government pathogen barrier facilities, etc."

I've gone back and rated THE OMEGA MAN higher than I had before I saw the (progressively-worsening) trailers for this one. I now see it for the towering achievement it truly is. The Corringtons (who, together, can't hold a candle to the writings of the grandest of the Grand Masters of Horror, Richard Matheson) dumbed down the original story for a 1971 audience and the witless wonders behind this one apparently didn't bother to go back and read the book: they simply used the Corrington script as their jumping off point (if only!). Casting a lead whose credentials are questionable at best didn't help. Opting to turn the vampires of the novel into cgi mutants may've seemed to the filmmakers to be yet another stroke of genius- but it wasn't. By a mile. Only someone whose tastes run to videocy (video game idiocy) could truly appreciate the monsters in this one. (There are some great shots of a deserted New York city- but, with a price tag of $5 million, there ought to be... At the very least.) Dumber even than THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, I AM LEGEND reeks."

It was instead the time and effort spent to build the character to a point where we feel for him, therefore the scary parts really were scary. <br/><br/>Then, it just devolved into really really really bad CGI monsters and video-game style film making that made me instantly bored. If only the film makers could have trusted their character (and the original story) and given the audience the thrilling post apocalyptic story with some heady substance that the first act promised. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt disappointed in everyone involved.

","First let me say that will smith is terribly overrated as an actor. That out of the way this film cannot be blamed on his performance. Apparently, the current horror/action adventure paradigm coming out of Hollywood seems to be to hype such movies to death and then throw as much CGI at the audience as can be afforded. Then pay off the initial critics to stimulate attendance. Unlike ""The last man on earth"" with Vincent Price (which is a vastly superior movie) this movie has no soul and fails to generate the proper (or any!) atmosphere. The VP movie was ultra low budget but told the story perfectly and conveyed the hero's despair over losing his child, his wife and ultimately his world to a mysterious plague.

Praying for something new after having plunked down $15 will, however, be a waste of time.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance? No better than a copy of the hackneyed portrayal of the same character by Charlton Heston in the last remake - one-dimensional and shallow. Shame on Smith for doing this low-grade movie. I expect to next see Smith doing 30-minute TV commercials for KTel or the next incarnation of the ""Thigh Master"".<br/><br/>While still not the best, the Heston remake - ""The Omega Man"" - at least had a compelling story that gave pause for thought.

My 2-year-old cousin has more imagination.<br/><br/>Cliché 5  Not only are there zombies, but the zombies only come out in the dark! Wow! If I close my eyes and pretend that this hasn't been done 1000 times, I might find that kinda cool! Cliché 6  The main character sacrifices himself for the good of a woman and humanity . . .<br/><br/>Cliché 7  . . . but like every other Hollywood hit that the critics love, he's too stupid for his own good. He had close to a minute (yes, I counted) to open up the shutter and escape the grenade, but he just stood there like a retarded teenager as it went off.<br/><br/>Cliché 8  Boring opening, just like the cliché critics love. It took an hour and a half before anything action-like happened. Oh wait, there was no action. I'm thinking about myself peeing after it was overthat was more action-packed than the entire movie put together.<br/><br/>Cliché 9  Flat characters who's names I couldn't even remember during the movie, much less after it was over.<br/><br/>Cliché 10  This is my favorite. Can you guess it? Everything in this movie has been done in at least 3 other movies I can think of off the top of my head.<br/><br/>People say Napoleon Dynamite didn't have a plot? Honestly, folks, this was more pointless than Napoleon even could have been. And at least he wasn't a sad cliché who was too stupid to open up a door and save his life.<br/><br/>And I'm not even going to go into the boring pretentiousness of everything else this movie tried to be but wasn't.

In place of the dog, we get more ""undead"" which all like Imotep from The Mummy movie - ie they don't look realistic AT ALL.

Then, to crown it off- the butterfly reference at the end- i am sick of Hollywood movies spelling out these metaphors to the point where it is insulting as they take us for people that can't put 2 and 2 together- which reminds me of that scene in Home Alone where Joe Pieci's (sp?) character comes into the house and they put that twinkling tooth animation in there...ah, yes, we get the point- he was the same guy as before!<br/><br/>If that wasn't worse enough the writers wrote themselves into a hole at the very end, as with the characters- <br/><br/>1) There is room for you in here Will- yeah, don't bother going in there with them 2)Will has more experience surviving rather than her and the kid- he should have stayed there to protect them 3)He blows himself up..ahh yeah i see how that would have destroyed all those other infected people in the room 4) The writers cut to the end scene which don't even show how the hell the 2 characters get out of that crazy situation with many, many infected people coming to get them. 5) Didn't like the idea of the cure.<br/><br/>Overall- good at the start, but waaaay too big crash at the end! 6/10"

","It never fails to amaze me how terrified Hollywood studios seem to be of deviating from clichés.<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson, the inspiration for a lot of successful horror writers and movie directors (Stephen King and George A. Romero among them), was written in 1954 and could reasonably claim to have set the bar for all post apocalyptic fiction. It was brilliantly realised, and is, for the record, one of my all time favourite books, not least for the amazing revelation at the ending which defines in one shocking and horrifying moment the real truth of the protagonists existence.<br/><br/>53 years after this book was published, they made this movie. Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.<br/><br/>I had fears that this movie would parallel ""I Robot"", which was another hammy Will Smith movie that twisted the great story or stories it was based on into predictable Hollywood pap. Sadly, my fears were not to be assuaged.<br/><br/>However, while ""I Robot"" took a number of Asimov concepts, and made them less than the sum of its parts, ""I Am Legend"" is a hack job, plain and simple. I criticise this film entirely on the fact that its creators had the sheer chutzpah to borrow the same title from that classic novel, and then alter the storyline out of all recognition. They evidently did not realise why the book was called ""I Am Legend"" in the first place.<br/><br/>It is a worrying trend, I think, that movie and TV producers think they can use expensive imagery to distract their audiences from pathetic and predictable cliché, when their original source material could have made their movie so much more brave and better. Do they think we are all idiots? Because if that is the case, then my feeling about them is most certainly mutual.<br/><br/>For the record, I like Will Smith in some of his roles (Enemy of the State), but I really wish he would stop accepting roles in movies which shamelessly bowdlerise the original material. Especially material which is very close to my heart. 0/10."

","Having read the book I was eager to see this film but as with many Hollywood adaptations money can't buy a good script. The ending has been completely changed to appeal to popcorn munching sheep. Did the story need CGI? No! But that's what seems to sell a film these days. Why can't someone outside Hollywood make a decent adaption to these classic books? Sadly the answer is because Hollywood has bought the rights to the scripts. As the wise know Hollywood is about making money not making a good film.<br/><br/>If you like Will Smith and millions of dollars worth of CGI then this film is for you.......but I you urge to read the book which is fantastic and much more rewarding!"

","I had high hopes for this movie, especially since I really like Will Smith and the trailer looked cool. Now I must admit, I'm not much of a sci-fi fan. But this movie looked really interesting. Yet I was really disappointed with the entire film. I thought using real people instead of computer graphics for the mutants would have been much more intense and frightening. And it seemed like a long movie even thought it really wasn't. Smith was decent, especially since he really didn't have much to work with. The movie didn't draw the viewer into the story at all for me. It seemed like it all just kind of happened on the screen and you understand why, but I had no connection with any of it. Giving a little more background information and less graphics would have been much better. Overall, I would never consider watching it again, even if it came on dish for free."

","Unbelievable, I saw this movie with a friend we wanted to see walk hard but it wasn't out till the day after. I didn't expect much but this was one of the WORST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!! I'll sum it up, it was a rip off of 28 days later with some plot changes (probably so they wouldn't get sued). I know 28 days obviously got there ideas from george romero but it was way too close to 28 days. I expected will smith to act like more of an egotistical jerk like usual but actually he wasn't the annoying thing about the movie. Not one person put on zombie makeup in this movie, NOT ONE, which sucks all the fun out of it, because the zombies in this looked SOOOO fake. I believed Roger Rabbit was playing opposite a live cast more than these zombies. I can stand some cg but every zombie was bad super fake looking cg, this movie actually looks worse than the mummy cg (or about the same). I didn't believe one scene there zombies were in, therefore it couldn't possibly be even remotely menacing or scary. Is it that hard to do it old school with real people? They certainly had the budget for it. The 28 guys and Romero can do it. Forget this and rent a good horror movie, the mind boggling part is I expected like 3 star rating on here for this movie, who's giving this piece good reviews is everyone blind. The bad thing is this review is from someone who actually likes Star Wars Episode 2 & 3, which while it did have too much cg, still looked 100 times more convincing than this one. This movie was pathetic and whoever directed it deserves a sh*t sandwich.<br/><br/>Nathan"

","If you have read the book please don't put yourself through this absolute travesty.<br/><br/>This is Hollywood at its worst!

"ldoig","3","20","39","26 December 2007"," Terrible...and is it me or is some of the morality of this a bit off?
","I was really, really looking forward to this. Huge fan of the book, out for Christmas, big-budget etc etc and find myself watching one of the worst films I have seen in years! I'm still in shock, if you haven't read the book, do so, you can do it in a couple of hours and like me you'll think, ""If they film this, they just can't mess it up, it's brilliant! It's scary! It's got everything, it's just asking to be filmed, they just can't go wrong."" <br/><br/>Oh...but they can...oh yes they can! <br/><br/>Actually, there are many good points about the awfulness of this film already made by others so I won't go on, read them, but firstly, the voting...I'm no longer convinced by it on this site anymore, I've seen far too many poor films get high votes that I'm simply left incredulous by. I really don't won't to be left with the notion that people are that thick, and I know they're not so all I can say is don't trust the voting system with modern blockbusters.<br/><br/>But, if it is true then I've noticed that most high votes are by ""children"" under 18 so I can forgive them their ignorance and lack of life experience, not that reading a short novella really takes any time or anything kids...<br/><br/>Secondly, why CGI? Surely the studio knew it looked awful (and it really does look dire), why on earth didn't they use actors? Surely 28 Days Later set a benchmark, and that was one of ours! (Sorry Brit here, used to low budgets you know, you have to like, improvise...) Of the million and one ways you could make a vampire/zombie type thing look scary and you totally and utterly fail on every count. Or was it deliberate? To maybe add to the unbelievability of the story? Or was this deliberate sabotage? I'm serious, they looked that awful I'm left wondering if there isn't more to it...<br/><br/>Then there's the third and more serious point I want to make. This is a classic science fiction novel, about the ""science"" of vampires. There's an awful lot to digest, and it's fairly light stuff really, let alone the heartbreaking stuff with the heroes (or antihero depends how you look at it)wife returning from the dead.<br/><br/>How dare someone then, turn this into a dodgy polemic on racism! Or at the very least in an extremely banal way on ""bad"" people. Is it me, or did all the infected look like members of the Neo-Nazis? Even then, what's with the religious spin? What's going on with a ""colony"" of uninfected in Vermont...land of the chosen few? Puritans!?!? The first settlers!? I noticed a lot of very dissatisfied grunts in Greenwich cinema, admittedly a more educated audience than most, but it really didn't sit well at all. Most I'd guess are expecting science-fiction, not some seriously messed up and confused comment on current US morality. <br/><br/>Fourthly was simply how much was missing. Will there be a fuller cut in the future perhaps? Was it cut to shreds for some reason? There's an awful lot unexplained and when it is it's done poorly. In fact when Anna and Ethan arrive I genuinely thought the film was going to return to the book and have them as more ""evolved"" vampires or something. But, oh no, they came all the way up from Brazil, all sweet and sound, totally safely and saved Will's life when he was having a bit of a turn. I mean, for crying out loud!! We went through this with 28 Week's Later - will studio types stop insulting our intelligence!!<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and what was it with the leader Nazi/infected headbanger? He some former ""bad"" man or something? Maybe political? Gee, maybe like, he was supposed to be George Bush Jnr, and like Will was the righteous man fighting for truth, you know like, keeping it real, right to the end. <br/><br/>Actually the sad thing is, Will Smith is really quite good in this, his performance simply cannot deny what a truly awful film this is. I'm a little disappointed to see however the film get rave reviews simply because he is in it, that's a shame, but credit where it's due. If the film was half decent they'd be talking about him in this in years to come. They won't now. <br/><br/>Still, I'm left feeling that I want to cry now.<br/><br/>One day someone will make a really good film of ""I am Legend"". They Will, really. (OK, terrible pun...)"
"TheEmulator23","5","10","17","7 January 2008"," The most overrated movie of 2007!

I should remind you people that just because you have good effects that does not make a movie! This is so dragged out and utterly pointless I just kept hoping it would get better; it didn't. There is some good shots and I can't stand shaky cam very much, but even this is done well. Please don't watch this unless you want a pretty mediocre flick. I will give Will the only reason that this has done a decent. Don't watch this. It is utterly and completely overrated. In fact, if this didn't star Will Smith, it would have been totally panned and no one would have seen it."
"buddybickford","1","5","7","13 November 2009"," Even IMAX can't squeeze adrenaline from this
","By choosing IMAX I assume the idea was to help stimulate a 'scared' response from the viewers, I understand this suggestion, and I would wager that part of the production team came up with this suggestion AFTER they saw the script, as the technology needed to make this film scary 'Throw the audience of a ledge a vision' hasn't been perfected yet.<br/><br/>I can't understand why a film inspired so obviously by 28 days later never learned anything from its idol. For example the very reason why 28 days later was terrifying was because the ghouls were human, not almost human, not CGI, but human. It is the very idea that Humans could be responsible, just by a change in nature to become the raging monsters that terrified us so much in 28 days later. Therefore why did the director choose to distance us from such a possibility and 'possibility' is the key to this type of terror, the likelihood of it happening for real is what makes this genre scary when done correctly. Instead he chose the worst CGI I have ever seen (they even CGI a Lion (Badly) why don't we have real lions? or trees for that matter?), each ghoul had the same features, why? they all looked like London cycle couriers, they just lacked the laptop saddlebag with the strap that femininely goes across the chest! and more importantly they DID NOT LOOK REAL, this is an absolutely important point THEY DID NOT LOOK REAL. The lack of 'real' makes things unreal which again relaxes the audience as they know it's not REEEEAAAALLLLL.<br/><br/>The Director also owes Will Smith, he delivered his lines with 100% commitment, the script was so poor, weak and lame that it drew attention to the mechanics of the film and its film making, as one became aware of this serious weakness, nevertheless Will Smith persevered, and even cried in one scene so top marks. I also cried, but only because I remembered that the Director and script writer of this rubbish would be a lot richer than me."
"bushtony","4","5","7","1 June 2008"," I Am Lacking
","Let's get my history out of the way first. I'm a big fan of the groundbreaking book. It represents the first and perhaps the most defining modern horror/fantasy novella ever to re-position the genre in genuine and contemporary circumstances which are recognisable and relatable to most of us. No Gothic castles or dense European locales replete with dark-haired men in capes slavering over bodice bursting virgins. Horror fiction came home. It roosted it's lethal vampiric form in the suburban and the urban. And a new genre was born. Stephen King is merely one writer who accredits IAL as being his major literary influence. It reinvented the genre. It deserves respect. More so than the movies has ever given it.<br/><br/>There has been no satisfactory cinematic version to date, and Will Smith's update is no exception. ""The Last Man On Earth"" was cheap, poorly edited, badly shot and gratuitously schlocky. ""The Omega Man"" turned its' premise into a hippie-based pseudo-religious fable and the undead into a mutated cabal of cult followers in monk-like garb. Way out sheet, man! Then along comes Will. And a $150, 000, 000 budget. So, what do we get for entertainment in this day an age and at this particular price? I'd like to pick out the plus points. The depiction of a ruined, desolate city, ravaged by plague is superbly rendered. The production values are well represented up there on the screen and it shows where they spent a lot of the dough. Will acquits himself fairly well, especially in the scene where he kills his only companion  the infected German Sheppard. He tries really hard to give a value-for-money emotive performance and comes close to pulling it off on a few occasions. The art direction is spot on and the whole production glows with that big-budget epic sheen. The ending  and Neville's fate  was, I think, a brave move for such a big-budget production, and I applaud the producers for taking the route they did.<br/><br/>The downsides: The film comes off as flat as a pancake and almost pleasantly banal. I have long since accepted that Hollywood is incapable of filming a straight adaptation of Matheson's scary and atmospheric novel, so I wasn't expecting that. I was, however, expecting some visceral thrills, chills, spills and jolts along the lines of the ""28 Days/Weeks Later"" movies at the very least. There's a lack of real blood and guts and the CGI rendered infected mutants are quite tame and poorly rendered overall. They were not frightening and imposing in the way that the infected in the ""28 Days/Weeks Later"" films were. I suppose because in IAL they looked like what they were for the most part  computer generated animations. They did not present as remotely real or realistic. Impossible, therefore, to take seriously. I'm going to assume the shock/horror/gore was deliberately toned way down to avoid getting an ""R"" rating Stateside and thus perhaps limiting the films box-office appeal. In the process, the movie had its claws trimmed and impact diluted.<br/><br/>IAL generates little atmosphere. Heston's ""The Omega Man"" sees the protagonist cruising deserted streets littered with decaying corpses, shooting at anything that moves with his machine gun, a paranoid loner close to the edge. It strikes a primal chord. IAL gives us a flashy superstar racing at high speed through too-clean looking, corpse free cityscapes, hunting deer with his rifle and his dog, chilling out to Bob Marley. It's not apocalyptically unsettling or unnerving. Will seems to be having a little too much fun, whereas Chuck was understandably becoming increasingly mad, bad and dangerous to know.<br/><br/>The script is littered with some truly clunking dialogue and Will does his best with it. Ultimately, though, he is sorely miscast and too darn friendly, cosy and nice generally to project the edgy, paranoid, grief-stricken obsessive personality of Neville in anything approximating a believable frame of reference. It's not that he's out of his depth, just in the wrong picture for his particular talents.<br/><br/>I'm not going to dwell on the inconsistencies in the script or how, for a supposedly intelligent guy, Neville fails to see the infected as socially evolving  there is a ""leader"" who shows open defiance by venturing into sunlight, luring him into a trap and sets infected dogs on him (clear evidence of an ordered thought process). Instead, he sees them as devolving to a more sub-human state. For a scientist, that's not very bright.<br/><br/>Bottom line, yes, I was moderately entertained for the duration, the film held my attention despite very little adherence to or respect for the source material. Although miscast, Smith approaches his role with commendable enthusiasm but is badly let down by the shoddy script and the awesomely detached performances of Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan. It would have been a nice touch if Anna and Ethan had turned out to be further evolutionary mutations of the infection out to capture Neville and not be just arbitrarily immune  tipping a nod to the book at least  but it was not to be.<br/><br/>Although it's a futile hope, one day someone somewhere may see the validity in realising in cinematic terms ""I Am Legend"" as a faithful representation of the book in terms of its' content and themes. Until then, I'm afraid the current version will have to do, lacking as it is."

","I read the book this movie is based on when I was sixteen - an age when apocalyptic Science-Fiction leaves a big impression on your average teenager.<br/><br/>I loved the book. I also love most of Will Smith's work. And I love big-budget, high-concept sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>But I am not happy about the sharp turn this movie takes in the last fifteen minutes, just before it seems to put Neville's desperate fight into perspective.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away (but you may not want to read this before you have seen the movie): There is a pretty good reason the book is called ""I am Legend"". It refers to the protagonist's role in a world where the sole human survivor - who represents *our* time and point of view - has turned into a monster feared by ""the next tenants""; the vampires and the ""still living."" The movie takes this message (that we, 21st century mankind, may become ghosts of the past) and turns it into its very opposite.<br/><br/>In the end, a cheesy voice-over tells us Neville becomes the ""legend"" not for the mutants/vampires, but for a group of good, God-fearing Americans that has survived in a cozy little village by the sea, complete with a pretty little church and soldiers at the gates. (Of course, all similarities to the first white settlers in a country ruled by gruesome red men is purely coincidental ...) And this tacked-on happy ending is pretty much the opposite of what Matheson tried to tell us with his novel: That our days as the dominating species may be numbered, and that when the day comes, it may be better to accept that we have not succeeded. 54 years after a man released a smart novel, box office logic dictates that Happy Smalltown USA has to prevail - no need for the average viewer to switch on his brain when he leaves the theater.<br/><br/>And frankly, this is more depressing than any ""negative"" ending the script writers could have chosen.<br/><br/>Good solid acting by Will Smith as usual and a convincing NY setting, so 4/10 for those who did their homework."

","I didn't expect much when I went to see this film but it disappointed none the less. I read the novel by Richard Matheson about 10 years ago and loved it. The premise (back then) was quite original and at only 160 pages, gripped me hard and did not let go. You really felt that you were inside Robert Neville's head and were experiencing what he was experiencing.<br/><br/>The film reflected hardly a shred of the classic piece of literature. I can't be asked typing out all of the differences but the main differences are as follows. Robert Neville was not a military scientist, he was an average Joe living in LA. Robert Neville did not have a child, only a wife who ended up infected with the virus and returned as a vampire. Robert Neville did not have a dog, he talked to himself mostly and yelled obscenities at the heckling vampires on his front lawn. The strange woman character in the book was found by him and was infected with the virus. He did not have some high tech lab where he was working on the cure. And last but not least....the vampires. In the film they were coherent and spoke. They were conscious and tormented Robert Neville which fuelled his madness & loneliness. They were not CGI, Resident Evil style monsters.<br/><br/>To be honest, I did not even feel that the film itself was a decent one even if I had not read the book. The portrayal of Robert Neville was quite shallow and the ending was severely rushed. I would not recommend this film as anything more than maybe a Blockbuster rental on a rainy Sunday afternoon."

","It is always slightly unfair to judge the depth or detail of any adapted-film in comparison to the novel from which it is sourced.<br/><br/>However, it is still unfortunate that the new movie of ""I Am Legend"" decided not to concentrate on the most poignant aspects of the novel, or the many other script-versions of the story that have appeared over the past ten years. This version glibly glosses-over much of the engaging detail to provide an entertaining, although bland, story gaping with many holes  leaving us wondering & wanting for more. <br/><br/>The weather-worn collapse of New York and the encroachment of Nature was fantastically delivered. The virus was credibly explained, but we were left with very little understanding of the nature of the 'infected', themselves  and I found it personally very difficult to find these poorly CGI'd cookie-cutter-creatures disturbing or credible, when all looked like they'd been cloned in a video-game. Actors in good old-fashioned make-up is what was needed here.<br/><br/>But where on Earth was Neville's emotional journey? ""I Am Legend"" is famous as the story of an everyman confronting crisis. A man who has to deal with the loss of his wife & child, his friends, his culture and world. To find purpose again after everything that gave his life meaning has been lost ... and to still have to fight for that life every single day.<br/><br/>We get some nice glimpses of his struggle, but this should have been the engine which drove this story through to its end.<br/><br/>And speaking of the end, where was the novel's hidden vampire-community of which Neville becomes the inadvertent ""boogey-man""? Where was reversal of fortune where Neville realises that the ""monsters"" were in fact just as scared of him as he of they ... and that he is in fact more of a monster than they are?<br/><br/>Further, Neville's death and the birth of a new form of humanity was the whole point of Matheson's original work. I understand that Hollywood fears unhappy-endings as box-office killers, but this isn't the new ""Pretty Woman"". The sci-fi/horror community want ideas, not pampering.

Didn't see anything new here, and I expected to, because of the title.<br/><br/>Remember ""Stephen King's Lawnmower Man"" and how it had nothing in common with the original story except the big red lawnmower? Decent flick, but why call it by the same title, then create an entirely different storyline? The whole point of the book was the main character, (an everyday suburban dweller who for no special reason happened to be the last person alive), realizing that the ""monsters"" he had been routinely and purposefully exterminating during the day had regained their intelligence and humanity, and HE HIMSELF had became the freak, the ""monster"", the creeping killer stalking the ""normal"" people while they slept. Just as we fear the night and the legend of the vampire, so these new beings came to fear HIM during the day, as they built their civilization from the ruins of ours. He was one, to their many, so they were now ""normal"" and he ***became the legend*** they would pass down to their children in frightening stories. Hence - ""I am legend.""<br/><br/>So.. um... where is that story line? It had guy's wife dying(human interest,) monsters (scary,) end of the world (scary,) guy killing monsters(action,) guy meets woman (love interest,)more monsters (scary,) big battle (scary action) and a BIG twist at the end.

Bur this highly educated, intelligent guy really thinks he'll somehow cure this all by himself in his basement? Easier to believe in zombies. <br/><br/>I don't see how this movie is any different than a hundred other ""end of the world"" horror/action flicks. Except for the creatures' sunlight problem, this was just another Resident Evil/28 Days/you name it generic zombie movie.

Overall I'm sorry to say but Will Smith should have overlooked this movie and moved on to do something better."
"pazu7","5","7","11","26 December 2007"," I Am Pabulum: Fresh Prince Of The Apocalypse (spoilers)
","Watch the first 20 minutes of this film carefully, because that's pretty much as good as it gets. Then you can go rent The Omega Man. It's a 36-year-old version of the same story, is laced with pretentious and vaguely right-wing undercurrents and cheesy effects, yet it's still a better film even with Charlton Heston as the protagonist.<br/><br/>The shame is that Will Smith really can act. Hey, I saw Ali, I know it can happen. But, if not for the obvious elements of the story, one would not know that his character lives in desperate solitude that borders on suicidal. Even his talking with mannequins or his dog comes off as quirky instead of the desperate attempt to cling to reality that it is. This inability to exemplify the desperation that is lurking just beneath the surface of Smith's obsessive dedication to duty, really ruins his character arc when, later in the film, he goes on a suicidal revenge quest. It makes no sense because there's been no emotional build up outside of the simply utilitarian dialogue and memory flashes.<br/><br/>But it's not all Smith's fault. Someone needs to yank the CG toys away from filmmakers, or at least convince them that big names, digital trickery and pop culture pandering cannot replace a good script.<br/><br/>I had temporary resurgence of hope when Smith was rescued from his failed suicide attempt. For just a moment it seemed that his rescuer had a hair lip or some imperfection that might wipe off the layer of superficiality that coated the film. But she turned out to be a vapidly beautiful woman with a vapidly charming young boy in tow, and she and Smith engaged in some equally vapid exchanges wherein we find that God has been talking to her. Ummm. anyway then comes time for the attack of the CG monsters and the film gets loud and brash and pretty pointless.<br/><br/>To be fair the action is OK, if rather predictable, and there are some great creepy moments, especially when Smith is navigating dark rooms filled with the infected. But IMO these moments get overshadowed by the over-doctored script, over digitized effects and the thematic pallor of the film. Omega Man at least engages the intellect with some philosophical arguments, as academic as they might be. ""Legend"" tries to make up for this lack of substance with innuendo, by Smith's love for Bob Marley. But even that comes off as pandering as opposed to making a subtle point.<br/><br/>I will admit it was absolutely amazing how they created an abandoned New York City. But I think 28 Days Later (a much better film made with a much smaller budget) stole their fire on that one.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a big budget escapist FX romp, go for it. It'll satisfy. But if you're seeking a good sci-fi film with subtext, intelligence and respect for the source material, as well as its audience, I'd keep looking.<br/><br/>And, please, someone hide the good books from Hollywood, before they film one again."

","It's the kind of film in which the people make very stupid mistakes... which cause events... where more stupid mistakes cause more chaos and crap to happen until eventually someone dies... and all this could have been avoided by any idiot with a brain. Too much CGI used... the kind of CGI you can tell... maybe it's me and I expect decent films but seriously I wouldn't bother wasting my time watching this.<br/><br/>Someone said to me, it's a zombie film with Will Smith, complaining about a zombie film is like complaining about bad pizza.<br/><br/>So this was my reply: For starters I can't cook, so if I decide to cook a pizza anyone tasting it will complain:):) hence the film is the same. I don't complain about Zombie movies... and these were not zombies, they were... humans with rabies... big difference. I loved all previous zombie films, from the Undead series to the latest Planet Terror one which was brilliant and Resident Evil.<br/><br/>These are proper Zombie films... this... well this was a mixture of Descent with Will Smith in a big city. Maybe it's me but like I said, 5 people watched this with me and we all agreed it was pants.<br/><br/>It's just another film that brings nothing new, nothing exciting, seems more like a cash in job, using Will Smith as a money making scheme. Maybe I expect too much out of Hollywood these days, sorry to say that this film did nothing to me, made me actually wish I watched something else instead of wasting a few hours. Also... this is a film about Will Smith:):)<br/><br/>This info is extra information I got from Wikipedia. So I think the film should have been left as a novel from the '50s and that's it, not bother remaking it for today.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a 1954 science fiction novel by Richard Matheson about the last man alive. Neville is apparently the only survivor of an apocalypse caused by a pandemic of bacteria, the symptoms of which are similar to vampirism. I Am Legend has had a profound effect on the horror and science fiction genres. For instance, it is one of the first stories to try to explain vampirism scientifically.<br/><br/>I Am Legend has been adapted to a feature-length film three times:<br/><br/>The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man, I Am Legend<br/><br/>My question is how can this film get so many stars?? Why would people settle for such a mediocre film..."

The one infected is ticked off his girlfriend was kidnapped, he set a trap for Nevill and had guard dogs attack Nevill.<br/><br/>But then it was like a Hollywood decided to do a rewrite of the second half. It was turned into another end of the world Alliens/28 days later/Dawn of the Dead movie.<br/><br/>The Eathan character made no sense. Why was this kid in the film? There was also no twist ending. That is the whole point of the title.<br/><br/>Smith is good, but he always is.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a action movie. Its okay.

"Skint111","6","20","41","14 December 2007"," Interesting semi-horror
","Caught a screening in London on Friday night and have to say that this must be the most downbeat major Hollywood product in some time. To say it is sombre is an understatement. I suspect it will split audiences, and that many Will Smith fans, expecting another of his action laden, feel-good shoot em ups, will be disappointed. <br/><br/>Smith himself is pretty good in the role, and, again, there are no concessions to the multiplex audience. His is a character who is seriously disturbed, abnormal even. No wonder when you see what he's been through and how he is forced to live his life. It's this refusal to pander to formulaic, predictable notions that sets the film apart from other blockbusters. <br/><br/>It also looks good - the special effects are as excellent as you'd expect nowadays but it's the deserted streets of New York, strewn with abandoned cars and other debris, that most catch the eye. Dialogue is sparse. I can't think of another big Hollywood movie with so little dialogue. The dialogue that is there is often witty and pointed. Again, it's a sign of the film's bravery, including a discourse on God. <br/><br/>But after all this - does the movie entertain? Well... kind of. As I say it's not a barrel of laughs. Meaningful incident appears sparse at the time of watching (thinking back later, you realise there was more going on than appeared) and the plot is, not surprisingly, very simple. The main fault with is that it doesn't inspire much affection. There's not really much to get the teeth into. Coming out at Christmas it may disappoint even more. <br/><br/>Well, that's my go at starting the ball rolling. I'll leave it for others to kick about a bit now.<br/><br/>PS Big thanks to the person who originally got this comment deleted. Well done! You must be the saddest person in the whole world."
"vithiet","8","2","2","18 June 2020"," Very good movie, but watch both endings
","No spoilers, but the ending is apparently very polarizing. Maybe that's why they made an Alternate Ending version, which pleases more people. The very strange thing for me is that I find the Alternate version to be a lot better and make a lot more sense BUT I tend to like the overall vibe of the regular ending. So I'd recommend watching both versions of the ending and be the judge. That said, regardless of the ending the move is very well worth the watch: great story, cinematography and performance from Will Smith. Special effects are still holding up 13 years later. Watching now during the 2020 quarantine gives an extra eerie feel to the experience as well... really hope this comment if read in the future will be seen as amusingly outdated (fingers crossed!)."

"Cineanalyst","6","2","2","8 May 2019"," Will Smith Tries to Save the World from CGI... He Fails
","Never mind the remake of the science-gone-wrong, vampire/zombie apocalypse scenario; ""I Am Legend"" seems of more, if still only slight, interest to me as reflecting its own making as a contest between man and computer-generated images. This seems all the more blatant today because the CGI tends not to hold up very well--if it ever did. The deer look especially unrealistic to me. So, in the movie, people and other living animals are turned into largely-CGI-created monsters. They look a bit like living creatures but not quite. Like the mannequins, an especially apt comparison within the movie. The irony is that this junk is supposed to be the attraction of these blockbusters, but this thing is completely carried by the human performance of Will Smith, the hero--plus his dog.<br/><br/>As great as Smith is in these popcorn flicks, though, even his heroics are no match for the havoc the CGI virus continues to wreak upon Hollywood. They even made that Batman v. Superman movie seen on a billboard within this movie. This was back in 2007... how prescient."
"WubsTheFadger","6","2","2","10 March 2018"," I Am Legend
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>Director Francis Lawrence has a way with suspense; jumping out of your seat is almost a requirement here. Onscreen, Manhattan transforms into a true island, isolated, removed, and falling apart. Weeds grow on the streets, Times Square is deserted, the Flatiron Building sits neglected, and an eerie hush has fallen. Bravo to the special effects crew, who have created a New York never seen before (except, perhaps, in Escape to New York). The results are nothing short of amazing.<br/><br/>But the story ultimately disappoints. It starts out strong, hooking viewers in, but it sputters in the end. It's as if the screenwriters (or director, or producer) ran out of ways to wrap it up. Or perhaps the film simply doesn't have the same nuances as the Richard Matheson book on which it's based. Still, you can't fault I Am Legend for trying to be different from the typical action thriller. Taking on such themes as mankind's need for companionship, the fight for survival, and the existence of God, it at least succeeds in making us think.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 6.0"

What has Bob Marley to do with this movie? Maybe his shallow 'oh-poor-me-the-victim' music? Of course the stupid scientist who caused the extinction of humanity could not have been American.

"the_naked_airplane","5","2","2","18 July 2011"," Disappointing
","The build up to this suggested a some potential, however this film is merely average which is a disappointment when all's said and done.<br/><br/>The main problems being the dodgy CGI (I thought Hollywood blockbusters were past this but apparently not) of the seekers. Some horrible dialogue at times 'I was saving that bacon'!!!. There are jumpy moments and I'm sure i left my seat a couple of times but 'boo' doesn't quite cut it these days. Aside from the scene searching for the dog the slow paced approach is wasted by ridiculous passages discussing the music of Bob Marley (there are better examples that struck me at the time but I forget now). Rather than explore the cause or delve deeper into Robert Neville's psyche. There's no real atmosphere of eerie tension which should be built up instead time is wasted in a relatively short film. Having said that the deserted New York looks impressive."
"ballerina1978","4","2","2","29 June 2010"," Legend?
","This is probably the best Will Smith movie I've seen. But I am not sure that is saying much. It is the story of a man in a post-apocalyptic future. He has to fend for survival against these zombie like monsters who used to be human. There were some good moments. I liked the part where they capture him and tie him upside down. The whole crash scene with the car at the docks was well done. Unfortunately, the biggest problem I found was the CGI for the monsters just looked fake. It almost ruined the experience for me. In the theater where I saw this, I even heard a few other people mention it didn't look good as far as CGI is involved. The other thing I didn't like too much was the whole storyline with the woman and the child. It made a film that should be more action into a soap opera type of thing. That got boring fast. The thing that was the best was the fight scenes. I also liked how his apartment on Washington square is cut off from all the rest of the town, like a bunker. All in all, worth checking out at least as a rental if you like action sci-fi films."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","2","8 May 2008"," Emma Thompson destroys the world!
","In the near future, a self-effacing Dr Emma Thompson discovers a cure for cancer that also has the unfortunate side effect of causing the end of the world. Clearly someone didn't carry out their clinical trials as thoroughly as they should Fast-forward three years and we're introduced to Will Smith's Robert Neville, a former military scientist, hunting wild deer from his sports car in central New York. The once vibrant city is now an eerie wasteland, bereft of all human life (or bodies, come to that) through which Neville trawls with military planning in search of human life. Ironically, once he eventually finds it, his relatively secure - if lonely - existence quickly begins to fall apart.<br/><br/>The overall impression I got after watching I Am Legend was that of an opportunity wasted. It's been a long time since I watched The Omega Man, but I recall that that film was also fairly disappointing once the curiosity value of a lone man speeding through lifeless city streets had worn off. Heston's version ill-advisedly strayed into vampire territory, with the viruses victims turning into albino-like creatures unable to come out into the sun but capable of logical thought and communication. Here, the afflicted are little more than feral animals, and in this respect at least, the later version is more believable. But where are the charred and ruined buildings, the car smashes, the looted stores, the putrefying bodies, the rats? Post-apocalyptic NY simply looks like a place from which people have been plucked and some undergrowth added. I only saw this on the small screen, but the vision of this NY didn't really convince, and any attempt at verisimilitude is minimal.<br/><br/>Smith is on the screen alone for much of the film with only his faithful German Shepherd for company, and he does quite well. His Robert Neville continues to search for an antidote to the virus, even as its victims try to kill him. Sam, his dog, is his last link with the old world and his family, and the scene in which Neville must kill her to prevent her from becoming completely infected from the virus is strangely affecting. Neville's coping mechanisms are also explored, if only cursorily, but they add some depth to a character that otherwise has very little. He sets up mannequins in the DVD store he regularly frequents (modern technology means the scene in which Heston repeats the words of an interviewee from Woodstock in a deserted auditorium can't be replicated here - the best the writers can come up with is Smith quoting the lines from Shrek as it plays on his DVD ('I like Shrek' he asserts helpfully)) and talks to them as if they're real people, and it these kind of small acts of madness that keep him sane.<br/><br/>As others have commented, things fall apart fairly badly in the final third of the picture, when it abandons its study of Neville's trauma in favour of both a more conventional action genre conflict and a quite frankly ludicrous diversion into fellow survivor Anna's (Alice Braga) crackpot belief that god has determined that Neville and she should have met. The film's overblown conclusion even goes pretty much all the way towards confirming her theory with a badly misjudged happy ending that simply refuses to be believable."

"p_jones92","5","2","2","12 March 2008"," Falls rather flat......
","This movie was quite trumpeted in the press when in first came out in theaters, and Will Smith duly obliged by appearing on every single show and radio station promoting the movie, hyping it up. After all that, and the promise it held, it's a rather underwhelming experience.<br/><br/>The production history of this movie is a legend unto itself, having a version of the story made in the 70's, and 3 attempts at a more faithful to the book version since then, so you would imagine that would mean that there was an interesting story to be told here. Now, I haven't read the book, so I don't know how it is, but going by this movie, I can't see why there was such a keenness to get it made. <br/><br/>Will Smith plays Robert, a Lt, Corporal something or other who somehow has participated in producing a vaccine for cancer, which inadvertently goes wrong and kills 90% of the worlds population. Of the remaining population, 9% get turned into ""dark runners"" vampires/zombies for all intents and purposes who only come out at night, and the remaining 1% are their food. Will's character is stranded in New York City, after it was quarantined and he sent his family off to a safe haven and stayed behind so he could find a cure for the vaccine ""as NY is ground zero"". After 2 years of living with just his dog on the island, only going out during the day, he is yet to find a cure for the ""dark runners"". <br/><br/>The opening 30 mins follows Will during his daily routines, hunting for food, searching buildings for survivors/supplies, working on his vaccine etc. It works for while, but the problem with just having Will and a dog is that there's not much going on, we get flashbacks to the night of the quarantine from time to time and what happened that night, but it's not enough to engage you, so you have to rely on Will being interesting, and unfortunately he's not. Some actors can act and tell a story with their facial expressions alone, and this is what was needed in this movie with such little dialog, but I'm afraid this doesn't seem to be Will's strength as an actor, and it leaves you begging for some action/drama to allow some more scope.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are few action scenes (3 in the whole movie), and these are also very underwhelming. If the dark runners are supposed to be human, then why are they completely computer generated? And why were they poorly computer generated at that? You don't fear them at all, you just keeping saying ""Hey, that's really bad effects"".<br/><br/>About an hour in some fellow survivors arrive on the scene, and you hope the story picks up, but unfortunately it doesn't. The scenes feel contrived and cliché, with Will struggling to adapt to company, let alone a female and a child who remind him of the family he lost, and his acting in these scenes, especially the breakfast scene when he's trying to control his emotions, seems very forced and over acted.<br/><br/>When the dark runners finally find his hide out and invade, you hope for a grandeur ending, but it doesn't materialize, it's quite quick and not very action packed.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is very at odds with itself. It's not the actioner you might expect it to be, it's not the horror/scary movie you might expect it to be, and it's not a strong performance by Will Smith, which is a shame, because I like a lot of it's work. It's really a hyped up version of 28 weeks later, with a bigger budget but less thrills, less action, and a poorer script, and you feel rather flat having watched it."
"jdesando","Null","26","56","12 December 2007"," Not legendary, but it Will do . ..
","I Am Legend is not 28 Days Later (my nominee for best horror/thriller of all time), but it is good for the post-apocalypse zombie/mutant genre. Sci-fi great Richard Matheson started it all with his novel in 1954; there have been numerous film versions, such as Charlton Heston's Omega Man, that have not been memorable; and this iteration is artistically less than 28 Days but still fun.<br/><br/>In other words, the last man standing is a durable conceit, good enough to titillate and deep enough to spark existential thoughts about the meaning of life and an individual's place in a seemingly random universe where one person making a difference is still a feckless cliché.<br/><br/>New York City is quarantined for a virus that has either wiped out most of the population or turned them into zombies. A scientist's (uncredited Emma Thompson) cancer cure is the cause of the subsequent plague. Will Smith plays the heroic doctor whose research may defeat the virus, but meanwhile don't go out after sunset, as all George Romero fans know only too well.<br/><br/>The shots of vacant New York are arresting (What else to expect from King Kong cinematographer Andrew Lesnie?) especially for those of us used to the difficulty of finding a cab at 5 PM. Will Smith is credible if not just a little too buff (Guess what? a gratuitous shot of him exercising shirtless!) but not too sentimental over the loss of his family to the virus. The notion that Vermont may be the home to survivors, should there be any, is an amusement to this critic, who fled its unsurvivable winters.<br/><br/>The formula is in tact, the edge of your seat just right for viewing, and those of us lost in reverie over Twilight Zone are revived. Smith, like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, proves capable of carrying off a film almost solo. Not lost to the star-power of Smith is the sub-textual staple of the zombie/mutant genre that aids is a global threat or ideological extremism makes us all the living dead."

","I was very excited to see this movie. I had high expectations due to the talent that was allocated for this film. Unfortunately some bad decision making went into the process when they decided to use CGI for the baddies. CGI can be used quite effectively, as it was used to transform NYC. However, the use of CGI for moving objects has not yet reached the maturity level where they become realistic. So what you have is blurs that streak across the screen meant to approximate motion. In the end it was quite disappointing. If they had just spent the money on actors and good makeup. 28 weeks later did a much better job overall. Sigh."

"filmmaestro","5","24","54","14 December 2007"," first half good, second half bad
","The movie sets itself up to be high in concept, low in intelligence. You can't expect a film like this to be ""great,"" so disregard such comments unless you're the type that takes Michael Bay's films seriously (unfortunately there are a lot of those people). For what it is--an event film--I Am Legend is above average. The first half is quite good, the second half quite bad. In the beginning we watch a man trying to live by himself in a city devoid of humans. He is lonely and it is this loneliness that he struggles with most. The dangerous ""dark seekers"" are actually secondary, that is, he has already learned to deal with them by the time the story begins. So then, what does the character need? This is something that never develops. We know he wants: to find a cure for the virus. But his personal need is quite different. He needs company. Once the opportunity arises he acts the fool. Consequently the protagonist has no satisfying arc. Consider a film with a comparable scenario, James Cameron's Aliens, in which the protagonist is likewise trapped in a space and surrounded by extremely deadly creatures. That film's protagonist not only escapes the alien creatures but saves the child Newt, with whom she had developed a mother-daughter connection. As a result she satisfies a personal need to redeem herself as a mother, a need established early in the film. That is her character arc. I Am Legend has no such character arc because the protagonist is alone throughout most of the film, has no opportunity to establish relationship dynamics with other characters because there are none. Cudos to the filmmakers for trying to pull off a flick that's mostly about a man and his dog, but in the end you see the limitations with such a concept. The teenies will get a kick out of seeing the monsters scream ad nauseum into the camera. But anyone with a soul and a brain will leave the theater feeling shortchanged and taking away nothing from this story.<br/><br/>And I thought the ending was both abrupt and weak.<br/><br/>A few comments on the technical aspects of this film. Nice shots of NYC empty and overrun with animals. The atmosphere is great. That atmosphere is frequently dissolved when the filmmakers resorted to excessive panning, zooming, shaking the camera around, and cutting every half-second. This makes audiences seasick. Take for example the scene on the pier in which the Robert Neville in his car is attacked by a mob of ""dark seekers."" You can hardly make out what's going on because, you know, the filmmakers thought it would be cool to zoom and jerk and cut-cut-cut. Seriously, I'd take just about any 80's action flick over I Am Legend for this reason alone. At least back then you could make out what's going on, even soak in the image. Not so with I Am Legend, which stylistically does nothing new and conforms to the rest of the nonsense cranked out of the studios these days. By the way, all the infected creatures were CGI, i.e, they looked cartoonish. With a budget this large, I Am Legend could have figured out a way to use real humans convincingly. Maybe they should have had Chris Cunningham direct this one (see ""Come To Daddy"" for how to make real actors look scarier than CGI)."

","I got ""Omega Man"" from Netflix and watched it a few days ago in anticipation of this film. Thank goodness they have little to nothing in common. The Charleton Heston was dire, needing those MST3000 heads in front of the screen shouting out rude comments. The remake is more polished, but with a few problems of its own. The CGI ""baddies"" aren't the best. They are reminiscent of the mummy in ""The Mummy,"" but if you suspend your disbelief, you will be freaked out by how fast they move. The first half of the film is more about a man and his German Shepherd named Sam - how they try to survive in a world in which about 6 billion people have died. The last half is a bit more frantic, with the Dark Hunters (I think that's what they were called, coming after our protagonist. Overall, ""I Am Legend"" is a fine addition to the apocalyptic film science fiction sub-genre. And will probably do a brisk holiday business. The theater at which I saw the sneak peek was overfilled - rare these days - and they had to turn people a way. If it's worth anything, the audience also clapped."

","What a disappointment! The only reason I gave this movie a 2, was because of the beautiful dog.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait to see this movie as I admire Will Smith's acting. Although he didn't really disappoint, the film plot certainly has.<br/><br/>1.This is a horror movie, make no mistake. This movie should not be allowed for under 18s. The amount of violence and horror was sickening.<br/><br/>2. The beginning had so much potential, so many possibilities to develop, so many possible endings, that I couldn't wait to see which way it will go. But 1.5 hrs of building up the plot,the hopes and expectations, and building and building and building (ARGH STOP BUILDING AND START A PLOT)......it ended so quickly and in such utter nonsense, and the character that survives is the one we barely saw for 5 minutes! Cmon! It was like: ""Movie intro: 1hr 35 minutes. Oh, we ought to have a main plot and ending, let's squeeze them in the last 10 or so minutes. Oh how are we gonna do that? It don't matter, let's just write anything really - intro is good, so ending won't matter."" 3. Story is full of holes, even for a rubbish horror movie. How did he not remember where he set the trap? It's not like he's got many other things on his mind now is it? And to faint so quickly and for so long - gimme a break. As for the cure, imagine Alexandar Fleming passing on the Penicillin to his mate about 2 minutes after discovery, then killing himself without revealing how it is produced or how to be used etc? Peh-lease! It's not like there are many scientists that survive innit! Then, to have a chance to escape and then not to - for what reason? It's not like that grenade thingy was going to kill every last one of the mutants ever. Speaking of which, who the heck would keep a grenade inside the drawer WITHIN the room where he kept the mutants! CMON! But the worse hole of all, why the heck did he do that to Sam? Didn't he keep infected animals in his basement and test vaccines on them? So why didn't he keep Sam? As a pet owner, there is no way that I would not attempt my best to save my dog. So this was just nonsense and start of the rest of nonsense in this movie.<br/><br/>4. I am angry because the movie could've been so much better: shorter intro, curing Sam, not finding a handy grenade in most unlikely spot, and perhaps curing the nation. Life can be miserable enough without watching a movie with a miserable illogical ending.<br/><br/>So I've been generous here: 2 out of 10. Will, pick a better movie next time. Please!"

The reason everyone keeps comparing Will Smith in this movie to him in others, is because he is one of those actors that PLAYS HIMSELF!!! This is the opposite of good acting. There are plenty of cool actors that are like that, of course. Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell,etc. I also kind of get discouraged when Hollywood seems to take a (fear) stab at a scientific idea.

","It's hard to believe less than 1600 people voted a ""1"" for this awful movie -- a perfect exercise in Bad Film-making #101.<br/><br/>This movie has no suspense, no fright, no real story, nothing! WHY? Because the director and the cinematographer have trashed it with amateur camera work and bad lighting. The hand-held camera was obviously in the hands of a guy with either St Vitas Dance or bad withdrawal from alcohol or drugs. He can't hold the camera well enough so the audience can grasp what's going on. Besides that, much of the action takes place on sets that are so poorly lighted the audience sees exactly nothing.<br/><br/>Poor Will Smith! He seems to have given a good performance, but nobody can honestly say that, in view of the rotten camera work. I met with Will Smith briefly when he was in NYC at 44th Street to promote this movie. I shook his hand and wished him well (as if he needed it). I hope he gets a better movie next time.<br/><br/>The nitwit director ought to have taken a lesson from ""Night of the Living Dead"" wherein a REAL movie director created a zombie classic; expending just $20,000 on the entire movie; not millions.

"Archblood","6","6","10","25 December 2007"," I am..... a little far off from Legend
","!!!Possible Spoiler ALERT !!! <br/><br/>Two movies had been made based on adaptation from the novel, 'I Am Legend'. While the earlier version 'Last Man On Earth' is more faithful to its source's content than the latter 'The Omega Man', it's seconded in terms of entertainment value. One may wonder if the people behind the latest, 2007 remake by the same title as the book ever learn anything from the two films, much especially LMOE.<br/><br/>To begin with, I don't expect Hollywood to follow the book a 90-100% cos anyway, you know the studios are so notorious for that and there's no reason to raise your hopes high about it. Understand that and you will learn to watch 'I Am Legend' as a movie INSPIRED, not (really) based on the original novel.<br/><br/>Back to 'Legend', the story's about Robert Neville(Will Smith), the sole surviving resident of a New York desolated by a global viral plague after a research for a cure against cancer went wrong 3 years ago. As a result, Neville, a former military scientist, battles each day, not just for a cure but also for survival against the murderous human horde of infected, sunlight-fearing victims.<br/><br/>The movie's opening scene, the depiction of Neville's lonely adventures and the in-between flashbacks illustrate clearly the origins of the disaster and the grim post-infection consequences our protagonist had to cope with daily. However, being a 100 minute film is a cause for worry and here's why. The vital plot devices and other important elements that had driven the novel and LMOE, are either weakly represented or just plainly absent. A cut down in screen time also means character development, together with the story, suffers and while Smith shines occasionally, the story feels a little rushed to the point that you will probably not feel much sympathy for Neville, maybe cos you are not allowed time to do so. Important stuffs that could have go along are sadly left out.<br/><br/>Despite the flaws, the first half is still quite interesting . It has its key moments of tensions and action scenes in the midst of the mundane quietness of Neville's experiences. Then the story took a very abrupt turn (actually, it's more like a nosedive) around after the part when Neville's companion dog died. He went for a sort of revenge against the infected, nearly got killed before he was rescued (in an odd and rather questionable manner) by the small framed Anna (Alice Braga), together with a young boy (Charlie Tahan) by the name of Ethan. Neville was driven to the safely of his little fortress and all of a sudden, we find him in family setting the next day, trying hard to accept and get along with his new found friends.<br/><br/>The latter part of the film faces the same hasty issue again. Dialouge and interaction between the characters could not get any more inspiring or intimate and before we can know and understand them deeper, the infected horde suddenly launch a massive attack against Neville's home base, successfully broke in and threatened the survivors' lives. The escalation quickly leads to the final climax which by then, lacks of emotional impact even in the form of a heroic sacrifice. The movie ends, concluding with a lame, inaccurate definition of whatever that makes Neville a legend and it certainly does no justice to the sacred meaning of the novel's title which is actually deeper and more intelligent than non readers may care.<br/><br/>Overall, Legend is not really the classic it's anticipated to be. This year's similar fare like '28 Weeks Later' could impressed more than Legend was able to. Especially if you are a reader and fan of the novel, it's probably good you stick with the book. Otherwise, Legend, at best, is anybody's average sci-fi horror."
"fettmedrespekt","3","9","17","4 March 2008"," Unnecessary use of CGI.
","I haven't read the book or seen any of the earlier movies based on it, so I didn't really know what to expect when I first sat down to watch this. The only thing I knew was what had been hinted in the trailers.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is pretty good. The decaying city is beautifully visualized and it works great as kind of a supporting actor, in a movie that has very few. I'm a huge fan of post apocalyptic sci-fi stories, and because of that I do recommend anyone to watch the first half of this film solely because of the city.<br/><br/>The second half, on the other hand, is what makes this nothing but another ridiculous Hollywood-effect-shitfest.<br/><br/>As soon as the infected ""monsters"" show up in all their CGI glory, ALL the tension and suspense which has been greatly built up until this point, is immediately flushed down the drain.<br/><br/>WHY did they use CGI to create these creatures??<br/><br/>I can't help to imagine what this movie would have been like if they would have used real actors and makeup instead of these ridiculous computer generated humans. THAT would have been scary. The way they look now is just incredibly stupid and laughable, and it truly makes it difficult to take this film serious. <br/><br/>It's pretty obvious that Hollywood is under the impression that they can't sell a big movie without CGI. This is just stupid!! The way it is used to create the deserted city is exactly how it's supposed to be used. To create things/images that otherwise couldn't be created. But WHY, WHY, WHY would anyone choose to create CGI humans in a world full of actors and makeup artists!!?? Is it because it looks cooler/scarier? Well, it doesn't! It looks stupid!<br/><br/>As far as story goes, I would have wanted/needed at least another hour to feel even slightly satisfied. It feels as if they rushed the story and/or left things out in favor of action and effect shots. <br/><br/>Overall this movie had a lot of potential but sadly blew it big time."

","Now, being British may be used in the future as a way to deride this review by claiming its author is bias. But, when the politics of the United Kingdom are taken into account i.e. the English and Scottish disliking each other immensely, I am sure this will considered and the objectivity of this review will be placed, without a scratch upon it, back into the pages of 'down the middle' journalism. I am English and Danny Boyle is Scottish, yet I will not let that influence my thinking. <br/><br/>Still, it is a time to be bold - he who dares wins and all that. And I believe I am being bold when I say: <br/><br/>I am Legend is not as good as 28 Days Later!<br/><br/>And, furthermore, I am absolutely beguiled in how I am Legend didn't learn from or even seem to acknowledge the stylistic and atmospheric achievements of 28 Days Later and made New York look like a legion of Hollywood designers came in and made the place over. London has never looked so empty and abandoned (and down right chilling) as it did in Boyle's crack at the Armageddon whip. It looked real. New York looked like it had been redesigned. <br/><br/>I am Legend is as good as 28 Weeks Later since it has an as highly implausible plot and unbelievable ending. One is infinitely more Hollywood than the other, although 28 Weeks Later has its moments - a helicopter decapitating hordes of Zombies. Ahem. Right. I am Legend is tense and somewhat imaginative, yet the baddies look quite false in comparison to the real baddies of 28DL and 28WL, who were not CGI'd. What is it with directors and CGI? Are humans not good enough anymore? Do we have to be replaced by something virtual every damned time? George Lucas seems to think so and Lawrence has apparently jumped on that flaming and sinking bandwagon.<br/><br/>Anyway, technically speaking, the camera work and vision of Francis Lawrence (Constantine being another visual treat of his) feels like any second it could pierce the bubble of what directors are allowed to do because it'll appeal to the mainstream audience and into what he might do in order to make it a more consistent and intelligent looking film. Putting aside the huge problems with the story and script, he would at least of been able to claim that with the sound muted it looked like some seriously good stuff. This may sound snobby and like a dismissal of the mainstream audience, but when the film finished in my local Odeon, laughter could be heard from all corners of the theatre; not because Smith ended it with a Fresh Prince like pose and an exclamation that he was indeed the Man, but because throughout the film the sound was not muted and it not only didn't look that great, but it sounded pretty bad too. Although, saying that, Lawrence did dare to use a body-mounted camera to depict Smith's panic at being chased through a building and onto the street, but it was only once and didn't seem to fit in anywhere. In contrast, Boyle used a whole host of shots, in 28DL, ranging from the jittery first person zombie dash to the super sharp and slightly shaky long view when Murphy was being chased through the broken and grey streets of London. Boyle was consistent and even with the sound off 28DL looks terrifying.<br/><br/>Smith does an adequate to good job of portraying a man on the brink of losing his grip. He clings to his old life through trying to build a new one as well as following a strong routine. Smith shows us a range of emotions, but in an emotional rather than an intelligent way. He uses the same physical gestures and tones of voice that he has in all of his other films. Angry? Time to shout and point in someone's face. There, that'll do it. This is not the work of a master, yet it is the work of someone who knows how to cry just a little bit. In contrast to this, Cillian Murphy, as directed by the wonderful Danny Boyle captures a man lost in a new world that he had no idea existed (being in a coma for 28 days; hence the title). He adapts as humans do, through tears and demanding to have just enough information to formulate an understanding of what he now has to do. He takes to killing well and shows us how close we are to being rage fuelled loons through realistic reactions and not shouting unless someone is quite far away and they can't hear him otherwise.<br/><br/>The crux of the matter for I am Legend is simply, to sum up, that it didn't look believable which didn't help the thin plot and awful ending. Awful because after an hour and forty minutes the audience, me included, lost all traces of what seemed reasonable and felt that our intelligence was being insulted terribly. At least with 28DL you could walk away thinking that the last bad tasting twenty minutes of total gore could easily be swallowed if washed down by the first hour and forty of splendour and intelligent film-making. Film making that was quite daring and experimental and still managed to do well."

","Will Smith gives I Am Legend a powerful performance built upon an excellent script with strong psychological realism and boosted by great art direction and solid directing.<br/><br/>Smith plays Robert Neville, a military biologist who may be the last truly human member of Homo sapiens sapiens left on earth. A genetically engineered virus which cured cancer has mutated into a pathogen which has turned 99% of the earth's human population into hyper-aggressive murderous cannibals with no social habits and no mercy. These viral zombies own the world and, from his generator-powered lab in the Big Apple, Lt. Col. Neville struggles to retain his sanity with the help of his German Shepard while almost hopelessly searching for a cure. Each night at sun-down, his patients come out and seek to infect anybody they can find.<br/><br/>It's an old story by Richard Matheson, which has been made into three somewhat different films - The Last Man on Earth (1964), Omega Man (1971) and now this. Each of these films is a product of its time, and has a different flavor. The 1964 version, starring Vincent Price, is more of a standard horror flick than the other two, and focuses on creating mood, atmosphere, and tension, then paying off with a modest amount of gore and action. 1971's Charlton Heston more sci-fi film, Omega Man, is heavy, philosophical and more than a little angry and scary.<br/><br/>I am Legend loses a bit of the philosophy and anger, retains but reorganizes the action, and adds better characterization, special effects (especially in set design - the abandoned Manhattan is mesmerizing), and writing. But, as if I haven't already made this point, the final key ingredient here is Smith's incredible performance. It is no mean feat filling the shoes of Charlton Heston in one of his most memorable roles, but Smith goes well beyond this and creates a character that is very much his own.<br/><br/>I am Legend is on the best post-apocalyptic films recently released, and one of the ten best Zombified horror films I have ever seen. Highly recommended for sci-fi and zombie film fans. Weakly recommended for horror fans - this is a very non-traditional horror film."

I know this may sound like a fan-boy rant to some, but what Hollywood (namely Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman (screenwriters) has done to the near brilliant work of Richard Matheson ought to be a criminal offense.<br/><br/>Don't be quick to assume my judgment is out of context. I understand that often a story must deviate from the original version when translated to the silver screen to either modernize it or ""make it sell,"" but the end product of this movie is completely stripped of any of the original story's merit as a thought provoking analogy of societal relativity/evolution as it applies to the highly subjective notion of what makes something a monster. <br/><br/>I don't wish to ruin the plot of either the movie or that of the book for those that wish to see or read either respectively, but for those of you that have read the book and enjoyed it, you will most likely not enjoy this film as it is nothing more than highly diluted fluff that borrows far too much from 28 Days Later when the source material was more than adequate to support what could have been a great film. We've seen same scenario about 5 years ago, but that time it was an Anne Rice novel that underwent the same treatment.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you don't care about the story so much as wanting a cheap thrill from a ""suspense"" film, don't get your hopes up.

","I just want to go ahead and say there is a little spoiler in this review but if you are completely oblivious to then there's no worries.<br/><br/>I just caught the midnight showing of I am legend and this movie is not ""i am legend"" one bit. I think its a little disrespectful for the film studio to give this movie the name ""i am legend"" when it is so far from the book. This movie is a complete and utter remake of Omega Man. Yes, there are changes but it is basically the same thing. This time around the creatures do not speak. The thing though, is that when i go see movies i don't go in with preconceptions of a movie because when you do that, you are only ruining the movie. Personally, I was shocked. This movie was very well made. I was a skeptic when this movie chose will smith but he pulls the part off and he does capture the character from the book. Thats basically where the similarities to the book end. I thought the movie was way too short considering the budget because the movie does capture the audience but moves very fast. I've read people complaints about the cgi and i honestly can say it did not bother me because it was no where near as bad as some said. I think the creatures did not need to be cgi they could have used real people like the reapers in blade 2. This movie should be called the omega man because it is very much a remake but this version definitely eliminated some of the big flaws in the original omega man. So kudos to Francis Lawrence for not making a piece a junk and i don't understand why they felt to call this i am legend<br/><br/>On a Techinical note for warner bros, i guess they did not have fake dust in the budget because Neville goes through buildings which are supposed to be dormant for 3 years and there is no dust or cobwebs. Maybe the creatures dusted each night.<br/><br/>And also people remember this movie may look and sound like 28 days later from the trailer but its quite different. 28 days later is far superior but also very different."

","This is a truly awful movie--one of the worst I have ever seen. Unsatisfying on almost all levels. I found the camera work amateurish, especially the irritating hand-held sequences.

What little of a story was present was almost content-free and completely silly. Our ""hero"" had few heroic qualities, and even the dog's role was lame. The best thing that could be said about the movie was that it was so forgettable. The one good part was that the movie showed a clip of the movie Shrek. Had it just continued with Shrek, it would have been a far better, albeit strange, flick!<br/><br/>By the way, the fault was not that of Will Smith. He did a good job.

","Will Smith stars in this latest of the several film imaginings of the 1950's novel by Richard Matheson. Smith plays a man who believes that he is the last person left alive after a biological apocalypse that has killed most everyone, and made all those left into zombie or vampire-like monsters who can not survive sunlight.<br/><br/>The monsters seem driven to constant violence and cannibalism, and incapable of anything resembling intellect or humanity. Worse, the apocalypse was man-made, the result of viral genetic engineering done in an attempt to cure cancer. Smith, in turn, a scientist, is driven to find the cure to reverse this civilization-ending catastrophe. His own family was killed by the chaos that resulted from the outbreak of the epidemic.<br/><br/>Will Smith has made more than enough films to convince me that he is excellent in comedy, as an action hero, and as a dramatic actor. This film is perhaps his best dramatic performance yet.<br/><br/>I fondly remember ""The Omega Man"" released in 1971, based on the same book, starring Charlton Heston, one of the most popular actors of his day. Heston was handsome, charming, strong, rugged, fearless... everything movie-goers at the time wanted in a superstar. And he played his part that way. He was heroic in almost every way.<br/><br/>Smith plays the role in a way more fallible and believable. He treats his only companion, Sam (short for Samantha) his dog, as if she were his child. He talks to himself and store manikins as if the world were still full of other humans. At the same time, he exhibits the same self-destructive actions as Heston, understandable in a world with so little to live for. His efforts to find a cure have yielded no results, but he remains determined.<br/><br/>When he finally comes across other survivors, events happen to bring to a head the contrast of his carefully protected and hidden environment, and the reality surrounding him. And then there are the alternative endings...<br/><br/>If you see this movie, definitely watch both endings. Watch the original theatrical release ending first. It seems the most consistent with the book.<br/><br/>But don't miss the alternative. I will not reveal anything, but watch for the butterflies... the butterfly Smith's kid forms with her hands, the one Sam chases, the one on the sign Smith passes, the shape in the cracks of the plexiglas when the alpha male hurls himself against it, the one the alpha male smears in his blood onto the plexiglas with his hand, and the one on the neck of the alpha female. What Smith suddenly realizes is nothing short of stunning. What he does is fearless. What happens next is positively memorable."

","*Eventual spoilers are mild and consumer-friendly*<br/><br/>Early on, I am Legend gives out several promises that it can't live up to. The post-apocalyptic story of the life of the one man left alive after the big wipeout - based on Richard Matheson's novel of the same name, already filmed twice in The Last Man on Earth in 1964 and The Omega Man in 1971, both films superior to this - will make you ask questions. Will Smith seems to be the sole survivor on the planet or, at least on Manhattan. He's driving around in the inner city wasteland in a scene that admittedly isn't totally unique nowadays, but nevertheless quite impressive. Several things come to mind. Why is he immune? If he has survived, surely others must? Why are animals not affected? What's his history? What happened to his family? What was his occupation? How does he function now? Also, we learn early on that this all has something to do with a positive cure for cancer discovered a couple of years prior. Emma Thompson has a cameo in the beginning as the guilty scientist. Another question - Will she turn up again? None of these questions are properly answered. Sure, answers are mentioned, either by the characters or in brief visual moments by the film itself, but we are far from closure. To begin with, the movie quickly falls into Silent Hill territory when we become aware of some scary nocturnal creatures that adds to the mystery we already have in front of us. The identity of these monsters are explained by Will Smith in one (1) monologue. Why he is immune is not explained. We don't get to know much at all about who he is and what he was doing prior to the apocalypse. His wife and family appear in brief flashbacks. Their fate is dealt with as if censored from the movie. The cancer origin thing is still unknown. Will Smith attempts to find a cure to the apocalyptic virus. It goes bad until it goes well. And no, I don't know what Emma Thompson was doing in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>By the third part of the movie, I realised I didn't really cared about it. The screenplay, by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich, is filled with nice-sounding lines that are supposed to explain Will Smith's character, but when the time comes for the movie to get closer to it's finale it turns out it can't walk the walk at all. There's no psychology to the character, which is a pity given that Will Smith is really doing his very best as an actor, and there's no proper reality in the situation of the movie either. Early on, we get the idea of a movie that knows what it's doing but all we really get in the end is a bunch of loose ends. All in all, if a moody Will Smith and CGI ghouls is all you require for your science fiction entertainment, you might enjoy this in quite an uncomplicated way. I can't see how it's about much else. And, well, there you have it."

When I found out Smith was attached I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>My fears were realized when I saw the thing. It was typical mediocre bubblegum for lame brained youths.<br/><br/>What really got my goat, however, was the stupidity of Smith's character when his silly dog dies. It had me rolling my eyes and ready to leave the theater.<br/><br/>The syrupy contrived happy ending made me want to puke in my popcorn.

","I have come to the conclusion that CGI is the bane of the movie industry. It is not the ground-breaking, eye-popping technology it once was. The days of being wowed by shockingly real-looking dinosaurs or space insects are over. Now CGI is used by studios too cheap to pay for sets, extras, stunt coordinators, animal wranglers or make-up effects artists.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays a scientist who is trying to find a cure for a virus that causes people to turn into cartoon zombies. He tries various vaccines out on the cartoon rats in his lab. Sometimes he and his dog venture out to hunt the cartoon deer that run through Manhattan. Occasionally they even watch a cartoon lion capture one of the cartoon deer so that some cartoon cubs will be able to eat. Will and the dog also sometimes run into the cartoon zombies.<br/><br/>The moments between Will and the dog alone are fairly compelling. But any time an infected person or other species of animal shows up, the movie turns into yet another showcase for phony, ridiculous special effects.<br/><br/>Were it not for the GODAWFUL effects, I AM LEGEND would be a marginally entertaining adaptation of Richard Matheson's infinitely superior book. With the effects however, it's yet another piece of bloated, excessive Hollywood trash, perhaps slightly less forgettable than most."

","I had heard some fairly positive buzz over ""I am Legend,"" so I was looking forward to finally watching the DVD. Some of my friends warned of a disappointing ending, so I did brace for a corny twist ending.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a promising, although unoriginal plot: much of the world's population has been wiped out by a horrendous virus and Will Smith's character is one of the only survivors. Smith will have to contend with surviving on his own in a world where many people have mutated into vicious zombie-like monsters. This is nothing new, but I decided to see where the movie makers would run with it.<br/><br/>And then . . . nothing happened. Nothing unexpected happened. Nothing unique happened. It was one of the most forgettable, ordinary post-apocalyptic movies I've ever seen. There are violent fight scenes. There are heart-pumping flight scenes. There is a conclusion at the end, but it's hardly a twist.<br/><br/>There was hardly anything that was not already done in ""28 Days Later,"" which was a more interesting movie, made five years before Legend. How did Legend do so well in the box office? Was it simply the Will Smith factor again? Ultimately, I give ""I am Legend"" a generous 5 out of 10, mainly because of a stupendous performance by the dog."
"rmax304823","6","3","4","6 October 2008"," Where is Everybody?
","Never having read Richard Matheson's novel, I can't comment on how closely the movie follows the book. Certainly closer than an earlier transposition, ""The Omega Man."" A doctor seeking a cure for cancer winds up with one that kills everyone instead. A few million people are immune, as can be expected in a genetically diverse population. Most of them turn into fierce ""dark seekers"" who have lost all human impulses and only appear at night looking for real people to destroy. The monsters include dogs, but, for some reason, not lions or deer.<br/><br/>Will Smith is a doc who is left alone with his German shepherd, Sam, in Manhattan. He lives in an apartment and laboratory overlooking Washington Square and he's working on a cure for the ""cure."" Joined by Alce Braga and her son, who have heard his voice on AM radio, he finally discovers the antivenin and sacrifices his life so that Braga and son can escape to an upstate colony of normal survivors, bringing a vial of the serum with her.<br/><br/>It's a brutal, suspenseful, violent, and ultimately depressing movie despite the uplifting ending. All by itself, the thought of monsters hanging around The White Horse Tavern is heart breaking. But, man, these monsters are really something. Some of their humanity may have been lost along with their hair, but they zip around like nobody's business and can fling a grown man across a room with one hand. They make a lot of noise too. And they have no respect for furniture.<br/><br/>Alice Braga is a sympatico young woman who tends never to blink, but the movie belongs to Will Smith. It requires a strong performance and I'm not sure Smith is up to the job. He tries hard but the effort shows. And his appearance doesn't help -- those outlandish ears. He can be quite good in thrillers that have a comedic component, as in that one with Gene Hackman, ""State Secret?"" Something like that.<br/><br/>The monsters attack so relentlessly, so careless of their own welfare, that they butt their skulls against steel and bullet proof glass. They can be stopped by light, by bullets, or by fire, but apparently by nothing else. And it's no use talking to them either.<br/><br/>The most wrenching scene in the movie is not when the monsters are attacking but when Smith must strangle the infected Sam, the dog he loves and who has been his only companion and helpmate. The director wisely keeps the camera on Smith's face during this ordeal. In the first half of the film, Smith does a lot of talking to Sam and that's good because it allows for exposition. But it does raise questions. When is it alright for a grown man to talk to an animal when the two are otherwise alone? Okay, dogs, anytime. They understand simple commands. They really do. I tried it with a non-English speaking dog in Samoa, switching from English to Samoan, and in each language using a different tone of voice -- angry or friendly. The dog responded to Samoan, regardless of tone. In English, he hadn't a clue. It's kind of okay to talk to cats too. Talking to your plants is supposed to make them flourish but I doubt it. One night, making clam chowder, I found myself apologizing to each living bivalve as I dropped it into the boiling broth. That's when I decided I'd better get a dog.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was sorry to see Sam go, but I wasn't really sad when the movie ended. It's long, fast, and expensive, and a bit tiring. It keeps your interest, no doubt about it, and isn't lacking in intelligence. (The events of the past are revealed gradually in small increments.) But, all in all, not worth a second viewing."

","i haven't read the book, so i'm taking the movie as is (which is the way it should be done). and STILL it's ruined by what i can only attribute to carelessness and paying too much attention to the ""trees"" instead of the ""woods"" (or vice versa, who knows?). by now anyone who reads this is already familiar with the story, so i'll just point out a few things that killed it for me.<br/><br/>in the opening scene, will is hunting CG-rendered deer through the derelict city in a SPOTLESSLY clean and shiny red mustang. 1) are you telling me you actually washed and waxed it so that you'd look good for a bunch of zombies? 2) why hunt? it's only been 3 years after the virus breakout, and there's still electricity. SURELY there must be some frozen/canned meat around. - just break into any supermarket, dude! the whole scene is totally absurd and pointless, but hey - i guess it looks ""good"". and that was obviously the only point.<br/><br/>speaking of cars: the girl's SUV is also spotless. i guess that in between running from zombies and staying alive, people take time to keep their cars squeaky clean. you never know who might be watching. <br/><br/>the girl tells will that there's a survivors' shelter somewhere in virginia. and how does she know about it? 'cause ""god told her"".<br/><br/>please.<br/><br/>said shelter is surrounded by what looks like a 16-ft wall at most. and two guards with M-16s. previously we saw zombies effortlessly climbing 3 stories high into will's apartment and hanging from ceilings. this wall would be a child's play for them. but whatever.<br/><br/>and the ""zombies"" themselves? souped-up gollums. CGI stuff here, folks, and not all that realistic either. if they hadn't destroyed that mustang, they might have had the money to hire a couple of stunts. 'cause it's hard to be afraid of bad CGI. and the fact that most ""scares"" are jump scares accompanied by loud blasts of FX doesn't help either.<br/><br/>also, i find the whole ""cast away"" angle, with will talking to dolls in the best tom hanks fashion completely unnecessary. he's got a clever dog for a companion, does he REALLY need to hit on girl dolls? those scenes might have provided some uncalled-for ""comic"" relief had he been doing it for fun. but he's FOR REAL. you might lose your mind on a deserted island due to lack of content, but after only three years in new york (no pun intended)?! come on! his days are full, there's so much to do, and he's a rational and intelligent man who's keeping himself fit, focused and organized, and is still trying to find the cure and other survivors. why flip it all around and try to sell us that he's in fact lost his mind?<br/><br/>will uses one of the dolls (""frank""?) as a decoy for zombies, so that he could catch them and test the cure. but then at one point he flips, starts shouting at frank for standing in the street and exposing himself, steps on his own trap and gets attacked by zombies. but not before he cuts the rope he's hanging from by his leg WHILE he's hanging from it (instead of pulling himself up), thus falling from 12 ft onto concrete and landing on his knife. brilliant. what a great way to advance your plot - by making your fit army general and scientist a mindless idiot.<br/><br/>80% of the movie is will alone with his dog. yet his death scene is so short and understated that i thought it was just a gimmick and that he'd emerge alive and well later on. but no, that's it. the whole ending's over in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>plus, there could've been more shots depicting how will spends his days. i mean, come on: he's got the whole city, the whole WORLD to himself! let your imagination run wild, for f*ck's sake! is playing golf on a plane carrier all you could come up with, mr. screenwriter?<br/><br/>and why don't we get ANY explanation, or even a clue, as to how come the cure is in will's blood? is it because he's listening to a lot of bob marley, who said that ""music is the ultimate cure""?<br/><br/>i've got SO many gripes, but this is already too long, so i'll sum it up. a cool idea and great visuals (at least some of the time), ruined by being needlessly cluttered with nonsensical BS and bad CGI. stick to the meat and bones, don't spice it up and overkill it. you're ruining a great meal that's hiding somewhere underneath."

","Oh, it'll be another twenty or thirty years, but someday, some smart young filmmaker is going to read Richard Matheson's novel and make the low-key, modestly-budgeted, intellectually serious, and CGI-free film it cries out for. At least, I hope so.<br/><br/>*The Last Man on Earth* came closest, but even there, the filmmakers completely missed the point of the novel's ending (which is as necessary to the story's meaning as the ending of *The Sixth Sense* or *The Caine Mutiny*). Then, somehow, it became de rigeur to ""reimagine"" Matheson's quiet, intelligent novel as a Big Dumb Action Movie.<br/><br/>This version is the worst by a wide margin. Will Smith plays a scientist/action hero (yeah, we all know lots of those guys) who for some reason has survived the CGI Virus, which transforms its victims into unconvincing computer animations. Then some stuff blows up, and some coincidences happen, and some more stuff blows up, and the filmmakers throw in a dumb plot device to justify keeping Matheson's title even though they have discarded the events which justify the title.<br/><br/>Why even bother? Surely they could have made this movie without paying Matheson for the rights to his novel, which this film in no way resembles. Just change the main character's name and call it *Fresh Prince and the Not-Scary Zombies* or something. Then someone else could have given *I Am Legend* the cinematic treatment it deserves.

","I am Legend is filled with laughably, fake looking infected ""people"" who look like they were taken straight from a bad video game.

He does well as a scientist who has spent the last few years of his life on a quest to cure the virus. The only conversation that he has through most of the movie is with mannequins and the best scene is where one of the them pops up somewhere else ands Smith's character questions it at gun point to see if it's real. When other people finally show up, they are just as forgettable as the infected. The director also unwisely chops up the flashback, showing it in pieces throughout the movie, despite it being painfully obvious what happened to Smith's family.

"TaoMark","2","3","4","25 January 2008"," More a damp squib than a Legend
","WARNING! CONTAINS SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>First of all, let me begin by stating that this is one of those cases where if you've read the book, then you'll probably hate the film. This is perhaps unfair due to the conflicting nature of books and films. Whereas the former have the time to go deeply into the psychology and richness of the characters, films (as a rule) have to cram this into as little visual space as they can, especially when the storyline follows a general format of the ""action"" genre. There are notable exceptions (""Alien"" for a start) but this film isn't one of them.<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this film and in that respect, I wasn't disappointed. However I left the cinema with a lingering feeling that I'd seen it all before. So let's take a moment to go over some areas that appeared in ""I Am Legend"": 1) Major city being deserted and populated by wild animals - see ""12 Monkeys"" 2) The protagonists are virus-wracked inhuman killers referred to as ""infected"" - swap ""vampires"" for ""zombies"" and you've got ""28 Days Later"" 3) Will Smith saves the world - see Independence Day and that's just for starters!<br/><br/>A few seconds of Will Smith working out and showing off his pumped-up physique were probably added to highlight the fact that his character needs to maintain peak fitness to deal with his situation but actually come across as ""Will Smith showing off"". Gratuitous topless shot, anyone? The only convincing relationship is that between him and his dog, one of the major elements of the book that successfully crosses over to celluloid. Will Smith's one defining moment is when he's called upon to stretch his acting skills and portray genuine angst when putting the dog out of its newly-infected rabid existence.<br/><br/>For me, the whole point of the original story was the question of how an ordinary guy would cope with being the only person alive in a major metropolis, surrounded by nightwalking bloodsuckers after his life. The intricacies and subtleties of trying to survive were made all the more poignant by knowing that ""it could have been you!"". Changing that focus to that of Will Smith's character, as Lt. Col. Robert Neville M.D. lost all of that. Let's face it, we're supposed to believe that he was the only person left of the 10% of the population in New York city that were immune to infection and hadn't already been converted through being munched by the bad guys. The fact that he was the only person with all of the inside knowledge of the infection and just happened to have all of the technical equipment (cue Apple's product placement) to research the problem and also just happened to be clever enough to do it was at best implausible and at the worst, downright insulting to the intelligence of the viewer.<br/><br/>The ridiculously-contrived flashback backstory concerning ""the family Neville"" seems to have been chucked into the mix to deliberately tug at the heartstrings and to add to the emotional angst but the explosive (pun intended) conclusion could be seen coming a mile off! The replacement roles of the woman and boy are equally contrived and in all honesty, we don't care enough about them to invest much emotion in the film's seen-it-all-before denouement. Having spent the entire film trying, and failing, to persuade us to give a toss about our ""hero"", we're now supposed to switch over to the newcomers like sheep following the farmer to slaughter.<br/><br/>A focal point of the book's story involved the main character's house and the security that it brought to his sanity as well as his physical well-being. The feeling of having to be caged within a defined set of walls for half of his existence added to the tension and emotional turmoil of the story and when this is finally breached, the guy's tough exterior and effort to survive is threatened with being wiped out alongside the brick and mortar. When Will Smith's house gets attacked, it's just another building and this is probably due to the fact that we're supposed to believe in the superior strength of character of Mr Smith as a stand-alone warrior of the plagued age. His failure to rely on anything other than himself or his dog actually serves to alienate him from the audience.<br/><br/>So now we come to the effects. The action scenes are well shot and the sweeping vistas of an empty New York are well constructed, as are the background images of ruined bridges, etc. The one point where it all falls down, however, is in the rendering of the ""infected"". This lack of attention to realism may have been acceptable a decade ago but in this film they just come across as men in rubber suits. And badly executed rubber suits at that. Perhaps the filmmakers should have taken a leaf out the book entitled ""Less Is Definitely More"".<br/><br/>To be honest, this film lost me in the opening moments when Will Smith went hunting for wild stag. With access to the entire pickled and canned food supply in New York, was there any real need to go shooting animals? Apart from further highlighting Will Smith's warrior stance, that is. The only time my excitement threatened to rise was at the beginning when I caught a glimpse of a mocked-up ""Batman vs. Superman"" poster on the side of a building.<br/><br/>In summary, if you haven't read the book then you might like this film. If you haven't seen ""12 Monkeys"", ""28 Days Later"", ""The Stand"" or ""Escape from New York"" then you might like this film. If you want to see Will Smith save the world yet again, in a vacuous action flick that doesn't bother to invest too much in emotional realism, then you might like this film. Otherwise, you'll probably hate it."

We can only see a little actions that performed by Will Smith fighting with those monsters, you may think that it is exciting, but another problem comes out, the camera-work. Many scenes of fighting were played in the dark, so guessing is the only way to know what is going on, but it is easy as the movie is easy to predict. A pretty bad ending, Will Smith killed himself in order to kill those monsters and keep the girl to alive and escape. I don't like this ending much.

Can he create a cure, or will the creatures or his sanity get him in the end? <br/><br/>The movie does get a couple of plus points. The idea of giving him a dog to talk with throughout the movie is a good idea. The effects showing a devastated New York are also impressive. Will Smith is a good actor, and hold your attention on screen.<br/><br/>But sadly, that's it.<br/><br/>First off, the CGI creatures are awful. It's some of the worst effects work I've seen in sometime, which considering this is a big Hollywood movie is a major disappointment.<br/><br/>The changes made from the novel by Akiva Goldsman (whom I'll never forgive for Batman & Robin) and Mark Protosevich actually weaken the story. In the book, the vampires are Neville's neighbors who actually spend the nights taunting him, hoping to make him come out at night and face them. Here the creatures don't speak at all, just make noises.<br/><br/>But the worst, the absolute worst for me was the ending.<br/><br/>The novel has one of the best endings I've ever read, as Neville realizes he's become the bogeyman to a new breed of humanity, were before it was the vampires. The movie doesn't even try to use this ending. Instead Neville sacrifices himself to save a woman and child, whom he gives a possible cure to save the world.<br/><br/>I can see why they didn't use the novel ending. Simply put it doesn't work here because of the dreadful way the infected humans have become CGI monsters. The intelligence of the creatures being lost, makes the book ending useless.<br/><br/>To be fair, it goes for a downbeat ending which is rare in big Hollywood movies, but then even lets that down, by ending with the possibility of hope for humanity. Now this may seem like giving the audience a more happier thought as they leave at the end, but all it made me do, was think 'Ah, setting up a sequel are they?' This is the third movie version of this tale. I've not seen the Vincent Price version, 'The Last Man On Earth' but have seen 'The Omega Man'. Of the ones I've seen, I don't think either have done the book properly. In fact the only decent version of the tale I've seen was a Simpsons version 'The Homega Man!' And for a book regarded as a classic of the horror/sci-fi genre that is a damning fact."

","OK,I'm giving it 5 out of ten.There's a reason behind it. Yes it was a surprising well written script.And Yes , although, Smith isn't the person I would cast as Robert Neville, He portrayed brilliantly. Obviously , he showed a lot of respect towards the Character in the book. And so did the rest of the Cast and Crew.But Why ,Why did they have to give the this Brilliant book such a dumbing down. Why, does Hollywood think's we are stupid. Maybe it portraits Society as it is. Read the book (which was written in 1954), see The Omega man (1971, and on which the movie I am a legend is based on rather than the book) and then watch this version. It's fascinating to see how society has changed and viewed through the media. The closest this newest version comes to Richard Matheson's writing, is the scene where the Mannequin has been moved from it's daily spot followed by the loss of his dog.The flashbacks are the most scariest ,cause they also portray Matheson's view and social life. Why do we have to have Computer animated Vampires ? Dumb Witless power hungry survivors (mmm, just like suits). And why does he, after three years of survival, kills himself ? That's not very brave is it ? Leaving a child and single mother behind. Why is Hollywood afraid to make us think ? Or show us human emotions ? Watch this movie ,cause ,yes to today standards ,it is a good movie. I'm sure the cast and crew ,if they would have gotten there way, would have made a different and more faithful product then this . Legend is not about silly mindless Vampires. It's about being outcast and human error/selfishness."
"michael-y-weng","8","3","4","25 December 2007"," A potentially quality film that was simply cut too short
","My biggest problem with this film is that the whole protagonist-antagonist relationship was simplified to the point of ""de-constructing"" the movie back to the drawing board/outline stages. The book gave both sides a much more complex twist, and really made the reader question the true ""hero"" and ""villain"" of the story, whereas the film did not. Neville was pure good, and the Dark Seekers were pure evil. If this story had been an epic, then it might have worked, but in this case... not very fun in my opinion.<br/><br/>With that said, I am convinced that Will Smith is one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood right now. I've always viewed him as the doofus from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but in recent years, he's really diversified his roles so kudos to him. As for the movie, the first 80% of it was great, but the whole film was just a long (albeit great) build-up that never got paid off. There was no sense of closure - instead we get a rushed ending because the producer probably wanted to keep the running time down so as to squeeze out an extra showing or two per day to make more cash. I am pretty sure that the writer had nothing to do with this, as the quality of the beginning drastically contrasted that of the ending - a telltale sign of production constraints and not bad storytelling.<br/><br/>I give it a solid 6.5/10, but it could have done so much better given the budget and the star power."

","First off, let me just say that Will Smith's acting was great, as usual. He was the only reason why this movie is getting the good reviews. However, anyone who has actually read the book will know why I am giving this movie a low rating. The only connection between the book and the movie is the name Robert Neville. The movie was disappointing and cliché. From forced humor and excessive product placement, to predictable scares and a dry plot, this movie fails in my eyes. To anyone who has seen this movie: read the book by Richard Matheson (not the movie book, but the original book). You will be amazed by the difference."

","Extraordinarily suspenseful movie. There are quite a few scenes when the excitement almost becomes too much to bear - I was sweating and my stomach began to get irritated! - Definitely not a movie for weak nerves. As indicated, the movie ""contains elements"" of ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston. However, it really looks like a very well done remake of the sci-fi classic, improving to an astonishing level the weak parts of the older movie, for example the time before the vampire attacks and the accompanying suspense, and making the main character a lot more positive and easy to identify with. Very nice as well the incorporation of the dog. All in all maybe one of the best ""no-future"" Hollywood movies of the past few years (I'm not telling the ending). Brilliant performance of Will Smith."

And all the darkseekers appeared to be cgi too. Computer generated enemies just don't seem that scary.<br/><br/>The ending was so flat. I didn't care for it.

","Absolutely an amazing movie. The fact that some people are complaining about the context of a movie billed as ""The last man on earth"" is ludicrous in my opinion. If you went to see Rambo (new one) tag lined as ""Heroes never die... they just reload."" would you be upset when he shot a gun? This movie has a lot more to consider than arguably any action movie out there. When is the last time that you saw an action movie with as much heart as I am Legend? I personally have tears in my eyes the entire scene where the Dark Seeker dogs attack and Sam is bitten, then it goes on to Neville being forced to kill the last piece of his family that he still had a hold of. The movie has more character development than a lot of people think it does. When you are (as far as you know) the last man on earth, you lose your family, you lose your friends, the only thing you have left is a dog that your daughter wanted to protect you, and you are stricken with the task of saving mankind, you're going to get a little bit angry. You are also going to be a little bit upset most of the time as well. Will Smith played this character perfectly (as he usually does) and this in my opinion is arguably the best performance in any Action movie in recent memory, if not ever. Even Sam gave a better performance than most action heroes. In my opinion, this movie is amazing. I have seen it many a time and I am anxiously awaiting the DVD release of I AM LEGEND."

","I have to wonder why this movie has the name of a book, if it isn't based on it. Plenty of spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>The original ""I am Legend"" book (and ""The Last Man on Earth"" movie, with Vincent Price, to a lesser extent) is the complete opposite from this film. I suppose Will Smith's ego and Hollywood could never allow a movie where the main character is not a hero (or one in his own mind), but a modern day Dracula (which is what the original Robert Neville really was, and the reason why he became a legend). True; ""The Last Man on Earth"" didn't strictly adhere to the original book, either, but it was close enough to make some sense. ""The Omega Man"", as awfully dated as it is today (just look at the disco zombies!) at least kept some of the overall feel.<br/><br/>But this movie? Nah, it's too busy with Will Smith to be something memorable. While the original movie and book had Robert Neville fighting for survival, killing zombies at day and losing his mind at night, this Robert Neville plays golf, shoots deer, drives fast cars and lives a life of luxury (where did the electricity come from, by the way? At least this question was answered in The Last Man on Earth).<br/><br/>While the ending is somewhat similar among the three movies, this one lacks the overall tension of the other ones - these zombies look as if they came out of a video game console. And besides, what kind of tension exists between them and Robert Neville, if Neville never tried to kill them in the first place (as in the book and the other movies?) Even worse - it's explicitly said around 12 million people survived the disease - so, why is Robert Neville supposedly the only man on earth - which is the original premise of the book? Gotta go. I need to watch ""The Last Man on Earth"" yet again. Try to find it - it's public domain now!"

","(before saying anything, my English can be pretty bad since English is not my primary language.)<br/><br/>After seeing this movie, I was beginning to wondering how the producers were thinking while they did this movie. So I'm gonna start now, my own thoughts, from idea to production:<br/><br/>Two producers was at home, watching ""28 weeks later"", then they realize: ""What a great movie! We should do something like this!"". They pull out their savings box and discovers they have 20 million bucks to use. And this is how their spent their budget:<br/><br/>90% to Will Smith. 9% to closing Manhattan. 1% to the rest.<br/><br/>And what is that one percent? That's the film editor who sat in his basement for 30 days, desperately trying to animate monsters during his 30 day trial period for the software he was using because the producers didn't have enough money to buy a full version. And they didn't even have enough money to hire extras as zombies.<br/><br/>But then something happened, they managed to get a hold of some extra money, so what do they do? They hire another actress to support Will Smith and they hire a dog! Very clever!<br/><br/>And then the movie opened and the movie got a profit for about 20 million dollars.<br/><br/>And what happens next? The producers are watching ""Heroes"", and then they say ""Let's make another one!"", so they ask Will Smith to be in a new movie called ""Hancock"", and what they are doing now, no one knows!<br/><br/>Stay away from this movie.<br/><br/>Go watch ""28 weeks later"" instead."
"brefane","3","4","6","18 January 2008"," I am instantly forgettable.
","Disappointing third film version of Richard Matheson's novel is more annoying than exciting, and the ""Darkseekers"", rabid mutants, make dull adversaries because they are one note like Cujo; they lack distinctive qualities, and their agility and strength seem incredible even in the context of science fiction. These CGI created s-creatures combined with Will Smith's glum protagonist make for an ultimately lackluster conflict whose outcome doesn't seem to really matter. The script lacks imagination and elaboration to say nothing of originality, and the result feels like an over-extended Twilight Zone episode. For a film set in a near empty Manhattan, the film is loud. The director amps up the sound throughout to keep the audience from falling asleep. Will Smith isn't convincing, commanding, or compelling; he's particularly bad in the chaotic and confusing flashbacks, and he and the rest of the cast are less interesting than the mannequins. Not a film to be watched again because the details are unconvincing, unvaried, and unimaginative. Besides being underwhelming, the ending is forced, and much is left frustratingly unexplained or underdeveloped. Another remake that makes you wonder why they bothered, and why the audience should care?"

","Yet again Hollywood takes a good story and one that should be easy to turn into a film and completely ruins it. Virtually none of Matheson's novel survives. When this is done then the adverts for the film should warn that if you liked the novel then do not expect much from the film. Amongst the the things wrong in the film 1. the vampires did not pester him at his home each night as in the book. 2. the vampires were portrayed as having superhero strength when in the book they could not break into Neville's house. 3. Neville met the dog in the book did not have him from day one as in the film. 4. there were no ""normals"" turning up in the book. 5. there was no refuge in Vermont in the book. 6. no mention is made of the ""new"" vampires inheriting the earth 7. but worse is the misuse at the end of the legend."

"The_Void","6","4","6","6 January 2008"," Has nothing on The Last Man on Earth
","In a time where just about everything is getting remade, the announcement of an updating of Richard Matheson's classic novel ""I Am Legend"" (which previously spawned the Vincent Price classic 'The Last Man on Earth' as well as 'The Omega Man') didn't exactly make me excited. The film is directed by Francis Lawrence; an ex-music video director whose previous effort was the muddled Constantine. This is a better film, but again it doesn't function as a complete whole; on the one hand, we have the desolate situation that the lead character finds himself, which is well done; but then we have masses of poor CGI and a rather boring personal story surrounding the leading man, and that just isn't good. Unlike previous adaptation of this story, this one takes the original novel's title; though I can't comment on whether or not it's closer to the source material, having not read it. The story is simple enough anyway - after a scientist discovers a cure for cancer, things go terribly awry for mankind as the cure turns deadly and becomes airborne, turning most people into nocturnal vampires and making most of the survivors their lunch. Scientist Robert Neville finds himself as the last man in Manhattan...<br/><br/>As mentioned, director Francis Lawrence does a good job of imposing the hopelessness of the situation on the audience. The streets of Manhattan are eerily deserted, while there is a constant sense of dread emanating from the fact that we know that there are always devolved humans lurking in the shadows. This hopelessness also comes through with the leading character; who has devolved himself from a happy family man to someone unable to function properly with other people. Will Smith may not be Vincent Price, but the great thing about this actor is the fact that he is charismatic enough to hold an audience's attention; something that is definitely needed in a film like this where he is on screen at almost all times. However, all this good stuff is undermined somewhat by the film's bad points. As mentioned, the CGI looks awful and unfortunately there is rather a lot of it. The story itself is strong for the first half of the film, but after a tragic twist and the introduction of a couple of new characters, it takes a sharp downturn. There's plenty of action thrown in, and I'm by no means saying that this is a 'bad' film; but I'm surprised at the reaction it's getting, and overall I did find the whole experience rather underwhelming."

Poor Emma. No wonder she didn't want to be credited for her role in this film.<br/><br/>Surely only someone who is infected would have the audacity to pretend to be making a movie of a novel, and then change the two essential premises: there is only one survivor (""hello? oh, pleased to meet you, glad you could drop in just as i was trying to kill myself, oh and you brought a kid too, great!""), and that the monsters are vampires (""vampires, zombies, the audience will never know the difference, and anyway, they're infected, but we're not ripping off 28 Days Later, honest"").<br/><br/>Add to that some sub-standard CGI: yeah, we've seen weird creatures with over-sized mouths before, anyone remember ""The Mummy""?

How are there 2 lions and countless wild dear roaming New York? How come the cars in the streets after 3 years are spotless while there are plants growing through the asphalt.

","With all of the hype and the money put into this movie, it could have been a lot better. Here's why: 1. The zombies/infected looked really fake. Too much cgi. Same with the lions/deer. But, the zombies, all they did was just open their mouth freakishly wide and scream. They looked like cartoons. They could have easily used actors, but instead decided to go with the more expensive option of animating everything. The result - it looked animated and the movements were not natural. Compare these cartoons to 28 Days Later. 2. He had a whole lab and 3-story house that was running on generators all night, but he took the time to wash the stairs up to his house off so the zombies couldn't find him? Couldn't they find him by the noise/heat of the generators? 3. The scene where he got caught in the trap was weak. Why couldn't the dogs jump through the 2 inch barrier of light? Why couldn't the alpha male who had already stood out in the light and burned his skin, run through the light and attack Will Smith? 4. Why was Anna driving around New York at night and how did she happen to be right where Will Smith was being attacked? 5. What had the zombies been eating for 3 years?<br/><br/>Other than that, most of the scares were startles, not scary situations. The part where he walked into the building after his dog was good though. Also, it was nice to finally see a Will Smith movie where he doesn't play a cocky full-of-himself hero (Independence Day, Bad Boys, MIB, Hitch, etc, etc, etc...)In my opinion, a scary monster movie can be judged by the creatures in the movie.

Both tell of a loving non-human companion. And both movies are deep and explore the human condition. Except I like I Am Legend much better.<br/><br/>There's something about the movie that makes you scared. It's the scale of the loneliness of Dr. Robert Neville, who lives by himself in NYC. It's the sense of impending doom that really makes you worry, like there's no point in living if everyone else is dead. It's worrisome, and I love it. There's little dialogue, but Will Smith pulls off an amazing job of going solo. His intense scenes of dealing with loneliness really hit the spot.<br/><br/>And the zombies . . . well, they're cool, and they scare the heck out of me. One scene involving a zombie close up in a car really freaked me out. The scariest, though, was when Smith turned on the lights to scare away the oncoming zombies, but they jumped on them to destroy them, and then Smith detonates the bombs to stop the zombies.

The plot is fairly clichéd and simplistic, hubris in the form of a modified virus destroys civilisation and so forth. Certainly not an exceptional film and disappointing seeing as a straight adaption of the source material would have been infinitely more interesting. It has it's good points though. Some nice post apocalyptic New York City imagery and a surprisingly decent performance by Will Smith shore it up. These factors set it apart from the average B movie. The cinematography and sound are overall quite good however the CG is overdone and quite plastic looking. Fans of the genre will enjoy it, fans of the book will be distracted by what this could have been."

","I'm sure you've read about the astonishing scenes of a vast, empty-of-humans daytime New York, weeds growing out of cracks in the asphalt and sidewalk cement. You've read about the horrifying people of the night, horrific eaters of the few remaining normal humans, so monstrous to see you can barely watch. Oh! That was scary! Sudden fabulous horror movie moments that make you jump like the first time you saw Carrie and at the end Amy Irving's hand shot up out of the ground. And all alone, heroic Will Smith, trying to save the world, but all alone in the movie, something like Tom Hanks in Castaway maybe.<br/><br/>Well, uh uh. On all counts. In every single one of those scenic shots you can see where the production designers carefully placed the fake weeds. All the stalled cars, empty buildings--the whole thing looks like a set. It doesn't look real for one second. You never get lost in the film; it's always oh yes, I'm watching Will Smith in I Am Legend. He's really buff! Get this: every single darn one of the monster people looks EXACTLY alike! No expense spared! They aren't supposed to look alike--they're all different people who caught a yucky virus. But they're all the same bald man. Wow. OK, you get my point. Booooring. No scares. This ain't no Castaway. This is a Will Smith phone-it-in. Hello Hollywood...every time I see a writing credit with somebody's name and then under it Akiva Goldsman, I think I'll skip it. How about he actually writes a movie for a change?

"Tenate9","1","10","20","17 December 2007"," Robinson Crusoe amongst the Vampires
","This is a bad film on so many levels. What was so shocking about the authors original idea which evolved into his so-so book ( Robinson Crusoe with vampires) and then a series of movies ( Apart from loneliness and isolation - turning that idea around and instead of us/Crusoe disappearing from society, society disappearing from under us ) is how do we feel about our societies history and it's sudden total elimination. That the creative team behind this remake went back to the original Vampire scenario - appeals only to escapists and kids with little or no thought of anyone else but themselves and so turns the movie into a fantasy whereas the last outing ( The omega Man 1971 ) of this story was a thoughtful play on modern man and his superstitious dark side. which when things turn ugly always resurfaces. Science and modernity in the backlash are seen as evil. (Maybe we are, This movie may make 500 million plus profit which will be divided to fit snugly into less than twenty pockets.)<br/><br/>No more triple heart bypass's, no more rockets to the moon, no more great Art, literature or music and no more Hollywood blockbusters and nothing or no one to remember or record it all. If our hero gets a toothache let alone needs an operational procedure he is done for. In this retelling there is no time to linger on what has been lost. Man's last 10-40 thousand years of history swept away. The chances of a plague making this happen are low yet a fundamentalist revolution is far more likely. In the next fifty to a hundred years the history that we know may well be destroyed and replaced by fundamentalist doctrine.This was the intellectual element to the Heston film ( The Omega Man 1971 ) The idea that the virus infested were intent on destroying everything that mankind had made and returning to a superstitious pre-modern state. That is truly scary stuff, Vampires are just silly.<br/><br/>To scare kids you need visually scary monsters but these CGI creatures were awful. To make an 'animal out of man' takes an off-centre genius like the ( Alien 1979 ) designer H.R. Giger. Not a bunch of CGI hacks and this is what we are given. Look at the directors last fantasy film (Constantine 2005) it has the same uninspired creatures running through it. Men in latex would have been scarier and more convincing. Three years is a short amount of time for virus infected humans to mutate into super-agile monsters. The movie (Twenty eight days later 2002 ) had a far more plausible scenario for a virus epidemic than to turn humans into vampires ( In 28 days... the infected become ferocious and dehumanised like wild dogs but wore themselves out after 28 days ). This movie felt like a continuation of the Resident Evil movies. They just stole the plot from 'I am Legend' and Mr.Smith continues where Ms.Milla Jovovich left off. A very far fetched and silly, ignorantly supernatural adrenaline fuelled feast and not much else.<br/><br/>Plot holes that jumped out were... An out of towner is able to find her way 30 blocks or so from Grand Central to Washington square at night ( With the New Yorker in-tow out cold ) with probably well over a million creatures roaming the streets ( remember some roads are completely blocked with abandoned traffic and tanks etc..) Plus how was she able or even willing to follow him around at night in order to save him ?<br/><br/>Sanctuary is a sort of white picket fenced idyllic farm community. This commune is surrounded by a 5 and half billion creatures who will live and continue to breed and multiply. How are the survivors going to use the antidote ? It seems they would have to take the infected one by one and do a complete dialysis to remove the infected blood - How long is that going to take - to do a hundred let alone a million or a billion ?<br/><br/>A creature that is able to set up an elaborate trap ( having an understanding of physics in order to set up the pulley system trap) and having the nuance to delicately move a mannequin many blocks and know to place it on a section of road he uses. Then when this smart contemplative creature finally confronts his prey he can only resort to banging his head up against a glass wall ? Are we to put this down to excitement or an enormous plot/ character hole ?<br/><br/>Finally the biggest hole - about a world without men constantly looking after it - A single small fire with no one to stop it would have raged and destroyed the whole of Manhattan years ago. But the scariest idea - Imagine the amount of nuclear power stations ( 438 operational nuclear power stations as of 2001 ), and other hazardous facilities, military etc.. that would blow up if not attended world wide. There would be a thousand year nuclear winter and every living thing, the creatures, Smith and any other survivors, even the gazelles would be dead.<br/><br/>What will keep people wanting to see this awful movie is Will Smith who it seems is genuinely loved by one and all. Unless he is a moron he should show more conscientiousness about the movies he makes. For a man with this much power could change attitudes around the world with the projects he chooses or make bad Vampire movies and line his pockets.<br/><br/>With the world in such a mess why are movies like this still being made ? This film doesn't bare thinking about during or after viewing - for we humans like to get in the dark, alone amongst the flickering lights, to just relish the moment without thought - How much different than the fictional vampires in this movie are we ?"

","I don't normally comment on movies but I felt I had to do it this time. I thought that this movie would be decent but it was awful. Don't get me wrong, the idea of the movie was good, that's what made me watch it in the first place. I watch a lot of movies and normally the effects won't make or break a movie for me, but this time it does.<br/><br/>Without giving away any storyline, I would compare the effects to Jurassic Park. Back in 1993, these effects would be awesome, but it is 2007. Trust me, if you are a movie fan, the effects will actually draw you away from the movie. I feel that if the filmmakers just used practical effects it would have been better than complete CGI.<br/><br/>This would be a decent movie if it was about 30 minutes longer and if the filmmakers put some time into their movie. Will Smith carried the movie as usual but it wasn't enough for my money.<br/><br/>Please don't see this movie because if you do, you are sending the message to Hollywood that you don't care about the amount of effort they put into their movies and that is very important considering we are in the age of game and reality shows.

There was a perfect blend of horror, suspense, drama and action. Though not one genre overtakes the others, it blends perfectly to combine into an entertaining movie.

","The movie had everything to it's disposal to make it into a great flick, but to me it doesn't seem to find it's drive. Will Smith is quite OK, but never shines like he has done so many times in even worse movies. The scenery is actually quite nice, although to be honest, I know nothing of the city it plays in. CG tends to be too visible a few times.. But is not disturbing. <br/><br/>For the story itself, I am not so forgiving. There is really nothing about this movie that has not been done before. All aspects have already and are still being done in film, comics, books, comic-books, theater, etc. And thats of course never a problem if done nice, renewing, entertaining, with a great plot, etc, so I of course expected this renewal of old stuff to top them all!!! Sad to say it definitely didn't do so for me..<br/><br/>The few exciting moments are shot down because of continuity errors, or by creating false moments of suspense by letting the characters just do really stupid things. The last reason for me is an instant failure with these big budgets and stars because it is just way too easy. There is no elaborate clue to a plot. They just mess up, wait too long, walk too far, go to deep, etc.. And surprise, surprise, You got yourself an action scene.. Even if I really liked the movie, if I were honest I, (we), could simply name 1-3 things (and probably name the same) which just didn't have to happen and destroyed the film.<br/><br/>Will Smith mentioned a lot of times in shown interviews that the people of the shown city gave him and the crew a lot of the finger every time they saw them. This because of all the closed down streets while filming. I hope they won't do worse after seeing the poor result."

The start of the film is good, the emotion elements are also well played out by Smith but the film goes stir crazy towards the end and despite the big budget the cgi is the worst I've seen in a very very long time. The director seems dependent on the scary nature of his villains in this flick which could have worked great, if he had remembered to make the bad guys seem remotely REAL. This is on par with the likes of resident evil 3 which is a real shame for a film that has such clear potential to be better than it is.

"Quinoa1984","7","7","13","15 December 2007"," the tale of Robert Neville, five years in the future...
","Another post-apocalyptic flick? And this time with Will ""gettin jiggy with it"" Smith. And from the director of Constantine. But I liked it. Or at least relative to what are much better films of this ilk (28 Days... movies, where they don't rely on CGI for every single infected) and lesser (30 Days of Night, if the comparison stands. Director Francis Lawrence deals with the tragic nature of the ""last man is not alone"" idea seriously, and with little touches of humor (some of it, of course, relying on Smith's charm, which in a weird way makes his small-talk to mannequins he has set up in a video store as the sad continuation of social mental stability). It's also amplified by his companion, a dog, who becomes like the quasi-Wilson of the picture- only, arguably, with more sympathy going out to a dog than a volleyball. Their scenes are the most heartfelt, but without having to try or cloy too much.<br/><br/>I liked the dark atmosphere for many of the scenes, particularly dark in the sense of it being literal (Robert Neville going around in the building to find Samantha). And I also like how the writers, taking off of Matheson's great source of a novel, at the path of professional and mental well-being, in the face of absolute (and calculable) doom. Even some bits of rational vs irrationalism between Ana and Neville work pretty well. And it goes without saying the impressive scope of the special effects - meaning almost all of the location scenes out and about in Manhattan where telling CGI or green screen or what is very difficult.<br/><br/>For everything that is impressive, and for a big-big studio movie (probably the most expensive ""zombie"" movie ever made), there are some liabilities. Some may differ, but the infected as shown are all complete CGI creations, and look as such. There are some legitimate scares (the bit with the girl on the operating table that jets up after what looks like death is a good one), especially in the old-fashioned ""dont-go-there"" kind where things crawl in the unknown spaces. But the design of the infected is never very compelling, they look like monsters and despite the difference from a 28 Days kind of movie the lack of a recognizable human feature (past the obvious fact that as mutants they're meant to look a little skewed) it's never too compelling an example. They look, as many suggest, out of a run-of-the-mill Playstation game.<br/><br/>But nevertheless it's worth a full admission price; I Am Legend is creepy entertainment that works well for the multiplexes. Smith as the (would-be) lone hero Robert Neville is in near perfect form; it might even be his best dramatic performance to date, where he calls on all of his resources to make this a guy we want on our side. He makes Neville much more human than Charlton Heston did in The Omega Man, and believable when he should be at his most pathetic. Even through monologing about Bob Marley Smith's interesting- a true leading man, and well worth this respectable treatment of a once-again adaptation of a classic science fiction/horror piece. Whether it's a great film or not you be the judge."

","I just saw the movie last night, and it was a great piece of filmaking, in my opinion. This is no mere action-thriller...this is a true psychological thriller with some horror/action elements scattered throughout to keep the multiplex crowds awake. Will Smith plays against type here as the protagonist Robert Neville, who struggles against insanity as he searches for the cure to the virus that has apparently made him the last uninfected man on earth. Smith does an excellent job here of showing the effects of isolation, loneliness and desperation. Gone is the supercool, in-control, wisecracking badass of Bad Boys, Men in Black and Independence Day. Here, he plays closer to the vulnerability he explored in I, Robot and perfected in The Pursuit of Happiness. I was reminded quite a bit of Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away, which Smith cites as an influence for making this movie. All in all, this movie is taut, gripping and intense, both emotionally and psychologically. The visuals of (the real) Manhattan, emptied out by the virus are both breathtaking and spooky. The intensity of the performances by the CG creatures is so convincing it makes the infected of 28 Days/Weeks Later seem like they're moving in slow motion. The story plays very close to the vest of the original novel, while simultaneously tipping its hat to the Vincent Price and Charlton Heston adaptations, and weaves its own new tapestry as well. The movie was extremely well done and is sure to be an instant classic. Bravo to all involved."

","Saw a free sneak preview of I AM LEGEND - so the price was right.

There's a lot of silence and dead-weight scenes to ""convince"" us of his solitude, too many. But to top it off, the CGI of animals and creatures is BADLY done. Often you could perceive the zombies/animals as, well, rendered! Detractively unconvincing really. In fact without Smith, the project would go straight to video - not really sure what he saw in it. He does a pretty good job as sort of a psychologically worn out military scientist. The last quarter of the movie seems thrown together though. The movie might've done better just focusing on the moments leading up to the spread of the virus. At any event, I'd avoid paying money to see it in the theater - maybe worth a rental for Will Smith fans. Mixed - close to a dud with some redeeming scenes."
"john-quel","3","18","43","22 December 2007"," Going to the dogs: Hollywood and the lost art of the screenplay
","I did not go into ""I am Legend"" expecting much. I liked the Charleton Heston version and there was also one other I have not seen. To be fair, there was some good stuff in the movie, here and there: the numerous shots of NYC devoid of people are impressive and though one soon feels the profusion of such shots is unnecessary (only the dimmest would not have gotten the point early on), it was understandable that the producers are eager to share their accomplishment. The movie must have cost a bundle. Better use it all.<br/><br/>Moreover, Will Smith has a few effective scenes, and it was not his fault that he was upstaged by his canine co-star, who deserves some kind of animal Oscar (I believe there actually is such a thing). Finally, the myth of ""I Am Legend"" is a powerful one. It's a strong story, the kind of story it would take considerable effort to mess up. Who has not felt at times that he is among the last of humanity, struggling to survive while surrounded by vampires (figurative vampires) -- perhaps at a family gathering or company picnic? Yet the movie can be barely said to work. It is one of those films in which any given scene is either good, but we've seen it before, many times before, or bad, and we really don't want to see it now at all. A film in which drama is repeatedly sacrificed to special effects and big scenes. One leaves the film not so much hating it, but wondering what was the point? To the screen writers of this travesty here is a clue: without drama, there can be no point. This is terribly lazy screen writing. For example, the credits reference the work of both prior screenplays. Did the currently screen writers somehow find the original source material weak and insufficient? If so, why even make the movie? This is what we call a bad sign.<br/><br/>Here is an example of how bad it is, one of many. Since nothing substantive follows from the scene, I think I can describe it without spoiling anything.<br/><br/>The scene is a flashback. It shows a huge, panicking crowd trying to escape. People are being given eye scans to see if they have contracted the virus (what the virus turns the infected into will be noted shortly.) A soldier who is doing the scanning, first gets a bad (positive) reading on the hero's wife. Now remember, Smith's character is a medical doctor. One of the Army's highest ranking in fact. Here's what happens. Smith starts yelling at the soldier, screaming out his rank and demanding the man scan his wife again. The soldier complies (why would he be reluctant to give a second scan?). This time the reading is negative. End of scene.<br/><br/>What is wrong here? For one thing, a real doctor would know at once that either the instrument is defective or the soldier does not know how to use it. Since the procedure is quite simple, the latter possibility can be ignored. There's not much time. The first, however, cannot. There is a grave risk that the instrument is defective. Which means infected people have likely been allowed through. His wife may be now become of them. Remember, Smith is a top ranking military doctor. He must be aware of that risk. He must be aware of his responsibilities. What to do? What a real doctor would do is stop everything, use another detector, and perform the scan again.<br/><br/>The situation now is quite tense. If his wife passes this scan, at least we can be confident that she is free of the disease. But if she fails He tests her again. Either way, the danger of infected people having gotten through is considerable. The terror on Smith's face should show the decisions he has to make and at once.<br/><br/>This alternative scene would also, btw, tie directly with a later scene, the best in the film, so the audience would be prepared for it.<br/><br/>But the variant scene, the one with that thing we call drama, is not in the movie. Instead we get explosions, helicopters spinning out of control, and a chance for Smith to bawl out a white guy for no reason whatever. The whole screen play is like that.<br/><br/>It gets worse. Smith talks along with an entire sequence in Shrek (I) to tell us how much he loves that movie? Why? What does this add? He gives us a lecture on how much he likes Bob Marley's music. I like it too, but why are these scenes here? What is the point? (I suspect, cynically no doubt, the company that made ""I Am Legend"" has financial interests in both).<br/><br/>There is also something vaguely racist about the whole business. If you imagine a movie about a white doctor being besieged Well, this film piles it on. New York is perhaps the most diverse city on earth. Why, when the plague hits does it turn the victims into incredibly buff, twenty-something, white people (who would be killers on a basketball court)? Smith really hates them. One long action scene demonstrates the full degree of that hatred -- but they are his patients, for god's sake! Why in that scene would he risk throwing his life away for the sheer joy of killing them? And wouldn't you think that Smith, who is himself is immune to the plague, as a doctor would find that fact an incredibly important clue? Nope. He does nothing with it.<br/><br/>Ebert has written about the offensive stranger on the bus. The smelly, boring, crude, and obnoxious individual, always too close for comfort and who is impossible to ignore. Now imagine a two hour bus ride with that individual. That is what this movie and its screen play is like.<br/><br/>For shame on all concerned.<br/><br/>Except, Sam the dog."

The world population has been decimated by a virus (Resident Evil) and now mutated humans are all thats left and attacking the survivor (Mr Smith) - again - Resident Evil, All the Night, Dawn, Day ____ of the Dead, movies etc. Mr Smith does okay but there are some curious plot lines - this senior Military officer who is cool under pressure and apparently watched his family die along with most of the rest of the earth's population systematically tries to find a cure but when his dog is infected he apparently can't take any more and goes suicidal. The CGI created besties are overkill (pardon the pun) and are also cinematic retreads with insatiable appetites and Spiderman-like capabilities to scale walls, the speed and agility of a cheetah and strength enough to break down steel walls - again think Jason, Michael Meyers, Resident Evil, etc. Even the Zombie dogs are a big knockoff - Resident Evil. Blame the script, there is nothing new or original here and even some of the pacing is uneven with a slow start then a overly rapid (and undramatic) ending. if you really like this type of movie do yourself a favor and go look up the original - The Omega Man - although dated it is more more developed effort at dealing with these themes."

","I was really looking forward to seeing ""I Am Legend"", from the moment I found out earlier this year. In preparation to seeing the movie, I watched Vincent Price in ""The Last Man on Earth"" and Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"". Even though the main ideas of the two prior versions were the same (last man, virus, night creatures, etc.), the delivery varied for their particular time. So I was intrigued to see how the storyline would be adapted to our time.<br/><br/>Boy, the first thing that struck me was the set. Being born and growing up in New York City, it really hit me hard to see the devastation and isolation of the city that ""Never Sleeps"". The streets, the abandoned cars, the bridges, the U.N.,etc. It really hit home. Then we see a much slender, leaner Will Smith trying to cope with the fact that he was alone. His portrayal of Robert Neville is Oscar worthy. Very moving. I find the origin of the virus quite interesting as it comes as a side effect for a cure for cancer. The prior two movies used a plague (The Last Man on Earth) and germ warfare (The Omega Man) to explain the virus. The use of a cure that transforms into a virus gives it an ironic twist.<br/><br/>The movie runs for about an hour and forty minutes, but is very fast paced and well directed. The creatures, even though they are CGI, were creepy and mixed well into the movie. I'm not sure they could have gotten the same effect from live actors. I will refrain from giving any more details to avoid spoiling the movie.<br/><br/>Very entertaining."
"chad-m-miller","7","6","11","17 December 2007"," Well done, but misses a golden opportunity to really shine... << Mostly Spoiler Notes >>
","As a former development exec within the movie machine of Hollywood, I've read hundreds of scripts. This one I read about 10 years ago in some vastly different incarnation. Worthy of seeing for it's vision of the city of New York largely reclaimed by nature. One hopes that the upcoming remake of LOGAN'S RUN will learn a few key things from I AM LEGEND.<br/><br/>The following details are my view of where this production lost it's way. This is only worth reading if you've already seen the movie or have no interest in seeing it.<br/><br/><<< SPOILER ALERT -- REST OF THIS COMMENTARY!!!! >>> How did the writer, the producers, the studio and the star ALL over-look the prime opportunity to really make this movie a movie to remember? How did they miss the story that they almost wrote but then either decided to un-write or ignore? I'm writing here about the importance of the ""Leader"" of the infected population. There's a key scene in which one of the creatures risks being burned by sunlight to see what has happened to one of the other creatures that Will Smith's character has captured for research purposes. The movie leaves this scene unexamined and throws away the huge potential for the story to have found a far deeper meaning that would have enhanced the word of mouth factor.<br/><br/>Even as I was exiting the theater I heard viewers reacting negatively to the hokey and forced ending. Avoiding this all the writers had to do was find in the ""zombies"" what Neville's character finds in the woman and child that too conveniently arrive out of nowhere: a sense that a future is possible.<br/><br/>The reason the leader of the infected people is willing to stick his head out into the sunlight is that the creature that Will Smith captures is his daughter. Ahhhh, yes, those of you who have seen the movie suddenly get it. This must have been an early draft of the project that someone unwisely decided to rewrite. The reason he is so steadfast to capture Neville's character is NOT to kill him, but to find out where is daughter is. As evidenced by the infected leader's ability to plan and plot, they are not brain-dead creatures -- they are simply infected with a desire to kill that they cannot overcome.<br/><br/>So what would the climactic scene have been about then? That would have been about the leader of the infected seeing his daughter healed and projecting her (and Neville) from the other infected creatures -- to his demise, as Neville and the cured girl escape the city to restart the world and spread the cure.<br/><br/>Obviously there's lots more details that could have been worked into that, but it's amazing how everyone involved with this project opted for an ending that in no small way, is a symbolic justification of suicide bombers. That was just so silly, it nearly undid all the good stuff that came before it.<br/><br/>Overall the impact of missing these obvious story enhancements results in a movie that looses the heft it could have had. As it is, I AM LEGEND is only a fair movie that could have been great. Faults entirely at the feet of the development execs and writers who thought up the ham-fisted finale without first seriously considering the clues within the story itself. Amazing that they missed it. Just amazing.<br/><br/>As a movie lover and former development exec, all I ask is for a little attention to detail within a story. Apparently all involved were too busy to really read it carefully."

","I am a huge fan of post-apocalyptic films, and I don't mind a good vampire/zombie flick every now and then either, so it was with dual goodness in mind that I sat down to watch the new film I Am Legend... I went into it with expectations fairly high, after all how could you mess up a plot as simple as Will Smith versus Zombie-Vampires? With a terrible ending that's how.<br/><br/>The film opens with some awe inspiring shots of the empty New York City, and throughout the film the setting, an overgrown abandoned New York will have you wondering how much of the effects budget went to create it. The film is good for a while, just Neville and his dog, surviving, plus some super suspense when Sam (the dog) chases a caribou into a dark building (where, of course, dark forms lurk)... There are a few other good suspense scenes, but it isn't until a character other than Neville is introduced that the film turns sour.<br/><br/>A woman and her child turn up and want Neville to go to some ""colony"" that supposedly exists, but Neville's flawed stubborn character is reluctant to leave ""ground zero."" The film ends in one of the worst endings I've ever seen, I won't reveal it here directly, but it dropped my rating for the film from an 8 to a 6. If you took out the female character and added some kick-awesome scenes of Neville shooting or battling zombies and then added a different semi-happy ending it would be an excellent film. Heck you could even keep the woman and just change the last ten minutes of the film to have Neville's character fight it out or even escape...<br/><br/>In short, its not bad, but it isn't spectacular..."

","Let me say right off that movies that hype themselves with lots of fanfare are normally kind of a let down. This movie did not 'hype' itself the way MOST Hollywood films do, so I was more inclined to go see it.<br/><br/>With that being said ... this movie was only so-so story wise. Will Smith is a great actor (never cared for his music much) and the special effects of the abandoned city are damn near seamless (the one thing I really was surprised about) but the CGI of the 'Dark Seekers' and the animals were fair at best. I kept thinking 'Is this I,Robot with that creature from Lord of the Rings?'. The story has been pilfered over the years in so many ways with movies like the ones IMDb recommends, that this one has really missed it's window to be a really good movie that everyone should go see to be entertained.<br/><br/>Of course this is all just opinion, but isn't that what this comment section is all about?"
"spirit_pulse","5","8","16","21 January 2008"," Awful CGI
","A great film is let down by the worst CGI since The Mummy Returns. The infected are so completely unconvincing that they let the whole film down. Quite why the studio didn't simply use people in prosthetics and make-up baffles me. The studio could have saved themselves tons of cash and got a better film if they just hired extras and dressed them up. The scenes of an apocalyptic New York are breathtaking and while Will Smiths performance is one of his best, it's let down by the fact that his greatest threat, is poorly conceived. The CGI must have been made by a couple of kids in their bedroom on a laptop PC, and the studio responsible for the effects should be shut down. This film is also very exhausting. Its mostly Will on his own for the first half of the movie with occasional flashbacks on his life before the outbreak. It is almost completely devoid of humour and by the end, you feel drained. A half decent film with laughable CGI. Worth seeing, but not buying. No re-watchable factor here."

"Mark-Raistrick","1","11","24","30 December 2007"," Modern take on Noahs Ark
","The film is an apocalyptic tale about the potential pitfalls of modern science. It is set in New York and told from the perspective of the only remaining inhabitant in a city ravished by a virulent plague.<br/><br/>It is a well constructed and well acted film, sucking the viewer into the world they construct however the premise itself has been covered before and to a much higher standard, 12 Monkeys and 28 Days Later to name but two superior examples.<br/><br/>The special effects are somewhat disappointing and distract the viewer from being able to believe it what is ultimately an all too believable premise.<br/><br/>It is this believability which is ultimately the films undoing. The film starts slowly, setting up the classic Hollywood hero and treating us to some familiar shots of New York in an unfamiliar and desolate setting and plays on the base fears we all have of science run amuck.<br/><br/>Seemingly having given us our Hollywood sugar it then dishes out the medicine by transforming into a religious parable which appears to be loosely based on the biblical tale of Noah's Ark.<br/><br/>The ultimate message of the film ends up being that science is wrong and that salvation can only be found in trusting to faith. It disregards human endeavour and the desire to help cure horrible disease and suffering as somehow morally reprehensible without justification. Instead it suggests we trust that mass destruction and suffering is part of a larger grand design and that we should absolve ourselves from blame and responsibility and lay down our arms to that plan.<br/><br/>When human intelligence and science finally do offer a solution the film insists that the solution must come at a terrible price.<br/><br/>Like all creationism, which however cloaked is what the film ultimately represents, the film abhors science and ignores the idea that science can play a part in belief systems because whilst science can be reconciled with modern religion it can not be reconciled fundamental interpretations of religious doctrine since science by definition is the exact opposite of fundamentalism.<br/><br/>I advise viewers to watch the film with caution lest they get sucked into the dubious morality this film expounds.<br/><br/>The fact that this film had had such a successful release is perhaps the most disturbing point of all and whilst it may deserve 4/5 out of 10 for film making alone, I can not bring myself to give it anything other than 1 due to the story itself."

"Coventry","8","9","19","23 December 2007"," Richard Matheson's Legend lives on ...
","By now, and ironically enough, novelist Richard Matheson has become a bit of a living legend himself. Countless of his screenplays resulted in terrific horror movies (""The Pit and the Pendulum"", ""Night of the Eagle"", ""Duel"") and which other author can claim he lived to see no less than three cinematic adaptations of his most famous story? And it's about time someone updated the marvelous concept, as the other versions date back to the early 60's (""The Last Man on Earth"", starring the formidable Vincent Price) and the early 70's (with Charlton Heston starring in ""The Omega Man""). From what I've heard and read there were earlier plans to accomplish a newer version, even acclaimed director Ridley Scott was interested during the 1990's apparently, but we still had to wait until now; for this tense and surprisingly unsettling film directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith.<br/><br/>Well, personally, I'd say this post-millennium version of Matheson's timeless Sci-Fi story was well worth waiting for! The author wrote his novel ""I Am Legend"" in the early fifties  1954 if I'm not mistaken  but the plot's impact is still as powerful as ever, and with the nowadays available & computerized techniques filmmakers can really re-create the apocalyptic ambiance like Matheson truly intended it. The earliest sequences showing the completely forsaken and bewildered avenues of New York City are, alongside Will Smith's perplexing performance, deeply impressive and memorable. This is probably the only movie ever that features deers running over Times Square! Smith portrays one of the most legendary fictional characters ever, Robert Neville, and the film starts three years after the feared Krippen Virus exterminated the earth's entire population. During the daytime, Neville wanders through the abandoned streets of NY and desperately attempts not to go insane due to his loneliness. He has mature conversations with his loyal dog Sam (a beautiful and intelligent German Shepard) as well as with mannequin dolls he randomly placed in a DVD store. He also continues to search for an antidote, because he still believes he can reverse the virus and save humanity. At night he has to hide for the so-called Dark Seekers. They are former human beings who survived the virus, but it nevertheless transformed them into monstrous creatures that can't stand daylight and prowl the streets at night for food. Will Smith's one man show as the supposed last man on earth is staggering, petrifying, poetic and saddening all at the same time. Through brief flashbacks we also gradually learn what exactly happened to his own family members during the times of the virus' outbreak, and these sequences only make his sense of perseverance more admirable. The Dark Seekers are reasonably menacing, but still a little too CGI for my taste. I still prefer the primitive zombies of ""Last Man on Earth"" and even the rather silly looking albinos of ""The Omega Man"" had more apocalyptic charm. Notwithstanding, some of the sequences involving Neville and his dog versus the Dark Seekers are genuinely eerie and atmospheric. Unlike many of my fellow reviewers around here apparently, I also really liked how the screenplay left a lot of questions unanswered and how it allows the viewers to contemplate about the missing parts themselves. For example, the movie never shows any footage of the three devastating years between the outbreak of the virus and the setting of the film. However, I do agree with the vast majority of reviewers regarding the disappointing climax. Although I do believe the modern cinematic times are partially to blame for the hopeful denouement, because back in the 60's and early 70's unhappy endings were far more common. At least the ending of ""I Am Legend"" is partially unhappy.<br/><br/>You wouldn't have said so after his previous achievement in direction ""Constantine"", but ""I Am Legend"" certainly proves that Francis Lawrence disposes of a talented filmmaker's visions and a great eye for detail. The film is nightmarish yet beautiful to observe, with weeds and flowers growing back through the asphalted streets, billboards and advertisement signs that haven't been changed in more than three years, car wrecks and buildings that slowly decaying in the streets and the last man on earth smashing against golf balls from the wings of a military jet. ""I Am Legend"" is at times even almost hauntingly poetic and I'm pretty sure the now 81-year-old Richard Matheson will appreciate the latest interpretation of his brilliant work. We can only hope the next large-scaled Matheson project (a remake of that other classic Sci-Fi story entitled ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"") will be as good as this."
"DonFishies","6","14","33","14 December 2007"," A half baked story ruins the film's chances of being legendary
","In a few years time, a cure for cancer has been discovered. It works perfectly at first, but then a virus emerges that begins to wipe out the human population. Fast forward a few years later, and scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the only living human in New York City. Along with his dog Sam, he searches and prays to encounter other survivors. But while day time presents only the challenge of outgunning wild animals, the nights bring mutant zombies just trying to stay fed.<br/><br/>I never saw The Omega Man or The Last Man on Earth, but I am very curious if they were anywhere near as disheartening as this film. I did not go in with the highest of expectations, but after sitting through at least an hour of this movie, I began to actually think I was going to leave surprised in how great it was. Sadly, that did not end up being the case.<br/><br/>The story, as unoriginal as it sounds, starts off intriguing and genuinely nerve-wracking. We see Neville and his dog going about their day-to-day routines, and we begin to realize the loneliness and terror that he is going through. He nostalgically watches old news programs from before the virus hit, keeps pictures of his family laying around the house, and frequently dreams about the last night he saw his family. These moments provide just the right amount of pathos needed to feel for this character, and as an audience, we grow dependant on wondering if he will achieve his dream of interaction and end the frightening isolation he faces. Much the same as Tom Hanks in Cast Away, we learn to appreciate what is basically one character interacting with another who cannot speak back.<br/><br/>But this is about all we get from his character by way of development. He spends much of the film searching for a cure for the epidemic, and we learn early on that it was his job to do so before the population was wiped out. But never once are we told why it was him chosen, or even how the epidemic started in the first place. We see articles and cut-outs littered around apartments, but never once does Neville stop and mention anything. Even worse, why is he the only one left? Just what exactly happened to everyone else? Unfortunately, obvious questions like these (and many, not so subtle others) are never answered. One can possibly leave it to the imagination, but with as perplexing an idea as this film presents, you would assume that the filmmakers would try and cover every angle of personality of this character. Instead, he is a few steps above being a one-dimensional card board cut out. The last third of the film does not help much either.<br/><br/>There are also a few annoying gaps of logic in reference to the zombie characters. Besides appearing at night, emitting horrible howls at any given moment and running like Olympic marathoners, none of them are given much else to do as characters. We are introduced early on to what one would assume is the leader (played by Dash Mihok), but never get a sense of why he leads. We just get terrifying yelps and near horrifying visuals. It does not help either that the makeup and special effects used for these creatures seems like they were just thrown together, instead of being molded into perfection.<br/><br/>Smith, as the lead and only real intelligible character for the majority of the movie, is a mixed bag. This is not his best performance, but it is not nearly his worst either. He seems to be throwing his whole heart into the role, but its demand just does not seem to be wearing off on him. Even though we are meant to believe that he is slowly going crazy from a lack of social interaction, Smith never truly shows this trait. He pokes and nudges at it, but there is something off in his calculations. Hell, his most emotionally packed sequences are almost laughable compared to some of the material in last year's The Pursuit of Happiness (and that movie was only watchable because of him). His dedication to the role wears off far too easy, and never do we get even a remotely close attempt at emulating the brilliant performance Hanks made on that island years ago. Smith is good, but just not good enough.<br/><br/>What the film loses out on in the story and in Smith, is completely different with the visuals. They are simply awestriking. Looking at the ravaged New York, it is almost too scary to think of it ever looking anything as dystopic and plant-friendly as this. These sets were created with precision and care. While the zombies look a little haphazard, these backgrounds are just stunning. Even his apartment, where much of the film takes place, looks simply amazing. There is nothing simplistic about them, and they end up working great for the film. The colours conveyed throughout the film are also very interesting, and are well captured by the camera.<br/><br/>The special effects on the other hand, are a little shifty. The monsters do not look that great, but some of the animals look photorealistic, and some of the sequencing (including a nighttime scene on a dock) are very well thought-out and put together. It is visually pleasing, and when they are actually on, the graphics look astounding.<br/><br/>Plagued with problems, I Am Legend could have probably done with a solid rewrite to pack in a few more answers. Leaving it to the audience's own devices is simply uncalled for. I realize they wanted something fast paced, and the film delivers on that ideal for the most part, but only because it sacrifices too much of the all important story. More work here would have only made the film stronger, and Smith's performance potentially legendary.<br/><br/>6/10."

","I did not know what to expect. But it delivered. What? I am still not sure. It was intense, and I think that it may have been a little much for PG-13. I looked at the ratings after the show, and R might have been a better choice, even NC-17. It was good to see our hero in a new role. But that is all I can say. It was a horror movie for sure. But it had an effect on the whole crowd who walked out of the early SF showing. Stunned and dazed. Many clapped, some sat for a while, and all came out feeling like we were glad that it was not real. It made me realize how lonely you could be if you were different from the rest of the population. New York can be that way, as it is. It is worth watching but don't go thinking it is Will taking on the world in a stereotypical kind of way. It makes him more real than he has been in any blown out of perspective action movie. He's Human! Maybe that was the point! I think I will look at my friendships a little closer as well. As one reviewer said, ""It may disappoint some of his fans"". About time. Life ain't all fun and games. His comments and the plot could be put towards many issues, that we have in our everyday lives, and I hope people can see that. Otherwise it has action that can get the biggest tough guy to wonder what is going to happen next, and will he be able to control his flinch reaction. Man I hope my friends can sleep after I took them out for this movie. But I wish I had a girl at the movie, can you say get a little closer. Hope you see it!"

The special effects are good and New York was portrayed very well. After that you just expect to get a jump so it looses the surprise. Parts of the film were very predictable and the ending was just a complete let down and unnecessary. I found it cheesy and just a waste of time. The acting was questionable at times and lines that were meant to be funny weren't. By the end of the film I had no sympathy for the character what so ever and a lot was left unexplained.<br/><br/>A plot full holes and a character that just isn't remotely believable makes this movie a complete let down.

","First and foremost - I love the book. It's one of the few I read every few years and I still get a kick out of it.<br/><br/>As for the movie, well since I saw the casting I didn't expect much from it. I also read a comment a while back saying it was going to be ""so cool - like 28 days later in New York"". That didn't inspire me with confidence. 28 days was great but IT was inspired by books like I Am Legend and movies like Night Of The Living Dead - I can't see how it can be used as inspiration for it's own inspiration (if that at all makes sense). Without wanting to drag UK films down - I felt that that comment meant they were setting the bar a bit low.<br/><br/>So - I finally went to see it. It had one or two ""okay"" moments but overall very lacklustre. I thought Constantine was okay(despite being different from the course material again) but the production team, writers and director have missed a real opportunity by not going for a faithful adaption of the novel (which also made a great 4-part graphic novel for anyone who remembers). Annoyingly Will Smith came across with some quality acting at moments, but these were few and far between before the movie slid into the usual formula which we all know too well - gunfire, explosions, our hero screaming at the camera and shameless product placement from Apple and Ford which was almost on a par with what we had to put up with in I-Robot (""cool, converse 2004 classics"" - aargh!).<br/><br/>And some constructive criticism to the CG department - that movie was a bad day at the office for you all and these days there's no excuse for that sort of thing. The monsters looked terrible and the Ford Mustang tearing through the streets at the start looked less convincing than the Mustang I drive in PGR3.<br/><br/>When will the US accept that we've seen this sort of nonsense so often that we can spot it coming a mile away. They've got great talent and resources yet they choose to release sub-par movies. My advice to the casual viewer is to resist the heavy marketing and wait for DVD, then borrow it from a friend (just not me, I won't be buying it - I have the book which is far better and cheaper).<br/><br/>I live in hope that one day they'll get a decent adaption of this book to the screen. I just hope I don't have to wait long for that."

The horror and action scenes were kinda too spaced out and didn't last very long. The horror scenes themselves were not even scary in the least bit. The thing was is you knew the exact second when something was going to happen, It was a little too obvious. The action scenes were weak with the exclusion of the perimeter explosion.

"chimera-4","4","5","9","10 January 2008"," Slow, Boring, with all new pointless ending! **MAJOR SPOILERS**
","Well, this is the third adaptation of Richard Mathesons novel and we are still left wanting something decent. The Omega Man though was a good movie (IMO) but it has dated a little and ""I AM LEGEND"" was in need of a modern take on the story.<br/><br/>Here we have Will Smith's Robert Neville, A military scientist who (it's alluded) had some role in a supposed cure for cancer that mutated into a virus that killed 90% of the planet and turned most of whoever was left into ravenous sub human creatures that skulk in the dark, feeding on the immune and being unable to expose themselves to the sun. Now this was the first mistake as far as I'm concerned. The infected in the novel (and the Omega Man) were still Human and had human intelligence. One of them was a friend of Nevilles who used to take great delight in taunting him nightly on his doorstep(""Come out Neville, what's the point, you're the last"" etc). There were still some human connections between the protagonist and the infected. Here the CGI creatures garner no sympathy whatsoever and there's barely any link between them and humanity at all.<br/><br/>The flashbacks were totally unessecary although they did provide some contrast between the normal bustling streets, alive with human activity and the bleak empty post apocalyptic world Will Smith finds himself inhabiting. I found the film to be dull in a lot of places with very few scenes that contained any real meat or action and a lot of it especially early on was just tedious. The film just starts to heat up and then finishes which brings me on to my biggest problem with the movie. The ending.<br/><br/>There's going to be some ****MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD so IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING STOP READING NOW****.<br/><br/>In the novel the title ""I am Legend"" had some meaning. I mean the whole story was about the last Human on Earth. When Neville dies at the end, normal humanity disappears into Legend. When I first picked up the book I thought the title would mean that the hero would be some a$$ kicking bad boy that would reclaim the earth in the name of humanity and actually found the ending quite powerful and sad.<br/><br/>Now the movie here doesn't quite go to those lengths but it does have the ""Good guy sacfrifices himself for the good of humanity as he finds he isn't the last after all"" bit which, in the face of the original ending just seemed contrived and cliché and quite honestly something the suits likely ordered tacked on.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS END*** Now Will Smith actually does a pretty good turn as Neville seeing as he pretty much carries the entire movie, it's just a shame his material is bland and mostly really boring. Production values are also pretty good across the board with the bleak deserted streets of New York looking really eerie. The FX were also OK if misplaced in this movie...<br/><br/>The director (Francis Lawrence) isn't to fault either as I felt he did a pretty good job and the bits I did find that held my attention were probably down to him. I also loved Constantine. The problem lies in the contrivances taken with a script that really wasn't very good to start with and should have had a couple more rewrites to really nail the substance of the tale being told.<br/><br/>Shame. Maybe we'll get the version we should have gotten by now in about 20 years."

","It was a good concept. It didn't go the direction I originally thought it would though. In short, if you liked watching Tom Hanks by himself on an island for two hours in the movie Cast Away, then go see this movie. I thought at first the ""zombies"" would be more antagonizing in the movie than the actually were. The only time I felt suspense in the movie was when a monster would come out of no where and make a bunch of loud noises. They tried to keep you involved with flashbacks throughout the movie, but here again I thought it was a good concept that the movie fell short of. There were some pretty cool scenes here there, but they might have well just been Ford advertisements. Go rent this one when it comes out on DVD and spend your money on another movie at the theater. Then again, I overheard a guy in line behind me when I was buying tickets say that he had seen the movie twice already because he thought it was so good. Maybe I'm missing something or inadvertently fell asleep during the movie. It wasn't near as action packed or suspenseful as I thought it would be."
"fallingforever","1","5","9","24 December 2007"," This movie made me hate Will Smith and Everyone else involved with this movie
","Let me start by saying that this is one of my favorite stories ever. When a book gets made into a movie I usually expect a fair amount of changes to be made. Understanding this I went to see I Am Legend. My verdict... Will Smith and the writers are Satan and I want the hour and a half I spent watching this movie back. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with Richard Matheson's short story I Am Legend and I am quite sure that Matheson is rolling in his grave over this film. They removed the humanity from the story. Instead of being a flawed everyman, Neville is portrayed as being of a higher intellect and therefore is not as easy to relate to. Neville is supposed to go through deep psychological drama, he is supposed to struggle with alcoholism and suicidal tendencies. The film was advertised Neville as being the last man on earth... but he isn't. Again a major deviation from the original story. The ending of the film made me want to cry and walk out of the theater and go and find Will Smith and demand my money back. I couldn't fathom any way that the writers could have deviated from the original ending. The original ending was so powerful and unexpected and this ending felt cheap and made me feel dirty. Why did I feel dirty? Because Hollywood took a truly deep and creepy ending and flipped it around so that the masses could blindly enjoy it. Is this elitist of me? I guess so in the terms that most people will see this film and think that this was the story Matheson wrote. Unfortunately it isn't, it is the farthest thing from it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Don't go see this even if you are paid."
"bootlegboab","5","5","9","22 December 2007"," Bitty, disjointed, usual Hollywood thoughtless ending!
","This is my first ever comment here, I think this site is tremendous and a must for me before going to any movie. That is why I decided to write a comment, as most seem to be applauding this as brilliant, and heart warming. I have to greatly disagree! This film for both my son and I was very disjointed, and if I hadn't seen the Omega Man years ago, I would not have been able to fill my son in on the missing details at the beginning, I have never been to a movie with him where he asked so many questions! He is an avid movie watcher and normally does not have to be filled in, or have things explained, not on this movie! Will Smith to me is a great actor, whom most of his films have repeat watch factor, and I was so looking forward to seeing what was done with this story to bring it into this century. That was done well, with the use of flashbacks, but after that for me it goes down hill, you never really get a feel for who Will Smith's character is, and the film feels like it should have been longer to allow the watcher to figure out what is happening, in places it is trying to be to clever, but without having prior knowledge of the story line, its just confusing. Plus without spoiling the ending, is this really the type of movie to be released at this time of year, after all its Christmas!"
"jai84@yahoo.com","8","5","9","17 December 2007"," One Man Show !!
","This is easily Will Smith's best performance till date, forget ""Ali"" forget ""legend of bagger Vance"", his face will haunt you for days to come even after you finish watching this amazing film. Francs Lawrence has perhaps pulled off the most difficult movie to make, as most people would wonder how can a movie be entertaining and thought provoking when there are no characters except for the lead actor. But once you start watching the film you will forget all these notions and just go with the ride. Right from the opening scene till the credits, it gripped me and never let go. Will Smith finally gets a chance in an action/horror movie to showcase his histrionic ability and he impresses with subtle touches of humor. Must See.<br/><br/>9 on 10. Will watch it again."
"danebecky","4","5","9","16 December 2007"," ""I Am Legend"" misses the point of its title
","None of the other adaptions of Richard Matheson's novelette stayed particularly true to the original story. ""Omega Man"" and ""The Last Man on Planet Earth"" at least seemed to understand the original even if they decided to downplay the stories central theme. ""I AM Legend"", the only film to actually use the title of the novelette doesn't even seem to understand its own name, tacking on a stupid half hearted attempt to find a new reason for the name in the final minute and a half. It transforms the story questioning what it is to be a hero or a villain, a human being or a monster into a bad version of a remake of a Romero zombie movie.<br/><br/>Deserted New York did look fairly cool and the film moved along well enough, but that's hardly enough to rise above its poor construction and Hollywood blockbusterization of the original material."
"mrjrd869","1","9","20","29 December 2007"," Writers were corrupted by producers
","This has got to be one of the all-time worst transitions on the big screen in history. If you read this and other comments/reviews and really want to leave the theater having seen a great movie 'segment', leave after the very sad scene in the lab (you will know it). After that, the movie goes sideways, as if the writers were told to insert particular content into a story where it didn't belong. Transforming then from initial self-destructive urges to some sort of divine agent, what began as one of the best movies I've ever seen insofar as character, story and unpredictability (despite my being a fan of Omega Man) goes down in my movie history as the worst producing disaster ever, culminating in my feelings of anger and frustration leaving the theater.<br/><br/>Once again, Hollywood blew it big-time. Michael Tadross gets the credit for allowing this to happen. I am angry. Omega Man deserved a better homage.<br/><br/>This movie deserves nothing better than a 1 for not letting the writers finish the story they started without corrupting interests."
"joshuascohen","5","14","35","16 December 2007"," Am I the only one disappointed by this flick?
","This movie is best described as Castaway meets 28 days later. I never expected nearly two hours of complete silence and half an hour at a time where virtually nothing goes on. Sure the graphics are great and this film's ""vision"" of post apocalyptic new york is eerie and foreboding, but that simply doesn't justify the apparent lack of entertainment value this film provides. Perhaps most jarring is the lack of development of secondary plot lines. Without giving anything away, all I can say is that a limited use of flashbacks doesn't help the reader get through the massive suspension of disbelief required to comprehend some of the latter events in the film. Will Smith provides an adequate job of moving this very slow trip along, but even his scifi prowess can't compensate for what really amounts to an event-less script-- this would be fine if we were meant to understand that the point of the movie was to focus on Robert Neville's agonizing loneliness and desperation, but the aforementioned half-hearted attempts at a back-story (and secondary plot elements) muddles this goal and creates an all around misguided flick. Worth seeing I guess but certainly not the blockbuster holiday event I was hoping for."
"fenofele","1","6","12","14 May 2008"," Shame on this crappy remake
","Watch out, Robert Matheson's fans. I don't know who is to be blamed, but they have spoiled and upset every single line of the original novel. Firstly, the evil creatures: in the novel they are still human, with cannibal behavior, but still human; in this film, they have turned them in dumb anthropomorphic animal. Moreover, they are realized in computer graphic. Come on! Finally, the whole plot has been upset such that even the title has to be interpreted in a different way. However, for those who have not read the book, the film offers a hour and half of cheap entertainment. Cheap compared to what the film could have offered if it would be more close to the original."

","I am still sitting here at the computer and I still can't remember a film I have liked less for a long time. I spent more than half of ""I Am Legend"" with my eyes shut, and some of the time with my fingers covering my ears, too. Even so, I still noticed some very basic plot faults, and an unsettling religious undercurrent. I am such a baby, but I get really scared in scary films. There were all these very frightening, hungry aerobics instructors with rabies running around in the dark and trying to eat Will Smith and his nice dog. The sustained level of anguish was simply too much for me, although the scenes of deserted New York are brilliant. At the party afterwards, Will Smith was nice but a bit too obviously playing the cool guy with heaps of clout, but I suppose he is allowed to."

","This being one of my all time favourite sci-fi/horror novels, I was supremely disappointed to see how the makers of this film missed the point so completely and blatantly. The features that made the novel just so amazing are just plain not there, such as the idea that the vampires were sentient and had their own society, Neville really being the last man on earth, the idea that there is no cure because the vampires are NOT virus or infection sufferers, and the poignant and profound ending wherein we see the vampires' society takes over the world, leaving Neville as what vampires are to us, a legend, and something to be feared that must be destroyed. Instead of all this genius, originality and deep meaning we were shown in the novel, we instead get 28 Days Later... In New York. The film, while certainly action packed and exciting, had NOTHING to do with the original novel and this to anyone who has read the novel, will be a great disappointment. This should have been 28 Days Later 3, because it bears about as much resemblance to I Am Legend as it does to Bambi."

Last person on earth, so it seems, (it's in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler), except for the zombies who survived, blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>The plot was such a ripoff that whoever wrote the screenplay didn't seem to care how they contradicted themselves. Now THAT'S a new achievement, ripping off a plot line older than dirt and managing to screw it up.<br/><br/>What the goal appeared to be is to take a plot that was ""in the bag"" and dress it up with Will Smith and special effects. No care taken to any sort of accuracy in the sub-plot line or dialog. It's sad because this movie could have gone a whole other direction and it is simply recycled crap.<br/><br/>Will Smith turns in an exceptional performance. It's a shame the writers didn't do the same.<br/><br/>One last thing, if you are going to simulate medical procedures in a film, try watching a few episodes of ER. At least they get it right.

","please take two scripts for the same movie, read them, then decide in whatever manner you use to choose scripts on a winner. Throw that one out and go with the one you hate because the scripts you are choosing are crap.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read I Am Legend will be disappointed in the movie. However the disappointment is bearable in this case as the movie, as a whole, is watchable. It isn't great. Nothing about it is great save the realistic vision of an empty NYC. Will Smith once again shows that he is the new Tom Cruise, talented enough to make people show up but not talented enough to blow you away. Part of this can be blamed on the director, part on the script but Smith has never been believable in anything that wasn't a comedy. Basically if you want to see the agony of a lone survivor, rent Cast Away one more time.<br/><br/>Anyone else tired of doomsday flix that promise so much but deliver so little? There were a few tense moments a few chills but other than that the movie was Hollywood 101. Big name star. Big budget wasted on CGI. CGI dominates and eventually causes viewer to lose interest in the story. Dog and Smith or Hanks and ball? Watchable movie that won't make you think of Oscar's but also won't make you cringe at the money you just spent. <br/><br/>But fans of the book will be disappointed that the movie isn't faithful to the source material. Fans of movie making will be the biggest losers as once again a studio took great source material and made it something far less than what it could have been. How does an inexperienced director coming off the disappointing Constantine get handed another big budget movie? How do the writers off such trash as Constantine, Batman Returns and Poseidon get chosen to write this script? How does the pedestrian Smith get handed a part that requires such depth? Memo to Akiva Goldsman stop taking classic sci-fi material and mangling it."

"lukem-52760","9","4","7","31 July 2018"," AN EXCELLENT SCI-FI THRILLER & A BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE BY WILL SMITH.
","WILL SMITH is a BRILLIANT actor FACT.
Smith gives a powerful & fantastic performance as the lonely last man survivor in the world,he's Robert Neville & he's surviving in New York City with just his dog but there are others but they are infected zombie types that only come out at night. I am legend is a BRILLIANTLY made sci-fi Horror Thriller that's intense & scary & emotional & that is solely because of WILL SMITH!!! His performance is BRILLIANT,his emotional eyes say it all.A true modern Classic.
Now i love the movie it's a massively budget apocalyptic Horror Thriller but it's not perfect as the infected Dark seekers are all c.g.i & that is never a good thing as i always prefer the practical make up fx & rubber suits it looks more real & grimy & gritty just look at how terrifying the infected zombies was in 28 days later & they was actors in scary as hell make-up no cheap looking c.g.i so THAT was the one problem i had with an otherwise fantastic movie.
The Dark seekers though do look good & are very frantic & scary but you can see they're computer images & that does take a little of the suspense away but the design/look of them is very well done & they are scary.
The mood & atmosphere is very well done with this movie it has a loneliness to it & the music score is very sad with a sense of loss.<br/><br/>
Will Smith is truly OUTSTANDING as Robert Neville & shows why he's the greatest movie star on the planet.<br/><br/>This is the closest i will ever get to will smith being in a zombie movie or even a Horror movie & as Horror is my favourite genre & smith is my favourite actor this movie means alot to me.
I am legend is an excellent movie & the performance by smith is outstanding so this is an instant CLASSIC in my opinion & yes the infected are well done but c.g.i of course now imagine if they looked like they do but was played by actors like in that excellent 28 days later!!! Would've been AMAZING.<br/><br/>I've been a huge Smith fan since the fresh Prince days & have grown up loving him as my idol as an icon & as my childhood hero.
Now ""I Am Legend"" is not a Masterpiece but it's one hell of a good sci-fi Thriller & very entertaining"

It has no point, no plot, no satisfactory ending, NO CAST for crying out loud!. I decided to review it because it made me feel like Hollywood is really out of ideas, this movie makes it official, it's the end of an era. I had been thinking for a while now that waisting my money on going to the movies was pointless, but every time I got out of an average film (even semi-independent ones like Little Miss sunshine or Dan in Real life)I though well maybe there's still more material left in the writers/directors brains of today. But once you see this movie (and Cloverfield I might add) you'll know, that it doesn't matter if Will Smith did it great in The Pursuit of Happiness, it doesn't matter how many reviews you read on the internet, it doesn't matter if the writers quit the strike: Going to the movies nowadays and expecting to leave the theater with a bit of satisfaction is simply impossible.

","Thumbs up for presenting a totally deserted New York City. It's really a wonder how the movie production managed to film something like that. It's not the usual apocalyptic scenario wherein it's devastated, dark and gloomy. It's just that the dead silence of the most populated city on Earth makes it all the more moving and realistic.<br/><br/>Will Smith portrayal of Robert Neville, as a sole survivor of a global virus epidemic, is topnotch. And as the sole actor in the movie, he'd better be. Optimism and loneliness, laced with Smith's trademark humor and you can really relate to his character. Of course, no disaster movie is complete without an endearing pet dog.<br/><br/>Given the family-friendly PG-13 rating, horror buffs should expect to be disappointed. For one I'm disappointed with the zombie/vampire/mutant-like Infected. They looked so CGI generic, so reminiscent of Gollum. Who'll get scared of that? Lots of ridiculous moments when he encounters the overwhelmingly numerous Infected. It's ""I, Robot"" all over again.<br/><br/>Excellent buildup during 2/3 of the movie but it falters near the end. Lots of plot holes you'll feel the third act was rushed. I won't spoil it but the ending was unexpected, in a bad way.

He is the last man on earth, but he has got enough power to run a fully equipped lab in the basement and listen to his ipod all the time. By the way: The title should have been: APPLE is Legend, since all other manufacturers of technology seem to have been infected by the virus as well. And it goes on: It's been just three years since the breakout of the disease, but all the streets of NY are cracked up by plants. All the cars have miraculously moved from being parked in a straight way to an angle. In the beginning Smith's wrist watch beeps to signal the sundown. But he has enough time to get home with a car, prepare food for himself and his dog, eat, close all the windows in the house until the sun actually disappears. It takes ages! Later on the watch beeps and he's got about four minutes until the sunlight-avoiding zombies are after him. It goes on and on. If you like watching zombies going after you, play a decent video game. There at least, you are able to shoot 'em on your own which is more fun than watching an overpaid American actor trying to do it. After 30 minutes I just hoped, the zombies would get him in time to make an end to one of the worst movies ever made. I was wrong. I had to leave the cinema.

","*MILD SPOILERS. NO PLOT TWISTS, JUST SCENE-SPECIFIC EXPLANATIONS.* Just came back from the movie, and I figured I'd write my 2-cents' here before I forget everything.<br/><br/>It was surprisingly good. For a major Hollywood movie of this budget, the film-making can be described as minimalistic, for lack of a better word. The director shows exactly what needed to be shown, and that's it. Only the bare minimum is explained, just enough for you to get the gist of what happened. The core of this movie is about Robert Neville's attempt to have some semblance of a life in a world that has run out of it. The scenes where he 'talks' to the mannequins are funny, but it quickly became disturbing when it became apparent that he's struggling against a sense of isolation an paranoia.<br/><br/>The musical score follows the same vein as the film-making. It enhances the isolation even more, and scenes of Times Square in a state of abandon, with weeds growing everywhere is definitely a sight to behold. Some scenes just plain creeped me out. Scary or not, I cannot fathom what Neville had to go through for 1,001 days of complete nothingness.<br/><br/>Yes, the CGI is slightly dodgy, but it's effective as-is, and when we're shown the mutants for the first time, it can definitely get under your skin. It's a pity that the third act starts to come apart, and the ending was a bit too... sudden. This is one movie that I wished had a longer runtime. 101 minutes is just way too short. We could have seen a longer and more fleshed-out back story, and a more satisfying ending. By that, I don't mean a happy ending (that would just be insulting), but something that was more befitting of the character of Robert Neville. As I said earlier, the ending is too sudden. Just when I was enjoying the thrill of this film's world, the ending came out of nowhere. It's as if the film-makers decided that they should probably wind it down. I have no idea why they came up with such a decision, and I would agree that it hurt the pacing of the movie. A pity, as it was the only thing keeping the movie from becoming a modern classic.<br/><br/>It's an post-apocalyptic epic, but not in a traditional sense. And that's what makes it stand out. I've heard about the changes made from the original novel, but I think it doesn't matter. If I had to summarize it in a sentence, I'd say that this is a story of redemption. Did he get it? Well, it'd be better if you find out yourself. Except for the dodgy ending, it's a well-crafted movie with some pretty interesting artistic decisions taken by the director, and I salute him for that. Will Smith's acting is phenomenal, and I don't think it'd be far-fetching that Robert Neville is one of his career-defining roles. I'd have absolutely no problems recommending this to people.<br/><br/>A definite watch.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"matthewmeans","6","4","7","18 December 2007"," Jumps high... breaks its ankle
","Well, for starters, I have not read the original story, though I've heard this film has more differences than similaritiesI will sidestep that particular topic. So... 'I Am Legend' left me with a lot of general good feelings, such as Will Smith's careful/substantial performance, the well crafted atmosphere of a depopulated New York City, and great empathy with its characters. For me, the latter is the most important success, and seems to be one of the hardest for mainstream Hollywood to achieve nowadays. If I can care about the individuals portrayed in a movie then I am already on board, ready to forgive many a surrounding flaw. What took the wind out of my sails here, though, was the lack of a satisfying middle portion, and a flat, trite ending (and, in a small way, the lackluster CGI[ if you want to see CGI that tramples the competition, check out South Korean horror flick ""The Host""]). Not only was 'I Am Legend' unexpectedly short, it was basically 60 minutes of prologue followed by 5-10 minutes of character interaction, then 15 minutes of action that terminates in an ""I can't believe that's it"" moment. Then comes the speechy epilogue that blandly tries to reinforce what a hero is Will Smith's dr/scientist/soldier character. At this point the audience at my showing, who had laughed and gasped and cheered for the film for a good 80 minutes, erupted into a chorus of boos... Myself, I still find more to like here than dislike, but just barely."
"Stryga2000","3","4","7","16 December 2007"," Stupid development in the genre (SPOILERS)
","Zombie movies make statements on the societies in which they are set. They represent the country tearing itself apart and a reaction to the graphic war footage during the Vietnam Era, mindless consumerism in the original Dawn of the Dead, and our own senseless violence coming back to haunt us in 28DL.<br/><br/>The tradition of a hideout that zombies cannot instantly penetrate (i.e.: a house, a shopping mall, a high-rise apartment, etc.) sets up a mirror of society. The smarter or luckier survivors barricade themselves there and are able to maintain it for a while. The contrast of their attempts at civilization inside with the apocalypse outside is striking. And when conflict builds between the survivors and their own microcosm of society breaks down, the cooperation which allowed them to maintain the barricade crumbles and they are overrun.<br/><br/>But with I am Legend (and the house in the beginning of 28 Weeks Later as well as the locked room where the civilians are placed during the breakout), the new zombie hideout is simply a place to hide, and it provides virtually no protection once the zombies find it. These zombies are ridiculously strong so they can easily turn SUV's over, bash into Neville's secure lab without breaking their bones, and tear through thick walls with bare hands, all the while maintaining a body temperature that would destroy their brains. The steel coverings Neville repeatedly closes over his windows provide no protection once the zombies attack. There is no feeble attempt to maintain civilization inside his home while the zombies attempt to break in; once he realizes they followed them home, it's all over. So the trade-off is for more powerful zombies (I assume the intention was to make them scarier, but the opposite was actually the result) while losing the interesting social commentary and any semblance of realism. Our own violence coming back to haunt us is a more sensible premise than an attempt to cure cancer that happens to go wrong. Smith's acting is excellent, but his lamentations over cooking the last of the bacon, while amusing, do little to develop a theme other than illustrating that he misses his old way of life.<br/><br/>A break from tradition and taking the genre in a new direction is a good thing, but it should be interesting and thoughtful such as making the new generation of zombies fast and adrenaline-pumped (but not completely over-the-top) in 28DL, not just done merely for the sake of doing something new but ridiculous like I am Legend. Contrast this with the more interesting solution from The Omega Man: Neville is able to fend off the zombies because they refuse to use modern weapons. Or Romero's new wrinkle from Land of the Dead: the city is secure until the zombies evolve to become more intelligent thereby attacking the city from the unexpected river border.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, newness and sensationalism is favored over interesting writing. The collapse of society and wildness of the new environment is reflected in the 2 lions roaming Manhattan? Hello? Did some animal lovers free them from the zoo during the mayhem? What statement is this making about the collapse of civilization? In 28 Days Later, by contrast, we see ""The End is Extremely *beep* Nigh"" painted on the wall and hundreds of missing persons posters, and we are able to imagine the collapse and sympathize with what the characters must have been experiencing in a more interesting way. Fascinating how a cheap camera, inexpensive makeup and creative movie-making can produce something so superior to a high-budget but poorly made film! Taken merely as an action movie without reading so much into it, I am Legend is entertaining, yet it makes me wonder if Francis Lawrence has ever watched a zombie movie...."
"JoeKarlosi","6","4","7","16 December 2007"," I Am Legend (2007) **1/2
","I'm a huge fan of the two earlier film versions of this story - certainly of THE OMEGA MAN and, to a lesser extent, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. Being a sucker for most end-of-the-world science fiction movies in general, I was game enough to see what could be done at this late date for Richard Matheson's classic 1954 novel I AM LEGEND. To start off with, I'm relieved that this third adaption has its own title to keep it separate from the other two. After all, in this day of remakes run amuck, we need to be thankful for small favors.<br/><br/>If this had been several years ago I would surely have moaned even at the thought of Will Smith taking on this lead role; but fortunately he has proved himself a pretty decent actor and movie hero in recent times. Here he takes the crucial role of Robert Neville, a scientist left alive in New York City after the rest of the world has died off from the effects of a wonder drug which promised to cure cancer but actually wound up rendering mankind virtually extinct. Neville spends his days searching out other possible survivors along with his lovable canine companion, a faithful German shepherd named Sam (short for Samantha). At night he must bolt his doors to seal himself off from a mob of rabid Computer Simulated maniacs who are what now remains of his past civilization.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I thought Will Smith was VERY good, and there were some gripping emotional moments from him. He was quite believable as the last desperate man left alive on Earth, and the touching moments spent along with his lone friend Sam are very strong. The chilling effect of a desolate New York City left in turmoil was nicely realized. On the negative side, the film comes crashing down like lead every time we are subjected to the fake-looking hairless night monsters on the prowl who are ""the infected"". Tragically, we are subjected to that awful and overused modern day trend of needlessly depending on CGI renderings instead of using real actors. Why is it considered necessary to have these cartoon-like ravenous creatures zipping and zooming and ricocheting all about at lightning speed, loudly roaring with their extra-wide mouthes agape a la Stephen Sommers' THE MUMMY? This is a damn shame because it completely trashed what was otherwise shaping up to be a fine film indeed. Also missing from this movie is a strong sense of motivation, something which both THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and THE OMEGA MAN each had. There is no interaction with the crazed mutations, for example; they seem to exist here solely because it's what's expected in the story, and not for any solid plot point.<br/><br/>If you've either already seen the past two incarnations of Matheson's book, or been into horror and science fiction movies for any length of time, or at least have seen either the 2004 DAWN OF THE DEAD remake or 28 DAYS LATER, you're bound to feel that I AM LEGEND gives you a sense of aimless deja vu. **1/2 out of ****"

This is three yawners in a row for Mr. Smith (Hitch, Pursuit of Happiness, and this bomb). In baseball, he'd be a bench warmer. Save your money and two hours of your time and pass on this over-hyped jolt movie. Jolt cause it wasn't scary, only shocking from effects at times (rarely). And any two-year-old could have written this pathetic ending. My 12-year-old fell asleep half way through this one. Anyone who rates this higher than a ""No"" must be either on the studio payroll or on Xanax. DON'T DO IT! And his next one in the pipeline, Hancock, looks like it will follow the same pattern. Too bad for Will, after winning our admiration in MIB and, to a lesser extent, I Robot. He seems like a very nice guy, and so we want him to do well.

","A little truth in advertisement might have saved me a waste of time and money. It will be a long time before I attend another Will Smith movie, if ever.<br/><br/>Rather than some entertainment we must experience the range of Smith's dramatic acting, couched in soliloquies and imaginary conversation. It is not impressive, nor is the writing.<br/><br/>A little humor might have helped but there is none. The movie takes itself dead seriously and that makes it deadly dull (all zombies aside).<br/><br/>The sparse action sequences (which might have interesting in other context) highlight the protagonist's dissolution, making his lifestyle at the point the movie takes up the narrative more than a bit confusing.<br/><br/>If there is anything good about the film it may be the imagery of a New York gone feral. Some of which is startling. Too bad it went to waste. This is just a bad film."

","Okay. First to say, I think this is Smith's first time to play a role in a horror genre movie. And I have to admit, he did a good job here. And secondly, don't expect any gunshooting spree or car chase. And if you're looking for this kind, I guarantee, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>For the movie itself, I'm very satisfied with how the director manage to direct this movie with all it's atmosphere in it. You can almost sense the creepy, quiet atmosphere, and fear around the already abandoned New York City like you are really inside the movie. It's very thrilling from the start, and touchy along the way, while sad along the way too.<br/><br/>And aside of that, Smith shows what quality he got in him. He can portrayed himself as someone who is being left alone, and try to act as normal as he can in the already abandoned environment, and only got a dog to accompany him. <br/><br/>If you wish to enjoy this movie, and you want to enjoy this movie to it's fullest, try to think and imagine yourself as Smith. If you can manage to do that, than I'm sure you will feel satisfied, and you will understand, why people say it's a good movie and Smith is doing very good in this movie.<br/><br/>I rate it 10/10."

The pacing is incredibly slow at times, and the story is directionless for the most part. Watching Will Smith wander through an abandoned New York is cool at first, but after a while you notice that it's not enough to keep you interested.<br/><br/>The creatures are another disappointed. Bad CGI-work plus some rather conventional voice effects by Mike Patton just don't make for very frightening zombies.<br/><br/>And finally, the ending is so unexciting and dull one leaves the theatre (or turns out the TV or whatever) feeling pretty vacant.<br/><br/>Here's an idea: if Hollywood can't make a good movie out of it, why not leave Matheson's novel alone already?

","Man, this has got to be the shortest 100 minutes movie I've ever seen -- I left the theatre feeling quite unsatisfied. As you contemplate at the conclusion of the film what you've just watched, it suddenly hits you: ""Hey, that's it? Where did my 100 minutes go?"" Now, allow me to elaborate on this. Basically the film can be broken down into a series of brief flashbacks about events in NYC before the outbreak of a mutant-making virus (turning ordinary humans to scary blood thirsty evil men-mutants) along with the following main sections: <br/><br/>1. Guy and dog shuffling around a deserted NYC hunting deers for food.<br/><br/>2. Dog makes a mistake while chasing a deer and enters a door into a dark apartment building where the savage and seemingly indestructible UV-allergic men-mutants typically live. Guy goes inside, fights evil men-mutants and saves dog. Also, guy ensnares one mutant-lady for mutant-making-virus antidote trials.<br/><br/>3. Guy and dog shuffling around the city again. But this time guy makes a mistake, falls for one of his own planted booby traps, gets strung up upside down on a rope, knocks his head and falls unconscious. Dog barks for hours on end to wake guy up, but to no avail. Guy regains consciousness near sunset, but too late as the bad mutant-men and their mutant-mutts come out to play. At the end, beloved dog is bitten and severely injured by the mutant-mutts. Returning home, dog is turning mutant due to bites and guy reluctantly kills beloved dog.<br/><br/>4. Guy goes on a night suicide mission to avenge death of dog. He gets totally creamed by the men-mutants and almost dies. A mysterious UV-flashing stranger comes to the rescue and drives guy home.<br/><br/>5. Guy meets the UV-flashing lady saviour and her boy companion, have chit-chat etc. Men-mutants track guy, lady and boy to guy's house and ransack the place. Guy, lady and boy get trapped in guy's basement laboratory behind a powerful glass barrier. Mutants slam themselves to glass to break in. All accidentally see that the last trial antidote is working on mutant-lady guinea pig. Guy knows he must sacrifice himself to save lady and boy. Guy takes blood sample from mutant-lady, passes it to the lady, and asks lady and boy to leave via a tunnel/crawl space through the wall.<br/><br/>6. Guy takes grenade, pulls the pin, charges at the mutant-men and KABOOM while lady and boy make it to safety and a human survivor compound with the precious blood sample of mutant lady guinea pig. All is well and the human race is saved. HURRAH. The end.<br/><br/>That's all there is to it. I think there simply wasn't enough plot or story for 100 minutes. Overall, still mildly entertaining, but left me wanting more, a lot more...<br/><br/>Score: 6/10"
"LoneWolfAndCub","6","3","5","6 January 2008"," Two films in one; one is an interesting and intelligent thriller, the second is CGI-filled dreck
","I enjoyed this movie for the most part. Well, the first half at least. The first half was a neat little apocalyptic thriller. The shots of a deserted New York were effective and purveyed a sense of isolation for the main character. Will Smith was excellent as Robert Neville, one of the only people alive thanks to a virus which has wiped out the world and turned everyone into vicious, animal-like creatures who are out for blood. Smith's character is obviously losing his mind and having trouble coping with total isolation (well, apart from his dog friend). There are some tense scenes littered throughout which help keep you one the edge.<br/><br/>Then we enter the second half, a crappy horror cartoon with no scares and some incredibly lame CGI monsters and a clichéd ending. When the monsters finally come out I sunk in my seat, not only were they pure CGI, they were pure, BAD CGI. It was almost as if they ripped them straight from a cartoon or video game and dropped into the movie. It was embarrassing and it killed what could have been an excellent movie. Not only that, the second half felt incredibly rushed, some extended scenes would have been nice and would have helped keep up the tension. And when the end comes it is a ""depressingly happy"" ending that feels a bit too clichéd and comes as a disappointment.<br/><br/>The first half is a four star psychological thriller with a fine performance from Smith and some well shot scenes. The second half is a two star horror cartoon with appalling SFX. That averages the rating to a: 3/5"

Will Smith remains very stiff in the title role which isn't surprising since he plays the same character in all of his films, he is not a versatile actor like Daniel Day Lewis or Russel Crowe. I have respect for Will Smith in most films though since most of his movies fit his act, however this movie did not, The directer also could of just made this better as a whole. He went definitely towards the horror side then real Sci-fi. Also the writers could of stayed a bit closer to the book."

But with a slightly better script. Can't say anything else about the acting, though, since Will Smith was in ID4 too. :-) Overall, you just sit and wait until the movie starts. But it never does. Instead you are invited to watch panorama shot after panorama shot of a nicely destroyed and digitally enhanced New York City. That's it.<br/><br/>Nothing happens, and nothing is shown. We don't see any character development, we don't see any story.<br/><br/>Okay, there is a story here, but it's thinner than a 2-minute short-film.

If you know the story - you know EXACTLY what is going to happen - no surprises here at all.<br/><br/>It's not bad made - it's just boring. It's actually very very nice effects, if you deduct the awfully boring and not-so-well-done vampires/monsters/whatever.<br/><br/>There are two scenes in this film: one with Smith's family and one with Smith in the future (present). We flashback to the family-scene now and then, and go back to the present. None of the scenes have any motion, nothing happens in them. It's like if you are watching two still-photos and flick between them for one and a half hour.<br/><br/>Fortunatly, the destroyed New York is so well done that it isn't boring to watch this film. It's like watching a documentary of New York in the future, with the sound constantly from Shrek. (You'll understand that one when you watch the film.)

","I was very intrigued by the premise of I Am Legend. The tag line says it all, ""The last man on earth is not alone."" As the film begins, we find out that what started it was a cure for cancer. As the female new reporter asks the doctor, ""So you've cured cancer?"" and she responds, ""Yes we have."" One of the great things about the set up is that they actually tried to explain what went wrong in terms of the outbreak. They had found the cure for cancer which was a virus. The virus was created in a controlled fashion to attack and kill cancers rather than our normal bodily functions, and then something went wrong. People began dying en masse, and the rest were being mutated into zombies of some sort. But then we're introduced to Robert Neville (Will Smith), New York's only surviving human being. This was the real treat of the film for me. I'm not into the over the top action sequences with the pointless shoot outs and gratuitous violence, and I Am Legend does a great job of staying away from all of that. We see Robert Neville and his dog Sam walk around New York, looking for food, survivors, and it becomes clear that it's not always about their own survival; they look for anything that will get them through the day. I think Neville's boredom gets the best of him sometimes as he visits the video store and actually carries on conversations with the mannequins and what not.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of a balancing act; the story goes from the immediate effects of the outbreak to Robert Neville to his search for a cure and back again. The film didn't have that much dialogue rather, it focuses on the subtleties of a world wide outbreak and how it affects the last man alive.<br/><br/>One of the most unexpected turns in the film (and frankly, the most interesting and underutilized) was the role of the zombies. Dark seekers as they are called in the film, they were all once human beings that mutated into the monsters. As Neville documents in his charts (he has a lab in the basement where he's looking for a cure), he notes that the dark seekers slowly lose all signs of rational human behavior. But then something else happens. The dark seekers begin to take on the qualities of their own community. So three years after the outbreak, they being to slowly evolve. As Neville captures one of them to conduct experiments on, they set an identical trap for him. The writers and director could've explored this in more detail, as it was in the book, but then again, this is a Hollywood film and too much thinking would've taken away the mass appeal.<br/><br/>Sadly though, with all these great things, the film ends on such a weak note that you're left feeling like the makers rushed through the ending because they ran out of money. Overall the film had great potential, but it was ruined by an overly simplistic ending. Wait for the rental with this one."

This would have made the story much more interesting and compelling, had they spent a few minutes showing Neville interacting with them and helped to understand the sub-society that was developing.<br/><br/>I do not think the monsters needed to be so fast, strong, and LOUD to be scary.

It runs away from the infected characters and turns them into one dimensional planks of CGI wood whom we have no interest in and who fail to be frightening, a task which they are forced to inhabit because they are so anonymous and boring. And thats the key word, it promises so much in the first third but it delivers very little, its boring and I could go on for pages. Really. But I will leave my post by saying I really enjoy horror films, I love the book, Will Smith does his best and New York looks great. But this film stinks for many reasons and the main reason is it really wants to be 28 days later and thats a shame because I am Legend is such a good story in its own right and it was ripe for a much better adaptation than this. Tragic."

","so another remake, and yet again we are reminded that we live in a dumbed down age. all the complexity of the book and previous films gone, instead a two dimensional b horror movie. Heston's the omega man improved on the novel by creating ""the family"", here robert neville has a worthy adversary, albeit a mad one. in legend they are super vampires who fly thru the air and growl a lot. much of the film's running time is wasted on pointless scenes that really do not add to the character or plot, the flashbacks with the family are utterly pointless, in the omega man, the end is logical and poignant, here it is meaningless, he really does not have to do what he does, (i will not say what it is, you will see when you see the movie, which by the way you should see on DVD, as its pretty much a waste of time and money to pay and see it in a theatre) by the way the screening i saw on Friday was far too loud, the film was far too loud, all noise and thunder no meat on them bones on a different note, i too have noticed the number of 10/10 votes this has gained, and judging from the fact people have voted and added a comment without seeing the film is pretty mind boggling , why is this allowed"

Making any film with the last man alive on Earth storyline struggles to be interesting, but when you add the cliché zombies, I mean really how many times has this stupid storyline been done.<br/><br/>The acting, it's Will, so what's the best you can expect. The dialog is totally devoid of making sense and on top of that no real explanation for events. A pandemic that acts so quickly would effectively wipe itself out, as it's victims would run out, see the Spanish flu for an example.<br/><br/>Anyway you have a dull non-sensical, pointless story, poor special effects, bad acting and poor dialog, how on Earth did anyone vote this higher than 0.

","I have just seen this movie and what I can say is that it was a mix of other movies, a cocktail. The whole idea was looking like ""12 monkeys"" with this living animal jungle idea, ""28 days"" and ""resident evil"" with the killing virus idea, ""pitch black"" and ""land of the dead"" because of the light terror creatures and the sense of community that have seemed to have. Of course none of the above are spoilers, you all can see them in the official trailers of this movie. The reason I gave 6of 10 is because its seems to me as if they have started to make this film based in all these ideas but somewhere in the middle they have changed their minds and the script as well and gave us something else that was not original. So although it was interesting during watching,I believe that there is a hole in the plot that didn't satisfy me at the end at all. Everything else, direction, photography, computer effects where fine and of course Will Smith gave his best as always."

"jaypugh","9","5","11","17 December 2007"," Great Movie despite it's flaws
","As I read other reviews here on IMDb I can say that I started thinking and criticizing Legend more and more to where I considered dropping my score. Then I thought back. What is the point of my review? It's how much I ENJOYED the movie. It isn't how much I can pick it apart later after the fact. When I left the theater I couldn't have been much happier with I Am Legend. Will Smith's acting was first rate in my opinion. Sure, this isn't Pursuit of Happiness we are dealing with here so it isn't as deep as that but for the material in Legend I think many will agree that Will Smith did a fantastic job. Of course there are those who don't like Will and I've seen plenty of those reviews. I thought his spiraling break down in Legend was more than just believable. You could feel the emotions. The story in this movie was great but this is a rare time that I have to agree with the people who wished for MORE. This day in age I am getting used to complaining about movie length of many films but with all that Legend had to work with they could have easily made it 30 minutes or even an hour longer. I, like others, would have enjoyed seeing how this event got out of control and had the whole story fleshed out a bit more. While this is a complaint it should also show as an applause that this movie is good enough that you just want to see more. That is the way I look at it. My other complaint that others have pointed out is the CGI zombie like Seekers (believe that is what they are called). For CGI they looked awesome but I still long for at least a good blend of old style special effects makeup and CGI. I wish Hollywood would realize that the audience hasn't fallen in love with this cheaper way of doing special effects. CGI is good if it is used appropriately. Anyway, even with this complaint I will say that what was used in Legend was among the best I've seen. So, back to the story. Yes, it is similar to 28 Days/Weeks but where 28 went for the extra gore and action (especially 28 Weeks) Legend focuses more on giving us an in depth look at the main character and how he deals with feeling like he is the last man on earth. No matter what, viewers should be aware that Legend may be a good blend of genres but overall it feels like a horror movie. If you don't like horror then I caution you to stay away from Legend as you will undoubtedly be disappointed. If you are ready to see a horror movie that is above the norm then Legend should be a nice treat."
"zor_prime","9","5","11","15 December 2007"," Excellent adaptation proving there is still heart and soul(s?) in the big movie business.
","After skimming the book, and having watched the previous two attempts at I Am Legend, I went in hoping for the best, but expecting mediocrity, (or something like the two recent Resident Evil films)... But I was quite surprised and entertained by what I experienced. Though it's true that most of the CG in this film is not very good, it's apparent to me that CG isn't the film's selling point, or what it leans on for merit. It's a well acted, well paced, well directed, and well adapted piece. Honestly, the 'monster' aspect never needed to be front-and-center visually for it to be effective. I thought it was implemented very well (largely in the dark and ultra fast moving scenes where the imagination can assist).<br/><br/>I was hoping for a departure from ""The Omega Man"", which I thought was an incredibly silly film of what I consider to be the ""A-Team variety"". But, for the first 30 minutes or so, there were just so many analogs to Charlton Heston's performance that it was getting predictable (though the Will Smith version is hardly as pompous as Heston's). Very quickly, though, I forgot all about that concern and the movie really came into it's own. Smith's character, the environment, and the adversary were all quite different and very well conceived.<br/><br/>I was also expecting vampires (a genre that I'm no big fan of), and was pleasantly surprised at what I found in this film's antagonist to be (which is 28 times more endearing to me than vampires).<br/><br/>The third and probably most detracting thing I was expecting from this film was for it to suffer from the standard droll devices of a big-budget blockbuster: the requisite love story, Rambo shoot-em-up action, and a dialog-over-story plot basis. Oh, and not to mention headlining a traditionally ""feel-good"" star actor that could probably run for president one day. Fortunately, none of these normally ever-present problems intruded to ruin this film. And though it was indeed an uncharacteristically dark role for Smith in several ways, he pulled it off brilliantly.<br/><br/>Maybe it could have been a little longer, answering more questions and allowing more of the psychodrama to filter in, but it's possible that would have spoiled the excellent balance of jump-in-your seat action vs. the plot/tension building interstital scenes. The theater I saw this in was packed with plenty viewers from the younger crowd (it's hard to believe this film is only PG-13 in the US). However, the entire theater was completely silent and caught in the grip of the films action, story line, and excellent pacing.<br/><br/>I noticed a lot of people taking advantage of what could be considered the 'comic relief' of this film. However, I found some of the 'humorous' parts less than laughable, and more disturbing than anything. When you see this, really try to understand this man's environment and then you will probably better understand his psyche.<br/><br/>I will look forward to more from this relatively unknown writer/director team."

","Well I'm back after the 7:10 show and I was pleased.<br/><br/>The story is fine and engrossing. There are some parts that are illogical but other than that, there wasn't much to complain about. I'll be sure to read the novel it was based on when I can.<br/><br/>The acting was great by both Will Smith and the dog . Will Smith was a great choice for Dr. Neville. His portrayal of the last man on earth is awesome and we see how that man copes with being alone for 3 years except for the company of his dog. The emotional parts are done right as it doesn't make you laugh, as some people will certainly do (none in my theater), but it actually makes you feel for the character. As always, there are a few jokes but they're used sparingly so it works. This won't earn him a Oscar nomination but as I said before, it was fine work.<br/><br/>The CGI was awesome. The empty city, the effects, the fight scenes. I have a little quarrel with the look of the ""vampire"" like creatures. They were menacing looking and it worked but I was just expecting more as the rest of the CGI was awesome.<br/><br/>I will admit that I jumped in my seat a few times and they were timed appropriately (they especially worked with the Dolby sound in the theater). So overall some things to complain about but otherwise it was a very good time and I was very pleased with it. It was definitely worth the $7 .<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"springsunnywinter","10","9","24","27 December 2007"," I Am Thrilled
","I Am Legend is a very well made film for a post apocalyptic thriller. Before I saw it I was wondering that how are the filmmakers going to keep the audience riveted to their seats? But it has many events and surprises that keeps you entertained and very enlighten. The best way to enjoy this movie is to watch it as the last man on earth trying to save mankind by finding an antidote using his own immune blood to cure the Dark Seekers. If you want nothing but brainless action then its best avoided.<br/><br/>The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense right from start to end and had a great vision beyond our imagination of the desolated New York. Will Smith is undoubtedly a really good actor but this was his best performance to date and he should get an Oscar for his role because it is really difficult to act like the last man on earth and I can't think of any other actor that could've replaced his role.<br/><br/>You can see every penny spent from the $150 million budget. Most people accused the film for the SFX of the Dark Seekers but I don't think they were that bad. The best thing about the movie is that you can actually feel that what is it like being the last person, so it is a very important film. I never thought that life will be extremely difficult e.g. you cannot interact with anyone, No meat will be available & food will be out of date and if you get hurt or sick then no medical treatment can be given.<br/><br/>Overall I Am Legend is a magnificent and my favourite film of the year It is Will Smith's best movie since I, Robot and gets better the more times you see it. There are many films that are a time pass and you forget about them after about 30 minutes you seen them but I Am Legend is not one of those, it will always stick to you."
"quiqueperezsoler","9","2","3","7 April 2020"," Unique heart-wrenching dystopian tale of a man that stayed behind with his dog to find a cure to a man-made disease. Original and overlooked
","A movie with subtle themes of loneliness, coping with death and a human-dog companionship that's as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe the average reviews this movie received then and is currently receiving. I saw this movie when it came out and was too young for the more horrific aspects of it but remember liking and understanding it. When rewatching it, it now holds a special place in my heart thanks to its incredibly well-crafted setting and heartfelt companionship of the main characters.<br/><br/>Certainly the movie could use more backstory information that the actual showed in the movie but that just might be the reason why this movie stands out. Through little clips of TV news broadcasts, flashbacks and a few smart interactions we are fed backstory details of the status quo of the world and the infected after the spread of the virus.<br/><br/>When recounting the events and ""action scenes"" there are not many to consider althought the third act is filled with them. Nevertheless, this movie's first act that sets up the story, characters and setting is so well realised that a gigantic zombie stand-off Zombieland-style would have not fit the tone that the movie is building up. Themes of loneliness, coping with death and survival. Without spoiling anything, there are several events that impact the human-animal companionship that heavily suggest heart-wrenching themes and callbacks to the horrors of the virus. A companionship that represents the core of a story that's meant to tell and show us they are the last rational creatures left on earth.<br/><br/>The movie relies heavily in the ""show don't tell"" rule generally. It prefers to unravel the backstory of the infection and the character of Will Smith through flashbacks and video recordings in specific and suiting moments in the story. They don't feel out of place as they try to expand the information to push the story forward or show an emotional turmoil the main character is suffering at a given time; and not simply to have an exposition dump in the middle of the story.<br/><br/>Also, it realies in symbolism from which certain subtle themes can be identified like a religious sense of fate and destiny or simple callback symbolisms like butterflies or a certain public figure; add an extra layer to an overall generic post-apocalyptic zombie movie. It provides themes through which to learn the different personalities and traits of our characters.<br/><br/>One of the bigger downsides the movie may show is the sense of rivalry given to Will Smith's character and another I suppose ""character"" of the story. Should the alternative and therefore deleted scene in the end would be considered part of the story that rivalry would have been better developed. However, in the final theatrical version it isn't present leaving the movie with a story that is meant to romanticise the aforementioned animosity. It feels too personal in an otherwise gently developed setting without a ""chosen one"" trope to lead it. The best post-apocalyptic stories are the ones that feature a main character that wasn't chosen by god or destiny, is the everyday man/woman/child with flaws as anybody could have survive the apocalypse and there is no destiny only coincidences. Having the movie find a conclusion to ALL the current stroy problems in a span of days it's highly unusual and too fantastic for this sort of setting. Nevertheless, the reason for the present rivalry and romanticised aspects of this particular tale could be attributed to the homage payed to the original 1950s book which actually featured the last man on earth facing the leader of the vampiric zombies creatures... So yeah, I'd say this movie shouldn't be looked as an adaptation of that novel but only paying homage with names and the title itself.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, this is an entertaining, at times thrilling, interestingly-crafted virus infecting tale lead by a man and his dog looking for a cure to an infection. It has some of the most heart breaking moments ever put to cinema only enhanced one of Will Smith's best performances. THe CGI is decent years later given the time the movie came out and isn't as bad as some put it. It was never meant to be a big blockbuster zombie apocalyptic movie filled with action and gory scenes but rather a video essay that could easily be a student film on the lonely survivor of the city of New York. The footage of the first act can easily be used in any sort of post-apocalyptic setting as it is well-realised and shot. If you disassociate it from the novel of its own name it is an original and unique take at the zombie genre. Subtle in its messages but you can still hear them loud and clear, we must let the light in to get rid of the darkness."

","I am Legend is nothing short of a legendary cinematic masterpiece. Packed with action, drama, horror, suspense and a good amount of strong CGI, I am Legend is one of the finest zombie action thrillers of all time.<br/><br/>The director has made sure you get to not just be scared of the ""darkseekers"", but also kinda enjoy the solitude along with the hero. To be honest, I did find it intense but not scary and the PG-13 rating explains it further. But it was really a compelling watch with plenty of entertainment for 100 minutes to keep me engaged.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance was really strong and emotionally resonant at the same time. The lack of many characters made the film even better, further allowing Smith to showcase his acting chops even better. His chemistry with the dog and mannequins is really heartwarming.<br/><br/>I liked how the film began right from the very first second without wasting any time. Plus, the film has got plenty of well executed action sequences from start to finish and they're one of the best things about the film. The CGI is also excellent for the most part and the overall visual appeal of the film is very high. You do get to feel the apocalypse.<br/><br/>That being said, I am Legend is really worth a watch. And not just for adults, but also for teens who like action movies. If you haven't seen it yet, don't wait anymore! It's on Prime Video in English and Hindi, go watch it now!<br/><br/>(I have also seen the alternate ending and I can't decide which one is better as both of them add a different layer to the story and characters.)"
"zkonedog","6","2","3","12 March 2017"," No Resolution, But Still A Decent Film
","As I viewed this film, it quickly become clear to me that two very different themes are being explored by director Francis Lawrence in this film, one that works and one that does not:<br/><br/>The first, more wide-reaching theme, is the fate of the human race, which Robert Neville (Will Smith) is working desperately to save throughout the movie. I can't tell you the state of humanity at the end of the film without spoiling some things, but suffice it to say that there is a good chance you will feel a bit let down by the lack of resolution to this theme.<br/><br/>The theme that works quite well, however, is how Neville copes with being the ""last man on Earth"". His internal struggles and outward devices (such as talking to mannequins, for instance) that he uses to keep some semblance of his sanity are intriguing, and Smith is a well-rounded enough actor to portray the wide variety of emotions his character must express.<br/><br/>Overall, then, this is a decent enough film (worth a rent), but lacks enough of a payoff in the end to be considered a real classic. I found this film to be much in the vein of J.J. Abram's recent hit ""Cloverfield"", where little to nothing is explained or expanded on...viewers are just supposed to live in the moment. Yet, with the way that Neville's family is developed in this film (unlike the anonymous characters of Cloverfield), I think that the lack of a conclusive ending was more apparent."
"Hitchcoc","5","2","3","9 January 2017"," All Special Effects and a Contrived Plot
","This film is well set up with an end of the world kind of condition that occurs when medical scientists really blow it. All that's left, it seems, is Will Smith. He manages to stay alive, fending off wild animals and zombie-like mutants. He studies what's going on. Fortunately for him, he is able to observe one big thing which leads to the conclusion. The thing that annoys me is the deus ex machina conclusion based on Smith's supposed scientific knowledge. Anyway, it is a really forgettable movie. I've never been much of a Will Smith fan. He brings a smugness to his roles that gets tiresome at times. There are so many of these types of movies that are so much better in the science fiction arena. Even the old Vincent Price, ""The Last Man on Earth"" is a better film, bleak and depressing as it is."
"ralo229","6","2","3","8 May 2014"," Not the Best But Certainly Not the Worst
","Post apocalyptic movies have been around forever. Some hit and some miss. The film I Am Legend does a little bit of both. So, the film revolves around a scientist and his dog, as they are the only survivors of a deadly plague that has ravaged humanity. During his time alone, the scientist searches desperately to search for a cure. But the question is, is he really alone in this world gone to hell? <br/><br/>The good: This film has a basic, but overall decent storyline. I enjoyed a good majority of the characters, and while I didn't think the actual death of the dog was sad I actually thought the way it affected Will Smith's character was sad. The special effects were pretty good, it had a decent score, and am I the only one who just loves the monsters? I don't know. Maybe I'm just a sucker for that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>The bad: While the first half was good, the second half is where I thought the film started to slide a little bit. After the dog is infected by the zombie-like monster things (I don't know, they never make it clear) Will Smith tries to seek revenge. However, it goes horribly wrong, but he ends up being rescued by a young woman and her son. Now, the woman and her son are not bad characters. They just seemed kind of out of place to me. I don't why it's just something about them that drives me a little nuts. Maybe it's because I wish the rest of the movie just revolved around the scientist without the aid of his trusty canine friend. I actually think that would've been a little more interesting if it was done right. But I guess I'll just take it for what it is. And for what it is, it doesn't really harm the movie. The length of the film is the other bad thing, but there's not a lot I can say about that.<br/><br/>Overall, I like this film. Is it the best post apocalyptic film? No, but it's certainly not the worst."
"Leofwine_draca","5","2","3","1 February 2013"," Too many diversions from the novel
","I'm a huge fan of Richard Matheson, whose classic sci-fi novels of the 1950s (such as this and THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN) helped make the decade fun. I AM LEGEND has been filmed a couple of times before, as LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price and THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston. Both were fun productions that threw their own slants on the source material, but neither of them could be called a classic. Much the same can be said of this production.<br/><br/>On the surface, I AM LEGEND is a perfectly serviceable movie. I'm no fan of Will Smith as a serious actor, but even I'll admit that he does pretty well here as a tormented, lonely hero. He builds a fine rapport with his canine companion for much of the production. The big budget nature of the production means that this looks visually impressive, with lots of ruined cityscape shots and eerie foreboding built up along the way.<br/><br/>What goes wrong, then? Well, two things. Firstly, the film is wrong-footed by some dodgy CGI work, firstly in the form of the wild animals that have taken over New York, and secondly in the nature of the vampire menace. They're entirely animated by computer graphics, Gollum-style, but they don't look particularly convincing, and the more we see of them, the worse they look. Naturally, the most frightening scenes are those early on in which the foes remain unseen, Smith and his pet crouched in a bath while their cries echo eerily through the night.<br/><br/>The second problem is that the film loses its way as it progresses, wasting interesting thematic elements and becoming a straightforward action flick. And the last third is unforgivable, throwing in a twist I found hard to swallow and which makes a mockery of the book. It's a shame, because in the right hands this could have been the stuff of, well, legend."
"toby-brace","5","2","3","1 January 2013"," Could have been so much better
","This is a sad example of how a great premise and some great production and some great acting can be badly let down by crappy Hollywood conventions that ruin the atmosphere and puncture the viewers suspension of disbelief. I am referring to the awful cheesy old routines that are used over and over again. Stuff that makes A VERY LOUD NOISE for no reason other than to make the viewer jump. Yes well this viewer has seen way to many of those for it to have any effect any more except to be very annoying. Then there is the fact that every 'monster' must make a roaring shrieking hissing sound like a lion crossed with a hissing serpent, even if they only have a human throat and voice box to do it with. Then the fact that every 'nail biter' is always exactly the same. 'JUST AT THE LAST MINUTE' is really a tiresome old chessnut by now. How about a little real world timing for a change? The cars that seem to be doing 300 mph and then turn on a dime, the helicopters that spin so violently they would just disintegrate in real life. The people hanging onto the skids of said helicopter! All of this just ruins any sense of realism which this movie could have exploited so much more. It is really creepy to see a deserted New York rendered so effectively. Will Smith does fine. It just is cursed with this cartoon flavor which totally ruined it for me."
"tsheridan94","2","2","3","11 February 2010"," Better than Omega Man
","The only thing I Am Legend and the 1971 Omega Man have in common is that they are both based on a 1954 Richard Matheson apocalyptic novel. Other than that, the zombies in Omega Man look like acne-ridden geeks who became zombies from sitting in front of a TV screen as opposed to being changed by a disease. The zombies in I Am Legend look like the crazed, beastly freak-shows they're supposed to be. Will Smith is actually a decent actor, if not earth-shakingly so, while Charleton Heston continuously left me wondering how he made it in Hollywood in the first place. Probably bribes or something. The last, and biggest, difference though, is that I Am Legend is good. Unfortunately the same can't be said for Omega Man.<br/><br/>What is it about I Am Legend that makes it good? It has some of the best suspense building scenes from 2007. While it never reaches full-out horror, there are plenty of intense moments. It's very psychological. Nothing is shown, really, violence wise. There is no gore or disembowelment's. This is all the better, as it makes moments like seeing a group of these creatures in an abandoned pitch black apartment building.<br/><br/>Will Smith is also very good. He provides a very powerful, if somewhat dry emotional, performance. He never has been one to get especially teary, or otherwise intense emotionally, except in Pursuit of Happiness.<br/><br/>The other characters don't stand out as much. No one is really bad, but no one is memorable, either. Of course, this doesn't make as big a difference as it would in other movies because, despite what the director tries to get the audience to believe, the only character that's important here is Robert Neville. And again, Will Smith does play him very well and believably.<br/><br/>The story itself is very simple. A disease has ravaged Earth, leaving most dead, and some zombies. Robert Neville is the last man alive. Honestly, that's such a great basis in and of itself that I can only imagine adding more complexity to the plot would diminish it rather than enhance it.<br/><br/>One more thing. I said earlier how Will Smith's performance, while very good, was somewhat emotionless. Well, I think I must say that he plays desperation very well, indeed. Sadness, not really. Happiness? If you want a movie that'll make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, my friend you have the absolute wrong film. This and the Road are probably the two most depressing-outlook apocalypse movies I've seen. (Although the Road to an even greater extent.) But anyway, when the time calls for it, Will Smith plays a man being driven to insanity by his own isolation and imminent doom very well. He's crazy. Are emotions really that important?<br/><br/>So while there may be some character flaws, they matter much less here then they would in pretty much any other film you would care to name. And the movie itself is fantastic, if not inspirational or uplifting, as Pursuit of Happiness was. But this is better than that one was. And much better than Omega Man. Oh, and I have to stay, as far as cinematography goes, that is one convincing utterly annihilated Manhatten."
"Prikolist","1","2","3","29 July 2009"," Inconsistent story about how religion saves mankind from the evil of science
","The first about two-thirds of the movie were actually quite enjoyable. Will Smith's acting was superb, I was pleasantly surprised as I was merely expecting another zombie shooter the likes of ""Resident Evil"". Instead I got an interesting story (with a ""Cast Away"" touch) about lonely survival with a pet dog being the only companion. Plus the great views of empty Manhattan overrun by plants and wild animals. The story started to be inconsistent pretty quick though. First, our hero remarks that the zombies/vampires/infected have no social behavior whatsoever, and yet later we clearly see that they have a leader controlling and planning coordinated attacks of disciplined followers. And the infected who are supposed to be mindless are capable of perfectly and easily replicating a mechanical trap that our hero lays for one of them, along with somehow figuring out a perfect bait. But in the same time they don't use any tools or existing technology whatsoever. Oh, and they have romantic relationships.<br/><br/>The part that was even more annoying was that the whole story is about the evils of genetic engineering and medicine which will of course create monsters and destroy humanity instead of curing diseases, and will be helpless against their own mistakes. But a message from god will bring the survivors (with immunity, obviously) together to rebuild the world.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time. If you want to see an abandoned Manhattan, just watch ""Life After People"". If you want to see zombies and vampires, well I could name a dozen better movies off the top of my head."

There are so many pros and cons to it that it essentially balances it out to somewhere around the middle, which is why I've landed on a 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>I was a little underwhelmed by the resolution, so directly after my first viewing I was left with a poor taste in my mouth. At that point I was thinking, ""Will was OK, nothing more than that."" But I was distracted by the conclusion that I felt was rushed and contrived, so I temporarily forgot about some of Will's key moments.<br/><br/>Sam's death was pretty gut-wrenching; one of the more saddening animal deaths in movie history. Will did a nice job in the specific scene, as well as the following scene in the rental store. I felt for him the most during that particular sequence.<br/><br/>""Big Willie"" also builds suspense nicely during the scene in which Sam runs into the darkness. We can feel his nerves breaking.<br/><br/>Another general positive is the fact that the zombies maintain their humanity without anyone realizing. Neville says that they are losing their human logic when the zombie runs into the light after him, but in reality, the lead zombie wants his woman back. We find out that the zombie Neville traps is a female, and then it makes sense that the male leader tries to enter the light to recover her.<br/><br/>Our natural inclination is to believe that the zombies simply want to infect Neville and the other two survivors near the end, but the more logical explanation is that the zombies want to recover the female that had been captured. Once again we see the lead male zombie leading the way through the glass. That's his girl in there...<br/><br/>But the negatives: (1) Like I've already mentioned: the resolution. The entire event's been predetermined? It's an act of God, and this woman with the butterfly tattoo that's just recently been introduced to us is the key to it all? We don't care about her yet on the screen; too much is riding on her. Also, how is that one vile of vaccine going to cure and restart all of civilization? That's enough of it? <br/><br/>(2) The CGI. It's pretty awful. I scare very easily and yet I was unphased by the zombies because they looked soooooo computerized. I mean, nothing even close to touching a realistic projection.<br/><br/>The deer are awful, and the lioness, etc.<br/><br/>(3) The melodramatic stuff like the butterfly woman's speech, and Neville's ""light up the darkness"" crap. Too cliché, too mushy-gushy-messy.<br/><br/>I dunno, I don't feel like writing anymore, but this film's a complete washout. Some good, lot of bad, but hey, can't take anything away from Will Smith -- the guy's a true megastar."
"caaronmd","4","2","3","15 December 2008"," Made me want to read the book
","I share the disappointment of many of the people posting here about the weak quality of a movie which otherwise had potential. . .Absolutely the culprit in my mind is lazy scriptwriting and directing.<br/><br/>There are so many plot holes in this film I could fill five pages, but I suppose I'll just list one: how on earth do the mutated humans survive for three years? You would think that given their state of regression they would be unable to survive the first NY winter that happened. For that matter, how is it that Will Smith's character is the ONLY surviving human in NY? What makes him so good? You would think that the small percent of immune people would have long ago band together, particularly as they have the advantage of unlimited daytime travel. For that matter, how does one get into Manhattan when all the bridges have been destroyed in an effort to quarantine the island?<br/><br/>Other, more intelligent films like '28days' have dealt with this neatly, or invoked the supernatural. To do neither is, I submit, laziness and an attitude of 'build bigger CGI's, no one will care about the rest. Well, I care.<br/><br/>I watched the movie on HBO, so at least I didn't waste the price of admission or DVD rental. But he real thing is, now I am inspired to go and actually read the book. You know, reading, an activity that is actually good for one."
"nvillesanti","5","2","3","16 May 2008"," A thousand and one ways on how to destroy New York
","I Am Legend, tells the story of Robert Neville (Played by Will Smith), who is apparently the sole survivor of an epidemic that has wiped out a large percentage of humans and has turned others in to ferocious mutants. The film takes place in New Your City. Neville is immune to the effect of this virus and is trying to find a cure or a vaccine. He survived by making a daily routine and with the companionship of his dog Sam.<br/><br/>The Positive: <br/><br/>1. The first half of the movie builds up the atmosphere very well and the images of a desolated New York are very iconic. <br/><br/>2. Will Smiths' acting its really good and you can really feel his sense of lost and loneliness.<br/><br/>The Negatives: <br/><br/>1. The movie is to short, a movie like this and with the talent of Will Smith deserved at least two complete hours. <br/><br/>2. There is no explanation of what kind of virus it is or who made it, and why Neville is immune to it. <br/><br/>3. The first half of the film its great but it gets lost by the introduction of Anna, that in my opinion, her character it's totally unnecessary to the film and it doesn't contribute to the story. There is no real story of where she comes from and how she has managed to survive with a little boy for so long. <br/><br/>4. The Zombies/Vampires are totally CGI. They are bold, pale, and scream a lot. The director should have used real actors to portrayed the infected instead of Computer Animated zombies. A very poor choice.<br/><br/>5. Another negative is the use of a leading zombie/vampire. <br/><br/>6. Both the ending and the alternated ending leave you with no real satisfaction and no conclusion of the story. <br/><br/>I Am Legend had great potential but the director and writers didn't exploit it as they should. Also, it looks like Hollywood just loves to destroy New York, a mean think about it; they have a 1001 ways to destroy it. We have seen it in other films: Planet Of The Apes, King Kong, Cloverfield, Escape From New York, Godzilla, Independence Day, Day After Tomorrow, and now I Am Legend, not to mention Al-Qaeda. It looks like poor old NY its filmmaker's favorite destruction site. <br/><br/>I score 5 for the first half, and 0 for the second half."
"vittoriobaky","6","2","3","9 January 2008"," Entertaining but disappointing, with many mistakes
","I Am Legend must be the dream of every actor. A 1.5 hour movie where about 1.4 hour passes with you and no one else on the screen. The actor, in this case Will Smith, sure had some fun with this movie, but are the spectators in for a Will Smith showcase?<br/><br/>New York is deserted because a virus that went spreading a few years ago. For reasons unknown, our hero is immune - it appears that he's the only person IN THE WORLD being immune to such virus - or is he? He has no one anymore but his dog, as he lost his family in the evacuation of the city. He goes around New York City with awesome cars, loads of weapons, etc.. Because he's alone, he also simulates people with manikins. Like Cast Away's volleyball, these manikins just show that our hero's brain is fusing because of loneliness and paranoia. If that wasn't enough, during the night some infected people (zombies) lurk the city searching for food, and so the life ain't easy. These zombies are pretty stupid and have weak points like not being able to be exposed on light, therefore surviving is hard but not impossible.<br/><br/>The 1st half of the movie creates the atmosphere. Shows you how the city is, what happens, what does Will Smith do, how's his dog, etc. etc.. A few flashbacks pretend to explain what happened, but it's a very superficial explanation in reality - not to talk about the actors who showcase in these flashbacks are not quite on par with Will Smith's great performance. This part of the movie, despite making a great premise, is pretty boring. One would think the 2nd part of the movie which shows some interesting change (some people survived) would then rule everything, but some plot-hole ruin this part too. Or maybe these are not plot holes - but we get such a superficial explanation of what happens why that it's unclear what is logical and what is not. Indeed both zombies and people do things that defy any logic. In a scene for example, zombie dogs can't cross a tiny stripe of light, because that'd hurt them. Near the end though, hordes of zombies run without problems between lamps and explosions, which are making quite a lot of light as well. Also I don't see why a virus would make you turn into a zombie which is killed by the light, but that's not relevant. Not to talk about the characters doing things that I definitely don't imagine that people would do if they'd find themselves alone in such a big city, but that's not too important either. The last 15 minutes build up a great suspense despite the plot holes and the lack of real explanation - and the end is simply bad. I'm not spoiling it in case you didn't see it yet, but it does not make much sense, as the 2 final events are one good and one bad:<br/><br/><ul><li>the good one could have happened about 3 years earlier</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the bad one could have been EASILY avoided Thus, making for a very inconsistent finale.</li></ul><br/><br/>As for the look, the movie is gorgeous: awesome CG, impressive effects, great actor work, and deserted New York City looks absolutely unbelievable. But pretty look does not make up for the often predictable, often flawed and often illogical story, which sees Will Smith on a 1.5 hour long mission to survive - but seeing the mistakes he does, I wonder how could he survive 3 years. He even falls in a trap that he usually uses. Also the last part has a very War Of The Worlds feeling, but in a bad way, as that movie, in my opinion, is superior to this.<br/><br/>I said many bad things about this movie, but is it bad? Not really. It's actually entertaining - but the storyline is extremely flawed. If you're a fan of the book, of Will Smith, of apocalyptic movies in general, or you simply want to sit back and enjoy an action-packed movie for 1.5 hour - watch this movie. If you want a real storyline, plot twists, or any sign of ""intelligence"", don't watch this. The story in fact looks like cut out straight from an arcade zombie shooter from a bowling alley - and, no wonder, there's even a semi-official game for this movie. But its final line is the same as my review for this movie: it's a decent idea done half-decently. And that's not good."
"MacKrazy","6","2","3","7 January 2008"," I Am Legend?....
","""I Am Legend"" is probably one of the most important books in the genre, I doubt there'd be a Night of the Living Dead, no Dawn, No omega man, no 28 days later and none of the films inspired by those films. So that stated you realise how enthusiastic I was about I Am Legend ""Hey there using the actual title this time it must be a lot closer to the original story now..right?"" I thought Will Smith was good as Neville, It wasn't the Will Smith from Bad Boys and Indapendance Day (I think a lot of people thought it might be) He made it feel so reel watching him going through loneliness and insanity. I feel they should have gone one way or the other with the action though, seems like they where trying to dance on two lines at once. Did they wanna make an action packed Omega Man or a character study horror film? If they had gone all action (Yet sticking to the basic storyline) I'd have enjoyed it. I think the Schwarzenegger/Ridley Scott version might have gone that route.(And yes I would have enjoyed that too) The CGI was seriously dodgy, I actually though some of the animals had escaped from Jamngi, well It's not really the fact the CGI was bad it's the fact it was used too much and most of the time when a far more economic and realistic alternative could be used.<br/><br/>Think about good cgi in films, Jurassic Park, T2. partly the reason there was the CGI was for things we have never seen; liquid metal men and dinosaurs. If you use it for humanoid creatures or animals (especielly furry ones) we'll spot its fake as we are so used to seeing them. But also because they where designed to work with well made practical effects.<br/><br/>Actors in make-up and actual REAL animals, you are not really trying to make me believe they don't have trained animals for films any more. CGI would of coarse still be used for animals attacking and the creatures doing un natural things but thats all it should be used for.<br/><br/>Look at the reapers from Blade II they where far more convincing and scary, thats another point as soon as a Close Up of a bad CGI vampire appeared it lost a realism all the great character build up with Smith was lost in an instant. It's almost as if the film itself was affected by night, by day a smart character study into the horror of isolation by night a bad cgi filled action film I feel the whole point of the book was missed like not having the other infected intelligent people who Neville had killed and thus became a ""Legend"" by doing so. I thought that Anna was going to be one of them and that the place she was trying to lead him too was there society.<br/><br/>I really wished some of them could talk I remember how creepy it seemed in the Vincent Price version when his partner would torment him every night I mean every night for 3 years its outside not letting you get some sleep ""we're gonna get you"".<br/><br/>If it where just BASED on the book and not an adaption they shouldn't have used the title, Title should be kept for adaptations. Movies based on books that differ I don't mind e.g ""Total Recall"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Die Hard"" but could you imagine ""Lord of the Rings"" reception if they had decided to change the plot? I have to say the expansion of the dog relationship was better and made the dogs death even sadder when you realise just how important that relationship was the Neville, although perhaps showing him capture the dog like in the book would have been better. The whole film seemed to go by so quick, 1 hour 40 mins? feels like there was no 3rd act at all. Plus it seemed to only take a period of a few days, I'd have preferred to watch Nevile over months like Tom Hanks in Castaway.<br/><br/>In actuality it was the same basic premise used many times by Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later etc (I Know they where all inspired by the book) but if your going to do a new film the most original thing they could have done is actually stick to the ""Basic"" storyline.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's terrible but a lot of things let it down."
"imdb-20078","6","2","3","7 January 2008"," Nice try, but doesn't quite work.
","Here we have more of a re-envisagement of the 1971 'The Omega Man' than the book 'I Am Legend'.<br/><br/>The film sets up the scene nicely but alas quickly falls into typical Hollywood habits resulting in somewhat of a dumbed down script/film.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>1) Why are the infected made mindless monsters by the disease? The virus reduces their brain power but for some reason gives them superhuman strength, realigns their jaw bones (so they have bigger mouths & can shriek like Godzilla) and generally makes them just look rather unappealing. The over-the-top CGI rendering of them looks just like that, CGI rendering, which really does not help the audience 'bind' with the film.<br/><br/>2) Why does Neville see fit to try and remove his scent from the stairs to his house? Surely if the infected follow his trail to the path at the bottom of the stairs they might just by sheer chance try the door at the top of the stairs?<br/><br/>3) Why is it necessary to charge after deer in a sports car (other for some product placement)? Surely just a good shot (or machine gun) would suffice?<br/><br/>4) Given all the (explosive) preparations Neville has made to defend his house, why not just use plenty of nice big UV lamps?<br/><br/>5) Given the clear intelligence of the 'lead infected'  who sets up a VERY elaborate/complicated trap, why doesn't he just pelt Neville with rocks while Neville attempts to crawl away from the trap? Or better still just find an old gun and shoot Neville?<br/><br/>6) His wife shows 'positive' on the infection test, and then on a second attempt proves 'clear'. And the other survivors turn up just in time to (somehow) save him. Oh common writers! Why sink to this sort of stuff! <br/><br/>In short, the film just bends too far away from 'common sense' and 'believability' for the sake of contrived sequences and effects. I would have preferred to spend far more time with Neville and discover more about the creatures, but unfortunately the second half/third of the film seems to rush through not leaving much time for this.<br/><br/>Worse of all, we lose the entire (clever) premise of the book (which the film names itself after) - Neville is now the odd-one-out. He is the bogeyman, the monster which comes out in the day, hunts them down, and kills them<br/><br/>With a better, more sensible script, this could have been a great film, but instead we end up with basically average Hollywood action fare.<br/><br/>6/10 - Shame it wasn't more like 'The Omega Man' film, or the 'I Am Legend' book."
"MashedA","5","2","3","28 December 2007"," Smith Can Act!
","I have just seen this at the cinema and I have to admit that I was disappointed! I can take or leave Will Smith, sometimes he can turn on the magic, sometimes not (Ali anybody?) I Am Legend is definitely a film of two half's, the first half seems to have direction, the second half felt as though the meter was running and it had to be wrapped up!<br/><br/>The first half of the film finds Robert Neville in a bleak apocalyptic vision of a world destroyed by a virus, flashbacks are put into place to ferry the story along where necessary. The scale and enormity of the aftermath is stunningly displayed with excellent cinematography depicting a desolate New York. Will Smith has a depth of character that seems to get better and better as the years go by. I just don't like the chin wobbling parts, I find it hard to watch although no were near as bad as 'Pursuit Of Happiness'<br/><br/>The Zombies look terrible, surely there had to be a better way to show their faces, it just looked like amateur night at the flicks.<br/><br/>'Off Topic' I have often wondered about apocalyptic cities, what happens to nuclear facilities, what happens to gas terminals aren't these places extremely dangerous once unmanned?<br/><br/>Anyway I digress, the second half is just awful, it felt rushed and the storyline just ended it felt like an unnatural conclusion to a great opener, what happened, well the head zombie smashed his face into the glass partition and Robert Neville lets off a hand grenade the end. Come on people! Why is the film called 'I Am Legend' the brief mention of it at the end of the film hardly seemed to suggest this was the case?<br/><br/>The Movie has obviously had megabucks thrown at it, why oh why didn't this film get pre screening feedback that that could have made this film more satisfactory.<br/><br/>On a side note, is Will Smith going for the more serious type role? I for one hope that he doesn't forget his routes in comedy!"
"sendoh15","10","2","3","25 December 2007"," Excellent performance from smith,intense, raw and a unique insight.
","I had high expectations for this movie since there's quite the hype, plus Smith's in it. Its not as gory, or like such films as 28 weeks later nor any other in its genre. But the interest and rawness is from the observatory and moving portrayal of Smith. It feels through out the movie the feeling of reality gone horribly wrong and how such impossibility is dealt with and dealt with very well, through a well acted character. You feel for him, you follow and anticipate what he does and observe closely as your hooked from the start.<br/><br/>His reactions and ways to keep himself sane is reminiscent of cast away. Though in this his relationship with the dog is inspirational as it is sad. Its a moving movie an imaginative one. Great performance from Smith. It is intense through out keeping you at the edge of your seat. The downsides are the infected monsters appearance while it is alright, it wasn't as scary as i anticipated. Through seeing transformers and 300 the level of cgi really went up and I felt as if it could have been more lifelike. It could have been longer too, a hour more would have made it even more perfect. But overall very interesting movie and you won't be disappointed, just remember to keep an open mind and appreciate the acting not just the gore or horror."
"monoape","3","2","3","24 December 2007"," More story, less god needed
","It was good in many ways, but really felt as though another 30 - 60 minutes could've been added to build out the story. Also, there's elements that are just a bit silly ... racing around the city in the Ford Mustang at crazy speeds with deer bouncing in every direction, his seeming inability to shoot one of these deer, being a couple of metres from lions who more or less ignore him, jumping out of a first floor window and suffering no injury, playing golf off the wing of Blackbird SR71 on a warship. Minor quibbles, but too often I was asking myself 'why?' or 'how?'. Just because it's scifi doesn't mean it has to lose all sense of reality.<br/><br/>On the positive side was Will's acting - he carried it well, but he couldn't make up for a fairly poor script.<br/><br/>However, what really turned me off the film was the god / religious nonsense that litters the film and swamps it at the end. When the woman and child arrive at the compound for survivors (that god told her about), the gates open to reveal chocolate box church with bells ringing. It looked like a cross between The Stepford Wives and a Branch Davidians compound. Shudder. I was expecting to see 'Executive Producer: Jesus' appear in the credits."
"Mccadoo","6","2","3","24 December 2007"," Didn't live up to it's potential
","**Spoilers** I read ""I Am Legend"" at least three times growing up and loved it each time. I went to see ""Omega Man"" with great anticipation and left with great disappointment.<br/><br/>I thought that this time they'd get it right, that this time Hollywood would recognize that ""I Am Legend"" is a great work of fiction and can stand on it's own. That for once they wouldn't mess with a good thing. That for once they'd realize that they really can't do it better, they're really not smarter than the original author, and just stick to the game plan. I was wrong and once again, scriptwriters who think they are better writers than the original author and in reality can't hold a candle, missed a chance at a classic.<br/><br/>That being said, I didn't hate this movie, it had some good things going for it. I thought Will Smith gave a great performance, especially considering that for most of the movie all he had to work with was a dog and some mannequins. The scenes of a deserted New York City were very well done. The beginning of the movie created the perfect atmosphere for what the story called for. And then, they screwed it all up; The CGI effects were cheesy at best, the nightstalkers didn't look believable at all. And they're behavior was so far over the top that it stopped being scary after their first few scenes and became annoying and even comical. I understand they were supposed to be sub-human monsters but come on, all they did was scream and slam into things. Even real animals don't act that way.<br/><br/>The movie never developed the story line, it hinted at the fact that the nightstalkers were ""evolving"" but left it at that; hints.<br/><br/>And then the plot holes; Robert Neville made a daily broadcast announcing his presence in NYC, this in fact was what eventually brought the woman and child to look for him. Why then didn't this commune of survivors in Vermont receive his signal and follow up on it? Another plot hole; Neville as at the dock, at night, fighting the nightstalkers in an obvious attempt to die after losing his dog. There are dozens and dozens of zombies there trying to kill him, and yet a woman and a child manage to rescue him and drive away? How exactly did they accomplish that? The final act of the movie was the biggest disappointment for me. First, they turn to sermonizing at the end, the woman states that God has helped her and the boy, huh? And the ending was the biggest disappointment of all. The novel's ending is what makes it a classic, and where the title comes from by the way. The movie gives us a cookie cutter Hollywood happy ending and a lame voice over to try to tie the title into THEIR ending. It ruined all that came before it. And it was totally uncalled for, they could have just as easily stuck to the original ending and stayed true to the novel. This is what they should have done because whoever wrote this movie couldn't carry Richard Matheson's water...<br/><br/>It was better than ""Omega Man"" but still didn't come close to the novel. To Hollywood; please don't make anymore movies from classic works of fiction unless you're going to pay attention to what made them classics in the first place."
"Katadreuffe","5","2","3","24 December 2007"," A bit pretentious for a zombie movie
","Mutated humans come out at night to eat the left over normal people. I've got the feeling I've seen that before in movies not worth remembering the title. That's what the movie is about, no matter how well the origin of these zombies is thought through.<br/><br/>As a zombie movie, it relies to heavily on the shock-effect, after the third time I spilled my beer, I got annoyed. And there's no other real suspense or flow to it to carry it. It seemed to have an effect on the audience but it's just the effect, not substantially different or from popping a balloon behind someone's back.<br/><br/>I like Will Smith's performance, though the movie is a bit short on good dialog, due to the story line. I also liked the scenes of a desolate Manhattan, and the little visual jokes (Van Gogh), but the computer graphics of the zombies were ugly, although up to today's standard. We will laugh about in 20 years, just how we are amused by old Dracula movies with the ropes visible. But if that's the best the computer graphics industry can do, than it must be great to look at, isn't it? It's quite an enjoyable movie, that won't get you bored to easily. But it's certainly not worth any more attention than 1,5 hour in the cinema."
"mdarmocida","4","2","3","23 December 2007"," Right Title Wrong Story
","The fact that this movie was named after the novel ""I Am Legend"" (prior movies were named ""Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man""), led me to believe that this would be an even more accurate adaptation of the novel. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed, as this story is probably as unfaithful to the novel as ""The Omega Man."" While many of the effects were good, the movie went overboard with the CG on the hemocytes, which made them look like cartoons.<br/><br/>Overall I found this movie a big disappointment as I felt Will Smith and the movie in general just couldn't pull off the dire terror of the book or first movie ""Last Man on Earth."" I was most disappointed when I saw the equivalent rivalry of between Neville and Ben Cortman (Neville's best friend who taunts him after being infected) reduced to a mindless alpha male.<br/><br/>In the end, the first movie; Vincent Price's classic ""Last Man on Earth"" obviously remains the most loyal to the novel even though the title and many of the character have different names."
"Phoenix_Hacker","6","2","3","20 December 2007"," Inconsitent
","This movie has some very good moments scattered throughout. Unfortunately, the rest is just so-so. Smith's acting is great while he's trying to maintain his sanity but he slips up at times as his sanity crumbles. The CGI was distracting at times. Some elements that could have easily been accomplished with real objects were needlessly replaced with odd-looking CGI models. The infected were only really scary for their startle factor. As the film neared the end it dwindled out and tried to make up for it with some generic action. Very anticlimactic and predictable.<br/><br/>The better moments are while Neville tries to recreate his normal life during the day by interacting with dummies and his dog. There is more chemistry between him and inanimate objects than in most dramas. Telling the story through flashback was effective but felt a little unnecessary as the story has mostly been revealed through trailers."

What looked like an award winning movie was destroyed in just a few minutes. Besides the fact I personally didn't like the ending, the ending didn't fit in the movie. It felt rushed.
And then I found out that this wasn't the ending the makers intended. They changed it after negative reactions of the test audience.
Today I rewatched the movie and without knowing it, I put on the alternate ending movie. And then it just fit. The movie became so great, the ending fitted way better and I personally liked this ending so much more.
So for people having the same issues as me with the original movie I would advice to watch the alternate movie instead. The alternate movie ending is way more true to the book and the rest of the movie."

","Starting on a promising note, losing its way in the middle, and collapsing entirely in the final act, I Am Legend is at its finest when it finds Will Smith steering through the windswept emptiness of the post-apocalyptic New York City but several shortcomings in the script and extremely shoddy work in the CGI department only end up nullifying the terror & sense of foreboding it had built-up within the first act. Neither chilling nor thrilling, this post-apocalyptic sci-fi horror had potential but not the required talent at helm to effectively translate it from script to screen."

The way in which it gradually reveals the information is seamless and elegant. The zombies/vampires are probably the most interesting of any movie in the genre.<br/><br/>I will probably keep watching this every so often but there are some shortcomings, the movie is too short, the last half hour is weirdly paced.

"tabuno","5","1","1","21 January 2019"," Nice Effort But Mediocre Script
","15 January 2008. Warning: Spoilers. An interesting look at an overgrown, forested, dehumanized, unpopulated New York, but the infected people looked artificial, the script was pretty much cliché, predictable, and a lot of the plot points were obviously more for overly dramatic shock value than any real sense of reality. This was more of a glorified horror teen action-thriller ride at an amusement park. It wasn't so much God that put together all the coincidences as the survivor girl says but the screenwriter who just appeared to become lazy and created shock value scenes. The unnecessary flashback technique made the movie more choppy and instead of THE TERMINATOR'S effective use of flashback as a natural part of the storyline, here in I AM LEGEND it's also a lazy way of saving movie costs and explaining the movie through edited scenes. Wil Smith never had an opportunity to really develop a character along a real timeline, the development of his relationship with his dog from a puppy. There isn't any development of his psychological progression over time, except sudden personality changes that seem out of context and don't appear to really make sense. There are the infected strange behavior that almost imply that they have retain some intellectual or emotional faculties but then it's ignored by the end of the movie. There is one scene where Wil Smith is in a bathtub for the night and then seen in bed in the morning as if nothing happened. There is a lot of layman shooting at deer for no real apparent reason, even for sport or food, it's not ever clear. There was too much manipulation, Wil Smith's wife at first being shown positive than negative for the virus, then the implication that their escape helicopter is destroyed by an out of control helicopter. There were just too many possibilities to make this a really good remake. Wil Smith isn't at fault, it was the material. While the story is understandable, the action and thrills decent, all together there just isn't any qualitative superlatives here that really move this movie into the very good category. The producers probably hoped that the supposedly fascinating look of New York would carry the movie, but unfortunately, it also became just a wild dream that crashed and burned. Five out of Ten Stars."

"ThiagoCrivellaro","5","1","1","28 December 2017"," Irregular with a dumb finale
","Before Will Smith came out with I Am the Legend, two great actors of the past, Vincent Price and Charlton Heston, were linked to Richard Matheson's novel of the 1950s. The first appeared in Die Dead (1964) while the latter was hero in The Last Hope of the Earth (1971). As I have not watched these versions, I will leave any comparison aside, however, considering the interpreter, the new drapery of the book brings someone much more convincing than updated special effects. Still, he sins by distancing himself a lot from his origin and transforms a great idea into yet another product of man's belief.<br/><br/>The kick that throws modern society to collapse lies in a remedy against cancer. Tested on thousands of people and advertised on TV as a great discovery, the product ends up having the opposite effect some time later. In a matter of a few months, civilization is attacked by zombies of great strength and agility, in addition to being quite bloodthirsty. Immune to the effects of the drug and working for years to find a cure, military man Robert Neville (Smith) lives on the abandoned island of Manhattan in New York accompanied by his dog Sam waiting for someday to meet other humans like him.
Although lonely in relation to his peers, Neville communicates constantly not to become an autistic. His voice is punctual, for it creates artifice to be spontaneous. He still makes up for his sadness with Sam's friendship, not just because he's a family pet, but for companionship at all times. The animal keeps him mentally healthy in the face of the insanity that has taken over the environment. She is unable to respond to Neville's longings, but it gives her emotional comfort. In this sense, the viewer can understand certain explosive attitudes of the character when the situation is out of control.<br/><br/>For two-thirds of the film talking little, Neville seeks to keep himself occupied with scientific experiments, golf games, food hunting, and hunting. Many of the wide-angle plans value both the character's solitude and the size of the holocaust that hit Ground Zero (used in the film as the place where the disease began, not the 9/11 actual terrorist attacks). In one of the hunting moments, the man discovers a lair stuffed with zombies and, when he can capture one of them as a guinea pig, the scale of the problems increases. And when they reach their apex, the script loses its impact.<br/><br/>On the one hand writers Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman offered an effective dramatic charge to the protagonist and, in a fair way, added a greater responsibility to this one giving large space to the companion, something that occurs in the book in a different way. In addition, both took from the writer the same composition of scenes between past and present events so that the spectator understands the parallel anxieties of Neville. However, the writer insists on glorifying the characters in order to target their actions to something superior and, through them, to exalt symbols and Christianity that insure as the beginning of the future. He still composes the third act with some mean dialogues, among them about Bob Marley.<br/><br/>In another case, director Francis Lawrence is able to take measures that raise tension at the most dynamic moments of the narrative, but makes the film false by demonstrating once again the desire to let the special effects fill the screen as it did in Constantine. Of course, it's all a fantasy, but do we have to see something bad? Zombies are more deformed by their digital composition than by the ugliness provided by their disease. Beyond them, animals, vegetation and abandoned buildings as scenery also artificially appear in several scenes.<br/><br/>I Am Legend has become the biggest box office hit based on a zombie story, even though the patients presented are less realistic than the horror films of George Romero, Zack Snyder and Danny Boyle. It is clear that Will Smith was instrumental in the success of the project and the subliminal message has had an effect. Unfortunately, the film will pass on the history of cinema as another adaptation of Matheson's work without the main aspect of that plot: its ending. Hollywood studios have lots of creative people who could film the last pages of the book; they lack courage"

","150 million dollars on this? A TWO-actor film?! Guess after Smith's paycheck and environment CGI, there wasn't much left.<br/><br/>The movie has so many problems...<br/><br/>1. Unbelievable.<br/><br/>I can't really imagine a faker loneliness. Want loneliness? Watch Moon. Rockwell nails the performance spot on. Smith is just... saying the lines, looking sad and stuff. Must've been good having a pet around.<br/><br/>Talking about pet - such a superdog who grew up with him for years... doesn't know that a dark place is bad? No, even better - it doesn't respond to basic commands? ""No, stay""? Yeah... right. Oh and that pet wasn't exactly a chameleon, it was deadmeat the moment it entered the underground. Hiding under the table like a cat when the ghoul is two meters away is so believable, why didn't Smith hide there?<br/><br/>Smith is supposed to be stoic, tough, smart and inventive. He... uhm gets into his own trap? Then stays unconscious for hours until his watch wakes him up, all the while his dog barking literally nonstop? Yeah, he was shown to predict the clock time... while sleeping at night. That was hanging upside down with a barking dog. Then he gets himself down... sees that the time is probably bad and starts to... slither to the car? Pain or not, it should be pretty clear that he should probably walk on his hands but get his rear end out of there. Only at the very last moment he decides to stand up and hop on a single leg. Right... Then... as his dog dies defending him from his own stupidity, the best solution he finds is to suicide trying to kill some random ghouls? That's.... that's legend. Pure legend. Of course, he gets saved by a scripted girl. He then spends screen time trying to get around, pouting and promoting Shrek and Bob Marley. Of course, the question of arrival only occurred to him when the night fell, so he couldn't really prevent anything Tomorrowland style.<br/><br/>But the best part is the ending. Granted that the alternate ending is indeed too much fluff, the way he went out in theatrical is... as logical as the death of the scientist in Night of the Living Homeless. He had a gun... he had a crack in the glass. What about... shooting the glass? Throwing a grenade, timing it? Probably the glass would take most of the impact, he should've survived. No, I guess the best way a military colonel can go out is to blow himself up, makes sense.<br/><br/>And of course there's gotta be a happy end. Time to ""listen"", right?<br/><br/>2. Horrible narrative With such a short screen time, the amount of time wasted on his pointless family, on the mannequin rambling, on promotions and other pointless dialogue...<br/><br/>The movie begins, you sort start to enjoy it, try to understand it, you already know he's developed the cure, it can't be made more obvious, and by the time the action starts... you just get the forced plot shoving. Trapped?! Dog died?! He went bonkers?! He was saved?! He acts Shrek?! Oh, right, time to wrap it up, coal chute is safe... gg. Why even bother with the cure, when it's clearly safer and faster to exterminate the ghouls and reproduce... Weren't those sheltered - immune? Wasn't his cure - an after-effect on the ghouls, not some vaccine for healthy people?<br/><br/>3. Movie doesn't really get anywhere.<br/><br/>I thought it would be a great coincidence to watch this post apocalyptic flick before starting Fallout 4, the beginning was so smooth. But then it just went zombie flick before losing all sense as described above. So what part of that was legend? Like Age of Ultron lasting for about a.. week? - so this movie doesn't really fulfill the title. It's not a legend, more like a story of a failure scientist who really, really wanted to get that paycheck and acted the sharp script as good as he could...<br/><br/>I thought Riddick's dog was too cheesy, but damn... compared to this, Riddick looks like an Oscar material with low budget. If this movie can get 7\10 rating... why not give Night of the Living Deb 10\10?"

","This was not a bad movie and it is fascinating enough to grab my attention to the end, Will Smith plays the isolated Robert Neville very well, we get the sense of desperation, despondency and at times despair from someone in a very dire position and also the sense of the monster when Neville becomes little better than the creatures he his in conflict with. The scene with Sam the dog is very touching and again, we get the feeling of despair and sorrow from Neville. The infected are nothing short of frightening and unpredictable, they become strong and fast, but I felt they had more in common with the zombie's from the computer game Resident Evil as they become more animalistic and the infected lose their minds and their humanity which takes away what made them interesting in the original story. The story is fascinating enough but a little too simplistic and the ending is very moving but a bit too predictable and not as compelling as the one in the novel. Overall this movie is definitely worth a watch and it has a lot to offer as a movie, but the book still made for a more compelling and interesting story."

","This movie stars Will Smith and is a post apocalyptic zombie movie. The film is set in New York City, 3 years after a cancer cure turned into a virus and killed most of the population and turned the rest into zombie like creatures. Will Smith played the role of a US Army Virologist that is immune to the disease. He is the only one left in New York City, or at least he thinks he is. He spends most of his time trying to cure the disease and fighting to survive. He is all-alone for most of the movie with the exception of his dog, Sam, that becomes his best friend after the outbreak occurs. The zombie creatures in the movie cannot go out in the sunlight so Smith does all his work during the day while he can roam free. Once night hits, he has to lock up the house and put metal shutters on the windows and doors so the zombies cannot find him. Every day he faces new challenges in this new dystopia world."

","""I Am Legend"", was the last film I saw in the theatre of 2007. It was actually pretty good on the first viewing, but the second time around I started to get very little sensations that told me it really wasn't all that great. <br/><br/>Based on Richard Matheson's 1954 vampire classic of the same name. This film had been delayed since the 1980's, and had gone through a string of action stars while in production. Upon finally being released, how did it all fair out? Well Will Smith was extremely convincing in the role, you can sympathise with him in his state of constant isolation and there's enough scenes to show some real star power. I can appreciate that some scenes came off as genuine, but a lot more of them felt forced. It's also one of those few films that I don't think I can really attack the dialogue scenes or many of their scenarios as some felt lacking, yet it never really bothered me too much.<br/><br/>What I will attack however is the CGI, which looked utter crap. It was so unbelievably bad and horrible, it pretty much destroyed the film for me. In a day and age of such great makeup effects, how those film-makers looked at those scenes and didn't choose to include some practicality is beyond me. I feel I could be a little forgiving, but a lot of people I know hate this movie because of that unwise decision.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It's far from accurate on the novel it's based on, I also reckon it isn't really necessary viewing. Will Smith puts on a good show and that's about all I can say from it. 6/10."

"siobhanmckibbin","5","1","1","29 January 2011"," Lost potential in being a 'legend'
","After my first viewing of I am Legend, i was left thinking about what it was i actually watched. Then after a second analysis i realised that the film makers had such a fantastic idea for a movie, developed from Richard Matheson's novel, but they failed to utilise it to its best potential.<br/><br/>The film in set in the city of New York, years after a plague has killed most of the humanity and the rest that remain have been transformed into, what can only be described as monsters. You can feel the sense of isolation, and as the film carries on you feel the desperation that Robert Neville is experiencing.<br/><br/>The cinematography is admirable, with the computer generated scenes which depict a derelict and uninhabited New York. Quite frankly these scenes shown at the start of the film were chilling, as you see are witnessing what should be a busy and buzzing city turned into a city of ruin.<br/><br/>Will Smith should be commended for his performance. He single handedly carried this movie along as Robert Neville, the sole survivor who only has his daughter's pet dog Sam for company. Will Smith's delivers not only a convincing performance, but he is also very moving, and as an audience, you begin to feel what he feels. The flashback sequences also provide depth to the character. The juxtaposition between how Robert was pre-apocalypse New York and post-apocalypse New York, creates a sympathetic feeling amongst an audience.<br/><br/>Although I am Legend started off with a strong and powerful narrative, with the potential to be one of the better 21st Century apocalypse films, it soon dwindled towards the end. The film had become very interesting and frightening as the 'monsters' became intelligent and were setting Robert up in traps similar to the ones he was setting for them. But unfortunately thats were it ended. I feel that there was more room for development here, but instead the film makers brought it to a sudden close, which as a viewer made me feel inadequate. Although i have not read Richard Matheson's novel I am Legend yet, i only hope that it is more established than Francis Lawerence's portrayal is.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time that a film has made me this frustrated. It had content to be a great movie of all time, but when it came down to it, I am Legend became a disappointment."
"screenman","5","1","1","29 December 2010"," More Zombies Anyone?
","'I Am Legend' is 'The Omega Man' updated. And it's daft.<br/><br/>The complete recreation of a deserted and dilapidated New York is very nicely realised. It's on an even grander scale than 'After Humans'. I enjoyed seeing the grasses and weeds shoving through the roads and pavements and putting up two herbaceous fingers at human arrogance. It's just as John Wyndam described London in 'The Triffids'.<br/><br/>There's been a plague. Thanks to the efforts of a well-intentioned, but unfortunately-named Dr Krippen, a cure became the opposite. We are told that 90% of humanity died, 9% turned 'zombie flesh-eater' and 1% were immune. Most of the latter got eaten by the zombies. It's a hard life. Will Smith plays New York's sole survivor. And he's a doctor with special knowledge of disease and immunity - which is handy. He also seems to be an expert on electronics and explosives too. Hmm. His wife and child got killed in a helicopter accident during evac, leaving him with his Alsatian puppy which has since grown up. So here he is, working on his own, trying to find a cure, and gradually going screwy.<br/><br/>Like all of our ancient terrors; the zombies only come out at night, so he's more or less free to roam in the daytime. He forages for food, traps the odd zombie for experiments, hunts wild game and collects CD's.<br/><br/>The disease is apparently both an airborne and contact contagion. Legend himself has complete immunity. His dog, meanwhile, only has immunity from the airborne form. How there can be any difference between the two when the disease symptoms themselves are identical is unclear, and merely serves to demonstrate a lack of pathogenic research on the part of film-makers. Like so many of them nowadays; they assume audiences to be just uneducated clots who can be bought-off with wham-bam-also-ran special-effects. Not only that; if the disease can infect dogs, why hasn't it infected the herds of wild game? Or the lions, for that matter. Surely they must contain the vital element of immunity then (yet our hero concentrates upon rats and zombies). Moreover; why haven't the zombies tracked all the animals down at night and eaten them?<br/><br/>Furthermore; the zombies are running a temperature, heart-rate etc on par with an athlete, and they're wearing almost no clothes (they wear enough to satisfy the censors!). To be in such work-out condition for an hour would be strenuous enough, but to sustain it 24/7 would require a huge calorific intake. 5,000+ per day. From where is this energy being drawn? They'd have to eat pure lard, or be burned-out within 48hrs.<br/><br/>I don't mean to nit-pick, but if a movie is going to have quasi scientific/medical pretensions like this one, it's no good vacillating between plausibility and absurdity just to appease a plot that doesn't stand to reason. Either be a sci-fi movie or a horror fantasy; don't try to rationalise one into the other. That creates a fairy tale.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the culminating question. Why is Legend trying to develop a vaccine at all? The few remaining normal people left alive like him already have natural immunity. The zombies are so violent that even if they can't infect you they'll rip you to shreds, so you'll likely get slaughtered trying to use it on any of them. The logical thing is to just clear out and let nature take its course.<br/><br/>If you're someone who doesn't stop to think: If you just sit there and take the whole thing as it unfolds without evaluation or question - in other words, answer to the prescription of its makers - then there is some decent tension, excellent set-pieces and lots of second-rate CGI to enjoy, and Will Smith gives a very decent turn for his paycheque. But that's it. It's not a thinking person's experience. <br/><br/>The ending is perhaps daftest of all. Partway through the movie, during a crisis, he is rescued by a pretty heroine who turns up with a young boy. Both have immunity too. So, at last he no longer has to talk to himself or tailors' dummies. And he's no longer alone (by now the dog's dead). This girl insists that there's an upstate enclave of survivors. Which is something Legend dismisses as complete twaddle. Yet in the last moments, when he has finally isolated a vaccine and the ZF-E's have invaded his stronghold, he gives the vaccine to her and the boy and ushers them into an escape tunnel. So where does he imagine they are going, if he doesn't believe the enclave exists? And what does he suppose she will do with his vaccine? Meanwhile, instead of going with her, he shuts off the 'escape route' and blows himself up with the zombies. He could just as easily have pulled the pin, chucked the grenade, and escaped with the girl as well. Daft.<br/><br/>If you think this movie is in any way exceptional, then you should check-out Jodie Foster's 'Flightplan'."

","This was a tough movie to rate. I found myself hating and liking parts of the film. I really like the feeling of how it is just Will Smith and the dog for the longest time. It gives you a creepy and uneasy feel. But I really hate the mutated people. Most of the CG was just horrible for this film. Especially the animals. But overall, the story was OK with a pretty crappy ending. You would want to see an amazing ending to this strange story, but you just don't get it. I would of also liked to see more from the side characters like Alice Braga. So I don't know. I rated the movie neutral for the fact that I did enjoy it till the end even though I hated some of the scenes. So I would say the movie is worth seeing at least once."
"Eternality","5","1","1","14 October 2010"," I Am Dismal could have been a more apt title.
","One of the most highly anticipated films of 2007 turned out to be a dud. I Am Legend, a remake of sorts, and an adaptation of Richard Matheson novel, has a premise that is potentially explosive, one that will make the cash register sing. A sci-fi horror in nature, I Am Legend will attract viewers just by the plot itself and of course, the charisma of its star, Will Smith.<br/><br/>Smith is typecast as someone with a lonely existence, but with a zest for life and a personal quest to reverse the deadly effects of a plague that has turned most into carnivorous, light-terrorized zombies that thrive menacingly when dusk breaks. His performance is ever-improving, maybe it comes from being recently Oscar-nominated. The rest of the cast is abysmal though, maybe it comes from being CGI-ed. The zombies while effectively created, does not frighten as much in the second half the film than in the first.<br/><br/>That being said, I Am Legend is a movie of two halves. A promising start that depicts New York City in the most desolate and lifeless ever, with added eerie suspense to match, to an utterly garbage second half that is both cliché and dumb, and contrastingly much less scary. For most parts of the film, it treads on thin ice, threatening to become another ""one of those horror disaster flicks"". Occasionally, the ice breaks, but Smith saves the day.<br/><br/>Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) doesn't have a proved track record; it's no wonder that I Am Legend is this year's most high-profile failure. This is a playground for Steven Spielberg (War Of The Worlds) and James Cameron (Aliens). One wonders what magic they would have infused into the film. I Am Legend is poorly-edited, with sudden cuts, as well as equally sudden loud bangs and crashes that irritates more than it scares. The score by James Newton Howard (The Village) is also one of his worst of his career.<br/><br/>Sometimes bad films are at the very least entertaining, think Transformers, or for that matter Die Hard 4.0. I Am Legend lacks substance, and will disappoint fans of the genre. It will continue to break box-office records though, but it also reminds us that popularity doesn't equate to quality. If you enjoy mediocre films, here's one to recommend. I Am Dismal could have been a more apt title.<br/><br/>SCORE: 5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
"RabbitFighter","6","1","1","30 September 2009"," An enjoyable lightweight viral disaster movie.
","I Am Legend does plenty right, certainly most of the important things to a post-apocalyptic zombie film; it has absolutely breathtaking scenery, the sets (especially the house) are perfect, and the atmosphere is appropriately creepy the whole time. Add all of this up and throw in a strong performance by Will Smith, and you've got a very promising horror film. well... almost. I Am Legend has a really big story, so big that it can't cover all of it's bases in the time given. The movie is relatively short at about an hour and thirty five, and there isn't much time for Smith to explore the interesting and disturbing world he has found himself in. To make things worse, large portions of the film are dedicated to lengthy flashbacks from just before the movie starts that never really seem to be called for or drive the plot in any discernible way, serving only to supplement knowledge of the plot; given the short length of the movie, it hardly seems a worthy sacrifice for some action or, even better, some mystery. Essentially, that's where I am Legend falls short, it doesn't really present a decent mystery or developed drama, and it trades the possibility of delivering non-stop action for some mediocre flashbacks and a simple plot. However, it never really bores, and Will Smith is charismatic enough to elevate the viewing experience to well-above average. But just imagine what could have been if this movie was also well written. As it is, it's a good film that is too short and a bit thin, but it could have been a classic in the horror genre."
"asianXstyle689","Null","1","1","16 September 2009"," As a film it was great...adaptation....not so much.
","Book/Film comparison. Story: I noticed everyone posting about just how good I Am Legend is as a movie. In all honesty as a movie I Am Legend was good, but compared to the book the film just doesn't even get close to what Robert Neville experiences as the last man on Earth. I know you can't be too picky as far as Hollywood affected film adaptations go but I can't help but feel cheated by this film. I understand the liberties taken to make the book more enjoyable to see as a movie, but by the end of the movie I could see that they'd missed a great opportunity to make a truly epic film of what it really is like to be the last man on Earth. The book was truly about one man's survival and that he not only fought against the ""infected"" but also against himself. Robert Neville was a drunk, and throughout the novel continues to live on against it all not able to take his own life because he's afraid to. He wasn't a doctor in the book, but I thought it was a good idea to keep him as one that way you could make the idea of a cure possible to be introduced. In the novel it wasn't so much about Neville finding out how to cure the virus, but to find out how it had affected the body and hopefully just maybe could find a cure utilizing his own immune blood. <br/><br/>Infected: The infected in the film I thought was completely stupid and ridiculous in the way they we're portrayed and handled. I understand again that everyone that has read the book has their own interpretations of them and that just bare w/ me on this one. In the novel they did have augmented strength and agility but they weren't ravenous, stupid 28 days later-esquire zombies. They really were people that were sick. Due to the virus they were allergic to sunlight, but they still maintained their minds only they now wanted blood and would do what it took to get it. Though acting like a bunch of animals they acted in packs and if driven to just like humans would feast on each other just to survive. Another note on the infected, okay; one of the reasons why Neville was able to stay sane for years was because of Ben Cortman. Every night when the infected came out they were led by Cortman; and would continuously attempt to coax Neville out of his home. Without the inclusion of Cortman I felt another great opportunity was missed to really show Neville's shaky grasp of his sanity. <br/><br/>Robert Neville: As I'd touched on above in my story comparison, it's true in the novel it was about one mans survival as the last man on Earth. Robert Neville battles alcoholism and depression. Will Smith wasn't my first choice as Neville but in the movie I could see that he could pull off the roll really well. Though if this we're a true adaptation of the book I honestly do believe that this role is Oscar material and that he could have gotten an Oscar nod for best actor and possibly taken the award home. <br/><br/>sorry I feel like I'm seriously bitching way TOO much about this movie because of how disappointed I am."
"dwpollar","5","1","1","21 July 2009"," Will Smith end-of-world vehicle falls just short...
","1st watched 7/3/2009, 5 out of 10 (Dir – Francis Lawrence): Will Smith end-of-world vehicle falls just short of being a completely satisfying movie experience. It's definitely an interesting concept with Will's character being the possibly last survivor of a virus brought about by a cancer cure that backfires. He is also a doctor who is still daily working on a cure. The problem with the movie is that it's an obvious attempt to put his face in front of us for 2 whole hours and I get the feeling he wants us to like it. He's a good actor but he can't carry something like this that depends on him solely. There are also human-feeding, night-dwelling, very fast living dead types that come out and he has to protect himself against them. He has learned this and he and his dog have a pretty regimented daily routine. In the daytime they do their shopping(aka. Looting) and search for others who might still be alive and then they board themselves up in the evening. Later he comes across a couple of others who save him and he's egotistical enough to not believe there are others in another location alive. The ending was interesting but still not enough to completely recommend the whole movie.(unless you just can't get enough of Will Smith)"
"foxx_1","4","1","1","4 May 2009"," Should have known better...
","Let's start with confessing that I was rather reluctant to the the idea of watching a film where Will Smith roams the street of Manhattan all by himself armed with a gun... but in the end, I had read enough enthusiastic comments so I decided to give it a try - which afterwards only confirmed my suspicions.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that it does not define itself as a pure fantasy/horror genre but tries instead way too hard to create references to real life: scientist announcing cure for cancer, the year being clearly defined, New York scenery, Bob Marley, Shrek etc. OK, this kind of mixing everyday life reality and absolute fiction worked just fine for comedies e.g. ""Ghostbusters"" or ""Back to the future"" but here it just made me roll my eyes with disbelief. We have to assume that somehow the above cancer medicine was simply injected into millions of people all over the world without even being tested appropriately and then - oops, it turns out that it actually kills people or turns them into monsters?!!? This not being preposterous enough, we are to believe that the virus spreads way too fast so it can kill everyone including the government (which would have been isolated right away), the Pentagon (same as the government), remote communities etc. It is also not quite clear how the streets are jammed with cars but there is not even a trace of rotting bodies... I guess this was also some kind of flesh, bone and clothes eating virus that made everything disappear neatly:) Anyhow, apart from driving his SUV and shooting deer Will Smith has to hide from the mutants which obviously are debilitated enough so they can only roar and make evil grimaces - in terms of communication. Other than that, they also resemble vampires i.e. start falling apart if exposed to direct sunlight - umm, ooh-kay... this is where it started getting a bit too much for me. Of course there are also vampire dogs (!!) which means that the virus somehow spread among animals too but did not harm the deer, the lions etc. By the way, the vampires/mutants do not seem to harm them either, obviously being vegetarian - which must be a good thing since they are able to jump and climb buildings with the agility of orangutans.<br/><br/>To tie up this story, there is a woman with a kid showing up at the right place and at the right time (talk about deus ex machina) as she apparently was the only one to hear Will Smith's radio messages... And then, towards the end of the movie, we see military personnel which for a strange reason failed to hear those messages and no one bothers to hint why!! Moderatly entertaining movie which will require you to suspend any logic to enjoy it."
"Scarecrow-88","5","1","1","17 January 2009"," I Am Legend
","A plague sweeps across the world and renders civilization a mass of dead and infected savages(..named Darkseekers who only hunt at night with an inability to withstand sunlight it seems), a survivor, Doctor Robert Neville(Will Smith)seeks a cure, working effortlessly in his lab, slowly losing hope of ever achieving such a feat. He also often hunts the Darkseekers at night, setting traps to capture live specimens so that he can attempt to cure them. During the struggle to find a cure, Neville's resolve and courage begin to dwindle, and his need for human interaction are proving to become his undoing.<br/><br/>Rather simply and predictably told, with CGI creatures which look like characters from a video game, it's Smith's riveting performance that keeps this rather weak interpretation afloat. Some action/thriller elements are delivered somewhat well as Neville finds himself in life-threatening situations with the Darkseekers. Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan are Anna and Ethan, mother and son survivors who enter Neville's life towards the middle of the film as he, in desperation and despair, almost kills himself by driving straight into an army of Darkseekers. Smith is able to convey a sense of loss and a desperate need for companionship with the film expressing a quiet, devastated New York City. Smith's work opposite his pet companion, Samantha, are really effective and his scene with a department store mannequin echo The Twilight Zone episode, Is There Anybody Out There? But, you've seen this all before and the film really doesn't set itself apart from other films which focused on the same type of Matheson story. Still Smith does what is required of him and the film benefits from such a performance even if the special effects are not up to par."
"kosmasp","6","1","1","9 July 2008"," Worn out
","One can't stop thinking what could've come out as a movie/result, if Alex Proyas would have directed this movie? See his Dark City, if you haven't, to understand where I'm going with this (there's also a Directors Cut coming this year). It's kind of the same feeling many had when Resident Evil came out and were yearning for the George A. Romero version of it.<br/><br/>But behold, I am Legend never goes completely off tracks, as Resident Evil did (that's of course in my humble opinion). While the director and the star (Will Smith) here try to make a decent (dark) horror drama, they don't really live up to the task. The movie has it's weird moments and some nice scary ... scares, but in the end, some plot holes, the not entirely convincing ""bad guys"", a real bad turn in the third act, all add up to undermine what the movie had achieved previous to that point. The end is then a big disappointment, not because it's not clear (I did get the hints/signs, without seeing the Directors cut or alternate ending stuff), but because you came to expect more from it.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any of the other adaptations nor did I read the book, but I can safely say that while Will Smith plays it straight, he's character is undermined by many script flaws. So he is flirting with puppets/mannequin(s), but only comes back as a boomerang at the end (if you watch the movie you know what I mean). It's a shame then, that it hasn't succeeded in walking the thin line between entertainment and dark horror drama/study ...."

"dave_wright87","5","1","1","15 May 2008"," Speechless, a real wasted effort.
","This film starts as a classic. Its got amazing visuals, New York empty and foreboding, and Will Smith is terrific, holding the audiences' attention on his own. His dog is also great (the best animal acting since the Nazi Monkey in Raiders). The atmosphere is tense and the social interaction between Smith and the selection of dolls and animals he has anthropomorphised is simply wonderful. The range of emotion is stunning. However when the sun sets the film turns around completely, becoming a simple action film complete with awful CG monsters. The CG is so bad you wonder why it was chosen - as special effects make up would have been effective (similar to the brilliant Descent) - and who did it, because it certainly wasn't ILM! From here on clichés are abound and the film deteriorates into mediocrity. This is made all the more disappointing by the start. A few moments bring the level back (the Shrek scene in particular) to its brilliant heights at the start but for not long enough. As the title says I was speechless after seeing this film, it really could have been one of the best films ever made, but squandered it pandering to the popular audience. I can only hope that the next time this premise is remade it FINALLY succeeds. Because of the brilliant 10* start but the appalling 1* end my score could only really be a middle 5. Watch this film, just for the potential shown at the start."
"hall895","6","1","1","1 May 2008"," Legendary this movie is not
","Once again Will Smith is called upon to save the world. Only this time there isn't much of a world left to be saved. A virus has killed off pretty much everyone on the planet. Those who didn't die mutated into soulless bloodthirsty zombies. A lucky few were immune to the virus...but it seems they've all been killed by the zombies. Not so lucky after all I guess. In a deserted New York City where deer and lions roam free during the day and the zombies rule the night one man survives. That man is of course Will Smith. Well no, actually that man is military doctor Robert Neville, played by Smith. Because if the last man alive on planet Earth was actually Will Smith that would just be silly. But I digress. Anyhow Smith, er, Neville forages for food during the day and retreats to his heavily fortified home at night lest the zombies get him. Oh, and in his spare time, he tries to find a cure for the disease. A little late now one thinks but OK. If he can find some magic potion to turn hairless, mindless bloodsucking zombies back into ordinary human beings well then color me suitably impressed. So the movie slogs along with Neville and his dog wandering around Manhattan, having a few encounters with the zombie types and then going home. And then there are a few twists and all of a sudden the movie's over. Yeah, there's not a whole lot going on here.<br/><br/>This is by no means a lousy movie but you get the sense it could have been a lot better. There are certainly some nice pieces. The shots of a deserted, overgrown Manhattan are spectacular. Smith does a highly admirable job in essentially carrying the movie all by himself. There are a few brief flashback sequences thrown in but basically the whole movie is Smith and his dog. Really, we could have used some more of those flashbacks to flesh out the story which really is bare-bones. OK, we get the general idea of what happened but it would have probably helped the film if we saw more of what went on as the planet's population was dwindling from six billion people to one Will Smith. As it is we're thrown right into the post-apocalyptic aftermath and we never really get to know enough about Smith's character. Which is kind of important considering his character is essentially the movie's only character.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film is the look of the zombies. The filmmakers went overboard with the CGI and the creatures often come off looking more silly than menacing. And with their CGI-generated superhuman speed and strength it is hard to believe that these things were once ordinary people. And how is it that all these zombies come out looking exactly alike? Last I checked human beings don't all look alike and these things were human beings remember? That's one strange virus.<br/><br/>In the end this ends up being a reasonably entertaining but somewhat disappointing movie. All too often there's just nothing going on. The one character the movie has is barely developed at all and the story is sorely lacking some background information to flesh it out. But the movie does have its moments. And you stick with it expecting that one big moment at the end but in that regard you may be left feeling a little let down. The ending confuses more than it inspires. All of a sudden the movie's over and you're left saying, ""That's it? Really?"" Yeah, that's it. Kudos to Smith for pretty much singlehandedly dragging this movie to respectability but he can't quite bring it home. At least not as powerfully as you might like. Better luck in your next effort to save the world Will."

","Good acting but that's about it. I waited until a friend of mine brought home the DVD and I wouldn't have done it any other way. I don't know anything about the I am Legend book but now I don't want to. This movie is more of a psychological thriller than an action flick. I was hoping for something along the lines of Resident Evil or maybe 28 Days Later where is much more action with the zombies and what not. I thought I'd see a lot more of that. <br/><br/>The cinematography was great in some scenes and there is some controversy surrounding the alternate ending on the DVD, but this is not the film to see if you want to see some zombie smack down (like in Resident Evil and 28 Days Later). The director of this movie could have done a little better in some of the scenes where it looked like Will Smith's character (Dr. Neville) was going to get killed. <br/><br/>One in the car after it flipped and another when he and his dog were attacked outside the building. I'm sure there are ways to show what was happening without making it look like the lead character was going to die. Also, there was a lot of jumping back and forth between scenes. <br/><br/>One second, it's Will and his wife, the next it's a bunch of people who are trying to escape, then back to Will all alone. There were several decent explosions and the alternate ending was good and had some narration in it to help you understand Dr. Neville's importance, but this is no academy winner. If it was anyone else other than Smith in the lead role, it would have been a waste of time, but it's still far from his best work."

","I Am Legend seemed like it was going to be awesome in the beginning, we open with Will Smith driving around and shooting animals for food in a deserted New York City, but the movie slowly drops in quality. There are tons of action scenes that seem to be important to the plot but they never pays off in the end. The Zombies were pretty cool but I definitely think they could have been done better; I do have to say that the action scenes with the zombies were amazing though. One part in the movie really caught my attention; Will Smith is walking through the city with his dog win he sees a mannequin in the street, he passes this occurrence off as nothing but all of the sudden the mannequin moves. This scene was freaking awesome, but it never pays off, the only thing that happens is Will Smith freaks out and shoots the mannequin up with a machine gun. The entire movie seems to be building up to something but in the end builds up to nothing. As I said before I Am Legend has some amazing special effects, the deserted New York is a modern day special effects masterpiece, but some of the CG in this movie is really questionable, like a CGI rat?! Since by the time this review comes out I Am Legend will be out on DVD I guess I will have to give you a recommendation about whether or not to go rent it or buy it or see it at all, and I guess I would say to go rent it from ITunes, or Netflix to see if you like it yourself but to me I Am Legend was a major disappointment, and only because of some stellar action scenes, I'll give it a 75 out of 100."

","Doctor/Scientist Robert Neville (Smith) in New York City is a lone survivor of an escaped man-made virus that killed most of the earth's population and turned many into mutants and he is determined to find a way to reverse the trend. He is immune to the virus. <br/><br/>This movie is one of the reasons I do not watch horror movies. I knew it wouldn't be so bad, but it did have some moments. Will Smith is a terrific actor and he provided a believable scenario of a man fighting to find a cure among the mutants who constantly watch him. His scenes with Samantha provided the levity we needed to go further into this very depressing story. I guess somewhere at some time, someone would make this kind of a movie. Yea! Let's all hear it for. When Hollywood wants to make a depressing movie it really knows how to do it. <br/><br/>Something I didn't understand. Neville has all this electronic equipment yet he has no contact with anyone outside NYC? None. One would think that they would be calling in to see how things are progressing with the cure. No contact at all so he talks to Samantha because he believes there is no one out there so he doesn't bother and doesn't' try. He believes he is alone.<br/><br/>Also, we see many dead people in the last act they will ever commit. Some are standing, some bent over. You would think the ones standing or bent over would let gravity have it's way. But, no. They are now like statues. Very spooky. <br/><br/>Oh, in flashbacks, when Samantha was a puppy, she was of a different coloring than the adult Samantha. I guess they couldn't find the right puppy. Probably thought we wouldn't notice. HA!<br/><br/>So the movie is just Neville working on a cure in his lab and escaping from the mutants from time to time until Anna (Braga) comes on the scene. However, good action scenes keep you riveted to your seat and you keep hoping this will all turn out good.<br/><br/>The CGI was okay, the stunts were good, the dialogue was good, the cinematography was excellent, but it was all too depressing to have any real entertainment value for me.<br/><br/>Violence: Yes Sex: No Nudity: No Language No"

","Found it most humorous to read in a comment how wonderful it was to find such an ""original"" movie. Anyone who thinks this is an ""original"" should check out Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man."" ""I Am Legend"" is virtually the exact same movie...even the name of the lead character is the same, and in both he drives a Ford Mustang! Oh sure, there are some minor variations, such as, in the original, Neville has no dog for companionship and the ""mutants,"" although completely insane are still capable of speaking.

I know it would be hard to tell the whole story in flashbacks, but this movie could have used it.<br/><br/>There are also some things left unexplained, such as how Neville got all that electricity (3 years after just about everybody died off, I'm sure nobody would be manning the power plants feeding the city), and how Anna & Ethan got onto Manhattan Island after all the bridges were knocked down.<br/><br/>This movie could have been so much longer and in-depth, but as it was I thought it was good & entertaining.

The story is far from the one in the book and very deceiving for those who have read it. The book is darker and The real Robert Neville is a more tormented and complex man. The movie contains some boring moments where nothing happens and no information is given to advance the storyline. I expected to ""feel"" what i read earlier on, but all i felt was that the people involved in the script kept laughing at me. Therefore, I strongly recommend reading the novel by Richard Matheson before this lousy adaptation. It is a classic in its genre.

","I haven't read the original novel or seen earlier film adaptations. I have only seen one other zombie-type film, which is 28 Days Later (which I liked). So I went into this with an open mind. <br/><br/>**SPOILERS** It started out fairly OK. Will Smith is not the best actor, but I could go along with him playing a brilliant warrior-chemist after only a minor suspension of disbelief. Next: Will clumsily hunting some CGI deer and lions (who let those out of their steel cages and how did they survive the cold?) that looked very unrealistic. Or cornfields that looked very neatly farmed. Or petrol that still seemed to work just fine. Or a bounty of electricity (though I later understood that he cleverly installed generators in his house). <br/><br/>And I'm not even at the zombie-part yet... I was ready to accept all these mistakes if the zombies or whatever they were would be good. But they weren't. They looked like something out of the pre-Lord of the Rings CGI era. Also they were supposed to be completely devoid of human intelligence and behavior, yet they managed to have a leader and trained zombiedogs? And if the virus made rats and dogs -and possibly other animals (yet not lions or deer)- go crazy, where were the packs of zombie-dogs or hordes of zombie-rats roaming the streets at night?? And why didn't Will-the-brilliant-scientist not wait a day or so longer to see if the cure had any effect on the woman? Still, that old lab in the basement of his family home came in very handy (...).<br/><br/>Also, the lady who completely unrealistically managed to survive for years with her young kid and also save Will at the very last minute from a horde of angry zombies. I had this nagging feeling she was trouble. Maybe a zombie-spy (btw I later read in a comment this was exactly what was in the original novel!)? A new variety of zombie that looked more human? She was so normal and calm, and the well-behaved kid did not look traumatized at all. And she didn't know Bob. It creeped me out. But no, she was just a nice lady with a nice kid sent by God (don't even get me started on the Compulsory Christan Theme!) to get the cure to Hobbiton (or wherever the rest of mankind was living). After Will cleverly decided that blowing himself and his precious research-lab with all the results up was a much better plan than escaping with them through that handy chimneyshaft-thingy (which was inside the zombiecage why?).... Really... <br/><br/>Waste of time and a huge missed opportunity for the writers/directors. The zombies would have looked much better if they had just used actors in make-up like in 28 Days Later (just rage and spitting blood, nothing more and they scared me big time!). So next time: maybe spend less money on lousy CGI and more on a decent writer!<br/><br/>o yes, and there's a cute dog. for obvious reasons."
"djvale","6","1","1","6 January 2008"," I Am Disappointing
","Being one of the final block buster films of 2007, ""I Am Legend"" has still managed to gross a whopping buck in the final week of the UK box office than the majority of films have done in a month. Still, with this in mind, the film was set to be huge, and give 2007 a good seeing off. Quite frankly, the best film I've seen this year, still has to be ""Hot Fuzz"", I couldn't compare Legend to Fuzz in any respect.<br/><br/>Legend tries to deliver what the Omega Man back in the 70's tried to deliver, isolation, paranoia and one mans fight for survival. In its best attempt, Legend does touch the top of tip of the ice berg on all of these attributes, it just doesn't really succeed in making you believe, even if Will Smith does give a pretty decent performance.<br/><br/>The film is basically about one person creating a cure for cancer, in which they reverse the string of the cancer disease, and thus, reversing the patients cancer string to cure them. We then get thrown into the mix 3 years down the line, to a desolate New York city, with no one but Smith and his Dog. Throughout the film, we get flashbacks of what happens to New York in its final hours before everything falls to pieces, and the supposed cure for cancer, fluctuates and reverses into a viral outbreak (Resident Evil anyone?) that turns everyone into zombie nocturnal like creatures that cannot get into direct contact with sunlight. This is pretty much what the flashbacks deliver, and do not really give us an insight of a deeper storyline and background to the film.<br/><br/>The film just doesn't seem to flow at all. Its story is limited and flawed in every way. You don't find out how the virus spread, why only a small minority of the population don't get infected, and how the virus originated. Its then just plot hole bonanza in that aspect, but we are left to figure out the story by ourselves, and thats annoying.<br/><br/>Albeit there isn't a lot of talking in the movie, Smith does do a fairly decent job of being the ""only survivor"" in NYC, but he does seem to drift off and give us some pretty bad acting in other scenes. But compare it to Tom Hanks in Castaway, and how he builds a relationship with the football ""Wilson"", I felt so much more upset when that ball got swept out to sea, than when Smith loses the things closest to him in this movie. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Above all else, this film is short. And that sucks. This film truly is a disappointment. Its decent at best don't get me wrong, but I just felt it was rushed, the ending was shockingly presented and it just didn't leave me pleased when it finished.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were quite groovy, almost Doom like - but with less cheese factor. But then after the red mist has settled, its just another disappointment for a supposed blockbuster of a movie. I just hope we can actually get a decent survival-horror-apocolyptical movie in the coming years."
"robspacey","5","1","1","6 January 2008"," I, Robot all over again...
","I felt to give this movie a fair review, i Had to split it into 2 sections. One for the film in comparison to the book and one for the movie in it's own right. I'll do the latter first.<br/><br/>The essential post-apocalyptic ingredients are certainly here: Will Smith playing our protagonist against a backdrop of a 'dead' new york, his survival against the world he lives in and then the antagonist, in this case, the infected.<br/><br/>Good points: Acting: Will Smith CAN act. He's proved it time and again that when it comes to big action movies with a serious edge, he's the man for the job. In I Am legend he pulls another good performance.<br/><br/>Storyline: For all purposes, the film runs along nicely. I never felt bored and there were a few scenes which showed this film was slightly above your average Hollywood release.<br/><br/>Bad Points: CGI: When will they learn that CGI is NEVER good. This film would have worked so much better if the infected where left more to the imagination and not rendered into a mummy-computer game crossover. This totally destroyed the atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>Ending: I feel the ending is the perfect point to bring in the book comparison. Cut short, this film suffered due to it's not following of the book. The ending for me didn't work as it felt too rushed and completely went against the the rest of the movie. And anyway, who keeps a hand grenade in a drawer?<br/><br/>Okay, now i've saved the book comparison as for me, this is where Hollywood rubs me the wrong way. They did it with I, Robot and they did it with this. The book centers around Robert Neville going round killing vampires, who, unknown to him, have formed a new society. In this society HE is the monster killing THEM. Therefore HE is a myth, a folk tale, A LEGEND. THAT is the point of the whole story. This film completely cut that whole storyline and for me, rendered the film totally pointless. <br/><br/>It just seems Hollywood can't bring themselves to think of people as intelligent and maybe capable of reading something further into a movie than guns and explosions."
"nielsmeyer","5","1","1","6 January 2008"," 28 Days Later
","Completely agreed that the movie is good - but where is the big difference to ""28 days later""? Living in Europe, you just cannot rid yourself of the impression that at least a lot of US-movies recycle the ideas of previously successful international movies. I am always again amazed at how many times I think after a US-made film: ""Well, that was nice. But I've seen the movie five years ago already, only then it was Spanish/German/British/Danish/French..."" Nevertheless, if that is the only way to get fresh ideas across the Atlantic, I guess we will have to live with this. I am excited to see what America will turn the 1997 European cult shocker ""Funny Games"" by Michael Haneke into. I just read the other day that it was being re-filmed. So here we go, ""Three men and a baby"", ""Vanilla Sky"",... all over again."
"yevonwm","5","1","1","5 January 2008"," Severely lacking
","This movie appears to be a mish mash of several other movies, introducing nothing new at all. The plot is your bog standard 28 days / resident evil zombie plot with just enough changed to avoid litigation. The angle of the plot is completely on will smiths character with everyone and thing else just being an add on. Its clearly packaged as a surreal action film but is screenplayed as the emotional journey of the protagonist. After 30 minutes you clock that you've been conned, but the first 30 minutes are quite good. The middle 30 minutes are completely spoilt as you've been hyped for action that plays as sloppy emotion and the ending is pure emotion. Your left with nothing to do but critique the CGI and try to explain the enormous continuation and plot holes.<br/><br/>If you just want to scare the crap out of yourself for 90 minutes - go for it but you'll end up unsatisfied no matter what you're looking for from this film."
"CagedinSanity","6","1","1","5 January 2008"," 7.4/10 is inaccurate.
","As my summary states, 7/10 might be pushing it. I had quite a few problems with this movie.<br/><br/>1) Overpriced, but that's not entirely the movie's fault. Mostly my own problem, as I could have spent my 5$ for ticket and 15$ on food on something entirely different than this. My bad.<br/><br/>2) The acting was fine. Really, it wasn't too far fetched or anything. But that's really the only thing that saved this movie from being a 4/10 for me.<br/><br/>3) And now to my main problem, was the story itself. There were entirely too many irrelevant(Sp?) scenes that didn't need to be included while the actual ""background"" of the 94% population dieing off was explained in unorganized flashbacks. Instead of shoving 30 minutes of ""filler-up"" scenes watching Will Smith's character stalk, walk, and jump through the barren streets of Manhatten (or NYC itself? I got confused), more relevancy to the story could have been plugged in.<br/><br/>4) The ""horror"" of this movie was pathetically achieved with the ""quiet.... quiet... BOO!"" horror style that should have died off years ago.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is the movie was dragged too much. A lot of it just pointless, they could have added more to the movie. Hell, make it longer if that's what it takes.<br/><br/>Waste of money, buy it on discount. Worth a watch but not in theaters."

","I Am Legend is a nice Hollywood-type movie. In fact, i liked it more i thought i would. But unfortunately for me, just a week before, i saw another movie, called ""28 Days Later"", a movie made in 2005 i believe. And in ""28 Days Later"", i found the following: - The human race is all but wiped out by a deadly man-made virus. This is also the case with Legend. So, checked! - The remaining handful of humans are surrounded by dark-loving zombies. Checked! - The zombies are imaginatively called ""The Infected"". Checked! - The action takes place in a completely deserted London - cars left in the middle of the street, shops opened for business, apocalyptic 'salvation' flyers all-around. Checked (New York, the same)! - The survivors hear an AM radio transmission that leads to other humans. Checked! - The moment the surviving humans meet is the moment when their routine 'hide from zombies, be safe' ends and apocalyptic events are triggered. Checked! - The humans believe they are all that has survived, but are proved wrong. Checked! - Hope of life returning to 'normal' is highlighted towards the end. Checked! And the list goes on..<br/><br/>If i hadn't seen 28 Days Later, Legend would have gotten an 8.0. This way, it gets a 6.0, and only because of the cute dog is portrays!"
"morrison-molly","5","1","1","3 January 2008"," ""It was okay, I guess""
","I had no idea what I was in for when I stepped into the movie theater to watch ""I am Legend."" This was actually a really good thing as I had no expectations, because had I had them I would have ultimately been disappointed. The most that I could say for this movie at it's conclusion when asked how it was, was simply ""it was okay. I guess."" Here was a movie with a huge budget a big name. I think that I even enjoyed the first half of the movie, until I thought about what I was watching. Here was Will Smith driving a red sport car, apparently hunting a herd of deer through the abandoned streets New York City. Cool? Yeah. But what were deer, and eventually lions, doing in the middle of New York? Are we supposed to believe that they had escaped from the Central Park Zoo? Are we supposed to believe that these deer and lions had somehow figured out some way to survive zombie attacks that all of the millions of humans on the island had simply ignored (save Will Smith's character, of course)? After this hunt scene, the movie started its steady slide downhill. I'm glad that the makers showed a little of Smith's character's life alone in the city, but there was something strange about it, he seemed too calm and comfortable, which I know that most people, even after three years, would have trouble achieving when there were blood-thirsty zombies leering from all the shadows. However, that was the most believable part of the movie so I won't bash on it anymore.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie, without a doubt, was the poor quality of the zombie-diseased human-creatures. The digital characters were poorly rendered, they were hardly above video-game quality. There was nothing that these super fast, super strong creatures had that couldn't be created by a good hair/makeup team, and this would at least make them seem like they might exist in reality. Also, two zombies actually ran headfirst into Smith's car and completely tipped it over at one point in the movie, moving them from poorly generated computer images to super strong/fast zombies that were vaguely reminiscent of the robots from ""I, Robot."" Despite these problems in the first half of the movie, I was still hanging on to some sort of hope that they would be compensated for. Like the fact that the zombies were getting smarter, they had a leader now and they had even laid a rather clever trap for Smith at one point. I thought that there would be some sort of clever explanation for that, but of course it was not only never explained but never even dealt with. Then I thought, maybe the back story with Smith's character might prove to be interesting, but alas, besides a few flashbacks to his family's death, it did not explain much even though it kept hinting at an interesting story as to why Smith's character was so committed to fixing this zombie problem.<br/><br/>Overall, I found a lot of disappointment in this movie. I like Will Smith. I like the disease-ridden city stories. I don't even mind a few zombies getting shot at every now and then. I loved Sam the dog! The makers of this film had so much to work with, like a big budget, big leading actor, and a character with a past, but like so many movies coming out these days, threw it all away in favor of a thrill scene like Will Smith deer hunting in his fancy car that made little to no sense. If you want a movie that deals with world-consuming disease, go with ""28 Days Later,"" which handles all the material of ""I am Legend"" but in a more sensible manner, and in my opinion, the zombies are scarier."
"shockeres","6","1","1","3 January 2008"," Pretty good let down
","With what I'm going to say most of you will line me up against a wall and shoot me, but the film let me down, it's been some time since I've left the cinema wishing I had gone to see any other film. I had been waiting for ages to see this film and finally got the chance to have some time on my own and get cozy in my seat at sit back and enjoy it, I love vampire movies and have great respect for Mr Smith. It started of great, the sensation of the empty NYC was great, the nothingness that accompanied the survivor and his dog was terrifying, the story line incredible and the FX pretty good, but that was it, I had a feeling that I was watching a mixture of movies all joined in one, the base line to ""28 days"", ""the Reapers"" from ""Blade 2"", the Alpha Male screamed just like the ""High Pries Imhotep"" from ""The Mummy"" before taking his human form, and a long line of etc's. It was entertaining but by no means stood up to what I was expecting. I was pleased that it wasn't the typical vampire blaster movie, just blood and guts...but I think they over did the humanity message. During most of the film Will Smith was sublime, as always, I must admit he is one of my favorite actors, he saved the movie, it's thanks to him that I've given it a 6/10. One last comment, do all scientific investigators have hand grenades in the draws??"
"martinbarrett63","6","1","1","2 January 2008"," Ultimately Disappointing
","The original novel is interesting, but for me it served primarily as the inspiration of 1971's ""The Omega Man"". This is an excellent film - one of my all time favourites - but I have always been convinced that a longer and far superior version was sacrificed to make it short enough to be shown in ""double-feature"" presentations.<br/><br/>I looked forward eagerly to ""I Am Legend"", in the hope that the earlier film's shortcomings would be overcome, and the cinematic potential of the story realised.<br/><br/>I do like ""I Am Legend"". Will Smith is very good at this sort of role, and he didn't disappoint. Unfortunately it seems that once again a much longer and much better movie has ended up on the cutting room floor, with the theatrical presentation only a shadow of what it might have been.<br/><br/>Another problem I had is with the CGI zombies. In ""Beowulf"", the CGI animation works because everything is in the same format - after a few minutes the brain accepts what is on the screen as a uniform reality and settles down to enjoy the action. In films which mix CGI with live action, the brain is constantly reminded of the unreality where the two meet. This reduced the poor plague victims in ""I Am Legend"" to little more than well-rendered cartoons, and they were at their most interesting and frightening only when seen in glimpses.<br/><br/>It's well worth the admission, but I left disappointed that once again this story has not been brought properly to the screen. Perhaps the director will take the opportunity of a DVD issue to give us the film this should have been."
"public-two","6","1","1","30 December 2007"," No depth
","As someone old enough to have seen the original version of this movie (Omega Man) I was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>The special effects were allowed to overcome the plot and the story, but this has become the norm for Hollywood. The computer generated dogs and even the human mutants were styled more along the line of non-humans and even had a somewhat alien essence to them. They were portrayed more as monsters rather than as human victims.<br/><br/>There was glimpse of what would have been a interesting relationship between Will Smiths character and the mutant leader, but just as it was starting to develop the movie abandoned it.<br/><br/>The relationship between Dr. Neville and the woman and boy he meet is also never developed, or even real. He meets the first non-mutant people for the first time in three years, and yet he's casual and even aloof. He basically treats them like you do the clerk at 7-11. The relationship between Will Smith and this woman does start to develop later on, but once again the movie departs from it for more computer generated battle scenes.<br/><br/>I did like Will Smiths portrayal. I now have a new found respect for him as an actor, and he reveals a depth and a new level of his abilities. If it wasn't for his skills this movie wouldn't even be worth renting, but because of him it is worth seeing."

It's painfully obvious every single time an animal or humanoid is computer generated. The sets ARE astounding tho.<br/><br/>As for the storyline... it's interesting and goes strong for most of the movie, and then suddenly turns to manure. the ending is an abominable splicing of the finale for a michael bay movie and one of M Night Shymalan's putrid plot lines.

","Not much to say about 'I am Legend'. A decent film that somehow combined '28 Days Later' with 'Cast Away' and it worked, for the most part.<br/><br/>My problem with the film, and many will lash out at me over this, was Will Smith playing the same character he played in 'I, Robot' and 'Independence Day'. There wasn't much room in the film for him to develop a character of his own, so what was left was a bland hero that we're expected to cheer for without truly knowing anything about him.<br/><br/>Great effects, eerie settings and an excellent score helped move the story along, but I felt that there were many things that could have been done that were simply glossed over or left to the viewers imagination. (The mutants sensitivity to sunlight, the apparent abundance of electricity/fuel etc)<br/><br/>For example, driving in New York City is virtually impossible *without* a quarantine, dangerous wildlife and a race of mutated zombies plaguing the streets, yet we see driving multiple times in the movie without much problem.<br/><br/>If you want to see an epic film that challenges your intellect, this isn't the one for you.

","It's a very interesting idea for a story--something worth putting thought into. However, perhaps more thought should have been spent. Theatrically, this was a decent movie. We all know that Will Smith can act. The sets were pretty sweet. These elements mean nothing, unfortunately, if the story which they attempt to tell is littered with holes and problems. For instance, a lack of exposition and character development made it impossible to sympathize with any of the characters. If the theme of the story truly was about God's place in tragedies such as that described in the movie, then the writers absolutely failed to deliver the most important part of the story.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: Kudos for coming up with a good idea, but I'm sorry that it really didn't work out."

","Sorry, but no. This was an entertaining way to spend a few hours but doesn't leave a lasting impression. The film creates little that is new and obviously borrows heavily from films such as 28 Days, Castaway and 28 Weeks. <br/><br/>The acting was good, the character drew you into to understanding someone's desperate turmoil, but it would then be thrown back at you with a blast of completely unrealistic Hollywood craziness. The last 10 minutes were just a bit vacant, and it seemed like 'I am Legend' got cut short as an after though. In a nutshell, the kids will enjoy it, but it didn't really stimulate at all."
"beefedupmonster","6","1","1","27 December 2007"," Very Disappointing.
","Some good moments but on the whole Hollywoods this carbon copy of 28 days later proved a inadequate, over elaborate and unrealistic take on the doomsday scenario. Far to much CGI with the infected syringed away the realism that the picture needed to prove credible. The production was to closely related to its basis 28 days later, offering little more than a thin New Yorkian veneer. The classic Hollywood plot blueprint was clichey thus predictable. Will smith proved a rare highlight of the film performing well especially in tandem with his canine companion. Also the personal juxtaposition with the family and the global event that was unfolding induced a intriguing sense of empathy. However these positive aspects did little for the movie and like a said a big disappointment."
"fwomp","6","1","1","27 December 2007"," Will The Remakes Ever Cease?
","Oh look, another remake. Wow. Woop. What fun.<br/><br/>Do I sound overly cynical? Maybe I am. But can't we see a few more original films on the big screen rather than mulling over the same ones year after year? Is that asking too much? Perhaps it is.<br/><br/>The post-apocalyptic science fiction genre has been done to death (THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, NIGHT OF THE COMET, DAWN OF THE DEAD, 28 DAYS LATER, OUTBREAK, THE QUIET EARTH). And here in I AM LEGEND, we get a remake of the Charlton Heston film THE OMEGA MAN. Growing up, I loved The Omega Man. I often wondered what it'd be like to be the last man on Earth; at least the last ""normal"" man on Earth. The genre wasn't yet tired in 1971 and I wasn't even into my teens. But since then not-just-a-small-number of similar cinematic films have come out, bombarding movie watchers with the same ol' theme over and over and over again (see my partial list above).<br/><br/>Will Smith (THE PURSUIT OF Happiness) takes on the lead role as Dr. Robert Neville, the seemingly sole survivor of a plague that has wiped out 99% of humanity, turning the remaining 1% into cannibalistic zombie-vampires who burn up if exposed to sunlight; they roam New York's desolate streets at night in search of fresh meat. A cure for cancer has sparked a new virus that started humanity's die-off, and these scenes are given frequent flashbacks during the movie. We also get to see Dr. Neville's responsibility for trying to find a cure via the military (whom he works for before everyone keels over).<br/><br/>With Dr. Neville is a trusty sidekick named Sam, a German Shepherd with acute senses. His canine abilities extend to detecting vampire-zombies, and to helping Neville battle the complete aloneness that rattles around his psyche. This is undoubtedly one of the strongest elements of the film. Watching Dr. Neville walk into a video rental store and speak to the mannequins he has set up is an honest portrayal that would hit any human who had only a dog to speak with.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!! When Sam-the-Dog dies (or rather when Dr. Neville is forced to kill him), it is a blow too deep and the good doctor goes out to meet up and kill as many of the nightstalkers as he can before they kill him. That's when he meets up with two young people (an older sister and younger brother) who save Neville from himself and tell him of a fantasy safe zone somewhere in the hills of Vermont. Neville has to decide what to believe in as the monsters close in on his home and threaten not only himself, but his two new god-fearing humans. The ending is pretty weak but set up nicely in a visual way.<br/><br/>END SPOILER ALERT!!! Having hoisted such terrible news as ""unoriginal"" on I Am Legend, one cannot deny two key elements that make this film a positive experience. First is the extremely creepy feeling one gets when looking at a vacant New York City. The weeds growing up from cracks in the pavement. Wild deer migrating through empty car-riddled streets. Everywhere there's a vision of what once was human inhabitation and is now just a rotting shell. That was a painfully great set of scenes. Secondly is Will Smith. Similar to Tom Hanks' CASTAWAY, Smith carries the entire film and does so with effortless precision. The losses he experiences are tremendous, and Smith pulls us in and forces us to feel the pain of one man left alone for far too long. This is most evident when dealing with Sam-the-Dog and his encounters with a pretty mannequin that he starts to humanize in his mind.<br/><br/>Some might be able to wiggle past this film's unoriginality factor, and if they can, I applaud them. They probably enjoyed the movie (minus the ending) much better than I was able. But if you're like me, and desire something fresh in the cinema, you'll probably have similar feelings."

IAL's just not *that* special.<br/><br/>Last ten minutes are bad, as much as is a *way* too short running time of the whole movie. Maybe we should wait for a DC, without producers cutting corners all over the place. The ending is so wrong because it hastens things beyond acceptable. Watching IAL is a slow and intimate process. Yet the last minutes break the whole charm. Not because of *how* things came up to be, but because how ridiculously *fast* they did.<br/><br/>And then there goes the sub-par CGI. Why would they involve a CGI close-up human like monsters in such a movie is beyond me. ""28 days/months later's"" human actors were thousand times more scary and authentic. As of now, no computer generated image beats an acted flesh-craving look.<br/><br/>I give a big nine to W.Smith though. He does a *splendid* delivery. His day-to-day life in a deserted NYC are peak points that along with some flash backs are the best you can get from this production. It really breaks my heart to see this movie end at least 30 minutes early."

First of all the acting was pretty good, Will Smith did a great job (But I gotta say the dog was better). When I watched the previews I did not know what to expect from this film, was it a suspense film, horror, science fiction? The film revolves around a military scientist, who just so happens to be the only living immune person in it in all of New York City. He tries to live a normal life, renting films, talking to statues he set up, and his most important thing is his dog. He is working on a cure for this mutated virus in his basement.<br/><br/>There is something lurking in the shadows, this virus has created zombie-vampires. They cannot go into sun or their flesh will melt (Anyone seen Buffy lately?) There jaws are able to open very wide to consume flesh. And the virus is transmitted by blood.<br/><br/>Some people find him and he has a hard time with communication. Yeah that is the movie. I expected a little more.

If you're looking for any sort of the artistry that is required to make a good movie, The Mist is playing in the theater right across the hall.<br/><br/>One of the worst movies of 2007."
"baba44713","4","6","15","19 January 2008"," Could they have made it even more cliché?
","The answer is no, no they couldn't.<br/><br/>Hollywood once again churns out a same old ""zombie"" flick, only this time you don't see a group of survivors vs the undead, you see one sole survivor, Will Smith. And his dog. Oh, and the zombies aren't really zombies, they are ex-humans infected with some sort of good virus turned very very bad. Or, to be more precise, they are actually CGI creatures resembling albino extras from Beowulf who do a pretty good velociraptor imitation.<br/><br/>Will Smith is somehow immune. Also, he isn't really your average Joe, he is some sort of ex-army microbiology genius. Handy, that. He desperately wants to find a cure for this virus, which is all nice and humane but ultimately doesn't make a lot of sense, since at one point it's said that 90% of the world population is already wiped out, and only 9% turned infected - and to be frank, the infected ones seem to enjoy being infected quite a bit.<br/><br/>After the - admittedly - nice setup, with all the scenes of decaying New York, grass growing through the pavement and herds of deer running through streets (with Smith hunting them in a flashy red sports car) the movie starts piling up one cliché after another. Let me give you an example - early on, Smith says into the camera that ""canine are immune to the airborne virus but are susceptible to infection via direct contact"". Note to director - foreshadowing is supposed to at least try to be subtle.<br/><br/>So, soon after we learn about the messy situation the world got himself into and get to meet poor old Will Smith who puts mannequins all over town and is slowly but surely beginning to lose his marbles, the movie switches gears and starts rehashing good old scary-creatures-jump-out-of-darkness shtick. Halway through the movie the plot seems to take a clever and interesting turn, but sadly the story all but ignores this bit and settles back to the routine.<br/><br/>I will not say anything more to avoid spoilers, but suffice to say that you can freely leave the theater after Shrek shows up. Because, hey, you already know how things will end - you've seen it at least a thousand times before.<br/><br/>4/10, but only because Will Smith does a pretty good performance. Oh, and the dog is cute, too."
"dean2900","4","6","15","21 December 2007"," Not very original CGI fest
","I am Legend has a great premise and could be a great movie. However this movie is really nothing more than an excuse for the studios to use as much computer generated animation as possible. The opening scene looks pretty good to see a desolate NYC but once the CGI creatures are introduced then it is nothing more than eye candy.<br/><br/>Will Smith was OK in this movie. I do think he could have been very good with a much better script. His dog Sam was probably the most intriguing character of this movie.<br/><br/>The biggest problem outside of the CGI fest is that the story was too short. It felt like there was a 2.5 hour story to be told that was rushed into 1.5 hours. There are flashbacks which explain part of the story but not enough depth at all. There are moments in the movie which I wont spoil with the detail that makes little sense.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to skip this one and see either The Omega Man, The Last Man on Earth, or the wonderful ""Quiet Earth"" which is probably of the best of the Last Man on Earth movies."
"ninjette515","3","15","50","19 December 2007"," In one word....LAME.
","We all know that ""I am Legend"" is based on a GREAT story. And for those of you who have read the book especially know that. We call all thank that book for spawning a horde of 'last man on earth' movies. However, some of these movies aren't up to par.<br/><br/>""I am Legend"" is one of them.<br/><br/>I guess I first new that this movie wouldn't be my cup of tea when I went to the theater and saw a bunch of 10-year-olds in line. So I looked at my ticket and realized it was rated PG-13. ""Crap,"" I thought. But I kept an open mind anyway as my friend and I took our seats. But by the time the movie ended, my throat hurt from scoffing so much. <br/><br/>The two major problems: 1. Will Smith- Don't get me wrong, I think Smith is a fine actor and can do touching roles, be funny, and yadda yadda yadda. But he was about as believable in this movie as rabies-ridden unicorns taking over the world. Totally flat performance. By the end, I didn't even care if he lived or died. I just wanted to get the movie over with. 2. The ""monsters"" - Can you even really call them monsters? They were not even a wee bit scary. They just looked like balding anorexics. And I'm sorry...full out CG totally makes everything unbelievable. It's like being afraid of a video game character. IT'S NOT REAL AND WE CAN ALL TELL. ""Oh look, a computerized dirty starving man! I'm so scared!!"" Pfft. I was shocked by the degree of lame this movie achieved.<br/><br/>And for the record, I do think ""The Omega Man"", ""28 Days/Weeks Later"", and Romero's ""Dawn/Day of the Dead"" were all better 'last people on Earth' movies."

","I Am Legend is a great film. This is better than I thought it would've been. The beginning was kind of slow, but things sped up as the movie progressed. The story of this film is about a deadly, highly-infectious virus that wiped out most of New York City and perhaps the world. The only survivor in NYC, played brilliantly by Will Smith, is the virologist Robert Neville. He must find a cure with his immune blood to help the infected zombie-like creatures while avoiding them. The acting mostly by Will Smith is excellent. He did a great job playing a lone figure. The zombies were hideous looking and scary, but they could've done better with them. The scenery especially the abandoned NYC is spectacular. I don't know how they did the NYC scenes without any people. Overall this is a great film, but a bit scary for younger children. I rate this film a 10/10."

It was gut wrenching to see him lose his best friend Sam and the way he choose to end her pain. That scene had me choking...<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>I didn't care much for the ending though. For those expecting to see a resident evil type movie, don't watch this.

","I was worried when I saw the previews for this movie. That isn't to say I didn't think the movie looked to be awesome, but I was worried about a one man script. Would Will Smith be able to handle being almost the only character for most of the movie? Would he deliver solo lines convincingly without another actor to play off of? YES!!! He completely exceeded my expectations like I wouldn't have imagined. He portrayed multiple emotions in one go with no trouble at all, putting this performance up there with the likes of Tom Hanks in Castaway. His one real relationship in the movie with his dog, Sam, was touching. He managed to portray a possibly cheesy aspect of this film with real heart. He treated Sam as an actress, not an animal, which made all the difference. Amazing job!"

","When I had first heard about I am Legend I had mixed feelings about it. We've all seen a post-apocalyptic world before, and to me everyone being transformed into nocturnal, cannibalistic beasts by an airborne virus made me think about zombie vampires, but Will Smith always does a good job so I was interested in seeing him in action on this one. <br/><br/>So I decide to go see this movie on Friday not expecting too much more than a pop-corn flick with some Will Smith Character development who fights off vampire Zombies with a sweet rifle and his canine pal. I got more than that, much more surprisingly. Besides the actual special effects, the movie looks very good with It's crystal clear picture and the action sequences are great. The Infected look CGI but they really show their transformed humanoid state as they scurry across the city and in the dark. You can really see why Smith's character wants to desperately fix what he in inadvertently caused. Which brings me to my next part of my review. <br/><br/>Will Smith is the only real character in the entire movie, and he pulls it off. Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, Will Smith really makes you feel like he is completely isolated and alone. He does however have his Canine pal which gives him some sanity. Smith's character explores the city during the day for food, and just plain fun. During this time we see the empty and desolate state of New York, and it's effectively eerie. Which gives this movie it's Psychological aspect of constantly being alone. Then Night time falls and Smith's character is visited at his home by some of his infected neighbors. Which gives the movie it's creature aspect respectfully. <br/><br/>Although not the best movie out there, this will be a movie I'll purchase due to it's creative approach and brilliantly acted single lead role. <br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","It seems that nowadays, every time I go see a movie I end up leaving saying ""Geez, I just wasted money and time I will never get back."" This time, I left in a decently satisfied mood. Will Smith delivers a terrific performance as Dr. Robert Neville, the last man on Earth. Whenever I see a zombie movie trailer I have the assumption that it is just widespread chaos, fires, bodies, destruction, all of that sort. Not this time. It is good to take a somewhat realistic but far-fetched approach to a zombie-survival movie with a great plot line built into it. New York in the near future empty looks phenomenal. The only flaws I can really point out are that the action sequences were short and few, but ultimately satisfying. Be prepared to jump out of your seat and leave feeling good because this is a holiday movie that you must see."

","This movie takes Richard Matheson's Book ""I Am Legend"" and adds in the missing pieces to make it a complete story. The acting, visuals, and sound bring everything together to make this a truly immersive experience that will leave you on the edge of your seat (and occasionally jumping off of it).<br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone however. It may leave you with feelings that you are not comfortable with, especially during the Christmas holidays when there is a risk of depression for some people.<br/><br/>I must also admit that while I found Matheson's short story interesting, there was just something missing from it that kept it from being complete.

","In much the same way that Tom Hanks had to carry the movie ""Cast Away"", Will had to do the same with this movie. In so doing, Will showed me that he has really grown as an actor over the years. That was great to see, and I believe it will open even more doors for him moving forward.<br/><br/>Equally as wonderful was to see a VERY different zombie movie. Honestly, this movie is more about themes like the human spirit, redemption, deep loneliness, dealing with regret/loss and a surprising theme that I will leave unnamed as not to spoil it for folks. The zombie part is actually secondary, though well done and prominent throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I had the same reaction to this movie as I did to ""The Mist"". Both are movies with familiar backdrops that we've seen a million times. However, they explore and expose a totally different element of the story. That makes them unique, and Will Smith makes this entertaining, engaging and exciting. Very well done. One of my most enjoyable movie experiences of the year. Total surprise.

"TheLittleSongbird","5","3","6","1 April 2011"," I am not so legendary
","By all means, I Am Legend is not a terrible movie, but it is a movie that could have been much better. The concept is absolutely great(coming from someone who has very little knowledge about the book), and the film does start off brilliantly with plenty of emotional impact and a convincing enough chemistry between Will Smith and the dog, who is very cute and believable. The film does look great too, the scenery and photography are excellent and apart from the odd dodgy CGI the special effects are pretty good also. There is also an intense and brooding soundtrack, decent direction and a brilliant, charismatic lead performance from Will Smith.<br/><br/>However, where I Am Legend isn't so successful is that under this surface it has its heart in the right place, but there are moments in the second half of the film on the surface that comes across as hollow. Speaking of the second half, this is where the film does fall down in an attempt to be too ambitious, and in the process situations are underdeveloped and characters fall into cliché territory and you don't feel enough for them emotionally. The film feels overlong, with the ending taking longer to evolve than it ought to have done and the pace in an attempt to explain everything becomes very sluggish. And there is a problem with the explanations, some of it does feel under-cooked. The script is also uneven, in the first half it was poignant and credible, but like the characters it becomes increasingly clichéd.<br/><br/>Overall, worth watching but I couldn't help thinking it could have been more. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

How about if there was nobody else on this planet and I could do anything, eat all the candies, drive all the cars .. Great!

At times i got a feeling that the director set up lots of scenes in a beautiful way, just to settle for something pretty ordinary at the end of it. Nothing out of ordinary in the film to keeps you involved. Climax is too obvious to thrill - in fact you would probably not realize that the movie got over until you see the movie credits on the screen... Ya, if there is one good thing that made me feel ""how did the director do that"" its the way in which New york city has been shown as a totally deserted place - it looked very real too...

","""I am Legend"" takes chauvinism to a new level, and without the slightest touch of irony too. The usual patriotic stereotype of the great nation is inflated to biblical proportions: fill the earth and subdue it. Trouble is being fruitful has become a little tricky with 99% of the species eradicated by a man-made virus. One man (Will Smith) and man's best friend, the German shepherd, are left to hold the fort. The acting is ridiculous; I won't even begin to imagine what Brazilian actress Alice Braga must have done to get the part of Anna. Her pronunciation is so off she's hard to understand even with subtitles. If there still is justice in Hollywood, her first part in an English-language production will also be her last. To be honest, I'm pessimistic. Penelope Cruz can't even say ""hello"" in English and got cast by Cameron Crowe, Rob Marshall, and Bob Dylan. The movie's only asset is the depopulated metropolis itself, reclaimed by vegetation and wildlife. I am particularly envious of Dr. Neville's open-air desk on the South Pier with its front-row view of the ancient kingdom of Brooklyn, New York."
"marie-lowe","3","3","6","14 January 2008"," It had so much potential
","I first heard about this film when Will Smith was on TV doing an interview about it. He talked briefly about the plot and the book it was based upon... and I was so excited to see this film as it sounded amazing.<br/><br/>Upon now seeing the film, I am quite disappointed with how the how thing was handled. I have read the book, and I believe the film would have been a whole lot better it it stuck a bit more closely to what happens in the book. Little changes for example- he is a scientist from the beginning, and he has a dog from the beginning doesn't matter. What I am more concerned about is the 'Vampires'. I would have much preferred they had used real 'human' actors in makeup, rather than graphics (which is what it looks like very obviously) and maybe kept the lion scene out of the movie, because they looked like stuffed toys. The beginning of the movie was great, up until the dog ran into the dark area, and Neville came across the monsters all huddled together. The minute I saw their fakeness I was let down considerably.<br/><br/>One movie that I really like which I believe may be a bit similar is 28 Days Later. Although the infected aren't vampires, they aren't zombies.. they are infected with a disease. I enjoyed the fact that the majority of the scenes in 28 days later where (what seems like) the last man on earth is wandering real areas of London, and no one is around. This scenery was not computer generated, from what I have read, Times Square in I am Legend was 100% computer generated. The fact that the areas in London which were filmed, even though some were short clips of emptiness when the roads were closed off for a couple of minutes, it was real. It makes me appreciate the films more.<br/><br/>28 Days later also uses real people for the 'infected'- unlike I am Legend, which are computer generated. They did originally use actors, but decided to create computer generated ones instead. One of the excuses was that they didn't act well in bare feet at night, and they couldn't hyperventilate for long periods of time... To be honest, the infected weren't in long enough shots for me to notice that they were hyperventilating... and I'm sure they could have worn flesh coloured shoes... hey, they digitally made times square, I'm sure they can digitally take away shoes.<br/><br/>What it seems to me, the only not digital thing in the film is Will Smith.<br/><br/>To be honest, I think it could have been made so much more better, even though they film is getting good ratings, I am personally not happy with it at all."

Of course he's going to find a cure, find some survivors and help repopulate the planet. The only other endings could've been for him to end where he begun, as the only man on earth, thus no plot progression and a possible suicide. This was obviously not going to happen in a Hollywood crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>And what's with all the grass etc growing through concrete.

","Will Smith does not disappoint as the last man on earth, Robert Neville, in the incredible third film adaptation of the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend.<br/><br/>Smith sticks to his winning formula of choosing blockbusters that hinge on impressive special effects, which serve as the perfect backdrop to his always well-received performances. Smith has a rare quality of being so likable he can sustain audience interest even when he is alone for most of the movie (the gratuitous shot of him doing chin-ups is a nice bonus). His earnest delivery of both thrills and laughs makes him v. special.<br/><br/>This commitment is shared by his very able co-star Abby, who simply must win best supporting actress. She plays Sam, Neville's German Shepherd and companion. Her eyes are very expressive for a non-mutt (purebreds' faces usually fail to have character), and she holds her own against a star like Smith (haha).<br/><br/>The part where Neville loses Sam in a darkened building had a Blair Witch-feel, and you can't help but be as paranoid and always on the look out as Neville each time something out of the ordinary happens. Lots of other interesting details also appear in the eerie city that are worth pointing out as you vicariously accompany Neville in the lonely, future Manhattan .<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a rare treat, so enjoy it; you will surely get emotionally tangled with the highs and lows of this action-suspense-sci-fi thriller."
"achilles-22","1","3","6","9 January 2008"," Disaster
","I really think that IMDb should introduce possibility of negative grades, because this one certainly deserves -10. This is only the second movie in my life that made me think ""What a waste of 1.5 hours of my life""... Up till now, I thought that nothing can be worse than Zemeckis' ""Contact"", but I was wrong. For me, this is singularly the worst attempt of filming an excellent novel ever. Absolutely nothing in this movie is done right. I don't understand the need of American film-makers to tarnish excellent books with their distortions and deviations, which is especially true for this film.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Will Smith was wrong choice for the part of Robert Neville. There is not a moment in the film in which I see Robert, not Will. I don't say he was abysmal, but he wasn't stellar either. Simply, he fails to deliver convincing character. <br/><br/>Story... What to say about this? I am convinced that screenwriters didn't even read the book. Instead of it, they just read summary digested in 3 sentences, because they wrote something that is so distant from the original story that I read one thing and watched something completely other. I won't go into details, it sufficient to say that there is no scene in the film that corresponds to the original storyline. For example: in film, doctor Robert Neville constantly repeats ""I can fix this!"" As if the plague that killed 90% of humanity is the broken bicycle that can be fixed. Also, he is the world's only hope of finding the cure, but this is cliché that can be seen in every Hollywood film of this type: Americans will save the day and bring hope to the humanity... Yeah, right. Real Robert Neville is in fact just an ordinary guy without Ph.D. trying to survive in the world that ceased to be normal"". He is alone, and the loneliness is something that was almost tangible in the book. Robert goes out in the day and kills infected that are in slumber. He becomes source of terror for the infected because he kills them in their sleep, their bogeyman"". Real vampires/zombies are intelligent beings that are building new kind of society, not mindless bloodthirsty creatures depicted in the movie. The woman by the name of Ruth (without the child) that came to him was not human immune to the plague looking for the enclave of health individuals, but a spy sent by vampires to infiltrate his house and eventually betray him. Also, the dog. The dog was much more important for Neville than we are allowed to see in the film. In the book, Neville was alone for long before the dog appeared near him. He had to lure this stray dog with the food for days just to have any kind of companion. He was heartbroken after dog died, because he developed relationship with that dog and now he was alone AGAIN.... It would take to much time to list everything, so I will stop here.<br/><br/>But what bothered me the most is completely missed idea. It's not about heroic struggle of one man to find the cure, but about vanishing of one society and system of values that is being replaced by another, in which Robert and the rest of normal"" people can't exist. Screenwriters don't understand why the name of the book is I am legend"". No, not because Neville became legend because he invented the cure for the plague and made restoration of the humanity possible. I am legend"" stands for something that Protosevich and Goldsman were not able to comprehend. Before his execution, Robert Neville understood that he represents anomaly in the world of vampires, who consider him to be the monster. As they are preparing the stage for his execution, he knows that he will become something from the past, something that will exist only in myths and stories for spooking disobedient children  he will exist as a legend. That's why the last sentence in the book uttered by Neville is I am legend"". Let me quote this part: Then sudden silence, as though a heavy blanket had fallen over their heads. They all stood looking up at him with their white faces. He stared back. And suddenly he thought, I'm the abnormal one now. Normalcy was a majority concept, the standard of many and not the standard of just one man. Abruptly that realization joined with what he saw on their facesawe, fear, shrinking horrorand he knew that they were afraid of him. To them he was some terrible scourge they had never seen, a scourge even worse than the disease they had come to live with. He was an invisible specter who had left for evidence of his existence the bloodless bodies of their loved ones. And he understood what they felt and did not hate them. His right hand tightened on the tiny envelope of pills. So long as the end did not come with violence, so long as it did not have to be a butchery before their eyes <br/><br/>Robert Neville looked out over the new people of the earth. He knew he did not belong to them; he knew that, like the vampires, he was anathema and black terror to be destroyed. And, abruptly, the concept came, amusing to him even in his pain. <br/><br/>A coughing chuckle filled his throat. He turned and leaned against the wall while he swallowed the pills. Full circle, he thought while the final lethargy crept into his limbs. Full circle. A new terror born in death, a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever. <br/><br/>I am legend.""<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend that the people that loved the book avoid this piece of garbage at all costs."

","From the moment that I saw the first calm, atmospheric trailer for I Am Legend, I was hooked. The visuals looked superb, Will Smith has always been able to give terrific performances in any type of movie that he chooses and the premise was tantalisingly promising. Yet even though I had an idea of what to expect from the movie, it still managed to shock, move and grip me, sometimes doing all three at the same time.<br/><br/>It is flawed, which shouldn't be totally unexpected. Whilst the visual effects used to create the abandoned, lonely landscape of New York City after three years of desertion are spot-on, the so-called ""dark seekers"", the vampire-like beings which fester in the darkness and hunt Smith's survivor, aren't as well done. The effect work on them is passable, but in the time of envelope pushing visuals, they seem to be sadly out-of-date. The ending is also a bit too safe and cuddly for such a scary plot, although I am only referring to the events which occur after the scene in the basement.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is brilliant. As mentioned before, there is some cracking visual effects work on good old New York, as well as a few superbly executed and suspenseful action sequences. The movie is paced vibrantly, and the cleverly integrated tension made me feel extremely tense whenever a door was slowly pushed open or shutters were pulled down over windows, let alone when one of the nasty dark seekers came flying out of the darkness.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence, the director, does a superb job at handling this huge task. His first movie, Constantine, was dark, visually exciting and energetic. Lawrence takes these qualities and applies them to I Am Legend, and also puts them to better use. He also applies many more terrific movie-making ideas, such as making the movie complex as well as thrilling by great action movie standards.<br/><br/>This is where the praise should be split between Lawrence and Smith. Smith, playing presumably the last man on Earth, gives a brilliant, shattering performance. He creates a complex and sympathetic character, who must not only secure mankind's survival but keep hold of his own sanity. His only companion is a dog named Sam (a terrific animal performance here, which is the first time I have ever made that comment), and he is so lonely that he treats Sam more like a human than a mere pet. It is details like this that make Smith's performance so intriguingly powerful. Another scene which perfectly outlines the character's situation is where he marches up to a mannequin that he set up in order to feel like he wasn't alone, and attempts to say hello. It is a deeply moving scene, and as Smith starts to cry, you can see that this is a tremendously human character. And that Smith absolutely nails it.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a terrific movie. Yes, it does have its flaws, but it isn't dull for even one minute, thanks to some great work from a committed crew and one hell of a star. Light up the darkness with this great entertainment."

","How difficult is it to be a little faithful to the source material. The title of the novella and one or two inferences to the novella does not mean it has anything to do with the book.<br/><br/>The problem these days is that the ""star"" of the film has to much say over what direction the movie takes. How can the character Robert Neville, who lives in the mid west, become the greatest immunogist in the world. He alone is the only hope the world has to save it from the monsters that it has created. Once again, Will Smith's theatrical God complex has ruined something that should've been great. Hell, he even says that he's been sent by god to fix what we've done.<br/><br/>This is more a remake of the Omega Man, than it is I am Legend."

","After a so called cure for cancer mutates the host into a vampire like creature, 90% of earth's population ends up dead. One man, who is immune to the virus, stays in New York to find a cure.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is the third film to be made from the book with the same name. The first two, The Last Man On Earth and The Omega Man, I have not seen. After viewing Legend, I can only hope they both have a stronger second half and conclusion, because Legend fails to capture it's audience in the third act.<br/><br/>The idea behind Legend is great and the in the right hands, the possibilities are endless. After viewing Legend I found myself wondering why it feels like two different films. Years prior Smith starred in a film about Robots taking over the city. In I, Robot the machines climb building walls, crash through glass and will not stop until they kill everyone. The third act of Legend follows the same structure. I couldn't help but picture the vampires as the robots as the climbed buildings and ripped through ceilings. The vampires themselves aren't too impressive on the technical scale. Seeing them attack wasn't as impressive as it should have been. They looked way too fake and it took me out of the reality of the film.<br/><br/>The whole film lands on Smith's shoulders and he pulls it off. The isolation in such a big city takes its course and slowly he begins to lose his mind. He interacts with his dog Sam and mannequins at the video store so he can have some kind of interaction. Tom Hanks did a similar thing in Cast Away. The film starts 3 years after the virus hits and it's a marvel to see the city in the state it's in. The technology we've created is what killed us. The technology we created is what outlived us. Seeing the tall buildings stands still while there is no live around it was astounding. The grass creeping through the streets, the abandoned cars and live animals roaming the city of New York. The special effects for this film is the highlight. It creates an atmosphere that no other post apocalyptic film has ever created. It makes one wonder if this will be our future. If we all die, will the things we created live on.<br/><br/>While the film does try and get us to connect with the lead character at the beginning, it doesn't try to keep that connection. It moves into an action film and I suddenly couldn't really care if Smith lived or died. I felt more of a connection with the dog Sam then I did with Smith. The film works up until one point, then it seems to go downhill and never catches back up with itself. When two new characters suddenly appear on the island.<br/><br/>There are bits and pieces of the film that don't really make sense. Like how all the creature look exactly alike, but those small things aside Legend is an enjoyable flick. It has moments of intense scenes, but then it has moments that make you question why. Such as why there appears to be a leader in the vampire pack. The flashbacks that are used to tell what happened to his family during the contamination of the city aren't that effective. It would have been more useful to have the flashbacks told with different days, instead of one night. Seeing Smith learning new ways to cope with his surroundings, meeting the infected for the first time, anything would have really worked. But they never took that advantage. It would have worked to connect us with Smith's character.<br/><br/>While Legend does have the performances or the conclusion one would hope, but it is worth a look at for it's special effects alone. It has it's fair share of problems, it stars of slow and ends fast. It's a mixed bag, the story is great, but presented on an average form. The special effects are astounding, but some of it look fake, like the vampires. In the end I did enjoy myself and that's what people look for at the movies."

","Based on the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, this is the third adaptation of the story. The earlier two were The Last Man on earth (1964) and The Omega Man (1971). With its Christmas release, huge budget and production costs and general hype created around it  obviously, it was a tempting offering during Christmas holidays.<br/><br/>Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the only man to survive the worldwide apocalypse due to a viral disease that has killed most of the human race and left the remaining humans as flesh eating zombies  who cannot come out in the light and can only come out in the dark to search their food. Robert and his dog Sam roam around deserted New York streets every day to search / hunt for food and waiting for some other survivors to contact them or works in his lab to find a viral cure. Robert encounters his own despairs and memories of his lovely wife and daughter, and battles with zombies. In one encounter with zombies, his dog is infected and dies, which leaves Robert desperate to take revenge and commit a suicidal attack on zombies. Anna (Alice Braga) - another survivor, rescues Robert. In the end, Robert dies in an effort to save Anna, but not before finding the cure for the disease.<br/><br/>Those who have not read the original novel  might find the movie entertaining to some extend. But be aware, that except the theme, this movie does not have any close resemblance with the original story, which is many times more interesting in its content, events and story telling.<br/><br/>This is a more ultra Americanized (American saving the worldnot again!) effort by the first time movie director Francis Lawrence, who until now only directed videos  mainly music videos for singers like Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez.<br/><br/>The budget is big and the production values enormous, which is seen on the cinema canvas and those visuals of deserted New York City are fascinating to say the least.<br/><br/>The movie belongs to Will Smith all the way. He carries each scene with great maturity and presence. He is the sole recognizable character in the whole movie until the last 30 minutes when Anna enters the scene. Will Smith has done great job in acting out the emotions and range of it. He looks great with his newly built muscular physique.<br/><br/>With good entertainment value, but poor adaptation (a lost opportunity  both for Francis and Will Smith) makes it movie an average viewing. I will go with (Stars 6.25 out of 10)"

This movie actually puts you in that situation and allows you to see how humans act in desperate and life threatening days.

","I Am Legend kind of has a Cast Away feeling. It is about one man isolated and trying to survive. But the circumstances are different. This time the main character has a small arsenal, a dog Sam to keep him company, mannequins, and an entire city to live in.<br/><br/>He spends his days active: exercising, hunting, and seeking for a cure to a disease (which he is immune) that has wiped out and turned most of humanity into zombies. His nights are on the lookout, barricaded and ready for the bloodthirsty monsters.<br/><br/>Once again, Will Smith shines as one of Hollywood's most influential actors. He is his usual self, funny, energetic, and overall entertaining. However, his character is not an ordinary protagonist like he was as Jim West in Wild Wild West or Agent Jay in Men in Black. His character is vulnerable and imperfect. He is not a super hero, but an ordinary, everyday person in a nightmarish situation. Of the movies I have seen him in, I have to say this is one of his best. The story is not cheesy; it's rather engaging and sometimes emotional with the well-timed flashbacks.<br/><br/>The action sequences were well-done, particularly with the scene in the beginning of where Smith chases after a pack of deer in a fast sports car. The camera angles and the computer-generated deer were amazing. Additional to the action, the movie had several suspenseful moments. There was one scene of where Smith goes into a dark room to find his dog. Each move and turn he makes put me on the edge of my seat, as I wonder what could pop up on the camera and scare me.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, my expectation of a quick pace was not as I hoped. The 101 minute movie felt more than two hours long. I also felt that some of the moments of where Will talks to the mannequins to be a little off. Other than that, I really liked this movie. 9/10"

The message the movie provides is nothing new either and does not make us think for a long time, or even regret anything we did or do, but it will remind you of going on, having hope and do good things in life.<br/><br/>So, go to the movies and enjoy this one.

The story had changed so much that it was unrecognizable and the point of the original (and there was a point in the source) completely reversed.<br/><br/>Although this has always happened in Hollywood, it has become even worse with recent adaptations, being not only dumbed down, which is unavoidable, but made to appeal to the Shawshank/Green Mile contingent.

Well, my husband and I went to see it the day after it came out and my expectations were met. The one thing that people need to understand about this movie is that it was not made to be an action filled movie. Sure, there are scenes in it that get your heart racing and even make it stop. But I think the main idea was for the viewer to understand what Will Smith's character was feeling and even to feel how he was feeling throughout the movie. In my opinion they did a great job of doing that because we were frustrated when he was, angry and scared when he was, but worst of all sad and lonely when he was. I'm not going to spoil anything about the movie, but I will say that there was actually more than one scene that made me cry.

"stewiefan201","5","3","6","16 December 2007"," The first half was excellent. The second half is just a dull violent, and don't forget stupid, Hollywood style climax
","I Am Legend is about a massive infection that got loose in New York City. 3 years later we meet Robert Neville (Will Smith), a scientist living with his dog Sam all alone in NYC. New York is completely barren of people which makes Robert one of the only, or maybe THE only, survivor. During the day he waits by a pier with the hope that someone will find him. He also hunts deer that roam the city for food. But at night he must barricade his apartment shut in order to keep the Zombie-like creatures out. The zombies are the people who were infected by the virus, millions of them that can only come out at night. While the zombies get much more intelligent, Robert must now try and find a vaccine to cure them. <br/><br/>I Am Legend starts off very well with its apocalyptic vision of NYC completely barren of people. The companionship between Robert and his dog Sam is also done excellently. If a dog could win an Oscar believe me, the dog playing Sam would without a doubt win.<br/><br/>As we begin to realize Robert may slowly be going insane, it is a little awkward at first since it has to do with mannequins. But this is nothing compared to the second half of the film, which I'll get into next. The effects are very well done when it comes to the view of the eery emptiness of NYC, which is probably the creepiest thing about the whole movie.<br/><br/>Now for the big problem which is the second half of I Am Legend. Throughout the first half it mostly hinted at what these zombies were really like, except for one dark scene which scared me pretty good. However the second half shows hordes upon hordes of these man-eating zombies, which look like computer-generated CGI monsters out of a somewhat higher budgeted Sci-Fi channel flick. There is also a big plot hole because the movie never explains how these zombies survive. What do they eat? Do they live on water like humans? And also how come they have gotten so muscular, loud, and better yet how come their lower jaws can stretch so far down? It was also a major problem that these zombies seemed to get more intelligent at hunting prey, and all of a sudden they become stupid and caveman-like once again. Everything goes completely downhill because it's as if the first half was not violent or Hollywood style enough. So they had to pack all that in to make a hollowingly dull, and ridiculously stupid and fake looking actionized ending.<br/><br/>I Am Legend starts off very well until it's fatally idiotic second half. Will Smith's acting was very good and you could truly see his loss and sadness. But all that and more is lost completely in the CGI pumped up climax. The filmmakers obviously couldn't come up with a good satisfying conclusion, so it ended up with a bad ending. The ending is horrible in my opinion because it is unsatisfying and literally does not solve anything. Once you see it think about the ending, you'll realize how badly it works out. I give I Am Legend a 2 out of 4, and am quite disappointed about it."
"Turfseer","3","3","6","15 December 2007"," Three cheers for the mutants!
","First of all, I was wondering how the female survivor and her son were able to get out of NYC so easily at the end of the movie. If she drove her car maybe she would have taken the Henry Hudson Parkway to the Bronx and then upstate. But wait a second--if the Army blew up the Brooklyn Bridge in order to prevent people from leaving Manhattan, wouldn't they have blown up all the bridges? So how did the two get to the ""colony""? Maybe she was able to drive the car on to the Staten Island Ferry and figure out how to operate it (if you believe a ridiculous scenario like that, you probably rated this movie a ""10"").<br/><br/>There were other things in ""I am Legend"" that I found to be too incredible to be believable. For example, when we first meet the mutants, they don't seem intelligent enough to hatch a plan to do anything except bite people. But toward the end, they seem to be organized with a leader, capable of going after Will Smith. And how did they figure out where Will Smith was living? All of a sudden they have such great intelligence? If they had such capabilities, why didn't they track Will Smith (in his home) earlier? Even if one was engrossed by the first two Acts of this script (and I wasn't completely), Act 3 fell apart completely. Will Smith is so depressed because he has no one to talk to and when he finally meets the female survivor and her son, instead of being overwhelmingly happy that he's no longer alone and can talk to somebody, he ends up almost immediately arguing with her about the existence of the 'colony'. The chemistry between the two is almost non-existent and the writers attempt to 'humanize' Will Smith by giving him some lame lines about how he likes reggae music.<br/><br/>And what about that scene where Will Smith is so depressed that he decides to play a game of kill-the-mutants with his car. I couldn't tell if this was one of Will Smith's dream sequences but if it wasn't, it didn't make a hell of a lot of sense. Here's a guy who's been spending all his time trying to save humanity by finding a vaccine that will transform the mutants and after he loses his dog, he goes to the trouble of setting up floodlights at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge and (for kicks) tries to kill as many mutants as he can. Was he trying to commit suicide or was it the director's decision to (awkwardly) place the hero in jeopardy and get him out of it? If it was still night out, how was Will Smith able to drive home in the dark without being attacked by a horde of mutants? Most unimpressive were the flashback scenes explaining how the virus wiped out humanity. There's no buildup, no tension whatsoever. Within a few hours, the virus has infected most people in Manhattan and they're all trying to escape. The movie would have been much more compelling if the infection was gradual and we saw how people coped with the transformation of their neighbors.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have praised the film for its 'inspirational message'. In true 'faith-based' Christian fashion, it was God who told the female survivor that there was a colony in upstate New York (or was it Pennsylvania, I can't remember). But God takes a backseat when it comes to 'faith' in this movie. Rather it's ""science"" that's elevated to the status of true religion. ""I am Legend"" echoes the mantra which we've been hearing since the 50s that ""science"" somehow holds the key to solving our most unsolvable problems and allaying our deepest fears. The whole idea that a virus can in a matter of a few weeks (or even days or hours) can infect and destroy humankind is laughable. Even more laughable is that some scientist can come up with a ""cure"" in the form of a mysterious ""vaccine"" to reverse the effects of such a contagion. In reality, when people get sick from some kind of 'disease', it doesn't happen overnight. It usually takes years before symptoms manifest themselves. 'Scientists' have been trying to find a 'cure' for cancer for years and always boast that they're one step away from discovering the elusive clue. The same goes for the pie-in-sky stem cell research which has been touted as a potential panacea for most diseases. I'll believe more in I am Legend's mutants before I believe in stem cell researchers enabling paralytics to walk again! ""I am Legend"" has a few good special effects and that's why I give the film 3 stars. But even those cuddly mutants become tiresome after awhile. As for Will Smith--he was far superior in ""I, Robot"" which at least had a fairly engrossing story.<br/><br/>If you like Zombie movies coupled with pseudo-religious pontification, then I am Legend might be for you. Otherwise, exercise your brain by reading a book (non-fiction would be most preferable after coping with one shrieking zombie after another)."

This reminded me (no spoilers here) of one of my favorite sci-fi epics, ""The Postman"" (with Kevin Costner, 1998), also based on science fiction literature from 40 years ago. These movies have the hold-over paranoia that grew out of the 1920-50's. I actually liked Postman better for the story, since anyone who has seen Heston's version of this, ""Omega Man"", will remember a two-line plot. But Will Smith adds so much heart to his character, sort of Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"", that the movie goes by almost too quickly. I will definitely watch it again on DVD, and unlike Postman which requires more pre-planning due to its bookish plotting, this has a good balance of action and reflection.

He now is what appears to be the last living man on Earth, and he and his dog Sam try to keep on living life. Will Smith gave a good performance, but the character is so one dimensional. For most of the movie he seems very angry and serious, and then he has the occasional joke, that usually caused a light chuckle in the audience. He was still somehow likable, but he could've been a much better character, considering this whole movie is practically a one man show for him. Any other characters in the story don't have enough screen time for the audience to care about them, and they are very underdeveloped (even more so than him).<br/><br/>A lot of action-horror movies are missing heart, and that's a big positive for this one. It has a heart, and it has some touching moments. This layered the movie and made it more than just a bunch of special effects and jump scenes right after each other.<br/><br/>In the end, this was a good movie, but I preferred the Omega Man over this.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins.

The theme of few people left on the planet, a kind of ""Planet Of The Ape"" type tale, is nothing new. This one just has a few different twists to it and, film-wise, is different in that it features computerized special-effects. As one who normally enjoys those visual treats, I would rate this aspect ""fair,"" too, like the story. Early on, the animals racing down New York City streets looked very fake. Later, the effects were a little better with the zombies, but nothing that would make you drop your jaw in amazement.<br/><br/>Like the story and FX, Will Smith as the lead character was okay: good, but not Oscar material. Actually, I thought the German Shepherd did the best job of acting in the film!<br/><br/>If you are looking for suspense, some scary scenes and a good diversion in your life for 91 minutes, I'd recommend this movie. Just know what you're getting: this is very horror-like in many spots. It's a tense story."

This is our first shot of them and it was a pretty creepy moment. The story just isn't really very compelling. I looked at my watch after having been in the movie for a while and I couldn't believe there was only 20 minutes left to go in it. I was like, 'huh?' There is just no really interesting arc to the story at all. Two characters, a mother and son, are introduced late in the movie and we hardly get to know them.

"honorhorror","8","4","10","13 December 2007"," A great horrifying and depressing journey of a man's faith in his kind
","Firstly I'd like to mention the trailer of I Am Legend, as it could be the best trailer of the year for following reasons: 1, intriguing and attractive;2, potential theme and expandable action sequences; 3, a misleading effect as if the movie is more about surviving than horror!! And that's a flaw. The movie's horror element is so overdone that 1, the audiences are always depressed and expecting to be tortured by more escalating darkness.2,whenever Will Smith express his feeling by screaming, it looks like a parody because the audiences can finally breath for a moment and some of us even laugh at him in relaxation. The movie should never be rated PG-13.<br/><br/>Well, that's enough for complains. I Am Legend is very innovative in its visual style that all the details in the scenes implies Apocalypse. It has obviously more CGI than Children of Men and overall it's well done, for both the ruins of New York and Zombies(or human-shaped monsters, etc.). Honestly I never expect some CG zombie to be so scary. Will Smith did a good job, he successfully delivers a man twisted by fate and by loneliness. He is the core of the whole movie. Therefore the movie is a journey about the his role. He used to be a person of family, but after the disaster he became godless, holding a belief of both right and wrong ideas about his kind. Insisting to treat the zombies by his blood for 3 years, he found out this belief is too far to reach and too valuable to abandon. Therefore the movie intentionally showed his suffering in long shots, which is a torture to both Will and the audiences until the female survivor appeared. Her arrival, also has multiple effects on Will's character. On the good side restores his faith in searching for others, on the other hand spoils his ""Ground Zero""--attempts to cure zombies. After a final battle, Will got a chance to redeemed his faith......<br/><br/>Well, if you think you can think about such themes after the 1st viewing, I recommend this one to you. However if you are:1, heart-conditioned;2, under 18; 3, easily depressed; 4, afraid of darkness I strongly suggest you don't see it."

The dog zombies were also a miss, not looking like dogs at all.<br/><br/>A much better look would have been to use one like that of the killer Vampires from Blade 2, which looked lots better and was just what this film required.<br/><br/>Please don't make a sequel, Will Smith was the only good thing about this film."

","Well I took a day off from studying for my finals last night and went to see I Am Legend with the girlfriend. I guess I will go with the good before what I thought could have been better.<br/><br/>Will Smith as always was superb. His acting was great and you could really feel his pain at various points in the movie. Furthermore, the CGI and scenes of an abandonded New York were amazing. It really gave you an insight to what a city might look like if it became completely uninhabited. The plot development was pretty good, with a tiny bit of holes here and there that left me unsatisfied. The ending was rather abrupt as well. Also, I for the life of me, cannot understand how zombies, who were humans at one point, have superhuman strength. How in the world does that make any sense?<br/><br/>It all depends on what you are looking for if you I would recommend this film. If you are looking for a horror movie and want to be frightened. Go see it. If you want to see an insight into what the world would be like if a massive portion of the population was killed. Go see it. But if you want to see Will Smith in a well-written movie, with great story development, and a complete plot. I would say wait till it comes out on DVD and judge for yourself, cause I don't think it was."

","Despite its considerable budget, I am Legend is at least, a bad movie. Not taking into account that the disease-apocalypse-mutant thing is as played out as any premise in recent film history, the array of contrived heroics and plot devices far outnumber those few moments of interesting story play. The interesting psychological investigation into a supposed last man on earth is constantly steered off course by forced emotionless scenes and an almost-Kevin-Costner-level martyrdom pumps like cholesterol through this waste-of-money's awful, awful veins.

","After ""The Last Man on Earth (1964) with Vincent Price"" and ""The Last Man Alive (1971) with Charlton Heston"" this is now the third try to make a movie out of the story of Richard Matheson. Plot: A virus, this time it's man-made, (A cure for cancer) has unexpected side effects. It goes out of control and can infect rats and dogs (better made in ""Resident evil"") too. The virus is spreading on body contact but is also airborne. The virus infects nearly everybody with exception of our hero and his dog (so it seems). Most of the infected people are dying. Those who are not dying transform into zombie like creatures. Madly violent and strongly light sensitive. They have to hide from daylight and are leaving their hideouts only in the dark. <br/><br/>Compared to it's predecessors, not even the action scenes are better. Sure the producers made plenty use of computer generated animation and also ""modernised"" the scenes, but that's it. In the version of 1971 the audience got all information to understand the plot. Now there are a few hints but, not enough. There are also sudden turns in the plot which are not making sense. So if you haven't seen one of the earlier versions (or read the book), you are probably lost. Compared with other apocalyptic plague movies (like Breakout) the science is worse. Summerised: This movie is just something for Will Smith fans. Everybody else should try to find a copy of ""The Last Man Alive""."

While I have many questions, the biggest one is how did that woman and child rescue Will Smith when he was being attacked by the creatures? Why did they not attack them? It was still dark. And how did these creatures have enough sense to set traps for him? Or to follow him home? Will Smith's character said that the behaviour of these creatures had diminished to the point where they had no human characteristics left at all.

","Will Smith gives the acting performance of his lifetime. There is not enough that can be said about the way in which Smith single handedly carries the whole movie by himself. It was very much reminiscent of the job done by Tom Hanks in Cast Away. The movie also focuses on a very prevalent issue which is finding the cure to certain diseases that grip our nation. I love the way in which the film shows how a great thing can end up being a nightmare; it makes the viewer aware of the unknown. The bond between Will Smith and his dog is superb. It is a film where a animal is very much a central character throughout the film. If you are looking for a relatively content clean film that provides endless action and adventure I would strongly recommend this film."

It's not so much that it's Will Smith's fault the movie's just wasn't entertaining in the slightest, it's more like it isn't developed well enough and you neither care no empathize with his character. You almost find yourself rooting for the zombies, who look like they walked out of a Shrek film, the CGI is that horrible! How hard was it to put makeup on some actors and only use CGI for the stunt sequences?? Seriously, there's no need use a CGI character for a close-up of a zombie shrieking! You could have put plenty of New York's homeless in makeup and given them a great working opportunity, and it would have been much cheaper! The story doesn't develop; it's just ANOTHER ""New York in peril"" story like all the rest of them. For once, I actually find myself wishing a movie was longer so it could have been more fleshed out.

It was interesting to see Mr. Smith providing the sort of performance that characterises his roles as 'Black Guy with attitude'(""BGWA""). Regrettably, a weak story - the story was always weak - and acting without any real depth created a movie experience that left me feeling there could have been more. Indeed, at 1 hour 41 minutes the offering was a little paltry given the subject matter. Just because the original story was weak doesn't mean some talented screen writer can't 'extend' it and give it more depth. 'Best Sound' and 'Best Stunts' seem to justify this vacuous movie. Please offer Mr. Smith a good script. He has served his time and deserve a real opportunity to see if he can do something that doesn't require him to be a BGWA.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","7","18 December 2007"," A Will Smith you've never seen before and a movie that offers more than the poster and trailer may suggest
","The remarkable thing about this movie is its simplicity. The movie makers seem to have taken a lot of effort to make it painfully predictable, e.g. the eventual fate of the faithful dog Samantha. The reason, I surmise, is to allow you to think a little and to let Will Smith act more.<br/><br/>Those who have watched ""28 days later"" will see this movie almost as a re-visit: a virus that turns humans into hordes of blood sucking zombies, a desperate struggle to find a cure and a haven where the few uncontaminated are holding on to a last glimpse of hope.<br/><br/>The opening sees Will Smith and the dog, as perhaps the only unaffected among the respective human and canine species, out on a regular hunting day in post-apocalyptic Manhattan. In an attentively crafted scene, we see man and dog zeroing in on their prey, but as he is just about to fire, a lioness from out of nowhere bounces onto the deer and pins it down. As you fully expect the simple solution of shooting both, you see the lion and cub appear on the scene. As the scene ends, you are left to ponder what is on this last normal human being's (at least to what he thinks) mind that makes him spare this lion family.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is the more watchable (although the second half us not UNwatchable, only becoming more run-of-the-mill), reminding you inevitably of Tom Hank's ""Cast away"" (2000). Smith however has an easier job because while he still has a dog to talk to, Hanks only had a volleyball with a face drawn on it. On the other hand, while Hanks' character still has hopes of being rescued with everything back to normal, the doctor in ""I am legend"" is actually quite convinced that everybody is dead and what is left is just zombies (but hell, such fast-moving ones). On a rational plane, his persistent research is in hope of finding a cure to turn these ghouls back into normal human beings. But you can't help but wonder: does he really believe in this hope himself, or is he doing this merely to keep his sanity? <br/><br/>As I said, by not clustering this movie with useless complications, the movie makers allow the audience the space to contemplate the magnitude of this loneliness. A Will Smith that you have not seen before has given a good shot at making this loneliness palpable. As we move beyond the first half of the movie and other characters appear, it becomes a more commonplace horror thriller and self-sacrificing hero yarn. Still, taken in its entirety, this is a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Deserving mention is a cameo, uncredited appearance of Emma Thompson at the beginning, sort of a prologues of an interview with a doctor who has purportedly discovered a cure for cancer, a discovery that eventually turns into the catastrophic virus - a chilling message that scientific advancements may one day have serious repercussions."

The End.<br/><br/>There was no Legend, just a stupid man that wanted to play God and make everything right again. The End."

","""I Am Legend"" delivered on many more levels than I expected. It was surprisingly poignant and emotional, with topical and thematic value I didn't expect. The film's overall success for me was due to the strong performance of Will Smith. There's been a lot of talk about this being a make or break film solely on the star power of Will Smith. For me, his star power isn't in question. His track record at domestic and global box office has proved that he can open a movie. Yes, he is often supported by other elements like a big director, producer, co-star and/or more commercial fare drawing a broader demographic. But this really shows how much he commits himself to his performance as an actor. His ability to internalize his experience and share it authentically is astounding. He shared the screen primarily with his canine friend, Sam, various mannequins, and blood-thirsty zombies but he manages to convey his emotions with such a layered performance, I couldn't help but be drawn into the story and his presence.<br/><br/>I'm sure most people are familiar with the story by now. I won't reveal any of the film's surprises or twists but essentially, an experimental cure for cancer ends up mutating, goes airborne and kills over 90% of the world's population. Of the remaining 10%, over 9% turn into light-sensitive, blood-hunger zombies which kill most of the remaining 1%, the people who are immune to the disease. Will Smith's character, Robert Nevelle, believes he is the sole survivor of the human race. He's also a scientist with a close relationship to the virus and is doing clinical trials on animals and ""dark seekers"" (the zombies) that he cleverly captures. There are some nice twists to the story, some great scares and pulse-pounding action, special effects and stunt work. Director Francis Lawrence did an exemplary job creating an isolated and eerie feel to a barren New York City while evoking a powerful and layered performance out of his star.<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" really proves the power of a performance, the imagination of creative storytelling, and the innovative use of many popular storytelling devices. Andrew Lesnie's camera work and cinematography is stunning and creepy. There's great art design and the special efforts use in the city and with the zombies is very effective and helps tell a great story with great moments of awe, suspense and wonder.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd love to see Warner Bros. really push for an Oscar campaign for Will Smith for best actor. He's in every scene of the film, the film works largely because of him and he brings a vulnerability to his character that really shows his risking nature as an actor. It's the type of performance and film that doesn't usually get the recognition of the Academy in acting consideration but for me it's reminiscence of Johnny Depp in ""Pirates"" 1. The film had an unexpectedly strong and original performance from Depp that supported and contributed to a lot of the film's success. And both films have many other visual elements that make them great entertainment. It's an unlikely film to win Will his Oscar but I'd like to see an attempt at it. And it really is inevitable for Will to win. He's too talented, powerful, beloved and committed to his craft not to. Go see this film if you want to have a great time at the movies and really experience the power of an actor's performance."
"virek213","8","3","7","16 December 2007"," Three Times A ""Legend""
","Richard Matheson's 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"" is universally considered a touchstone in modern horror and science fiction literature. Its story of the last known living man on Earth trying to survive an onslaught of mutants bought on by a terrible plague has been the stuff of many cinematic variations (including NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD), plus two loose adaptations--1964's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with Vincent Price); and 1971's THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston). And in our time, it is now Will Smith who has the burden of being that Last Man in this third version of ""I Am Legend"", using the novel's title this time around.<br/><br/>Smith takes up the role of Robert Neville, who had been a virologist in 2009, trying to contain a once-promising cure for cancer that instead became a violent plague and killed off practically the entire Earth's population. Now, in the year 2012, he roams around New York City (the novel has this set in Los Angeles), foraging for supplies during the day with his German shepherd Samantha, trying to contact anyone who might still be alive, and making it back to his townhouse before dark--because that's when other survivors come out, and they are the Infected, or ""Dark Seekers."" His main business is to try and find an antidote for the virus, which is the only way he keeps sane. And then his world takes a turn when an uninfected survivor (Alice Braga) finds him, and he sees some ray of hope.<br/><br/>As with the previous two films based on Matheson's novel, I AM LEGEND does follow certain aspects of its source material: a plague killing off the population; flashbacks to the start of the horror; mutant survivors hounding for Smith's blood; and the appearance of uninfected people in Neville's world. On other points, unsurprisingly, this version of ""I Am Legend"" really isn't any closer to its source than the other two were. In one sense, this version, directed by Francis Lawrence and scripted by Mark Protosevitch and Akiva Goldsman, reworks aspects of the John and Joyce Corrington script of THE OMEGA MAN in making Smith a scientist trying desperately to find a cure while maintaining his sanity in the same way Heston had done in that film.<br/><br/>Obviously, die-hard fanatics of Matheson's claustrophobic and brilliant novel are not going to have warm and fuzzy feelings by the way I AM LEGEND has been amped up, even in contrast to the '71 version (let alone the Poverty-Row '64 LAST MAN ON EARTH). But Smith's performance, as he's on screen for better than three-fourths of the time, is every bit as credible (if in different ways) as Price's and Heston's in the earlier versions; and the sense of desolation in New York City creates a great deal of tension.<br/><br/>It may be that Matheson's book, with posited the vampire myth in scientific terms, can't really be filmed the way it should by Hollywood; these days, vampires seem to be the stuff of B-movies. That said, however, this I AM LEGEND does work well enough just the same."
"getmeagasmask","4","3","7","16 December 2007"," Climbs to a near-peak, then crashes down in away that is nearly heartbreaking
","As we all (well, most of us know), I Am Legend is a remake. Countless thrillers that I've seen have left me with a poor impression on remakes, but come on, I Am Legend seemed so incredibly epic when I first saw the trailer, then later the commercials. So last night I went out to see it.<br/><br/>The movie, as shown by the commercials, is basically that everyone on the planet dies save Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith). The film does not begin with the story of the downfall of earth and Robert's experience through that; all of that is revealed through Robert either watching old tapes he made of the news or in flashbacks. That's okay though, because the movie is interesting enough from the beginning that you don't even notice. It definitely is amazing and chilling to watch Robert as he goes through his day-to-day life in NYC as the only human in existence. The city's streets are cracked with weeds pushing their way through cement , some buildings are wrapped in plastic, cars are jammed on the roads in a way that tells the audience that they were abandoned in a frenzy. His faithful dog, Sam accompanies him and in my opinion seriously added an excellent touch to the film. However, Robert is living amongst these sort of cannibalistic, super-strong, super-agile, zombie-like creatures (think 28 Days/Weeks Later) that only come out at night and are burned by sunlight. Besides busying himself with hunting for food and waiting around hopefully for any other survivors, Robert works studiously in his lab, testing on animals and all the infected humans to try and find a cure. Now for the bad stuff... Now, without saying TOO much, two other people are introduced into the story. However, there is basically NO character development on their part, and by the end of the movie the audience couldn't care less about them. Speaking of the ending, it was a gigantic disappointment. This is one of the top let-downs I've witnessed, seriously. If perhaps the characters and story were given more time to develop, and many things were explained (because there were several holes in this movie, there were many things that needed explanations but were often forgotten) then perhaps the ending would have been more satisfying. The ending was obviously intended to like, ""Wow, that's beautiful."" Yeah, it isn't./ I Am Legend is everything it's hyped up to be in the beginning. After that, don't keep your expectation up too high. It just isn't worth it."
"Zombiguy","9","3","7","15 December 2007"," Amazing Film With Great Story
","This movie has an amazing view on how the world is post-apocalypse. The details they put into this movie are incredible. The whole time i was on the edge of my seat. It was exciting, sad, creepy, eerie and epic all at the same time. The storyline is also great. The way the characters are portrayed and the way they act make you feel like you are in the movie. The scenes in the Infected ""hive"" made me jump out of my seat. Robert Neville seems like the perfect ""last man on earth"" because he is crafty and witty at the same time. The way he creates his own little world at the movie store with mannequins show what 3 years alone does to someone. The flashbacks in the movie let the audience calm down a bit and let you know how the characters got where they are and how the infection happened.<br/><br/>The infection starts when a so-called cancer cure goes wrong and kills 90% of the world. The other 10% were immune to the virus. They all died except 12 million who became infected and lived in the dark waiting for a kill. Neville is left alone with his dog Samantha or Sam for short. I thought that the deaths of the characters fit into the plot almost perfectly. For example, when Samantha is attacked by infected dogs and infected, Robert has to kill her himself by strangling her giving a sad, touching scene which captivated audiences. What got me aggravated though was how he fell into a random trap and we never find out how Fred got there or who made the trap. I feel this was just an easy way to kill off a character and get audiences to get angered or sad. Also, the way Neville's family dies is that a rescue copter gets pulled down by desperate New Yorkers and crashes into the private copter for Neville's family. It was sad and upsetting, but let us know that Neville's family died without the infection. Finally, in the end when Neville sacrifices himself for Anna and Ethan(who doesn't say a thing the whole movie) to keep the cure safe it was a great EXPLOSIVE ending to an actiony, sad, epic and overall awesome movie. it was a great film and I highly recommend it to anyone over 13 years of age."

","I left the theatre last night feeling moved and in awe of the story told of a man so driven by his need for absolution that he isolated himself in a city filled with monsters.<br/><br/>It isn't enough for most people to live, they have to have a reason for living. Robert Neville's cause was his promise to his dead little girl that he would ""fix this."" Over and over again, he said that, that he would fix this.<br/><br/>After three years alone, Neville's patterns are pretty well set. He and his dog hunt the city in the day. The night and the dark places belong to the mutants. And unlike the previous adaptations of the Richard Matheson novel, Neville does not seek out the mutants by day to kill them...he fears them to his very core, and only goes into their lair to save his dog, gone to chase a stag.<br/><br/>I found the trap set by the mutants to be too intelligent...first the mutants would have to perceive the purpose of the mannequins in the video store, choose one that would move Neville to investigate (the peripheral dummies would likely not have grabbed his attention as much), and then set up the trap for the last food in the city. It seemed too intelligent a trap for the creatures we saw in the film, who were nothing more than bundles of raw anger, rage and desire. This trap was clearly a necessary plot device needed to move the story forward, and I have to give it a bye for that.<br/><br/>The interaction of Neville and the two survivors that find him is lovely and moving, as when the hero mouths the words from ""Shrek"" as the movie is playing on the DVD player. This one lonely, lonely man, nearly driven crazy by his isolation. He doesn't even know how to relate to people at first.<br/><br/>As a person who has been in self-imposed isolation for nearly three years, I can totally relate to Will Smith's character, and my hat is off to him for a virtuoso performance! <br/><br/>Nine of of ten for the sheer emotion that this film evoked in me."
"MrKaphie","9","3","7","14 December 2007"," This movie was a great synthesis (minor spoiler)
","I Am Legend is probably one of the better movies that I've seen all year. I recommend that anyone interested in an excellent plot line, good acting and suspense see this film.<br/><br/>The only problem with the film was a minor problem -- the CGI was a bit obvious. But that is a minor problem, indeed, keeping in mind that fantasy and science fiction always necessitate some suspension of disbelief and CGI special effects are discernible in virtually every movie wherein they are used. And I Am Legend is definitely a science fiction movie.<br/><br/>The movie was inspired by a novel called I Am Legend, but was not based on it. I'm thankful for the fact now that I've seen the movie. The movie was better than the book. The cinematic story line was better and more meaningful. The movie I Am Legend without question owes at least as much to previous movies than the book. And that's OK, considering that every piece of art has its inspirational predecessors. The inspiration of previous zombie flicks (28 Days being only one) can be seen in the film, as well as M Night Shamaylans movie Signs. One can even see whispers of Planet of the Apes in the implication that the mutants might be slowly becoming their own new species, potentially replacing humanity. In this regard, I Am Legend should probably be considered a masterful synthesis of previous styles and ideas.<br/><br/>What makes I Am Legend different from the aforementioned movies (with the exception of Signs) is that I Am Legend is far more emotionally sophisticated. Its definitely worth a view."
"prettymuse789","6","15","60","14 December 2007"," Are filmmakers running out of ideas?
","Can movie-making genres become stale? Are filmmakers running out of new methods to scare people, to thrill audiences? I Am Legend is a movie that prophesizes a grim future for two genres that are becoming defined by the enigmatic multiplicity of the Saw franchise.<br/><br/>I Am Legend should be called I Am a Really Desperate Lonely Dude Who Plays Golf On Airplanes and Likes Long Walks in Central Park Cornfields; My Ad is on EHarmony.com. The ""legend"" is Robert Neville, who is immune to a virus that has infested the entire human civilization with vampire-like symptoms. He is unable to make contact with anyone who has retained his humanity, so he assumes 99.9% of homo sapiens are dead. Despite the pain and mental duress these creatures have caused, apparently a Hippocratic oath taken by colonels prevents him from wanting to obliterate the entire vampiric race; instead he uses them for study because he believes his immunity means he is supposed to find a way to cure the vampires.<br/><br/>The vampires themselves...I won't spoil it. But you've seen creatures like them in about 500 other fantasy/horror/thriller movies that already exist. Makeup is becoming a dead art yet creates more realism than any CGI effect I've seen (except for maybe Transformers). It is the filmmakers' reliance on these artificial ways to scare audiences that make this movie--which is fueled by real feelings and real people and real terror--so...lacking.<br/><br/>The terror comes from amplified noises of objects and long, drawn out moments of hunting with Neville. This kind of scaring process has been experienced before in countless other films. Can't directors and writers find other ways to scare people besides this cycle: tense moment, scary monster crashes through something, monster chases hero, hero thankfully escapes and looks amazing while doing it, repeat? Why are scary movies scary when they're only showing human torture? Why are thrillers and horrors not as innovative as they used to be? Last comment: I read the novel, and was disappointed. The bastardization of books by filmmakers because they're too afraid to portray uncomfortable topics on screen has reached the point where they're ignoring a novel's most appealing aspects because they don't want to shatter the mental status quo of the movie-going public. Something was ""too perfect"" regarding the final moments of the film; and the tone of the movie (consistent throughout the entire novel) drastically changed. The last twenty minutes almost felt forced, as if Hollywood was looking for a way to compensate for making the first hour and a half more human than it should have been--but that was the most compelling part of the film.<br/><br/>P.S. The scene where Will Smith does his pullups is the high point of the movie."

","Resourceful and determined scientist Robert Neville (a fine and credible performance by Will Smith) does his best to keep his sanity and find a cure for a deadly contagion that has either wiped out most of mankind or turned the ones who are left into murderous nocturnal mutants.<br/><br/>Director Francis Lawrence, working from a compact and compelling script by Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman, keeps the absorbing story moving along at a constant pace, brings an impressive sense of tremendous scope to the premise (the expansive shots of an empty and desolate New York City are extremely striking and jarring), and ably crafts a powerfully unsettling mood of pure dread and despair. Moreover, the strong bond between Neville and his fiercely loyal canine companion Sam (well played by the beautiful German Shepherds Abbey and Kona) gives this film plenty of touching heart and warmth. Smith plays it serious and straight for once with remarkably spot-on results, Alice Braga lends sturdy support as soulful survivor Anna, Dash Mihok cuts an appropriately fearsome figure as the savage lead alpha male mutant, and Emma Thompson has a nice uncredited bit role as the well-meaning doctor whose cancer cure inadvertently beget the virus. Kudos are also in order for Andrew Lesnie's sharp widescreen cinematography and James Newton Howard's spare chilling score. Alas, the CGI creatures and wild animals look really cartoonish and unconvincing while the bittersweet ending fails to wrap things up in a satisfying manner. Those flaws aside, this film overall sizes up as a real on the money sci-fi/horror end-of-the-world winner."

The last time it was filmed was in 1971 with Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"" (Omega being the last letter in the Greek alphabet), but that flick has become quite dated now with its hippie kids and blaxploitation heroine, so a remake seemed necessary.<br/><br/>About ten years back, it was going to be remade with the Ridley Scott/Arnold Schwarzenegger dream team and a massive budget. What a pity we will never see that version, it will always remain one of the great unmade sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>Instead of Arnie, we have Will Smith in the lead who can be a good actor when he pushes himself. Sure he's buffed up and carries a gun everywhere (so far, so Arnie), but he tones down his usual hip-hop mannerisms and actually displays some vulnerability for once and does well in the role.<br/><br/>Director Frances Lawrence did a good job on ""Constantine"" and, for the most part, he acquits himself well here too, particularly in the daytime scenes. The scene where Will Smith has to go after his dog in a dark, underground space where ""The Dark Seekers"" might be hiding is as tense a scene as any movie had in 2007. Brilliantly done.<br/><br/>Virtually every review of ""I Am Legend"" complained about the cheesy special effects. The dark seekers look a lot like Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"" which is probably because Andrew Lesnie was the cameraman on both movies. The difference is that ""Lord of the Rings"" had a massive effects budget (which is why Gollum looked so photo-realistic), while ""I Am Legend"" seems to have had very little. The creatures look like graphics from a PlayStation game. Although they are much scarier than the ghouls in ""The Omega Man."" Charlton Heston could reason and converse with them, the dark seekers in Will Smith's movie are fierce, primal beings whose only instinct is to drink the blood of humans. They don't even seem to have the power of speech, they just roar (A great early scene has Will Smith hiding in a bath with his dog as he listens to a chorus of blood-curdling howls coming from the masses of ravenous dark seekers in the streets outside).<br/><br/>I did enjoy ""I Am Legend"" and I will be getting it on DVD, but I will always pine for the Schwarzenegger/Scott version that almost made it.

In fact, it turns out that he's widely known as the person who released the malignant version of this retro-virus... yet no characters blame him or wish him ill.<br/><br/>The sheer coincidence that he's a) famous, b) the guy who released the retro-virus into New York City's general population, c) immune, and d) working on a cure...just kills the believability of the film at the start.<br/><br/>The CGI effects of the abandoned city are effective, but the monsters are... pathetic. The overstretched mouth during a scream is a tired re-do of the Mummy's scream in the Brendan Frasier film ""Hamunaptra"". The fact that the monsters don't starve and don't freeze to death in winter is pure silliness. The sheer energy and superhuman strength of the monsters is a believability-killer for anyone over the age of 5.<br/><br/>Worst, the film becomes offensive and moronic in its pushiness about Christianity, pro-military stance, and flag-waving. By the time we're shown a town of survivors in Small Town America, with high walls, a big church, and an American flag in front of EVERY home, the audience was either actively booing or looking like they were sitting through unanaesthetized dental work.<br/><br/>Shame. On. These. Movie makers."
"sergiogarza_834","6","2","4","27 January 2008"," Below my expectations.
","Ummm... OK. I will start saying hat Will did pretty good in this movie. So, his acting wasn't my problem. See, i thought that this type of movie deserves the R rating. It's not like i love to see blood on movies, it's just that with more brutality, this kind of films create more impact on the audience. When i saw that the rating wasn't R, i thought, well, it can't be that bad. I was still really excited to go see it. But it really was bad. This movie seemed so... empty to me. It would have been a lot better if more survivors showed up, or that Neville was trying to survive along with 2 or 3 other companions, and that maybe some of them die someway. Wow, the shiny mustang...yeah, the car is hot, but i mean, he is living in apocalypse practically, and he bothers himself to clean his ride? I mean, he's struggling to survive and find a cure, but he still finds time to keep it shining. Come on! Besides, he only drives it once in the film, at the beginning. The dark seekers, if i'm not mistaking the name, look soo unreal... they all look the same too. And the end... why did he sacrifice himself? he could have entered where Anna and Ethan had, waited for the dark seekers to break the glass, and toss the grenade, quickly closing the door. Í consider myself a big fan of this type of survival movies. I expected this one to get close to the great 28 days later, but i was wrong. It needed lots of more stuff... and lots of less stuff too."

","MY GOD what a horrible movie. The trailer sold an action packed, non-stop fuel filled movie. And what did we get. 2 hours of boring zombies and melo-dramatic clichés. The concept of the movie was interesting, I must say I was psyched to watch this film, high anticipations may have ruined it for me. Settling in at the theater I quickly discovered that this was another ""me"" movie ( i.e. will smith's movie)The thought of a movie containing one main character is intriguing but also very very difficult to accomplish. Tom Hanks in Cast Away set a standard in this genre that is not easily followed. <br/><br/>Will Smith was convincing as slightly paranoid left alone doctor. First half of the movie Mr. Smith shined, unfortunately the plot falls through completely. It ends up playing the Hollywood fiddle, touching emotions in just the right ways, the correct suspense build up with a tragic highlight towards the end. All in all a standard Blockbuster recipe poorly hidden in a doomsday wrapper. I felt cheated as I left the theater and once again went home, wishing for more indie films and less Blockbusters. Hollywood has gone soft, caught up in ""fixed"" story plots . Lets hope that the ongoing strike can clear the path for more indie and good plots. This was just embarrassing.<br/><br/>I give it a four star, I would give Will Smiths portrayal a six star, but the movie was just to Hollywood/Bruckheimer if you know what I mean."
"skuagrips","4","2","4","23 January 2008"," Close, but no cigar
","For a movie that was 1hr & 41 minutes long the setup, though great, took too long, causing the confrontation and climax to happen too late in the film, which led to a flat Deus ex Machina kind of ending.<br/><br/>The sacrifice of the hero at the end held no gravity for the ""damsel in distress"" (i.e. the survivor woman and her son) because their emotional relationship with the hero, Will Smith, had no time to develop and mature, which is why the climax and ending felt flat and empty. The damsel element was added to late in the film. The capturing of the zombie female was the right time for the female element to be introduced into the movie, like the original novel (""I am Legend"") and the two previous adapted movies had done, instead of splitting in two the damsel element into the female zombie and the female survivor characters that this recent interpretation of a great story has done.<br/><br/>Sometimes you wonder if these production companies think too much when working on their scripts.<br/><br/>The relationship between Will Smith and his dog was more powerful than the one between him and the human females. Maybe they should have cut out the human females and just focused on the bitch."

"Ibsen3","3","2","4","20 January 2008"," Betrayal of an SF classic
","I saw two films last night, one eagerly anticipated, the other avoided. The other (The Italian Job) I reviewed as 'A sickeningly awful travesty of a classic film' but then, I expected that because it was 'an American Blockbuster'. This, on the other hand, is the other side of the negative 'American film-making' coin and represents a more depressing prospect as it is a betrayal of a great US book rather than a great UK film (books being more reputable in my opinion).<br/><br/>Like others before me, I loved the NY scenes and the sequences with Robert's dog which form an essential part of the book. Yet they totally missed the point here. The book is an exquisitely portrayed justification of the very idea of Vampires existing at all and that derives mainly from the events of the time in which it was written, whilst the film hi-jacks ideas such as 9/11, a cure for cancer and so on, making this background premise a whole lot less convincing.<br/><br/>Will Smith does a fair job of Robert Neville but, if you ask me, he was the absolutely WRONG choice for the part. This is never more obvious than in the flexing muscles scene which is a transparent and wholly unnecessary bid to bring in the female crowds. I know that if you made this film without him, it probably wouldn't sell but, in the book, Robert Neville was an extremely tragic character (what happened to the elegantly portrayed idea of tragedy in modern books and films?). If you were the last man alive without much hope, having to go through the same old routines in order to survive, with no company, desperate to save the human race and find a cure, would you be so utterly ripped? There are limits to how deliberate self-delusion to keep oneself going can be maintained. It's not as if he fights many vampires in this film like some super hero and it's not like he's working out in order to look good is it?<br/><br/>There are hints about his tragedy but, if you were to read the book with its more drawn-out character exposition, you would know about his family life, what happened to his wife and daughter, how he met up with the dog and various features of the vampires that make them stand out from your average nasty blood-suckers by characterising them properly. I won't spoil it for you so GO READ THE BOOK!<br/><br/>If you do read the book, you should be able to see how this film could have been so much better. Nevertheless, I must add a few !!!!!!!BIG SPOILERS ABOUT THE BOOK HERE!!!!!! in order to review it. For a start, Neville was not a scientist. He was just an ordinary desperate man who spent hours poring over textbooks in an abandoned library trying to find all manner of tips to help his lonely existence. The arrival of the dog was a godsend to him and he spent months trying to catch it, tame it and figure out why it wasn't infected. Neville was bombarded each night by vampires who knew him when they were alive and who would taunt him endlessly so that he could not sleep and he spent most of each morning repairing the house's outer defences. Neville became an alcoholic and makes various attempts to block out the sounds of the vampires outside, even going outside to fight them in one foolish and desperate act of frustration. Indeed, there are various heart-stopping moments that are completely lost in the film which appears to make a nothing of Neville's trials.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in the book there was a reason why he survived so long and this is bound up with him meeting Anna. I will try to avoid giving the whole game away here by telling you the real ending because I'd like people to read this book but, suffice to say, that the movie chickens out once again, as is common for an American film aiming for a blockbuster status but only serving to cheat its viewers, by giving us a hopeful ending with just a tiny note of tragedy. If you were to examine the premise of why the book was written in the first place, you would see the betrayal of the whole reason why Matheson wrote this classic here in the first place combined with the whole reason why they changed it.<br/><br/>This is a classic example of early American SF being brilliantly subversive and American film taking over and replacing the best ideas with propaganda in order to create what it thinks is the appropriate effect for its audience.<br/><br/>My low rating is because it would have been SO EASY to make a film about this book that was 'edge-of-your-seat' brilliant and heart-wrenching by giving us a genuine human biopic of this man. It also betrays the sheer quality of American SF yet again in a way that reduces the whole genre to the sort of turgid surface-play that you get in Star Trek plotting (quite apart from the often high quality of its hard SF) and which gives the genre a bad reputation in literary circles. Shame on you!"
"greybitsdmg","5","2","4","19 January 2008"," Why were the writers so lazy?
","3rd film adaptation of the book, with each adaptation getting further away from the book. Why fix what isn't broken? Why unnecessarily up-date plot lines which are still perfectly relevant? Why make the man (Neville) and the mutants more than they need to be? Having just read the book, and being a fan of the earlier adaptation 'The Omega Man', I can't (or more cynically, maybe I can) believe what a mess Hollywood can make of a wonderful story. The overuse of CGI actually detracts from the film. The 'dark searchers' are unbelievable. The humans have mutated themselves, gaining super powers, instead of contracting a virus meant to decay them into abysmal wretches, and eventually zombie vampires. <br/><br/>Parts that work - The touching bond between Neville and his dog Samantha, his only companion, and a gift from his late son. When the dog runs off, Will Smith's effort to find/save his dog, forgoing his own safety, brings home his desperate loneliness, and elicits real suspense.<br/><br/>Parts that could have worked - Will Smith's reduction into isolation/stress induced madness. Not enough time taken, or background given. His character flits from sane/intelligent to cuckoo/stupid almost willynilly. It's not Smith's fault, more lazy writing or editing. This for me is the most annoying problem with the film. It's as though not enough thought was given beyond making the special effects work. There are homages to the previous films, and the best bits are the real-life human touches/ sub-plots that made the previous films work so well. but these bits are just that - bits. It needed more care and attention to themes we can connect with, not cartoon creatures. All in all, a wasted chance to make something brilliant."

","this movie has to be one of the best in 2007. will smith portrays the character of Robert Neville perfectly; no other actor would have been able to seem slightly crazy without overdoing it and appearing as insane as the 'infected'. i'll admit, that even though the movie deviates significantly from the original book and past movies, it in no way ruins the theme of a deserted planet.<br/><br/>i especially like the way that it really builds up to the realization of what has happened. i only read the book after i saw the movie, and thought the book was a great inspiration for a great movie. seeing as i had no idea the movie was about a planet ruled by infected mutants, it really kept me guessing for quite a bit of the first half, effectively using flashbacks, recorded news programs, and, of course, the newspaper clippings we see on the wall.<br/><br/>Although the ending may seem weak to some, i thought it was a good way of bringing a bit of closure to the movie, as Robert Neville has lost everything.<br/><br/>all in all, a great movie"
"legendary_nick","8","2","4","15 January 2008"," People say its different from the book....it is but thats not all bad.
","First of all i was so looking forward to seeing this movie and once it came out the cinema i wasn't disappointed. Although many people complain it is too different from the book.<br/><br/>It is VERY different, but in my opinion for all the right reasons. Firstly, the book uses Neville's struggle for sanity alongside the problem of vampires queueing up to eat him outside his house, very effectively. But in a way of him getting drunk, smoking and listening to classical music....hardly movie going material. Also the book contains one part that i was very disappointed the movie didn't include...the stopped watch sequence which in the book is very intense and could have proved terrifying in a movie, but was left out and replaced by *MAJOR SPOILER* the trap and dog death sequence, adding a huge emotional element to the movie. A part of the book involving one of Neville's main tormentors being his ex friend, Ben Cortman, was sadly left out, but i don't believe the vampires/dark seekers would have been convincing or scary enough if they shouted 'Come out Neville!' and threw rocks at his house all night (also the fact that Dash Mihok is even credited for being the 'Alpha Male' is a joke...he is all CGI!?). Leading to another very different element within the film...how they don't know where Neville lives, in my opinion a brilliant change as it adds the on edge factor to the way he passes each night.<br/><br/>The way Will Smith portrays Neville is also very captivating. This is greatly helped by his eccentric and very moving relationship he has with his dog, Sam whom he talks to as if she where a person. The movie makes him out to be a fearless cure finding hero, which is believable (because its Will Smith) but is different to the book, where he is a Joe average guy who just wonders why.<br/><br/>The warehouse sequence in the movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout and especially the tension built by the near total darkness only revealing the dark seekers in partial glimpses added an element the book couldn't, the suspense. During the book they come to his house nightly to terrorise him etc but this suspense kept the audience intrigued. The film has one up on the book in the ways it uses flashbacks....and how Neville's life took the drastic change it had to compared to the limited flashbacks in the novel. The scenes of Neville's shiny new Mustang GT500 racing through a deserted NYC are especially incredible.<br/><br/>Alright so, the ending. The books ending actually explains the title, where Neville is a legend amongst the infected for his killing exploits etc, but the film only makes him out to be a legend for finding a cure!? The character's of Anna and Ethan are also somewhat suspect...how did a young girl and a kid survive when Will Smith is struggling and has a whole cupboard of guns at his disposal. But the end sequence with the storming of his house and what follows is incredibly cinematic and exciting.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was very good, although different from the book. Those fans of the novel who have slammed Hollywood think if a movie exactly true to the book would be exciting and tense and as cinematic as this movie was. My only major complaint would be how CGI is the only method in which the dark seekers are portrayed,which takes away some level of believability in the way they move and act, but it did make for the movie to seem more scary and fast paced. Although many key aspects are different from what made the book great, there are other added factors in the movie that make it too great, in its own right."

I liked how he walked around New York and that there were weeds everywhere, especially coming up from the cracks in the pavement. However, the highlight was that main Zombie who was incredibly angry. He was seething anger and even took it out on the other Zombie's toward the end. I have to wonder what the rest of the world was like. I am getting tired of all the great movies centering around New York City. Why not Albuquerque or Phoenix? Anyway, great movie and the eerie vacant NYC was great visual eye candy!

","First up this film only runs for 90mins. Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing. The fact that its short allows for a roller-coaster 90min ride. The fact that its maybe lacking half an hour means it probably will not be remembered for too long in the memory afterwards.<br/><br/>Great acting by Smith. I had read before this film came out that it did not concentrate enough on the emotional aspects of the main characters plight (being alone for 3 years). I disagree though, I think his relationship with the dog and the store dummies proves this point. I found it heartbreaking at times to watch him flash back to his family. This worked very well and made for more than just a dumb blockbuster.<br/><br/>The zombies are crap though. The CGI annoyed me. I would have preferred 28 days later type zombies better I think. These guys were not scary at all.<br/><br/>Overall I had a blast though. Good fun and a bitter sweet ending, which fitted perfectly. Go see it for yourself.<br/><br/>8/10"

While after sunset, they hid from Dark Seekers in their cozy house without lightÂ… Sounds familiar? Even though the original story, a novel by Richard Matheson, is considered the first novel which depicts a disastrous virus spread leading the world to its end, audience nowadays are bombarded with similar typical Horror B films, say The Living Dead series or Bio Hazard series. Instead of competing against its fellow B movie comrades, I am legend focuses on a more personal issue, the solitude of men in today's world. It precisely pointed out the mental status of a man in solitude, such as compulsively repetitive behaviors or the lack of communication skills, etc. The story is about the sole survivor of the planet. It undoubtedly is a one man show, like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, and not every actor has the guts and talents for it. Luckily, there is Will Smith, whose Oscar winning acting is so genuine and natural that it gives an ache to your heart. From his tired eyes and tears, you know Robert is no longer a character in the movie. He is a man of flesh, just like you and me, who may lose his faith out of despair and regain it by a coincidental revelation...<br/><br/>Only in a simple-plot movie can we find the true value of an actor. Besides setting a barrier between reality and drama by his acting, an actor should also persuade the audience that he is REAL.

No intereresting plot twists, only one character in the movies and the Infected folks were very unrealistic. I mean they have a virus, where do the superpowers come from? And the sounds they make...so the virus must modify and magnify their voices too? Finally, the ending was abrupt and lazy.

"corylol","9","2","4","5 January 2008"," Legendary-- Except for the Ending.
","I Am Legend by the trailers seemed like the typical Summer Action flick, but for the Winter. Going to this movie I expected lots of explosions, a lot of high intensity mutant action sequences, and a feeling like my 10 dollar ticket was put it decent use.<br/><br/>However, I Am Legend far surpassed my expectations by setting a terrific atmosphere and ambiance, by the acting delivered by Will Smith, and also by how interesting the premises in the movie were.<br/><br/>Slight spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The film begins with an interesting start. A viral cure for cancer is found-- but unfortunately ends up killing 90% of the population and turns 5% into mutants. 5% aren't affected but most are eaten by the mutants. So we find Robert Neville, Will Smith's character, all alone in New York trying to survive along with his dog Sam. Neville is trying to find a cure for the mutant virus everyone has while also trying to keep his sanity.<br/><br/>This is where my favorite part is at. His character even sets up mannequins to talk to and talk to about with Sam. Without people to talk to-- Neville fights hard against the loneliness and somewhat futility in living all alone. Will Smith plays this part brilliantly, performing at the top of his game. You can tell he is deeply into his role, which to me created a real sense of realism that lasted throughout the film. He fights off the mutants, captures one and tests his cures for the mutant strain on it. Throughout the film there are flashbacks to Neville's past-- showing the last moments he has with his family (who do not survive). There is a very solid balance of suspense and humanity delivered evenly through the film.<br/><br/>The only real issue for me was the ending of the film.<br/><br/>So the mutant leader sets up a trap to catch Neville. He is caught and darkness falls allowing the mutants to come out from hiding. There is a scuffle and Sam gets infected and dies. It's one of the most painful moments in the film. Neville, in his pain, decides to go on a mutant-killing rampage and is hurt. He gets saved by a woman and her child who heard Neville over the radio. The woman wants to go to a safe colony in New Hampshire. Mutants attack, Neville finds that the cure for the mutants is in the blood of the mutant he captured, and then he gives the solution to the woman. To save the woman and child he grabs a grenade and blows himself and the mutants up.<br/><br/>To me the ending fell short because the whole film had a great build-up that was begging for an ending that gave Neville a greater finale. Though his act was incredibly heroic, the ending killed the main (and the only major) character in less than 5 seconds.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought that the film was fun to watch and a different action film than the rest. It was a different mutant/zombie film than the rest as well. And though the ending 10 minutes wasted a little strong energy-- I felt that this would be a film going on my DVD wish list for sure."
"chaosrampant","5","2","4","5 January 2008"," The last man on earth deserved a lot better.
","I Am Legend, the third incarnation of Matheson's eponymous novel, after The Last Man on Earth with the great Vincent Price and The Omega Man with the not so great Charlton Heston, had all the makings of a modern day classic, but, naturally, they managed to blow everything. The first third of the movie is very good, not great, but it sets the tone. The CGI of a barren Manhattan with overgrown foliage and wild animals is eerie and very effective. Then BLAM Will Smith comes riding a Ford Mustang (or whatever that car was). It just felt so out of place IMO, even though it's a nod to the previous Legend installment, The Omega Man. It's the kind of stuff that's screaming Hollywood, and even though it IS a Hollywood production, they had a chance to prove that they can do a lot better than glossy product placement. But no. This is very indicative of how the potential I Am Legend carried was totally mishandled. You're making a post-apocalyptic horror movie. You want to communicate the despondency of a a world without future. And if the Bob Marley songs were a smart and emotional contradiction to the empty streets of New York, a Ford Mustang has no place. Save it for Fast and Furious...<br/><br/>On the other hand, Will Smith WAS Neville and his performance effortlessly carries most of what makes this movie worthwhile. He was chewing scenery for the first half of the movie with ease. A fantastic performance, worthy of an A-list actor if I ever saw one. I wouldn't ever imagine the titular Bad Boy would be capable of portraying insanity and desperation so well, but Smith just exceeded all expectations. The guy just looked like he had lived 3 years alone, his eyes communicated that. The parts where he's talking to the record store dummies stood out for me. You can't tell if he's knowingly talking to them out of genuine loneliness or if he's losing it.<br/><br/>Even the first glimpse of the much maligned CGI monsters wasn't THAT bad. I was expecting a lot worse, and I sighed in relief. Little did I know, that the worse was yet to come. Anyway, the scene where Neville goes looking for his dog in a dark, dingy basement, and stumbles upon a ""zombie"" hive, with the infected ""sleeping"" up right with their backs turned was very creepy. But for *beep*'s sake, the director had absolutely no clue about building suspense and tension. Less is more. It's the essence of horror. He needn't go all the way back to Nightmare on Elm Street or Alien to study how the less the baddie appears on screen, the more terrifying he becomes in the mind's eye. A look at recent British horror flick The Descent and how they handled their creatures, would have solved many his problems. Instead of leaving more to the imagination and showing the infected on rare occasions or for a few seconds at a time (like the first time we see them in the basement), which would also mask the cringe-worthy CGI, they show the infected screaming, running around, beating each other, climbing on top of cars, street lights, even friggin walls. I never felt tension or claustrophobia building, when we were expecting the infected to attack. Nothing like Alien and how you're expecting the Giger-ish nightmare to leap from every dark corner and tear the hero apart. Just Will Smith being hunted by pixels. Or dozens of Gollums. I was expecting Frodo to come to the rescue any time.<br/><br/>Then we have the final third of the movie. The second one was already bordering ""meh"" territory, with Shrek monologues, incomplete backstory and plot holes large enough to drive a Land Rover through. But the third part just takes the cake. I stood there, scratching my head. What the *beep* did I just watch? Some gun fight play, the infected climbing walls, Smith going down to the basement and VOILA, the antidote he was working on is ready. How convenient. Then we get a laughably BAD scene where the Alpha Male is trying to break down a glass wall with his head. I think I lost a couple hundred brain cells right there. Worse than smoking pot. Frankly the whole house invasion should have been a preliminary to the final action. It just felt inadequate.<br/><br/>Anyways, that's my rant. I didn't go in expecting a masterpiece, but I am Legend was so disappointing because it HAD potential. This was no kiddie stuff. No Harry Potter or Golden Compass. Of course that has more to do with the amazing source material, thanks to Matheson's novel, but still. Add to that, Smith's excellent performance, the eerie streets of Manhattan, the horror of defending against hordes of infected that may or may not have traces of humanity left in them. It sounds like a mix between 28 Days Later and Cast Away, but it's less than the sum of its parts. In the hands of a more competent director, without the blockbuster excesses and the natural dumbing down to cater to the average joe of a Hollywood production, this could have been a modern day classic.<br/><br/>5/10 and it may go down on repeat viewings."

","I finally saw it, and I am so disappointed. :( I expected much better.<br/><br/>First of all, it is too short a movie. Secondly, it is indeed very much different from the book and all the other movies based on the book which I liked a lot, such as ""The Omega Man"". Thirdly, I despised the needless addition of the dog, and I knew exactly where THAT was going in the plot.<br/><br/>The mutants were just silent digital FX creatures instead of characters we knew and either hated or felt sorry for. They all were people the doctor, Neville, (main character) had known and they morphed into something bad, that in the earlier films. In all those other versions Neville spent his time hunting the mutants and killing them, and at night the mutants tried to kill him; they knew exactly where he lived but could not break in. But in this film, when they found out where he lived these mutants, who now have super human strength, can climb walls like spiders, attack in huge swarms like insects, and were able to take apart his house in short order. They are also good at mindlessly smashing their heads against windows and glass walls to break in, but they never say a word.<br/><br/>The entire story was truncated; there should have been at least 20-25 minutes more of plot, as there was in the other versions.<br/><br/>At one point late in the movie Will Smith, who at least did a fine job acting, started doing Shrek shtick while a video was playing. *rolls eyes* I almost walked out. I am just amazed I disliked it so.<br/><br/>Smith's acting was very good, but I could not wait for this to end even though it was the shortest of all the versions."

","When i went to go and see the movie ""I am legend"", I was anticipating an exciting, action packed film, and above all else a change from what I have been previously used to with previous zombie/apocalyptic movies. 'I Am Legend' was none of these.<br/><br/>There was an extraordinary amount of hype building up to this movie, with posters all around London, adverts being repeated continuously on the television, and reviews saying that this film is brilliant and a 'must see'. I myself regard Will Smith as being a good actor, who is best suited for comedies, but also has an ability to be convincing in serious roles of films. I really liked him in films such as Bad Boy's, Independence Day and Ali. In i am legend, Smith just did not deliver the goods on a performance scale and to be honest, i was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>The film itself lacked any fantastic plot, it was hazy and didn't explain things enough to the audience. The scene where Smith is exercising and doing pull ups without his shirt on (included in the trailer), had nothing to do with the film, and was obviously just to show everyone his figure that he had obviously worked very hard on getting.<br/><br/>The zombies in the film looked too computer generated and to me weren't convincing enough.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I feel that perhaps Will Smith thinks too highly of himself, and that he can now get away with making films such as I am Legend, which will gross huge amounts of money, and do all of this by himself, with no supporting cast what-so-ever.<br/><br/>My rating is 2/10.

Will Smith has no one to talk to so spends the movie talking to Manicans who are slightly more sophisticated that Wilson. The best Actor in this movie is not Will Smith - but Sam - Samantha is played by the German Shepard Dog - she steals every scene.

"andrew-413","5","2","4","29 December 2007"," A Missed Opportunity
","As a fan of science-fiction I really did expect to enjoy this, but found it to be a massive let-down instead. There are some good moments but they are unfortunately few and far between. Basically, a lot of the movies' premise does not check out. How, when you're the last survivor of a city, do you still have electricity (and to watch DVD's on - surely you're utilizing as little as possible)? How on earth do you still manage to obtain fresh water? Food in tins - in my experience - doesn't tend to last longer than 3 years but Will looks physically stronger than ever before. Will must really enjoy pumping gas as he's driving his Mustang and some massive SUV around the city for much of the film. Of all the practical vehicles he could have chosen, these must rank last. Point is, if these critical survival issues really were based around some inch of realism, he'd surely be much worse off than he was.<br/><br/>Will also wasn't very credible as this scientist attempting to discover the Zombie cure, while at the same time something of a highly-trained Navy Seal, excellent with his weapons and a master of self-defense. The two disciplines are surely at odds with each other.<br/><br/>The pace of the film was also terribly drawn-out, there are periods where little of interest happens. Really bizarre. The characters (the few that inhabit the film) are poorly developed and the entire film just comes off as something very superficial when it really could have been much better developed. For example, Will is mentally unstable at some point when he does his usual shopping trip and is surrounded by mannequins inside of the store, notices one that's new, and has an internal conundrum over how to introduce himself. This I can appreciate: he's been without any human company for 3 years and has seen a lot of tragic events unfold. His means of relating to human life is retarded due to a lack of development. He's a little 'toasted' psychologically. However, later in the film when he meets 2 other survivors he seems within a very short period of time to adjust to his new visitors. It's like going to a psychiatrist for one session and being cured of your mental illness: unrealistic. There were many other loose ends that just never got tied up.<br/><br/>A real disappointment for something that could have - with more depth and intelligent rationale - been the movie of the year.<br/><br/>Oh, and lastly, Will plays some Bob Marley to his briefly-featured female companion near the end and asks her if she's heard of 'Marley' before (as this music brings him mentally closer to his family). Bizarrely, she asks if he means 'Damian' (whom is actually Bob's son). WTF? Is there anyone on planet earth whom can understand English who's not heard of Uncle Bob? I sincerely doubt it. Sci-fi meets Bob Marley: a peculiarity untouched!"
"refresh_daemon","6","2","4","28 December 2007"," Continuing improvement from Smith, but the film fails to fully exploit its potential
","Will Smith is quite the man. It seems like every movie he stars in is destined to reap enormous financial rewards in the US and outside the US, regardless of whether it's good or not. As such, I imagine that he has the luxury to pick and choose his projects. When I heard that this film would be made yet again. A previous incarnation, The Omega Man, with which this film shares more than the original novel exists. I've also heard that there an even older film adaptation, but know little of it, except that The Omega Man has taken some cues from it.<br/><br/>As it stands in this film, the story was clearly made more shiny for the clean-scrubbed character that Smith usually plays. Not that Neville in this film doesn't have issues, but that he's not nearly as complex as the novel, or even previous incarnations. Most of the film plays as a Cast Away meets 28 Days Later.... In fact, in some ways, Legend is more an American successor to 28 Days Later, just with less humans and zombies.<br/><br/>Thanks to the overall simplification of the story, I Am Legend actually turns out to be quite a different piece from the novel it's based on, focusing more on what happens to people that are stuck alone, as well as with disillusionment from years of failure and loss. Sometimes this simplification comes at the cost of believability, as some of Neville's flashbacks to before the loss suffer from contrived melodrama in order to keep some it's ""cleanness"".<br/><br/>Although this weakens the story considerably, the movie still provides Smith a place to show the growth of his acting, as he's been slowly, but steadily, improving since his big box office debut in Bad Boys (and his oft-forgotten work in Six Degrees of Separation). Although he still plays a version of Will Smith, he's grown the ability to convey contrary messages and personal irony just through variations in his charisma, swagger and vulnerability. The rest of the film is technically sound, although the ""infected"" fail to impress as they appear like a poor cross between the titular character from The Mummy and the maddened rage zombies from 28 Days Later... It's unfortunate that the science-fiction vampires from the book never made it out.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is essentially another Will Smith blockbuster film, with much in common with Smith's previous I, Robot in that it stands a watered down adaptation of a complex work, fit into Smith's image and with complexity removed for easy consumption by the masses. While it might be entertaining enough for an in theater romp, it fails to deliver the substance that the source material contains and remains a passing affair. I don't think anyone will really hate this movie except fanboys (and fangirls) of the novel. Most will be temporally entertained and move on (although the film does have something to say, albeit how little a voice it speaks with, about the role of hope in sustaining humanity). Not essential. Not necessary. At the same time, not bad either. Here's to hoping that Hancock is better. 6/10."

","I just saw this film and I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I expected some kind of cross between ""The Last Man On Earth"", and ""The Omega Man"" (the 2 previous film versions of this story), but instead it was more like a cross between ""28 Days Later"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"". I didn't like the fact that Neville really wasn't a hunter of the infected, like in the previous films. In this one he is just trying to survive while trying to cure the virus. He only really kills the beasts when he is forced to, and they really weren't very easy to kill. I think there should have been more action in this film, and more interactions between Neville and the ""undead"". Having said all of this, Will Smith definitely turns in one of his finest acting performances, if not his finest, and there are some great moments in this film. Overall, I would say this film is definitely worth watching, but could have been much better."
"RoninDeVamas","5","2","4","28 December 2007"," ""I Am Legend"" seems to hold back
","For a post-apocalyptic horror film, ""I Am Legend"" seems to hold back from the intense drama that one would expect. It does this is several ways: <br/><br/>The Dark Seekers (as the monsters were named during production) aren't as developed of a threat to truly give a sense of danger and tension to the film. They are presented as one-dimensional, serving primarily as the enemy to Robert Neville without developing a firm hero/villain relationship. The Dark Seekers are simply characterized as being completely inhuman and any sign to the contrary is made void. It is shown that Robert wants to cure them, but there isn't much emphasis on the humanity that he sees in the Dark Seekers as an important plot point. Had there been greater development on the Dark Seekers as characters, ""I Am Legend"" would've been a better movie.<br/><br/>What I will compliment on is the psychological drama that Will Smith and the filmmakers have portrayed in Robert Neville and his disconnection from the rest of humanity. His interaction with the mannequins were humorous, but the lifelessness of the dolls made such moments very eerie and shows you just how close to the edge Robert really is. Again, the psychological drama would have expanded and a new level of anxiety would have been reached had the Dark Seekers been developed as more human characters and Robert Neville been driven to save what humanity was left in them.<br/><br/>One aspect of ""I Am Legend"" that I do have a discrepancy against is how quick the film ended upon the arrival of Anna and Ethan. They didn't become involved in Robert Neville's efforts and so there wasn't the development of psychological attachment that would've made Anna and Ethan truly significant characters.<br/><br/>The reason for Robert Neville to become a ""legend"" in this interpretation doesn't seem to ring in consideration with everything that he has gone through. The legacy that Robert Neville should be remembered for shouldn't necessarily be the cure itself, but the drama that he underwent to obtain it. Unfortunately, the emphasis on this major plot point seems to be lost in favor of focusing on Robert Neville as being ""the last man on Earth."" <br/><br/>Rating: *** - Good"

"Jonny_Numb","8","2","4","27 December 2007"," The Man Who Dreaded Sundown
","Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" has undergone such high-profile film adaptations (from 3 different eras) with diminishing success, that the terms of ""faithful adaptation"" and ""remake"" have become fairly absurd. ""The Last Man On Earth"" (1964), co-scripted by Matheson (under a pseudonym) and starring Vincent Price was the first; ""The Omega Man"" (1971) re-imagined the vampire tale as a Hollywood action flick with Charlton Heston. Now, in 2007, Francis Lawrence (""Constantine""and a million music videos) has used the original title for a semi-faithful adaptation blended with old-school tension-building tactics and carefully rationed CGI.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: a plague has wiped out most of the population (exempting a infinitesimal number of immune cases), and survivor Robert Neville spends his days foraging for food and supplies in a desolate New York City, returning to his fortified, barricaded house to elude the ""infecteds"" that roam the streets by night. He believes himself the only survivor of the plague (here caused by a cancer-cure side effect) and devotes his own efforts to concocting a serum to reverse the plague's effects.<br/><br/>I was not a fan of the overblown ""Constantine,"" but ""Legend"" shows Lawrence's technique in a more confident place. There is plenty of CG spectacle on displayeasily the most stunning I've seen to dateand while the Hollywood model is to exploit this to the point of overkill, Lawrence balances it against scenes of quiet solitude and suspense-sequences that can be intensely claustrophobic and ominously open. The landscape of a plague-ravaged New York is at once a stunning marvel of digital imaging and jaw-dropping isolation and horrora maze of car-clogged streets and human desolation.<br/><br/>As Neville, Will Smith veers away from the cute and comedic roles that have permeated his career, and proves he can carry a film that's essentially a downbeat, one-man show with great success. Unlike the chest-thumping machismo of Charlton Heston, Smith's Neville conveys an authenticeven sadsense of loneliness, loss, andwhen two survivors cross his pathan awkward, clumsy re-integration into normal human interaction. Even the scenes between Neville and his dog, Sam, possess a pathos because the relationship is crucial to Neville's own sanity and day-to-day function.<br/><br/>Yet if the post-plague scenes (set in 2012) contain a visceral, urgent quality, then the fragmented flashbacks (spliced in at deliberate moments) of a panic-stricken mob seeking passage out of the City when the plague hits recreates the panic and fear of a post-9/11, post-Katrina scenario of a world goingand goneto hell. These sceneslike the CGIare presented in intense snippets, shot in a cinema-verite style that maximizes their impact. Lawrence places us INSIDE the panicked mob, and the effect is absolutely chilling.<br/><br/>The suspense is also frequently brought to an unbearable swellwhen Neville has to retrieve Sam from an abandoned, pitch-dark bank, the tension builds beautifully (as an ironic counterpoint, the world outside is bright with afternoon light). Same goes for a scene in which Neville falls prey to a booby-trap and must crawl back to his car as the sun rapidly sets and ravenous ""plague dogs"" spring in his direction (a particularly excellent marriage of old-school suspense tactics and current technology).<br/><br/>On the downside, the ""infecteds"" are largely lacking in personality, reduced to howling mutants with little more than fresh meat in mindthough it's better than the all-to-eloquent existentialist of ""The Omega Man."" And near the end, we're expected to believe that Neville has wired the area surrounding his house (underground, even) with hi-test explosives. And the film concludes on a note that, while satisfactory for this particular narrative, misses the point of Matheson's novel. But that aside, ""I Am Legend"" is a thoroughly satisfying entertainmenta carefully controlled mix of sci-fi spectacle and action, a strong performance by Smith, and a thoughtful meditation on what mankind's actions can wind up reaping.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"
"MissLadyLoki","2","2","4","23 December 2007"," Don't expect it to be a cinematic legend
","As a fan of Will Smith and sci-fi/action movies, this movie was just plain utterly horrible for a myriad of reasons. First off, the script was horrible. I mean, Robert Neville (Smith) spent his time talking to mannequins for no apparent reason. Yes, mannequins, like the kind you'd see in stores such as Macy's. When Neville does have human contact with a girl named Anna, their conversations are poorly written, not to mention their interactions with one another was of equal lacking and just painful to watch.<br/><br/>Second, the mutant-vampire things or whatever they were had been a fine example of excellent computer animation, but there was never enough explained about them. For example, every time there was something explaining the virus that caused their mutation was either a quick flash from a paper or garbled out by other sounds, with became very annoying. There was also numerous inconsistencies in the story, too. If the vampires had lost all human intelligence and were just a bunch of wild monsters, then where did they get the intelligence and cunning to make a trap that was identical to one Neville had set up earlier in a different spot and to move one of the mannequins to the spot of the trap? A story flaw in the raw is how I see it.<br/><br/>Third, although I'm normally not a nit-picker on camera angles and sound effects, but they were just utter garbage. When a vampire would be shown, the camera would all of a suddenly go into jerky camera movements that made it impossible to see what was going on and even left me dizzy. As for the sound effects, one second it would be so quiet you can hear a pin drop, but then, out of no where, the sound would be booming with vampire roaring or explosions so loud it's enough to make you jump out of your skin.<br/><br/>Finally, to put the frosting on the cake, the ending ranks with one of the worst I've seen yet. Besides Neville killing himself, which I found pointless, Anna and her son went up to the refugee camp in Vermont she had spoken about earlier and walking into the walled-in small town. Then, the screen went black. I found it to be highly dissatisfying and I can see exactly why I said in the silent theater when the credits began to roll ""Wow. This movie was bad."" All in all, this movie was just a waste of my time.

","I saw Omega Man, with Charlton Heston in the title role, in the 70s and enjoyed it, as an interpretation of human self destruction and based, a also, on the novel, I Am Legend. The new film's script has a depth in characters and culture with writing that presents a real possible result of human developed catastrophe. Francis Lawrence's direction was very good and the editing was fantastic, keeping me on the edge of my seat through the film. The settings and special effects made one, almost believe, that an actual city was used to film the movie after an intensive makeover. The performance of Will Smith, in a mostly solo performance, is very Oscar worthy. The additional characters were great, falling into place as comfortable pieces in a wonderful sci-fi puzzle.<br/><br/>In summary, a most enjoyable afternoon viewing."

","Unfortunately, a lot of 'scary' movies have 'evil' as the plot point. Like demons etc. They also usually contain foul language or nudity. If you have to use foul language to make a point, you're an uneducated idiot. Anything can be said without swearing. Nudity is never necessary. There is no reason to have it in a film. If you want to see a nude woman, look at your wife. Now, with all that being said, this is simply a great movie. Will Smith is a great actor. I took my teenage girls to see the movie, they were nice and freaked out by it. The way a good scary movie should be. Plenty of jumpy moments to keep you on your seat. You'll jump, you'll scream, you'll cry. You'll see it again and then buy the DVD when it comes out. I just hope they have a great special features on the DVD. (ie: LOTR special features. which will never be matched)"
"ngojlife","7","2","4","20 December 2007"," Smith gives I Am Legend added boost
","Will Smith can hold the screen all on his own. People that are looking for a faithful adaptation of the Mathenson's novel will surely be disappointed but it's a movie, what do you expect? Not everything that comes straight from the book can work cinematically, as long as you don't change the feel of the book, then tweak it to your pleasure.<br/><br/>Robert Neville (Smith) is a scientific military doctor living in an abandoned New York City, trying to find a cure that has wiped out 99 percent of the earth's population. The other 1% are either dead or zombie like.<br/><br/>He keeps his sanity because of the routine he goes through, whether it's saying hi to mannequins at a video store or talking to his dog Sam to keep him company.<br/><br/>Smith has to play Neville with such conviction and believability because weird things can happen when you have no human contact for over three years. He does that with much gusto. One of the better performances of the year.<br/><br/>Sure, people that love the book probably will hate the film. Others will question how a drama for almost 2/3's of the film now becomes an action flick. People will also ask, if Neville really does believe he's the last man standing, why does he continue to try to save these Voldemorts or vampires or whatever they want to call themselves. But you don't ask those questions when you're watching this movie. You'll be too into the world of Neville, where New York City has become so desolate, and the only way to save himself is to find a cure to save these things, whatever you want to call them."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","4","19 December 2007"," Smith assures his ""Legend""ary status
","Think about if you were producing a movie about the last man on earth. You *have* to cast one actor. Who do you cast? The answer is clearly Will Smith, ""I Am Legend"" aside. If the human race was 99.9% wiped out or turned evil by a mutating virus that was initially a cure for cancer, I would personally volunteer Will Smith as the last man alive. He could have my place.<br/><br/>Smith plays Robert Neville, a former military officer that before the virus outbreak was the leading figure on a defense plan in case something happened, and afterward is humanity's only hope for a cure. By day Smith and his dog hunt and wait at one spot for any survivors and by night they must remain confined to their home as the infected ""super"" humans have violent tendencies. Basically he has to survive long enough to find a cure and maybe he can fix the human race. The part just begs for Smith's resume (Independence Day, I-Robot)<br/><br/>With the film focusing on almost nothing but Smith, he has to be interesting or the film fails. Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) helps Smith succeed by using suspense and a writing team of Mark Protosevich and the acclaimed Akiva Goldsman keeps the facts unraveling at the perfect pace for keeping up interest level in mere background alone. The audience is intrigued in Smith's every endeavor.<br/><br/>The visuals of this post-apocalyptic Manhattan are astounding and Smith takes command of it brilliantly, yet his character is portrayed as very emotional and unstable, unlike many previous films in which he is in the business of being ""the man."" It's believable and bad ass.<br/><br/>Any actor who can take a film like this that's so basic and make it any bit good and successful financially clearly is a legend. If this doesn't cement Smith's status as one of the greatest stars of this generation (right next to if not above Tom Cruise) then it will just take another box-office shattering action flick to prove it."
"rstud07","7","2","4","17 December 2007"," Heartfelt but Plot Failure
","I went and saw this movie absolutely excited as it was a remake of Omega Man(1971). I thought will smith would do a great job with the character as he seems to in all of his roles. I started off generally impressed by the displays of the empty city and the scenes of him living for his own. I thought the way he rationalized his singular existence with the use of the mannequins allowed for several of the loneliest scenes in the movie. His relationship with the dog was beautiful and i thought his world was something we could relate to in spite of us never knowing his realm of existence. <br/><br/>My problem came from the second half of the movie. All of the cinematography was excellent and will smith does a good job of acting but I felt his performance was weaker in the second half. He seems to lose his edge and becomes a weaker character- as if not the same person and i found no correlation between his change in character and the direction of the plot. Thus, i was forced to believe his change was a failure by smith, and not an eloquent piece of cinematic work. The movie seemed to be going in a normal direction until his late night scene on the pier and from that point on the plot nose-dives. In not looking up the time of the movie i expected a bit over two hours and was genuinely surprised by the brevity of it. I felt the ending came too soon and was unnecessary. The movie lives up to its name to a degree but the way in which it gets its name derives from a weak attempt at an existential statement. The movie had to follow the book to an extent but here was a case where the director needed to step back, think, and realize that the original may not be the best. <br/><br/>I wish the second half could have lived up to my expectations like the first half did. Still a decent movie in terms of message- not so much in terms of the actually story and plot."

","Oh my God! This movie is an amazing peace of cinema. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I had no doubt in my mind that it wouldn't be a disappointment. And I was right. This movie was great on every level. The acting was phenomenal, visual effects awesome, storyline great, and did a great job on always making your eyes stick to the screen. Just the fact that this whole thing started out with good intentions and it turned into what it has become is just sad. I Am Legend is one of Will Smith's best peaces of work, acting wise. Even though he talks to a dog most of the time; you can just see his emotion and rage and sorrow in his words and face. All around this movie has to be the best mainstream movie this year. Go see it, i highly recommend it. 10/10."
"qtarantinofan","8","2","4","16 December 2007"," ""I Am Legend"" may not be for the kiddies
","Will Smith is an amazing actor. Seeing him in his other movies, I was curious to see how he would act being the last man on earth. He does a good job convincing the audience that what happened was serious and not too pleasant. However, when I saw this movie, I was expecting few ""pop-up"" scenes. That is exactly what we got. Seeing this movie, I wouldn't think that any kids under the age of 12 should see this film. Personally, I believe the film should have been rayed PG-13 for some intense frightening scenes. I found this movie to be very unsettling throughout. There's not a lot of happy things that occur in this film. Some scenes are very emotional while other scenes are very frightening, suspenseful, and intense. However, this is a good film to see if you're bored and in the mood to go out. This is not a good film for you to try to calm down and relax. However, I did find this movie to be a work of art. The perfect word to describe this movie is decent."
"brrryce","9","2","4","15 December 2007"," Not Your Typical Blockbuster
","Will Smith, in my estimation, is an amazing actor. This movie simply drives home that point, for me. The fact that much of the movie has him alone onstage is a testament to that. But, I've got to hand it to the director, too. He refuses to hand out any easy answers. The flashbacks hint at the tragedy that befell Robert Neville's (Smith) young family, but don't linger overmuch. And Neville's erratic behavior totally fits for someone so alone for so long. My favorite scene is when Neville loses it because something is out of place in his city. It's terrifying and yet poignant. But, getting back to the 'no easy answers' assertion, I think the director allows two delusions by two groups to co-exist without validating either. Neville, in my opinion, is deluded when he thinks the ""Dark Seekers"" have lost all humanity.<br/><br/>BIG SPOILER I believe Neville is so blind to humanity regaining its status as the predominant species that he neglects to see many of his troubles stem from his kidnapping of a Dark Seeker girl -- which enrages her family/significant other. That fits the book's premise - that Neville is the last of a breed, killing and striking terror into those who represent the next stage of evolution.<br/><br/>He becomes ""legend"" with his terroristic actions.<br/><br/>The delusion of the Dark Seekers is that Neville comprehends the full extent of his actions from their perspective.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd much rather see this film again, rather than something like Juno, which purports to be a smartie, artie flick and flaunts its lack of scale and explosions, but is not an iota sharper. There are layers in this understated big film that speak to an intelligence not often seen in blockbusters. You can eat your popcorn and think, too. How cool is that?"

","Remember when Will Smith was the king of summer? This comes at the end of that and is anything but a crowd-pleaser. In fact, it's one of the most downbeat major motion pictures I can think of.<br/><br/>It's based on Richard Mathson's 1954 novel of the same name, which also inspired The Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth, as well as Night of the Living Dead.<br/><br/>This movie sat in development for decades, as Warner Brothers had owned the rights to the story since 1970.<br/><br/>Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his script The Cell. His first take took place in San Francisco but was closer to The Omega Man than this film.<br/><br/>All sorts of people were going to star - Tom Cruise, Michael Douglas and Mel Gibson - with Ridley Scott as director, but the studio wanted Arnold Schwarzenegger. The studio came to regret giving Scott creative control, as his movie was dark and had a downer ending. They were looking for action figures.<br/><br/>It took nearly another decade until Schwarzenegger became the producer of I Am Legend for a brief time, bringing on Michael Bay as director and Will Smith as star. Nothing happened there and a few years later, Akiva Goldsman and director Francis Lawrence (Constantine, four of The Hunger Games films) came on board.<br/><br/>Between closing big parts of New York City and a $5 million dollar Brooklyn Bridge scene, the film just feels huge and empty at the same time. And a week into filming, Lawrence decided to scrap the practical monsters for CGI. Trust me, time has not been kind to the effects in this film. I am a fan of how they sound, though, as Mike Patton of the bands Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Fantomas (and a few hundred other lineups) did some great vocal work for the bad guys.<br/><br/>The film concerns a genetically re-engineered measles virus - once a cure for cancer - that killed 90% of the world's popular and turned the rest into mutants called Darkseekers who are basically vampires.<br/><br/>Three years later, US Army virologist Lt. Col. Robert Neville (Smith) lives the same day, day after day, alone with his dog Sam in the heart of Manhattan. Nearly the entire film is spent with Smith slowly going crazy, defending what's left of the world and talking to anything that looks remotely human.<br/><br/>While the ending of this film isn't anything like the book, it wasn't the only one filmed. There was another version where Neville and the Alpha Darkseeker come to an understanding about the female in the lab. This one is the happy ending, but didn't feel like it fit the spirit of the film.<br/><br/>One of the things I really liked is that most of the art on the walls of Neville's apartment has been rescued from museums. If you're the last man on Earth, why not grab something from the Museum of Modern Art?"

","I am Legend is a great movie. It won't be too everyones taste and is inarguably slow, but for good reason. Its a beautiful movie in a strange sort of way and although short of cast it makes up in the sense of relationship between a broken and lonely man with the one thing he has left. You feel the sense of disaster quickly and its bold however all the way through I got a feeling that something was missing. Not a lot happens but there are some emotional and heartfelt moments to make up for this. There is also some thought provoking moments to create the idea of what Nevilles situation would really be like. Although the plot is simple and short its effective, this is mainly down to the way it was shot. The major plus of this movie is Will Smith, he is superb. He acts incredibly and takes his role to another dimension. The major flaw happens to be its lack of loyalty to its source, Richard Matheson's novel. It strays a little to far in my opinion."

I believe the idea of the film was to tell scientist not to play with chemicals because a lot of things can go wrong. In I am legend they were trying to find a cure for cancer and made everyone take a vaccine. The vaccine ended up having a very bad effect on people and started a virus that didn't have a cure. Maybe the film was trying to tell us that they dont test there vaccines or if they do its only on animals. In the film after the outbreak the town was closed off and blown up Dr. Neville(will smith) comes out during the day time to find food and other things that he might need but at night he needed to make sure he was in the house and safe. Sometimes he would have flashback of his daughter marly (willow smith) and Zoe (Salli Richardson-Whitfield). The actors did an outstanding jobs keeping character of the roles that were given to them.

"HorrorFanatic4Life","8","0","0","9 March 2019"," Not your typical post-apocalyptic movie
","Of all the post-apocalyptic movies I've seen, this one is probably my favorite in that it shows so much emotion you really get a feel for the loneliness and fear that comes with being one of the last survivors. This has got to be the best performance by Will Smith I've ever seen. Most movies of this nature are a whole lot of zombie chases and gore. This one is a bit more emotional than the rest, which is what makes it so great.<br/><br/>Neville's relationship with his dog Sam really gets to you in a lot of ways and is probably the best part of the movie for me. You feel glad that he at least isn't completely alone, but also sad seeing that has been his only companion for the last few years. He really plays that part well showing his gradual loss of his social side, especially when Anna and her son make their appearance. Obviously the saddest part of the movie is when he loses his only companion to the blood thirsty zombies. You really feel for Neville when he has to make the tough call of ending Sam's life after being bitten.<br/><br/>The movie definitely kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, but I will have to say the zombies were lacking a bit in the CGI and could have been a lot creepier. Most zombies from other similar movies I've seen still have qualities from the person that it used to be. The ones in this movie don't even look like they used to be human in any way. I get this picks up three years later, but it's hard to believe they evolved that much and have lived off of nothing seeing as nothing else has seemed to survive for that long so you're kind of left wondering how they've been surviving. The fact that Neville was able to make it that far with his setup and they didn't even get through one time is a bit unrealistic. The fact that some parts of NYC definitely look post-apocalyptic, but other details make it seem like it just happened yesterday make it seem even more unrealistic. Those few parts are the only downfall for me.<br/><br/>Other than those few holes, this movie was still great overall in that it was scary, emotional and different from the rest. I would still recommend to anyone."

At the same time, he is wary of other predators; a lion, from the zoo I imagine, and the virus-infected zombie-humans. They cannot stand sunlight, and hence stick to the dark areas and hunts at night. Dr. Neville has built his daily routine in such a way that his official business is done by dusk, and he's at his palatial home watching movies with his dog at night.<br/><br/>All that loneliness must get to him. Smith gives plenty of evidence of his acting abilities, which are easy to overlook because of his inherent likeability and charisma. He is utterly convincing as a survivalist, as a man who has a soldier's bearing wired into him, that his original role as a medical researcher seems to get overshadowed. It is perfectly plausible that Neville has gone a little bit insane, and the loss of his dog in the second act starts a chain of events that ends with a breathless third act, which while still excellent, didn't exactly measure up, but only because my hopes were so high from the quality I saw up until then.<br/><br/>Post-apocalyptic New York is not what I expected. It both was and was not a deserted wasteland. The stark contrast between the most modern, urban cityscape in the world and the forestedness in the aftermath of the virus is beautiful and unsettling. A lot of credit must go to the visual effects team for seamlessly blending the city with the post-apocalyptic landscape. I couldn't detect any trace of fakery in any of the city scenes, and combined with the cinematography, I am Legend provides an excellent showcase of how to portray an environment to set the tone of the movie. The only complaint I had was the zombies didn't look threatening or different once they were up close.<br/><br/>The story starts to fall apart slightly with the introduction of other players into the screenplay. Only Neville is sketched out fully, and the portrayal of zombies while doesn't fall short of standards, is not anything special either. The movie fails to combine the excellent characterization of Neville and the city with other elements and characters that should have organically moved the story forward. Instead, the additions were sudden and pushes the story into unnatural speed, disrupting the steady, comfortable flow with hard jerks forward. The movie experience falters here, on an otherwise brilliant depiction of a dystopian story.<br/><br/>Direction: 7
Screenplay: 7.5
Acting: 7.5
Cine'tography/VE: 8

Overall: 7.5<br/><br/>VERDICT: Will Smith excels as a lone man in this dystopian thriller, excellent visual effects and worth watching."

","The first two-thirds of I Am Legend are superior to the fast-paced, action-oriented final 35 minutes.

The ending, while not a complete cop-out, diverges from that of Matheson's book and feels a little too convenient and facile. For most of the movie, character drives plot.

","The world is once again in its post apocalyptic form on the big screen, and this time we are graced by the performance of Will Smith. A gripping narrative and a plot to match, this movie propels itself already to a higher place than many other movies that fall short on this aspect of cinematography. The formula for a great cinematic adventure is concocted by the choir of isolation and the quest for human contact begins. However, the world is now very dangerous, filled with newer threats than human greed for power and conquest. We have a chance to explore this forlorn, zombie infested world through the eyes of a brave man and his faithful dog friend. This movie, through on surface wears the guise of your typical z movie, is much more than that. The story is not sublime or hackneyed, and runs on the fuel of human innate desire for interaction. There are scenes that evince the onset of isolation and it's adverse effects, as Will traverses the ruins of the city that was once bustling with life. We are engaged deeply into the story because of how well the lead characters, particularly the protagonist, stay true to color and never give an non idiosyncratic performance. There is plenty of action to satisfy your cravings for some good ol' shoot-em-up, but that's just the icing on the cake. It's much more than that. It's a thrilling visual experience that doesn't skip a beat when it comes to special CGI effects to enhance the flavor of the film, leaving us some very interesting gut bursting, zombie annihilation. The movie juggles different themes of scarcity and abundance, isolation and accompaniment, destruction and creation. Yes, it's true that the world is wiped clean of human life and the busy, booming industrial gears of human society have come to a grinding halt, but nature finds a way. In the ruins of the botched cities, we see nature beginning to weave life as vines corral around the remnants of concrete structures, trees propping up in unlikely places, and cars are turned into a haven for critters. It makes people question how pragmatic our notions of necessity and desire have become, and how wrongfully we associate the two together in a world of materialism. The movie skillfully and hierarchically distinguishes the needs of a human being from the superficial desires that one could live without. The survivor must survive at all cost, not only the ravages of the virus that turns people into zombies, but the mind-numbing pain of loneliness."

","After watching both The Last Man On Earth and The Omega Man I needed to throw on I Am Legend to complete the trifecta of films based on the book. Despite all the times I've viewed these three films I've never sat down and watched them in close proximity before. I wanted to see if my opinions on any of them changed by doing so, or if they would stay about the same.<br/><br/>This film seems to get a lot of hate from people. I think a lot of that's unwarranted. While it isn't anywhere near as brilliant as The Last Man On Earth, or as fun as The Omega Man, it does have some good moments. I thought Will Smith did a solid job as Robert Neville. The portrayal of despair and mental taxation from his time of isolation is well done. Some of that mirrors Vincent Price's performance in The Last Man on Earth. While I don't think it's as dominant as Price's performance it's solid. I also liked the addition of his canine companion Sam. As the story unfolds you see why Sam is so important to him, more so than just companionship.<br/><br/>The thing that really brings this down is the shoddy CGI. While at times it looks okay, more often than not it isn't good. It looks very cartoonish and cheap. It's bad enough to be painfully distracting at points. Truthfully, if that had been better, it would have pushed this film up a few notches. As I've said time and time again, I will take okay practical effects over cheap-cartoonish looking CGI effects any day of the week. <br/><br/>When it's all said and done. This film is enjoyable. There are a few genuinely emotional moments and it's an engaging enough story. I've watched it about seven or eight times now and each time I've enjoyed it. Watching it close to the other films did make me appreciate things more from those adaptions, as well as the other way around. In The end, I Am Legend manages to be a blend of both earlier movies, not really taking on the full persona of either, which at times makes it feel a little unbalanced. This time around I watched the original theatrical ending because I hadn't seen it in awhile. I'll be honest, I prefer the alternate ending. I think it's a change of pace from the other films and changes the overall tone for the better.<br/><br/>I think each of the three films has their own good and bad points. While I have never read the book, I've heard people say none of them have really nailed it. Too often that's the case with adaptions anyway. They never quite capture the same spirit of the printed word. Two separate mediums that are often hard to translate into the other. Casting that aside, I enjoy all three films for various reasons. My rating for this one has stayed just about where it always has. So for me, viewing them close together really didn't change my opinion on it either way. <br/><br/>My Rating: 6.5/10"

","Hauntingly beautiful deserted New York City landscapes are one of the main visuals of ""I am Legend"". Will Smith plays the sole survivor of New York City after an virus has decimated 95% of the world population. The remaining 5% are zombies feeding on anything that breathes. Struggling to find a cure against the virus Will Smith roams the streets of New York City in complete solitude.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning! To see one of the most busy and well know centres of the world look completely deserted and overgrown with plants is just amazing. I am flabbergasted and in awe of the visual effects of this movie. That alone would make this movie worth watching. The acting is as good as it gets with Will Smith, who doesnt play his usual cheery self. It is pain, fear and determination that is written all over Will Smith's face throughout this movie.<br/><br/>The suspense is thrilling from beginning to end. Although there are no humans left alive, there are still masses of zombies who will tear anyone apart. The constant looming danger of being attacked by zombies is very thrilling.<br/><br/>There could have been an alternate more original ending, then I would have given this overwhelming visual thriller an 8. Now I lower my appreciation to a well deserved 7. Not a typical cheerful Will Smith actionmovie. This is serious stuff, brilliantly produced and visualized. And spooky!"

","My intense dislike for this movie stems from its complete disregard for the book on which it is based. The story in the novel has been hacked into a nonsensical, self-serving mash-up of sci-fi / horror crap. The CGI baddies are ridiculous. They aren't even the same type of creatures in the book. Why change them? If you changed the name of the character and change the title of the movie, it would be unrecognizable as the classic novel.<br/><br/>The reveal at the end of the novel as to the relevance of the title, ""I Am Legend,"" is poignant and it reinforces the underlying tone of the story. The change in the ending of the movie is pure Hollywood garbage<br/><br/>The tone of the story in the book was hauntingly gloomy and DARK. It was chilling and bleak.

","This was a fun film to watch, with a nice message that was hidden behind the lines of the script. But this is not what we will be talking about. If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, it would be this: Go Will. Will Smith is the driving force of I Am Legend. His performance as Dr. Robert Neville is impeccable. Living in a deserted NY city, his acting is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of a volleyball, he has mannequins and a faithful German Shepard named Sam. His basement, a retro-fitted, high-tech lab to find a cure for the disease that has turned the population of the entire planet into mutant, zombie-like, hive mind, blood-thirsty monsters, and, for some reason, Robert is immune. His days, spent hunting. His nights, sleeping with a high-powered rifle and hoping that the mutants don't find him. Keeping the movie flowing are well placed flashbacks that show what happened to Robert's family and why he is there. The movie falters a bit at the end, maybe at the last 5 minutes, but it doesn't ruin the plot or acting put forth. Containing wonderful cinematography and CG, I Am Legend is a spectacular film that I will be seeing again."

"wilkinsl","8","0","0","20 April 2016"," Now What In The Hell Would YOU Do In This Situation? I Am Legend
","Living in an unpredictable, ghostly world makes this 'Pursuit of Happiness' a little more difficult for actor Will Smith. Besides the failures this sci-fi story has had in the past, Director Francis Lawrence found a way to organize ""I Am Legend"" into an amazing, action-packed, emotional thriller. This film, almost a decade after its' release, can still be said to keep audiences around the world on the edge of their seat, waiting anxiously for Dr. Robert Neville's (Will Smith) next move.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, we are introduced to a world much like the one we live in now. The plot is based in a very familiar area of New York City that many of us have probably seen in other movies, TV shows, and/or possibly first hand. As a viewer this movie makes it extremely easy to start asking questions, such as the 'What if' scenarios, and virtually live alongside Dr. Neville. Well let's just say, if an extremely dangerous virus, which once upon a time was supposed to cure cancer, ended up turning people into nocturnal zombie-dinosaur like people, I would feel pretty good about having Mr. Smith and a badass German Sheppard (Samantha) alongside me. Luckily I haven't been in a situation where my entire city ends up under quarantine, but watching each step Dr. Neville takes is definitely one hell of an adventure.<br/><br/>On a day to day basis, Smith makes his meals from preserved food, keeps his guns loaded, seeks to find a cure for the infected, as well as any other survivors that may be left. As the days go by, things become more and more intense. Dr. Neville's observations state that the infected people are changing and their symptoms are leading to very dangerous behaviors. In this case I would rather run into a mean grizzly than a growling human that wants to eat me! Screw that.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence definitely directed this film in an exhilarating way, keeping his audience engaged and focused. From the start it may be hard for the viewer to understand what is going on but as the film takes a turn and reveals flashbacks from Dr. Neville's life things become more and more clear. This film technique is used extremely well. As we watch the sequence of events from Neville's current life (3 years after the virus began), we also get to slowly unravel the answers of why things happened the way they did. When it comes to the acting and directing of the film, I would strongly say there are many more pros than cons.<br/><br/>On the contrary, I will warn you about the CGI effects used to create the infected characters. This can easily be perceived as the biggest and possibly only con of the film. When first introduced to the infected population, it was kind of a struggle to believe these characters were anywhere close to real. If you're anything like me, even in this science-fiction case, I like to compare films to reality. Because of their cartoon look and clone appeal from one another, it was obvious that these figures were fake. Besides the fact that THEY ARE FAKE, I believe these effects could have been focused on more and brought out a more realistic look. Don't get me wrong, I still think this film is absolutely incredible.<br/><br/>Alright, before I become too much of a spoiler I'll stop there. So if you're looking to go on a journey and don't want to go far, I Am Legend is definitely a film worth checking out!<br/><br/>""Slick, adrenaline-fueled fun."" - Los Angeles Times"

","I Am Legend (2007): Francis Lawrence / Cast: Will Smith, Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan, Salli Richardson, Emma Thompson: Provocative one man show that is a cross between sci-fiction and zombie flicks importing the hero's notoriety. A lethal virus wipes out mankind leaving scientist Robert Neville stranded with only his dog in New York. During the day he scouts for food and possibly other survivors but by night he locks himself away in hopes of discovering a cure. Director Francis Lawrence is backed with tremendous production showcasing the wasteland city. The third act is no surprise and hardly a shock. Will Smith holds strong as Neville but unfortunately he is pretty much a one man show. He is isolated and alone accept for his dog, and he makes grim discoveries that prevent him from venturing outside at night. One of the big drawbacks is that supporting roles by Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan and Salli Richardson are limited. They appear briefly in flashbacks that setup how Smith got to where he is at. Perhaps more of those characters and background would have been great. Emma Thompson also makes an appearance but more would have been better. Strong theme regarding communication and survival that play off some suspense along with effective production effects. Hopefully our future will not be this bleak and downcast. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

The film's other main flaw is the monsters themselves, who are rather badly digitally produced and simply aren't very frightening. But come the final moments, Robert's story comes to a heart-rending peak, beautifully played by Smith.

I have cried to this movie many times before and I suggest you watch it purely for the factor it provides for all (horror, romance, drama, action etc.).

","First to state that this movie, in no way is the worst thing ever. It has its definite faults, but one should try to look past some to see any positive attributes. The acting is good in most aspects (mostly due to Will Smith). The real issues come from the CGI, plot, and terrible conclusion of the film. The infected within the film look more fake then realistic, which takes away from the film in every aspect. This murder of CGI leads into the plot, which is slow to begin with then rushed at the end. Most of it feels like filler, trying to pass the time until something emerges that sparks development in Will Smith. But the worst part about this film is the disappointing and angering conclusion. I will not state what happens at the end, but it is not a good pay off. I will give the film some credit in almost bring the waterworks in halfway through the film, but that will also not be spoiled. All in all, this film has the potential, but in the end does not take advantage of the positives and leaves behind copious amounts of negatives. It is worth a look at, but be warned."

","I Am Legend is the third adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel of the same name, although this is the first film with that actual title. The first adaptation was The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price; a classic for many, but I found it rather dull. I was always fond of The Omega Man, featuring a very cool and macho Charlton Heston, but that film has not aged well. I've never read the book, but glancing over its synopsis, none of these adaptations appear to be fully accurate.<br/><br/>On its own merits, the I Am Legend film is a visually smooth and lush film; some of the most memorable imagery show New York City in ruins, overgrown with tall grass and vines, overrun with animals. The film follows the main character as he cruises through the city, hunts deer, scavenges, plays golf off the wing of an abandoned airplane, and continues to find a cure for the pandemic. Even though a lot of these scenes are fun (in the same respect as it was fun watching Charlton Heston roaming around in The Omega Man), this film does throw the main character into dangerous run-ins with hoards of fast and insane zombies. There are a few gripping scenes throughout, leading up to an action-packed finale.<br/><br/>The story for I Am Legend is generally sound, and it tries its best to be elegant about things. The plot structure is not particularly strong; outside of the occasional zombie scare and battle, conflict is kept to a minimum. What really matters is the narrative structure, which is a little unique for its use of flashbacks. Characters are delicately handled; it's hard not to feel for a man who's been alone for so long that he talks to mannequins and treats his dog like an actual person. However, the pathos suffers a little when the character acts out unreasonably (especially toward the only other human characters he eventually meets). There are moments where the film aspires to be more than it is: the film attempts to use butterfly motifs, Bob Marley references, and profound dialogue to dig up deeper themes regarding legacy. I'm personally not so sure if such themes really work, but they are nice touches. The film overall carries a delicate and emotional tone, which does succeed in making it invoking.<br/><br/>This film looks really slick; photography can get a little hectic with the action scenes, but is smooth and solid in every other scene. Editing is really interesting, given the way flashbacks are cut into the narrative so abruptly. Will Smith offers a solid and emotional performance. Writing is generally not bad. This production uses some very imaginative and good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects were cool for their time, but show their age slightly (the computer-generated zombies are especially notorious, for they are not all that scary). The music score is nice.<br/><br/>Of the three films made from the same novel, I believe this is the most respectable one to date, even if it isn't totally true to the source. At the very least, it does make for a decent post-apocalyptic drama, and fans of the genre should check this film out.<br/><br/>Recommended.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)"

","This movie is unlike any other horror/apocalypse movie I have ever seen. In this film, Robert Neville, portrayed by Will Smith, lives with his dog in a post apocalyptic New York. To his knowledge, there are no other humans left, just zombified-vampires that now populate the world.<br/><br/>Neville has worked every day to make a cure since the outbreak of the virus three years ago that has turned everyone into the monsters Neville faces in the movie. Without going to in depth, a woman and a child eventually find Neville in a dire situation and save him. She brings him back to his house but fails to complete the ritual he does every time he returns to ensure the 'dark seekers' do not follow him and find his hideout. <br/><br/>Eventually, the monsters attack Neville's home and he is forced to sacrifice himself to destroy the dark seekers after he discovers that his experiments were successful in creating a cure. After the explosion he creates with his grenade, the woman and child emerge from their hiding spot and drive to a community in Vermont with the cure and hands it to them. <br/><br/>Will Smith really allows this movie to succeed more than it would with any other actor. His performance is just breathtaking as a loner in a world without humanity. Also, the dark seekers are a mixed breed of zombies and vampires, which has never been done before. This is a must see if you a fan of the horror or action genre. It has a piece of excitement for everyone."
"thewillt08","8","0","0","14 October 2012"," Will Smith Strikes Again
","Everyone you or I have ever known has seen this movie and will read this review. I am Legend was not really what I expected. Will Smith delivers another great performance as a scientist in a post disaster New York City. Once upon a time it was believed that a cure for cancer was discovered. It turned out that this cure turned into a virus and killed most of the world's population. Some survivors turned into infected zombie-like monsters. Then they started feeding on the living and leaving a small living population of humans left in the world. <br/><br/>Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist who is looking for a cure. The search for a cure keeps him alive because he feels he can fix the mistake humanity made. He is at ground zero; it is ""his site."" He is alone in the entire city, but finds ways to keep his sanity. He exercises, talks to manikins, and is in love with his dog. He takes care of his dog Sam and she becomes a beloved character. Smith also watches old newscasts on TV. His brilliance in this movie is remarkable. He is in survival mode and he raids old houses and scavenges the city for supplies. Every night he puts his house in lockdown to keep out the infected. He has many weapons and has set explosives around is house, and sprays gas everywhere. How he has survived and the preparation he makes everyday just makes the movie different. There isn't a lot of dialogue or characters so the audience needs another way to be entertained, and it worked. This movie had chilling moments, funny moments, heart breaking moments, and memorable moments. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie we see flashbacks of what happened during the evacuation of New York. We learn the story of his daughter and wife and what happened to them. His daughter, Marley, is an important character herself. She reveals symbols and is a symbol herself. She is named after Bob Marley and his music is heard throughout. In one flashback Marley talks about a butterfly. ""Look daddy, a butterfly."" This becomes important later towards the end of the film. It is little things like that which makes the movie interesting and something a real fan can enjoy.<br/><br/>Now, New York is infested with former human beings but are now infected with the virus. They hate the sunlight but come out at night and wreak havoc. In blu ray these monsters are terrifying. Their screams sound real; you can see the detail of how their skin had burns and their veins pop out. Meanwhile, Neville catches one in a brilliant scheme and he puts it in his lab. Neville is immune to the virus so he cannot become infected but he tests the cure on rats and eventually the human sample. This angers the infected and they get back at him.<br/><br/>The infected are smart themselves and set up a trap. They move a manikin into a position and Neville's insanity kicks in and he thinks the manikin is real and he shoots it. Then he goes over to it and gets caught in a wire. He passes out and wakes up at dusk. He cuts himself down and injures his leg, again brilliant by infected humans. What happens next is just epic. The infected let out their infected dogs to attack. Neville and Sam crawl back and there is a final ray of sunshine keeping the dogs from attacking. The inevitable attack commences and Sam, the dog, makes the ultimate sacrifice. Neville survives but Sam is hurt, really bad, and Neville has to choke out is dog and best friend. That scene was powerful and difficult to watch. We don't see the dog. We see Will Smith's face and his reaction as the claws of the dog scratch along the floor and eventually stop. <br/><br/>This brings the introduction to two new characters Anna and Ethan. They save Neville's life when he basically tries to commit suicide and take down infected with him. Anna saves his life and brings him home. Smith shows more insanity and how he has no people skills anymore and the only good thing the kid does in the movie is pick up the knife when Neville flips out and tosses the plate. The kid really annoyed me and he was an unnecessary character. He didn't say one word in his thirty minutes on screen and was pointless.<br/><br/>Other problems with the movie were small. In the beginning when Will Smith is driving the brand new car in a post apocalyptic world. Come on? That's just the car paying the movie to advertise their new product. Ethan was pointless, Anna was not in the movie enough and honestly at time I was a little board with the movie. There were very few characters, little development, and little action. It was still a fun movie and given the circumstances it was still a good movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I Am Legend was a good time. I bought it on blu ray, so it was a good movie. I could watch it again and again and still be entertained. It had a great a great storyline, a fantastic lead actor, awesome special effects, and clever moments. Is this movie really memorable? Not really, it isn't a classic but it is a good activity to do on a rainy day. Watch it alone, with friends, whoever. Small children may be scared but no big deal. I am Legend gets the WillyT Seal of Approval."

","I Am Legend is a 2007 American post-apocalyptic starring Will Smith. A film adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name, following 1964's The Last Man on Earth and 1971's The Omega Man. Smith plays virologist Robert Neville, who is immune to a man-made virus originally created to cure cancer. He works to create a remedy while defending himself against humans mutated by the virus.<br/><br/>Francis Larwance Started a great plot with showing how Robert Neville lived day to day. The camera shots of Smith's point of view through his gun and eyes got you on the edge of your seat and you felt like you were there. Walking in to save his dog in the dark was terrifying, not only were you scared for him after he found a hive of mutants but for his dogs life as well. <br/><br/>When the storyline changes to brief flashbacks you slowing start to put the pieces together on what exactly happened. Will Smith does amazing at touching anyone who watches the movie. You feel his past and you feel when the last part of his sanity gets infected, His dog he got from his daughter the last time he saw her. Alice Braga (Anna) Shows confidence and independence on how strong she is. <br/><br/>There are two endings to the movie and they're both great but I definitely think the story is complete with the unrated ending. You understand why the mutants come for Robert. In the scene where he traps the Darkseeker and takes it home he takes note to one specific Alpha Darkseeker (Dash Mihok)who after the incident is reoccurring and is the one who leads the other Darkseekers to Roberts house. Robert took his mate and the alpha wanted revenge. Dr. Neville curing his mate was killing her in the alpha's eyes. It all fell into place when Dr. Neville pushed his patient out into the group of Darkseekers, Reinfected her, and the alpha exchanged words (unidentable)and called the other Darkseekers off and they left in peace. <br/><br/>In all the movie was great, It had a strong plot and the storyline was touching. Everyone did their role perfect to every scenario that was placed. The scenes were impressive considering some of it was enhanced. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good post-apocalyptic science fiction horror film."

"ironhorse_iv","7","0","0","24 September 2012"," The story about a man and his dog is not that legendary.
","This movie is not legendary. sadly, but it's still worth checking out. It's really good, but can't hold the same value as the IMDb high highs such as Godfather and others. It's should be higher than where it is. The film is based on the book by the same title which was written in 1954 by Richard Matheson, a entire 150 pages book that shows depth and is cleverly written to make one think of their moral stand point, and how our view of humanity may skew our perception of who the real monster is. The book is full of irony and makes a very interesting dark tragedy. This author also penned some other well know tales which became excellent movies including Stir of Echoes and What Dreams May Come that follows that pattern. His writings were also inspiration in many Stephen King novels (The Stand), as well as the first survival horror films such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Man and his dog"" ""28 Days Later"" and 'Silent Hill"". 'I am Legend"" also feed the works and movies of ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964, Vincent Price), and ""The Omega Man"" (1971, Charlton Heston). 'The Omega Man' is the closest movie similar to that. In my takes, this would be a remake of that movie. While Richard Matheson book is a great read ""I Am Legend"" the movie, shows the world in the near future where scientist have recently created a virus altered cure for cancer. After thousands are cured with this revolutionary drug, the virus-cure mutates and eventually leaves the scientist Robert Nevell (Will Smith) as possibly the last man on earth and immune to the virus. The plot follows his life as the only remaining human in a lonely abandoned New York City with his dog and his search for a cure to save the remaining infected populace which remains in a zombie/ vampire/ undead state. This survivalist horror film makes several good moves that gave it the potential to be a great film. It's not a bloody gore-fest of a zombie movie that is a mainstay these days, and that's a good thing, it counter-acts the lack of blood with an edgy and unnerving feel throughout the entire film, especially being set in an abandoned Manhattan. The acting is excellent, and Will Smith's portrayal of being totally alone is on par with Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"". It's really capitalizes on the loneliness of the character, who only hope for a normal life is his dog, and a few mannequins he talks as if people. The film kept the same dark feel of the book, but someone decided that all the underlying plot and depth which makes one actually use some brainpower and think about what this story is saying, is unnecessary. So the viewer is left with a movie which starts out strong and slowly dissolves into the same played out special effect heavy, heroic man takes on legions of infected zombie vampires all while trying to save the world action flick. The CGI zombies are just so fake looking. There are subtle hints that someone may have actually read the book before making the movie, but they are easily passed over, and not very prominent. Those who have never read the book (or a book for that matter) will probably love it, and add it to their DVD collection. The other group mostly those who have read the book or who like depth, consistency, and a clever plot line can wait to rent it and be angry that the movie didn't use the original ending. All in all, ""I am Legend"" is entertaining and has Will Smith in it, that being said, it will not go down as legend and will be in danger of becoming just another zombie movie."

","After finding himself the lone survivor of a disastrous world-wide plague, a man interrupts his struggle to battle a swarm of bloodthirsty mutants to save the few isolated pockets of humanity left.<br/><br/>This one wasn't all too bad but really had a couple points going for it. One of the main issues here is the fact that far too much of screen-time is devoted to areas that aren't that thrilling or exciting, really tending to drag out the first half here. From the daily routine and interacting with the dog to him scouting the city with the mannequins spread out in the different stores and just driving around not doing anything, it all leaves this one with large amounts of time where not a lot happens. Bounding it all with the plague research and scientific investigation into the virus which is pretty much all that occurs here, it doesn't feature much of anything with any real interest that features just very little action or exciting moments to drive this along, and the lack of action really throughout this makes this one limp along so lamely there's very few times where anything actually happens. It's also hard to tell whether or not we're dealing with vampires or zombies here, as the hunting behavior and origins of the virus and how to stop it are straight-zombiedom, while the nocturnal-ness and bloodsucking are vampiric activities, so it's a little confusing as well. There's still the pretty problematic fact that the CGI for the creatures is a misstep by making them look completely ridiculous and fake for the entirety of their screen-time. The last half is a lot better, as while the hunting techniques at the abandoned apartments derive a few scares and the creature's assaults on the fortified house are great action scenes that have some nice gore here and there so it does build to a fine finish, there's enough action to make more of an overall impression though it's still got way too many issues that work against it to overcome them.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and violence-against-animals."
"Laakbaar","8","0","0","1 June 2012"," Going mad in an empty New York
","I thought this was a decent science-fiction movie for two reasons in particular. <br/><br/>First, Will Smith delivers a great performance. What would happen to someone who had survived the horror of an apocalypse and was left alone for three years? Smith gives us a good idea.<br/><br/>Second, the post-apocalyptic scenes of an empty New York were particularly interesting. (Since 2007, however, the History channel has broadcast their series on ""Life After People"" so this no longer comes across as a novel movie concept.) <br/><br/>I admire the producers for avoiding a cliché ending, but still....it wasn't satisfying.<br/><br/>Despite the appropriation of the name, this movie departs significantly from the Richard Matheson novel. If you prefer movies that are faithful to the book, don't see this one. The earlier movies on the same theme had faded from memory, so I saw it as a fresh concept. I was actually surprised at the direction this movie took.<br/><br/>It's interesting to me that this popular movie, released about five years ago, has practically the same score on IMDb.com and RottenTomatoes.com.<br/><br/>The IMDb user score is currently 71%. The audience rating on RT is 69%, but the average is 72%. Not that different.<br/><br/>IMDb's ""metascore"" (which is based on 37 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com) assigns it a score of 65%. On RT the ""Tomatometer"" is at 70%, although the ""average score"" is 64%. These scores are based on published movie reviews. Again, not that different.<br/><br/>The statistics on both these sites are based on a huge number of user ratings and dozens of movie reviews.<br/><br/>There are only 8 points between the lowest and highest score. Should I be surprised that these scores are so uniform five years after the movie was first released? The popular scores (around 69%) are a little better than the reviewer scores. But not by much. There doesn't seem to be much difference. I wonder whether this is common.<br/><br/>Movie goers often go for high and low scores when they rate movies: they give it a 10 if they love it; 0 if not. I wonder how much this voting dynamic affects the final scores? Perhaps in the end this is what makes user scores different from movie review scores.<br/><br/>And why do I feel that my score should be higher than the one that has emerged after five years out of hundreds of thousands of ratings? I suppose it's because I love science fiction. I am also forgiving of plot holes, science problems and lack of realism. As long as a movie is entertaining, has a few neat concepts and a character worth caring about, I'm willing to forgive almost anything."

","I am Legend starts off excellent. Will Smith's character is incredibly believable along with the shots of the barren New York City streets. The plot is wonderfully put together and dispersed and small portions of comedy are thrown in to suit Will Smith's personality. The scare factor is certainly present as it uses surprise and suspense as its greatest factors. I found myself jumping as I saw the infected zombies ravaging around.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance is certainly the strongest point of the film. The emotions and traits he displays are amazing and convincing. whether he be sad, calm, or nearly insane, you'll be rooting for him the entire movie. His character provokes nearly every emotion you can feel, and you'll very quickly become attached to his companion dog.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the downsides: The simulated zombies were very poorly made with almost no detail. There is almost 0 variance of the designs on the infected. However, it is understood why the creators resorted to using CGI because of the absurd speed and strength of them. The lack of back story and explanation is very bothering to the audience. It was already a short movie to begin with, so an extra half and hour of seeing the start of the virus and Will's character's preparation would've been appreciated.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** The ending was certainly not satisfying. The sense of love and compassion felt by the infected was not at all convincing and it makes you wish they either killed Will's character in the end, a successful cure, or more to their escape. Only one shot of the survivors driving away is below par for an ending of such a great beginning of a movie **SPOILER END**<br/><br/>Let's recap: Will Smith is amazing as usual, you'll become attached and feel sad, scared, and even happy throughout the movie. The overall composition of the movie is good, but more explanation would've been nice. Finally, the animated zombies aren't too amazing and the ending might leave you a little dissatisfied. However' it's totally worth a watch."

","The film is strong when the ""vampires"" come to the home. In ""The Omega Man"" they were still a human right and also heavily made-up white with white contact lenses. The new appearance is for the good.<br/><br/>In ""I Am Legend"" the creatures do not talk and are completely computer animated characters. It is also not trying to give a message such as the Omega man, and in ""I Am Legend,"" the vampires are only there for shock effect and the action. I actually did not mind this fact.<br/><br/>Will Smith, who was at his best in ""I Am Legend"". They gave him the dog Sam by the hand, worked. A lot of nice monologues by Smith. It may be more likely that he has tried desperately to make the script the best it possibly could, and this makes it more a new film than a remake. Not 100% convincing, but okay, I find him in comedies that are much worse. Heston said the role perfectly as it was already filled, let there be nothing to Shiver. It was not easy for Will Smith and it is perhaps a little unfair to judge him now to Heston. Will Smith was good, I'll give him the points.<br/><br/>Something like ""The Omega Man"" in 2007 no longer works for the audience. ""I am Legend"" is first about powerful images. The empty New York is quite convincing and it's very atmospheric. The CGI's of animals and vampires, however, are not the true and the monsters sometimes are just scary-dressing. The film seems quite scuttled at the end, on the other hand, I was glad it was for almost 100 minutes long. ""I am Legend"" found its fans, but it can't be timeless CGI effects in 20 years will look bad where as ""The Omega Man"" will just look like a an old film and will live longer.<br/><br/>Good film though.

He captures a woman, Ruth, and she seems to be immune and so he injects some of her blood into his body. He passes out and wakes up a prisoner of the undead, of which Ruth is a part of.

","Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way - Will Smith is excellent, as usual. The scenes of an abandoned New York are amazing, in much the same way as the shots of a deserted London in 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Now on to the disappointing stuff - the CGI work throughout the film is terrible. 14 years after Jurassic Park, and this is seriously the best they could do? I could live with the CGI animals, but the CGI 'infected' are just beyond belief. They all look the same, they all behave in ways that are clearly opposed to the laws of physics, and they all look as though they've stepped out of a cartoon or a computer game.<br/><br/>It's hard to overstate just how unconvincing the CGI work is; about half-way through the film stops being 'real' and turns into an absurd mix of the real world and sub-par animation. It's more 'Mary Poppins' than '28 Days Later'.<br/><br/>Real people with prosthetics would have made a much greater impact, and may have added some genuine thrills into what is otherwise a fairly dull film.<br/><br/>The ending - and I won't use any spoilers - is very weak.

","'I Am Legend'is not a bad movie, but it's not a good movie. It doesn't do much to tilt the scales in either direction, and as a result, I give it a 5 rating.<br/><br/>I decided to rent the DVD, not expecting very much. It did deliver on this point. And that says it all. It was entertaining to a certain extent, granted, but 'I Am Legend' is like a roller-coaster. It's up one minute, down the next, up again, then down. It never comes into its own, and when a 100 minute film is at times a chore to sit through, you've hit a brick wall. Will Smith does delver a fine performance, but I don't believe it's the show-stopping performance many have touted it as.<br/><br/>Granted, Smith keeps 'I Am Legend' from sinking in its own muddled sea of emptiness, but it's just not enough. It doesn't take long to discover that 'I Am Legend' just doesn't have the script or direction to deliver a good movie. And what could have been the film's saving grace, special effects and action, quickly become one of its weakest efforts. The CGI is unrealistic enough to take us out of the film almost entirely, while the sparse and repetitive action breaks no new ground.<br/><br/>'I Am Legend' could have been an exciting and action-packed blockbuster. This film had potential. But perhaps worst of all, it tries to front itself as a deep psychological character study and be a popcorn blockbuster at the same time. It just doesn't work, and it comes off feeling forced and cheap. 'I Am Legend' wants to say something, it wants to pack a punch. But I was never able to muster up enough enthusiasm to really care. A disappointment, but low expectations helps ease the pain."
"The-Sarkologist","8","0","0","31 January 2012"," What if you were the last person left alive, surrounded by monsters
","While this is a very good movie it is also quite slow in parts, but unfortunately it needs to be. The film is set in 2012 after a virus has pretty much wiped out most of the population of the earth, and those that were not killed outright by the virus were either turned into mutant monsters or killed by the mutant monsters. As far as we know at the beginning of the film, the only true human left alive is Robert Neville (Will Smith) and his faithful dog Sam. Neville is a military scientist who, when the disease first struck, was tasked with finding a cure, and this was back in 2009 (where we have a number of flashbacks to see what happened to Neville's family). It is unclear what happened in the intervening years, but it appears that Neville has managed to survive.<br/><br/>The first part of the film simply shows us the normal daily life the Neville lives: he drives around empty New York Streets hunting deer (though staying out of the dark places since that is where the infected live during the day – they have an aversion to sunlight, to the extent that ultraviolet light will kill them), visiting the local DVD rental store, where he has conversations with dummies, visiting a pier where he hopes somebody will pick up his radio message, and also occasionally playing golf. When he returns home we discover that he has a lab beneath his house where he is tirelessly working to attempt to find a cure. I will not go any further than this because I really do not want to spoil the movie.<br/><br/>However, at the beginning of the movie we are privy to a television interview where a scientists says that through genetic engineering, they have discovered a cure to cancer. However, we suddenly jump to a dead and deserted New York City. It is obvious what has happened, this new cure has mutated into a very dangerous virus which has pretty much decimated the population of the city. Thus I would suggest that the major theme of this film would be the arrogance of human development. He we have a life saving drug that clearly wasn't properly tested before it was released into production. Unfortunately we see this time and time again, where companies will attempt to produce a wonder drug, release it onto the market with out proper testing, and result in people suffering significant side effects. Many writers have suggested that the regulator is pretty much a toothless tiger that is staffed by corporate hacks.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a book of the same name, written back in 1954, and since then there have been two movie adaptations (one of them being 'The Omega Man') in addition to this one. The original story was set in Los Angeles and it was clear that the infected were actually vampires. The idea was to try and introduce vampirism into a science-fiction setting as opposed to the supernatural setting that they are used to. The original book attempts to explain their fear for crosses and of garlic, however since them most authors simply modify the vampires' weaknesses, usually dropping the cross fetish. However, this movie does not really suggest that they are vampires, and it is only the aversion to sunlight (and maybe the fact that they pass the disease on by biting people, but then again there are a number of references to the disease also being airborne).<br/><br/>This film does tend to leave us very alone, and also tries to grapple with that idea of loneliness. All Neville has for company is his dog Sam, and Sam does show to be a loyal companion. We also see a general aversion to him killing the infected. While it seems that they have degenerated to a base animal level, it seems that some do show cunning an intelligence. Neville at one time suggests that they have devolved further to the point where they are ambivalent to risk, but I do not think this is the case. When the Alpha-male comes partly out of the door and burns himself, in one sense I believe it is designed to create an identifier to this particular infected, and also to warn Neville that this infected knows him, and will be out to get him (as we see later in the film)."

","Finally, an end of the world thriller that is worth seeing! This remake of 1971's Omega Man is a perfect example of how end of the world movies should occur. The flashbacks to the time before the catastrophe tell the story of what actually happen. Will Smith is really great as Dr. Robert Neville. Instead of going on some insane journey to find an unaffected area, he stays right in the heart of the crisis and tries to fix it. He is a great example of a true hero and Will Smith portrays it perfectly. Smith's personality in a dark and somber movie is a bright spot and his interplay with the innocuous things he encounters is fantastic.

","I Am Legend is the story of Robert Neville's (Will Smith) journey of survival in a post apocalyptic world filled with flesh eating zombies, as well as his quest for the cure of the disease which he believes has wiped out the whole human race and turned them into zombies. Neville is also immune to all forms of the disease. Along with Neville is his trusty dog Sam who accompanies him for most of the movie until she is struck with the disease and starts showing signs of being infected which forces Neville to put her down. The story takes place in a barren New York City which is overgrown with plants and infested with wild animals like deer and lions. The setting creates a sense of loneliness and fear complimented by a dramatic and suspenseful scene where Neville and Sam have a close encounter with a group of zombies inside of a dark building. This feeling was perfect for this type of movie. Throughout the movie Robert tries to find a cure for the disease in hope that he can cure the zombies. The movie allows you to feel his struggle as he constantly has flashbacks of the last moments he spent with his family. You can begin to feel his pain when he comes close to curing a zombie whom he captured, and eventually dies in his lab. Just as he is about to give up hope, he encounters a woman and her son who tell him of a refuge where other humans exist that were not infected. However just as they are about to escape with the cure that he developed, his house is stormed by a mob of zombies. In an effort to save the woman and her son Robert uses a grenade to kill himself along with all the zombies while the woman and her child hide until the morning."

","At first I thought it was a pretty good movie. The story went forward very well. There were subtle hints hidden here and there that pointed towards an interesting ending. Unfortunately the ending did not live up to my expectations (or that of all other people I asked about it). Also all the hints here and there didn't make any sense any more.<br/><br/>A few months later, I had the chance to see the original ending, which was replaced after a negative test screening. It was exactly the ending the movie needed. I don't know what kind of people the audience of the test screening was made of, but it seems they were somehow intellectually challenged.<br/><br/>Thus, if you happen to get your hands on a DVD or Blueray which contains the original ending, skip the 'fixed' one when the showdown in the lab begins and switch to the better one. It will return a meaning to the movie.<br/><br/>I'll give the cinema version 6/10 and the original cut 8/10."

","I came to watch this movie last night without actually planning to watch it. I was actually going to watch X Men Origins Wolverine but this came on free to air and I was a little intrigued. A world where a cure for cancer turns the curees into monsters. This plot line is very similar to 28 Days Later. Trying to escape a city that is plagued by infected people that are trying to infect everyone. The only difference is that in this film, it was a cure for cancer that turned people into vicious savages and that there is far less people who have survived. I quite liked Will Smith's character and that he would trawl the abandoned dwellings in search of food and that he created a world of mannequins in the video store and that he kept it so orderly. The saddest part of the film was when his faithful companion, Sam, the Alsation was infected by one of the monster dogs and he had to put her down. Very traumatic scene which made me almost stop watching it as usually the pets survive like in Alien. Overall, this kept me glued to my seat happily entertained. I think the ending was a little short and the self sacrificing was seen a mile away but still poetic nonetheless."

This film took place in New York City and he was the last human survivor. The virus caused the citizens to become carnivorous beings that could only survive in the dark, but would also destroy or infect anyone or thing that came in their pathway. Neville sent his family away to a more thought of secure place for them and decided to stay in their home to find a cure to save the city. While it was daylight Neville would go out and scavenge for food items and supplies to continue to survive this was an ongoing issue for about 3 years or more.

","As with almost any literary adaptation, fans of the source material in search of a literal interpretation will probably find a lot to fault in this Will Smith vehicle, particularly in its neutered take on the story's conclusion. All of the original's deeper underlying meanings are still there, buried in the actions and expressions of the transfigured creatures Smith does his best to avoid, but without a big reveal to lay all the cards on the table they're too easily shrugged off or overlooked altogether. That positions this as, basically, a hybrid summer blockbuster / suspense-laden monster movie with a better than usual premise. In this role it fares well - Smith portrays the terrifying isolation of the last sane man on Earth with passion and depth, leaving memories of his less-inspired earlier work far in the past. He's come a long way from Independence Day or even Hancock, and surprisingly little of that has the more stern-faced, serious script to thank. Legend's computer effects are a different story: while exceptional at rendering an overgrown, deserted NYC skyline, they feel excessive and overwhelming when it come to the creatures themselves. Though it may not live up to the lofty expectations of its namesake, this is hardly a complete write-off. In fact, as mass market action pictures go it's unusually smart, expertly paced and generally contemplative. A pity it didn't have the balls to stick with that original ending, though, as I think it would have been much more universally appreciated."

This is not the best film for younger children, that is true. 12+ should be able to handle it, but it depends what your standards are... But, this film is very disturbing and pretty sad. Most people I know cried throughout the film. The whole movie is based on him being the only known survivor of this virus, and it is implied many times throughout the film that his younger kids and wife were killed. There is also several other sad scenes within the film that can be interpreted as distressing and disturbing for viewers of any age. None-the-less, this film is simply well done and beautiful.

","Without giving too much way, Will Smith plays a sole survivor of a world dominating virus created by man that was originally created to cure cancer. Three years into the ""new"" world, Smith (who was a former doctor) dedicates his life to survival, finding a cure....and talking to mannequins. In order to find a cure he seeks out the infected, who only come out at night, and hoping to correct man's mistake.<br/><br/>""Legend"" was the first truly scary movie I've seen in some time. Realism is the main factor in scary movies in my opinion. If it can happen, than that's pretty scary. Also, Smith's portrayal of despair and borderline insanity of three years of seclusion added to the effect. With the exception of his dog, Smith had no live contact with constant failure attempts of his cure only leading to his insanity. It had a ""Cast Away"" feel to it with his dog as to Hank's volleyball and his house reminding you of that stranded island.<br/><br/>The action/suspense scenes coupled with superb sound direction were also heart pounding and unexpected which added to the ""scare"" factor. Whenever Smith engaged with the zombie-like survivors, there was that claustrophobic feeling that I haven't felt since ""Alien."" My only real complaint was the overuse of CGI over real actors for these characters, but with their speed and strength that these things showed if may have not been possible.<br/><br/>""Legend"" overall is one of the better movies of 2007 and a must see. Not Oscar-worthy by any stretch of the imagination, but it's certainly entertaining, realistically tense and maybe even thought provoking."

","n 2012, three years after a genetically modified virus which was supposed to cure cancer ended up wiping out most of the world's population, a scientist named Robert Neville, immune to this virus, appears to be the only uninfected human left in New York City, maybe even the world, and his only companion is his dog, Sam! Neville does research in his basement laboratory to try and find a cure for the virus, and regularly sends out radio messages, calling for other survivors to come and meet him, if there are any out there, but so far, this has not worked. Eventually, the scientist discovers people in New York who have not been killed by the virus, but have been mutated by it, and as a result, they have become dangerous monsters! Worse still, there are many of them in the city, and Neville is still waiting to see another uninfected human, so he is grossly outnumbered! <br/><br/>This film is slow-paced around the beginning, but this works well, starting with the introduction to the virus which was yet to fail, and going from there to views of a deserted New York, which are reasonably intriguing. Some scenes may be a bit tedious, such as Robert Neville looking through the dark building before finding the mutants, and the camera is sometimes a bit unsteady, but to make up for the flaws, there's quite a bit of tension (which includes scenes with the mutated, zombie-like humans and they're chases and attacks, even though I'm sure we've seen scenes like that before in movies), as well as some poignant moments, with Neville and his loneliness. Also, for Bob Marley fans, the main character is a big fan of his, and at one point, he talks about Marley and his philosophies. As someone who listens to his music and has read a lot about his short life, this part definitely touched me, and it obviously isn't featured in the previous two adaptations, as they were both made before Marley became an international superstar.<br/><br/>Yes, this film has its flaws, and seems to have gotten a lot of positive feedback as well as negative, but personally, I have to give it a positive review. While not quite a masterpiece, I still found it to be a memorable sci-fi/horror film, with a fair amount of suspense, action, and poignancy. Once again, I don't know how it compares to the book or the previous two adaptations of it, and clearly, it seems to be widely considered inferior to those, but while that may be true, I cannot join the naysayers on this one. If you see this version of ""I Am Legend"", I guess you could easily end up on either side, but if you want to see a combination of sci-fi, horror, and drama, and you're a Will Smith fan, I think it's worth a try, and yes, it just MIGHT help a BIT if you're a Bob Marley fan."

I think it is a pretty minor offering, with zombies that look cheesy and Will Smith's campy performance weighing it down. However the director's suspense buildup is pretty masterful, making a few truly scary moments. Manhattan looks good in post apocalyptic form, but the movie looks better on paper than it does on the silver screen, which simply is not acceptable. For zombie fans, this is too layed back.

It is entertaining. It has some stunning visualisations of Smith's post-plague life in a New York populated only by him during daylight hours. And it has Smith's performance: very much the macho protagonist, yet allowing us to see the sad, lonely, mourning man - bereaved not just for his family but for his species - who is clinging on to his sanity, barely, by his fingertips. There are places where I think that this may be Smith's best performance ever.<br/><br/>And then there are the CGI zombie/vampires.

"cowboykalira","3","0","0","2 July 2011"," Promising start turns out to be vague religious nonsense
","*** SPOILERS WARNING *** <br/><br/>Okay this is my first review here, so bear with me.<br/><br/>I'll start with saying that i think Will Smith did a great job. Don't listen to people comparing him to Tom Hanks in Castaway, Tom Hanks doesn't hold a candle to Will Smith's performance in this film. He is gradually losing his mind, one twist at a time, and he portrays this in a way that makes it realistic and dramatic at the same time. <br/><br/>Secondly it looks good. Again I don't agree with some of the other critics here, saying the creatures were outdated cgi. Granted they were not realistic, but to me they fitted in somehow. And the scenery is very nicely done.<br/><br/>What I don't get about this film however, is how it's brilliant for 60 odd minutes but then when he meets the other survivors it turns into a weird combination of bad SF/horror and religious twaddle. <br/><br/>Now seriously, where did that come from? It could just be because they couldn't think of a decent way of saving them and because they wanted a happy end they had to come up with a vague religious side story, so they don't have to explain how they end up in Vermont. That would be quite bad, but the other option is even worse : they did intend this ending, and wrote it to tell us that those nasty scientists who are trying to cure diseases are evil, and that we all should just stick to trusting in god. Yeah...right.<br/><br/>This film could have had a great ending if they had been creative. He does find a cure and starts using it to revive the city, ending with the first rays of hope for the first few newly cured people, maybe him returning to the video store and finding a real girl there, voilÃ . Or he doesn't find a cure, gets crazier and crazier and then infected and dies at the end, not having achieved any of his goals, which would have been a really great scary ending. The options were literally limitless.<br/><br/>Not trying to offend, but people who say the ending of this film is really deep, which i did read in some other reviews here and elsewhere, are not making very much sense to me. It's not. It's blandly religious at best. Sure, this film has some nice ideas and good acting from will smith, but that's it. Rational people, beware of this film, enjoy it for an hour and then just turn the damn thing off."

","""I am legend"" is about a woman finding a cure for cancer, but it turns out to be a plague. It kills of most of humanity, turning them into mutants. A few years later, a survivor from New York City - immune to the plague - struggles to find a cure.<br/><br/>This film is definitely moving, and the story was easy enough to capture. The problem was, is was incredibly slow to get going. Robert Neville (Will Smith) is a survivor, living alone with his dog Samantha, in New York City. For a large fraction of the film, there are no other characters involved. Apart from a few mutants randomly appearing, the amount of action is very minimal.<br/><br/>The film is still successful as a scary movie. Many of the scenes show horror, and there are incredibly intense scenes which make the film what it is. There are quite a few dramatic scenes that crop up around the ending time of the story. One of them featuring Robert and Samantha, the rest featuring Robert, Anna and Ethan. There are definitely a few missed opportunities throughout the film which could have made it more enjoyable, but to me it wasn't much of a bother.<br/><br/>In the second half of the story, Samantha ends up dying after getting bitten by a mutant. Shortly after, Robert is close to death, until he is rescued by Anna (Alice Braga). They both arrive back at his house where we meet Anna's son (Charlie Tahan). From then on, the film starts progressing rapidly, and a lot more action takes place. <br/><br/>The use of the character ""Samantha"" is a main feature in the film. The dog shows how Robert copes with a companion and alone. Without Sam featuring as much, the film would not mean the same to me. Marley Neville (Willow Smith) also plays a big part in the story. She shows us how Robert relates to her, and the rest of his family. She also provides a talking point later in the movie.<br/><br/>The director, Francis Lawrence, uses many successful and unique techniques to construct the film. Even though it is quite slow near the start, the events that happen keep the viewer on edge, just waiting for something to happen. Personally, the lack of action does help structure the story in some way. Some people may not carry on watching it after about 1 hour, but I think the majority of viewers will find it a unique technique. His use of flashbacks also keep the story going, and it is far more interesting than playing the movie straight from the start, and making us watch every single detail.<br/><br/>Overall, ""I am Legend"" is very dramatic, and I recommend this film to anyone who likes horror, thrills and a lot of drama. <br/><br/>9/10"

","An apocalyptic terror-mutant movie that re-adapts Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name, and the science-fiction classic film of the 70s ""Omega Man"".<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of the destruction of human kind by a virus, and the survival of just a few humans, some of them immune and some others mutated by the virus. Colonel Neville, lives and works alone in Manhattan with his dog Samantha, trying to find other humans, alone, lonely and with bouts of mental disturbance.<br/><br/>The reconstruction of an apocalyptic Manhattan is realistic, wild, sad and beautiful at the same time. The running of wild deer and lions are just that something that completes the transformation of the city into a wild space, still not the wilderness we expect from apocalyptic dark movies. That's great, not going mainstream to depict something that has been depicted visually in a certain way gazillion times. The empty wild city of ""I am legend"" is eerie despite the sunshine and the clarity. There is uncertainty, familiarity, mystery, abandonment, and desolation. It really sets the mood of the movie and makes everything it happens believable. In fact, I would say that, in this movie, the setting is another actor.<br/><br/>The story of the virus apocalypse and its effects on human kind are simply told, but are well depicted and narrated. Despite the fact that most of movie is just Will Smith and the dog, we can praise the script to give mystery, intensity and interest to the movie.<br/><br/>Will Smith is very good in his role, playing alone most of the time, with great dramatic intensity. He shows that when a script demands some seriousness, he stands to the challenge. His problem is that, most of the time, he chooses roles that just showcase his own self not the actor he can be. This is not the case here, as Smith is physically and mentally transformed, and plays well the lonely human-contact longing Neville in a desert Manhattan.<br/><br/>There are special effects in the movie, but they are well integrated, and what is spectacular is not the effects but what happens in the story. The bunch of mutants are really scary and almost human.<br/><br/>I found that the time frame was not believable. I mean, that much urban destruction in just a few years? Or things that are not explained: How does Ann know that there is a colony of survivors, where it is, etc. if she keeps moving? Or, when Anna and the boy went to wait for Neville at the docks, and he did not appear, why they did not go hiding to protect themselves from the mutants? They were just there, at the right moment in the middle of the night. How did Neville know the percentage of immune, mutants and deceased? This, just to mention a few details.<br/><br/>The animation shorts, which complement the story (in the DVD) are quite interesting as give us glimpses of what might happened in another places of the world, and in different circumstances, when the virus spread. Especially good is the story set in India, which is very gore and truly terrorific, and, I confess, I had difficulties watching. They are much terrifying that the movie.<br/><br/>There was an alternate ending for the movie, which I would much preferred (at least for what I've read), but is not the one finally chosen, which I found to be done in a hurry."

","I'm not gonna say that this is the best or the crappiest movie ever - though I shall only be referring to the film with the 'controversial' ending, the one that actually is a 7, the regular version is a 5 in my book. So if you haven't seen this, look for a version with the alternative ending!<br/><br/>So, long story short, vampire people wobbling around a deserted city, seemingly soulless animals that have it in for our hero and his lovely pooch. Acting is above average, and way above anything I expected from Will Smith, and if you're a fan of apocalyptic sci-fi-ish horror flicks, you can watch this without being disappointed. It's actually more scary than most actual horror movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>*Spoilers begin here!* The thing that actually makes the regular version a lot crappier than the one with the proper ending, is that in the first, we have a hero, in the second we have an anti-hero. A cocky representative of the human species, that thinks that if it looks like a soulless monster, it must be a soulless monster, is trying to find the cure by deriving it from his naturally immune self. Noble you might say, but this guy ends up killing hundreds of sentient beings, because he can't look outside his human box and say 'hey, maybe these bastards aren't as hollow as I thought', not even when a vampire dude walks into the sun just to try to grab a friend/daughter/girlfriend from the clutches of out scientist dude. 'He must've been real hungry' Neville says and doesn't give it a second thought. <br/><br/>At the 'controversial' end, he realizes that the creepy guys were after him because he had ruthlessly killed hundreds of their own, and they wanted to retrieve the most recent capture he had made. The thing that would've made this story a 9 star one would have been if our anti-hero would have died, after realizing that he had killed non-savages. Be it by shooting himself or by slitting his writs and letting the guys have a bite, it doesn't matter, though I'd go with the latter, but the guy should have died. All in all, that's what legends are, dead guys that people talk about for a long time. <br/><br/>Anyway, the alternative ending is really worth it, and though, as I read in a review here, the film gets kind of preachy and god-loving as soon as the new female presence is detected, and though that annoys the hell out of me too, I recognize the fact that I wasn't the only one targeted for this film.<br/><br/>Bottom line, watch it, it's cool - but with the alternative ending!"

","As others have said, the CGI is very bad, the ""infected"" don't act like vampires, as they are in the novel, they act more like cartoon monkeys and climb like Spiderman. They all look exactly the same, and they know how to keep dogs on a leash, which is surprising. In the classic survival-horror story, Neville is a regular guy-next-door, who's trying to survive as best he can, and uses his generator to operate necessities...the movie however has Neville as a scientist who watches pre-recorded news broadcasts, and uses his generators to operate, not only his entertainment electronics, but a vast array of scientific equipment down in his basement--which is very unbelievable, and made the movie even more stupid in my opinion. Another lame idea of the movie is that he believes everyone else in the world is dead and yet is trying to come up with a vaccine...for what purpose? How would he administer this vaccine, if successful, to the millions--if not billions--of infected? The ending is extremely weak and again, very poor CGI. The only good CGI in the movie are the scenes involving an abandoned and overgrown New York City.<br/><br/>This movie falls extremely short of the literature it was taken from. The screen adaptation is poor and the CGI is horrible. They should watch Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead, and you can see what really good makeup effects can do and sometimes the less CGI you use--the better it can be. If done correctly, a film-adaptation of the Richard Matheson story would be a great movie, but this movie isn't worth owning, and far-less worthy of the Matheson title. Read the original book and use your imagination."

I was hoping this remake would take it to the next level. This one makes a total mess of the story resulting in a totally inept action movie with no soul.<br/><br/>The whole feel of being alone in the world, hunter and hunted, the fear of the lurking enemy is missing. Instead we have a car chase through Manhattan, an immature kid/brilliant scientist/terrible strategist main character, totally unnecessary flashbacks to explain the obvious, CGI monsters with super-human physical abilities instead of semi-human mutants, incomprehensible stupidity on the part of the hero, alternating thinking and animal behavior from the ""monsters"", undeveloped secondary characters and lots of action scenes to cover a lack of ""soul"".<br/><br/>There were a few promising moments: Will Smith's relationship with his dog and the pain of losing the dog after it saves him... The fearful nights, the hiding and the need to cover up smells and any signs that might lead ""them"" to him, the tense scene in the dark building when he discovers the hive.<br/><br/>What is missing? Connection with the character. Time showing the ""routine"" of his life, his ""relationship"" with his opponents, insight into his quest and why he is a ""Legend"", his loneliness.<br/><br/>What is botched? The CGI monsters leaping tall building, tearing the roofs off houses, breaking through walls with their heads, acting like wild animals but planning clever traps? Raising attack dogs? Setting up mannequins? Too many action sequences, too many explosions, too many car chases, too much gun play, too much brawn, not enough brains. Secondary characters are wasted, final wrap up feels like a quick exit left and lacks any feeling."

","I am Legend takes place in a post epidemic world, and depicts the struggle for survival of one man on Manhattan Island. As one of the most amazing breakthrough in medical science becomes one of mans darkest fears and as people start to die society starts to unravel. This action/drama stars Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville and Alice Braga as Anna as well as an amazing performance by Abbey the dog as Sam. It contains just enough leg jerk moments to keep you on the edge of your seat the first time you see it. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to anybody who is into survival movies or zombie flicks, but not to young children as some of the scene may be disturbing to them. As Dr. Neville said, ""God didn't do this, we did"", and as such the world ended with a whimper not a bang."

","All in all, I Am Legend is even a disappointment if one went in expecting disappointment. There is no deeper examination of loneliness, just shots of aloneness. The threat to Neville has been dumbed down- in earlier versions he is the threat. In this film, he is the threatened. The female he meets is a religious bubblehead, rather than a plant from the semi-zomboids that are looking to start a New Breed. And on and on goes the watering down. The film fails as both an adaptation, and if seen without knowledge of its forebears. But, aside from its Hollywoodization stripping the tale of its relevance and depth, this film version even fails its low Hollywoodized standards of success- it's dull, poorly made, and has not a second of suspense. It is a retard's retard. But, as I always seek to give credit where it's due, let me state to that grandfather of Hollywood dumbing down, 'Thanks for nothing, Mr. Spielberg!'"

","Two thirds of this film is wonderful entertainment, both in scope and story telling, and in Will Smith we have a cracking central performance that carries the film with consummate ease, sadly the final third undoes all the great promise and tension building that had gone before. <br/><br/>After a genetic engineered cancer curing virus wipes out practically all of mankind, Robert Neville {Will Smith} appears to be the sole surviving human on earth, the only company he has is the family dog and an army of virus infected mutants that can only come out in the dark. That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure. <br/><br/>Yes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth. <br/><br/>Secondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would of been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used admittedly to competent effect, and Fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then............... <br/><br/>They throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money ?, well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame."

","I saw this movie probably around a year ago, but I still remember the storyline pretty well.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man and his dog, supposedly the last man and dog on earth. A plague had spread a few years back that killed most of the people on earth, but turned the rest into zombie like creatures. Neville (the man) is immune to the plague, and he's trying to find a cure. Now, these zombie like creatures can only come out at night (Is anyone surprised?) So one night, Neville captures one, and tries to see if he can ""heal"" it. But not before some things happen, and his dog passes on. I bawled so hard, most likely because they extend his death to the full, and the dog died trying to protect his owner. I love animals, so that was really sad to me.

Smith is really good and he should do more drama! <br/><br/>The vision of an empty New York is surreal and as attracting as scary! Between ""the Stand"" and ""War of the Worlds"", the terror is never so high when it takes root in our daily life. ""Dracula"" is maybe frightening but as Pennsylvania is far away, it is also baroque. Not here. The reality is cold, uncompromising.

","This is another one of those films that takes an interesting concept but has no idea how to conclude it. For the first two thirds of the film, I was on the edge of my seat as Will Smith entered dark, derelict buildings. It is a shame though that the final third changes the films atmosphere and takes away any suspense that was in the first two thirds of the film.<br/><br/>Thankfully Will Smith is consistent as ever doing a fantastic performance as Robert Neville, a scientist who is working on a cure to heal infected humans. His performance carries the film and it would not have been half as good, were he not involved.<br/><br/>People have complained about the CGI in the film and it is indeed bad in places. However this did not bother me as I was able to ignore it. The real issues though is the ending. Without spoiling too much, the ending reveals a lot to the audience that makes the film feel like a waste. It is anti-climatic and this is were the alternative ending succeeded. <br/><br/>The film is exciting for the most part and Will Smith gives another powerhouse performance but the ending is a disappointment.

","Will Smith does a creditable job of bringing Richard Matheson's post-apocalyptic tale to life. This story was made into a movie in the 50s (Last Man on Earth), but was kind of boring and low budget. Then there was the 70s Omega Man with Chuck Heston, which was more fun and more action, but still low budget and a little too campy. I am Legend lends the right amounts of action and pathos to the tale, and keeps your interest throughout. Smith's acting is very good, showing that he can do drama as well as romantic comedy. The creatures, brought to life through computer animation, are far superior to the goons in fright wigs seen in Omega Man. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised."

","I recently decided to watch and compare the movies Last Man on Earth and I Am Legend. The Last Man on Earth was filmed in 1964 and starred Vincent Price. In both these movies to men live in a ravaged world filled with disease and monster. In the movie the Last Man on Earth, Vincent Price played a man named Morgan who lived in a small town infested by the sick. These sick people appear to be carrying the vampire virus which they received from an airborne sickness. These people only come out at night and try to kill all the immune survivors of the outbreak. During the movie Morgan tries to find other survivors and when he eventually does it isn't for the better. This other survivor of the sickness Morgan fears to be the only one left so he convinces her to come with. After spending time with her, he discovers that she too is infected by the virus but, has some form of cure. And after discussing with her the matters of the time being, the woman reveals the something vital to the being of Morgan. According to the woman there was a group of survivors who had a temporary cure for the disease and this group was angered at Morgan for killing people they could have saved. Then the woman so sick, collapsed on the couch exhausted at all the excitement fell asleep on the couch. During this time Morgan had a great idea. His idea was to transfer the blood of himself into the woman. Eventually the idea paint off. He had created a permanent cure for the disease but, not soon enough. After his breakthrough, just as the woman predicted the group of angered survivors came and shot Morgan down. But, there was still hope the woman now had the cure in her blood and I eventually predict that the world was restored to its once peaceful self. In I Am Legend, the main character Robert Neville was played by Will Smith. In this movie Robert lives in a deserted New York City filled with zombie-like creatures. The creatures were created by an airborne disease that was supposed to be the cure for cancer. In this movie Robert is much more focused on finding a cure for the disease than he is for finding survivors. After many attempts and after losing his dearest friend, his dog Sam, and meeting other survivors he eventually discovers the cure after giving his life to do so. The movie ends with sort of a cliff hanger and lets you decide the ending very similar to the first movie.<br/><br/>Honestly, I enjoyed the newer version better. To me it much more appealing and seems that it was better thought out than the first one. Both these movies are entertaining though and they both have a different way of trying to frighten the movie-goer.<br/><br/>Ratings: I am Legend – 8 stars out of 10 The Last Man on Earth – 7 stars out of 10"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","0","6 March 2010"," Smith Shines In An Understated Perfromance But Otherwise 'I Am Legend'...
","'I Am Legend' sort of follows the same path as '28 Days Later' except this time with more money and less development. The set design is impressive and the sense of isolation and doom is well created though the CGI isn't really at its best. While the film is entertaining in parts, it severely lacks character and story development. There are just so many plot holes. The best parts were the scenes between Robert and his dog Sam. Thanks to Will Smith and Abbey and Kona (the two dogs who excellently play Samantha), we get a sense of how lonely Robert is in this world that has been abandoned by humans and his one and only friend is his dog. It would have been interesting to see how Robert further deals with his loneliness when he's completely isolated but instead this is cut short when, in a fit of rage, he goes to attack numerous zombies and this leads to meeting two other people. This last half hour is terribly rushed. Smith is quite restrained here, a welcome change from his usual over-the-top characters he's more recognized for. Even though the character could have been further defined in terms of writing, Smith makes the best of it. Alice Braga doesn't have much to do with her limited screen time. Think of this movie as 'Castaway' in a metropolitan island filled with photosensitive zombies. 'I Am Legend' can be watched for Will Smith's performance but otherwise it doesn't have much to offer."
"vreejack","4","0","0","16 February 2010"," Too, Too Many Plot Holes
","I spent most of this movie scratching my head and asking, ""But..."" as a continuous stream of implausible events over-tested my ability to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>1) One of the major plot flaws is the use of measles as the agent of destruction, which is ridiculous for a number of reasons, the most important being that virtually everyone in the developed world with the exception of people with compromised immune systems and a few anti-vaccer nuts, is completely immune to measles. Aside from that there are other esoteric problems such as the fact when infectious agents are used in this way their ability to be infectious is completely destroyed.<br/><br/>2) Robert Neville drives around Manhattan hunting feral deer and harvesting his own maize in the warm summer days, retreating to the safety of his bathtub when the sun sets. But Manhattan gets an average of just over 72 cm of snowfall a year, which means that with no one left to plow or shovel it that there is going to be a coating of snow on the ground from mid-December to the beginning of March. Even if the roads were clear he could not risk going out to hunt on a cold day for fear that it might start to snow while he was out, giving the dark-seekers an easy track to follow once the sun set.<br/><br/>3) How did the dark-seekers survive the winter? For three winters they have survived freezing cold in unheated, open buildings, with no appreciable clothing. With elevated body temperatures, no less. Note that they avoided doors, and preferred to tunnel holes into the tops and sides of their nests. This does not make for a cozy environment. They would need to produce (and consume) ten times as much as an ordinary human in cold weather. This would have been very difficult on the coldest days, assuming that they needed to sleep. The kind of disregard that they display for their own health would not likely enable them to survive their first winter, never mind three.<br/><br/>4) I know they wanted to avoid an -R- rating, but having the clothes on the dark-seekers decay so modestly was just silly. The rags were not offering any thermal protection and would have been difficult to manipulate in their unfortunate state. I find it hard to believe that they would bother to put them back on after answering a call of nature. If they had the presence of mind to do that then they could at least have found some more clothes in better repair.<br/><br/>5) Anna seems to be experienced in dealing with dark-seekers. She has a flashy truck armed with bright UV-emitting lights and seems to be armed with some kind of phosphor weapon for really effective vampire repellence. She has seen them up-close before, mentioning that they always seemed to want to bite. But she didn't realize that the dark-seekers would follow her back from their encounter to Robert Neville's house. What?<br/><br/>6) All the bridges and tunnels to Manhattan were gone. How did Anna get her truck there? Or did she just happen to find and hot-wire a fully-equipped anti-vampire vehicle after it had been sitting around for three years? An impressively resourceful task for someone who didn't realize that the dark-seekers would follow her at night. She might have used some kind of ferry, but once again there is the issue of getting it running. Certainly Neville would have been curious, but he doesn't ask.<br/><br/>7) While it is theoretically possible (but not plausible) that the original cancer treatment somehow mutated--perhaps by mixing with another virus inside a patient--the idea that it could gain the power shown in the movie is beyond any reasonable stretch of the imagination, at least without some kind of explanation. The ability to kill 90% of the population is very strange. Even the Black Death only managed 30%-50% in an age of poor medicine and nutrition. Ebola can be as deadly to those it infects, but measles is not ebola even on its best day, so you have to assume that a nuisance virus that had lost its ability to be infectious not only gained it back but became much more virulent. Then there are the other symptoms: permanent modification of brain function such that the victims are converted into hot, murderous, blood-drinking vampires. Robert Neville is supposed to be a smart man, but after explaining to Anna just how awful and impossible this apocalypse has been, he draws the conclusion that ""There is no God."" Perhaps he meant that God was powerless in the face of this disaster, but given the implausibility of the events, wouldn't the correct conclusion be that this apocalypse could only have been brought about by God in the first place? Perhaps what he meant was that the ""God of Love"" that he had been brought up to expect obviously did not exist, and instead there was only a god of whimsical and malevolent destruction. But that wouldn't have played out very well with the end of the movie."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","14 July 2009"," An interesting and well unravelled genre piece that revels in its scenes of sheer terror, pure heartache and what some might call dopey symbolism.
","I think 2007's I am Legend is a fitting enough adaptation of a popular book that I have read about in terms of it carrying so much weight in terms of ingenuity and inspiration for contemporary texts. Films like I am Legend come complete with threat of just collapsing under the sheer familiarity of both its set up and narrative, but this pulls through. In terms of its placement within the genre of survival horror, the film makes the grade rather easily, but it does so with its fair share of ideas; dramatic set pieces; genuinely heartbreaking moments and striking visuals of deserted contemporary Western pieces of iconography.<br/><br/>I am Legend sees a solid, if familiar, set up involving what was first assumed to be a cure that helped humankind but actually carried a bit of a hitch. This is somewhere in late 2009. What was a cure for cancer progressed into a formula that mutates the individual it inhabits into something known as a Darkseeker which, rather obviously by name, demands they stay out of sunlight and in the nooks; crannies and rundown, abandoned buildings that make up the bulk of what is most probably all of the world's major towns and cities. So as to come across as contemporary, the film avoids the term 'vampire' in the same sense 28 Days Later avoided calling its antagonistic force zombies by manipulating into the text a plot point that demanded they be labelled 'infected'. Non-existent by day but screeching loudly and dominating the city by night, they act as a fairly interesting anti-human component to the text.<br/><br/>During the opening, mankind as a species is relegated to that of resembling an ancient hunter; wondering, perhaps aimlessly if the daily goals are not achieved, through a once bustling arena of contemporary life represented by towering buildings; street lamps; cars and numerous vast, once electronic, billboards that used to display advertisements for the latest in 'must have' consumerist items. All of that has gone and, albeit aided with an automobile of his own, the individual shots of a wandering lead seeking out game for means of nourishment work well.<br/><br/>The lead is Robert Neville (Smith), a once top U.S. Army virologist, now rendered the only known human left in New York City after having spent three years on his own. But he is accompanied by the film's non-human component, which comes in the form of his German Shepard dog named Samantha. For its very brief and relatively basic substance during this opening, I am Legend calls, albeit meekly, on inspiration from 2000's Cast Away as a man struggling with his loneliness in this dystopian setting. If Cast Away took place on a beautiful and somewhat exotic deserted island and turned it into a place of terror and no hope, then I am Legend's look at New York City as a place that retains its contemporary look and vast feel, only with undergrowth beginning to take over. The key difference is I am Legend's ingredient of an antagonistic force in the Darkseekers, something the lead must be weary of.<br/><br/>But it is all very brief. Some key scenes to get across this factor of loneliness sees Neville interact with mannequins he has taken from other shops and actually placed in stores he visits to get across a sense that he is communicating with people. I am Legend's decision to break the film up into past and present tenses works surprisingly in its favour. The cut aways from the first instance we hear the Darkseekers howling in the night leave us on a knife edge of sorts as we go back into the past for some brief pre-apocalyptic story to do with Neville and his wife and young daughter. Addtionally, the flashbacks don't feel as intrusive as they might've done; we can take a break from Neville in his post-apocalyptic world and hark back to see the development of the outbreak without really feeling frustrated or torn away form something. The approach and this manipulation of time aids in distancing the film from things like 28 Days Later and the subsequent sequel released around the same time as I am Legend.<br/><br/>If there is any substance in I am Legend, then it is rather unfortunately linked to the finale and the very end of the piece, which halts going into things too deeply. Other than this, the film is principally a nuts and bolts survival horror only with the lead being able to freely inhabit the space in which he is surviving in during the day. Items are removed from the text and the film dips slightly, whereas certain other elements are installed into the text, even if they carry a nagging, obligatory feel to them.<br/><br/>It's thought that when the third element that does actually meet with Neville stumbles across him, it was God that brought them together. The introduction of God via the dialogue is a distinct shift towards what the film ultimately builds to: a scene of great sacrifice so that millions of others may live on, echoing the plight of Jesus Christ. It's the sort of symbolism that'll have some groaning in frustration, others crying gallons of tears, depending on which way the text sways you. But I bought it, and I enjoyed all the somewhat familiar point of attack; establishing of the situation; Neville's routine plus relationship with the new world in which he lived as well as the overall direction the film took me."
"gav_mcf","7","0","0","11 July 2009"," By no means Legendary, but Will Smith makes it worth your time.
","Having never read the novel or seen the other I Am Legend adaptations (1964's The Last Man on Earth & 1971's The Omega Man with Charlton Heston), I am judging purely on Lawrence's latest version.<br/><br/>Smith as usual is very good and as watchable as ever in his role as lonely survivor Neville. With only a canine and various mannequins for company, he manages the role really well and carries the film easily. The first 40 minutes are basically a one man show and an acting masterclass from Smith's point of view. Having a few serious roles under his belt and two Oscar noms (Ali and more recently The Pursuit of Happiness) you can see Smith is now very comfortable in these roles and has somewhat distanced himself from comedy.<br/><br/>In the build up to Legend, you have to say the campaign for the film was excellent. Trailers, posters and early buzz were all really positive, huge $150 million budget, chilling images and concept art of a deserted New York grabbed attention from fans as well, not to mention Will Smith's box office appeal. The question is that does the film live up to all the hype? I would say yes, it does... just.<br/><br/>My main gripe with the film is with the infected, vampire-like creatures known as the ""Dark Seekers"", using all CGI for them was definitely a mistake. They just move too fast and don't look real at all, they reminded me of something out of a computer game. Lawrence's inexperience comes through in this aspect and you can't help but think how better handled the infectants were in Danny Boyle's similar but superior 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Although in saying that, Lawrence directs Smith very well through the day and when it's just him and the dog, they are easily the best parts of the film. You have to remember that this is only Constantine director Francis Lawrence's second film, and you have to say he does a pretty good job with keeping up the tension and generally keeping the audiences engaged.<br/><br/>A word must also go the New York setting. Elements like deserted buildings and grass growing through the streets are very well done. The special effects here are brilliant. You sometimes have trouble figuring out which parts of the city they really cleared for shooting, and which parts are CGI.<br/><br/>To sum up Legend, I think it's definitely worth checking out. If you can forgive the woeful misjudgement of the Dark Seekers I think you will enjoy it. It's likely you will because they are merely a distraction and it's Will Smith's excellent, affecting performance that will be your main afterthought after seeing this movie. Perhaps He Is Legend after all."
"pfgpowell-1","6","0","0","25 April 2009"," Entertaining enough, so give it a shot
","There's nothing much wrong with I Am Legend despite the carping that it isn't as good as previous versions of the novel of the same title. It has to be said that Will Smith, who began his career as a lightweight is again rather good, and as he gets older and matures as an actor we might well be in for several more good performances. The outstanding feature of this version, courtesy of modern technology, of course, but then who cares, is its depiction of Manhattan as a wasteland in which only the birds, a herd of deer and a couple of lions are the sign of any significant life. How a herd of deer and lions end up in post-apocalypse Manhattan is not at all clear, but then, come one this is Hollywood. Hollywood can do these things. Next in the rather good things about I Am Legend comes Will Smith's performance which has to carry the film for almost all of its shortish running length, but this he does admirably. It is remarkable that just he, his dog and eventually an assortment of mutants star in the film for much of the time, but our interest keeps up and there is none of that quiet glancing at watches which is a sure indicator that not all is right with a film. When I Am Legend does finally develop and it becomes apparent that Will Smith is, after all, not the only human to have survived the onslaught of a badly virus which was supposed to eradicate cancer but instead eradicates 9/10s of the world's population, the film moves rather quickly to its ending, which - and I'm assuming the novel and its filmed versions all carried some kind of message - is one of hope. Along the way Smith copes with the mutants who have all been ravaged by the virus and who, for some reason, all develop superhuman strength, agility and aggression. We, the viewer, simply have to accept that, because no reason is given. At the end of the day, if one were to analyse I Am Legend, there is any number of incongruities. Where does the electricity supply come from, how come a woman and her son on their way from Brazil to Vermont detour via Manhattan, especially has we are earlier informed that all its bridges have been destroyed in an attempt to isolate New York and the virus. Then there is the matter of her and her young son's escape - just how was it possible to get out of a tunnel in Smith's lab after surviving an explosion, get off Manhattan despite the lack of bridges to the outside world and find a - rather smart - SUV with which to reach a colony of humans which has survived the virus and is re-establishing itself in Vermont? But what the hell. I've remarked elsewhere that there are two kinds of films: those which, for some reason, you like and which you will forgive many flaws, and those which, for some reason you take against and which you nitpick to death. Largely thanks to Will Smith and the rather splendid recreation of Manhattan as a wasteland, this film, for me, falls into the first category. You might feel that way as well."

Although everyone had been raving about this, I went in expecting nothing more than some above average escapist action, considering the hype. From the moment they try to instill that heavy sense of depth by having Will Smith breath heavily, scared snotless of the badly CGI'ed monsters, they lost me. Reading what I have of the book, it feels like it might not have come across quite as pretentious if it had stuck to the ideas of the book closer, but it went with the most hackneyed apocalypse scenario, and by limiting the potential of the vampires in order to cut him off so completely from any society, they had to find ways around cinematic stumbling blocks they created themselves. This means a lot of predictable fluffing around, a lot of injecting existential angst into the main character, and not much else.<br/><br/>Somehow I was just expecting something a little more original."

","First off I am a rather big fan of Richard Matheson's classic Novel of the same name but sadly that's really all the novel and film have in common is the same name except for the fact people get infected that's all. As a stand alone film I Am Legend serves up cheap thrills thin plot and an abandoned attempt to show Robert Neville's psychological breakdown but if you have a Saturday free and want to see a little action go for it. As an adaptation OH MY GOD why did they even call it I Am Legend it changed the location the actually events leading to the virus the way the virus affected humans it completely abandoned the point of the original book and turned the most brilliant darkly ironic endings to a run of the mill seen it a billion times ending.

","This film goes in a different direction with Richard Matheson's novel than Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth. This is the most interesting adaptation, as it skips over the original message regarding the foolishness of mankind, and focuses on Dr. Robert Neville's struggle to find hope and maintain his sanity after a pandemic kills nearly everybody on the planet. With his dog, Sam, as his only means of company for the past three years, Robert Neville still tries to find the miracle cure for the man-made disease.<br/><br/>The setting of ground-zero Manhattan - after three years in the absence of man - incorporates annihilated buildings clashing with wildlife such as deer (these clashing elements are epitomized in the opening scene in which Robert Neville chases down a deer with his car). The setting is fantastically done, sporting the best set decoration of 2007.<br/><br/>While the first half of the movie contains no dialogue, (all of the speaking takes place when Dr. Neville is talking to his dog or mannequins which he has set up through the city) you still learn so much about Robert Neville's character, and Will Smith's performance is perfect. The limited dialogue between Neville and Anna is always meaningful and extremely well-acted.<br/><br/>If for nothing else, see this movie for its outstanding acting performances. But this movie has a lot to offer, particularly the incredible score by James Newton-Howard.<br/><br/>9.2 out of 10"

","A fairly good movie. I never rented or saw it in the movie theater cause the title and picture seemed egotistical and most movies these days suck, so I figured this one would as well. <br/><br/>But I watched it on one of those free movies sites and thought it was pretty good. If you get past the many problems with the story; That after 3 years most of the food would have expired, That all the gas would have been gone or been no good anymore, That the electricity would have all been shut off, That the zombie monsters with rabies would have long since died of starvation. <br/><br/>That there was no real explanation why some people get this virus, while he didn't, his dog didn't, the deer and the lions didn't and many of the other inconsistencies and confusion with the stories....<br/><br/>If you get past all that, it's a fairly good movie and subject matter. I'm sure everybody has dreamed about such a thing, having a whole city to themselves, I think they could have done a little bit more with that other than going to the video rental store, you'd think. <br/><br/>But in a new world of floods of horribly bad cheap crappy Hollywood movies, Will Smith still makes a movie good enough to wait for it to download for free, and that is saying a lot these days. <br/><br/>I think I'd even buy it if I see it for sale on the previously viewed rack at the local drug store. <br/><br/>So two thumbs up, with a lot of plot line problems."

","A lot of violence and mutants. Will Smith rules Los Angeles! I watched it the day it came to theaters. It is a whole lot better than ""The Omega Man"", starring Charlton Heston. The technology of 2007 is better than the technology of 1971. The movie is really sad, because first, his dog dies, then in the end of the film, he takes a hand-grenade and dies in the explosion. Then in the end, they mention the year 2008 A.D., that his life was dedicated for finding the cure for the unstoppable virus. What is scary about the film is the way the mutants look and they way they act and bite others. What's really scary was when the dog died and turn into a mutant."

I know that the number is an average of what others voted, but it just was not that great.<br/><br/>Visually, there were plenty of things that were interesting. New York in the future was fantastic. And, since the original story came from Richard Matheson, of course it is terrific. Still, there are moments where it seemed almost anti-religion.

"sddavis63","8","0","0","2 December 2008"," Good Version Of A Familiar Story
","I've seen Vincent Price in 1964's ""The Last Man On Earth"" but not Charlton Heston's ""The Omega Man."" Along with ""I Am Legend"" all three are versions of the same sci-fi story. I liked the Price movie, although I thought there were a number of holes in the story which made it difficult to accept. For the most part, ""I Am Legend"" avoids those holes (although it does leave some unanswered questions - probably deliberately, since the disease and its effects are supposed to be mysteries.) Will Smith was excellent as Robert Neville, a military scientist who is one of the last survivors of a deadly disease that spread rapidly around the world. The disease started as a miracle cure for cancer until the side effects - described in the movie as being like the beginning of rabies - started to develop. Eventually, the disease causes mutations and even physical changes which leave the afflicted living a sort of wild-animal like existence, hunting after dark for victims to kill and devour. Neville for some reason is immune to the disease and fights both to find a cure for it and to survive.<br/><br/>Compared to the '64 version, I thought this was by far the superior movie. Neville's psychological deterioration struck me as more realistic than anything portrayed by Price, the afflicted humans are more believable than the zombie-like vampires come back from the dead in the '64 movie, and overall this movie is far more frightening (and yet not particularly bloody). Smith was often putting on a virtual one man show, and he did so quite successfully. One could say that Neville's ultimate fate was a bit too cliché for a Hollywood action movie, and while I appreciated the extremely hopeful end of the movie, things at that ""survivors colony"" in Vermont did seem far too ""normal."" (And, if that colony could survive because the virus couldn't survive the cold, then one assumes that we in Canada must have been quite fine, so I'll stop dreaming about the South Pacific and rejoice in the cold and snowy winters!) Overall, though, this was a pretty enjoyable ride. 8/10"
"Enchorde","8","0","0","16 November 2008"," Very good sci-fi thriller
","Recap: Aiming to cure cancer a humanly engineered virus is tried on humans. However, it mutates and starts to spread widely in the population. The effects are horrendous. The infected become highly light-sensitive, extremely aggressive flesh-eating monsters. Only a few are immune, and most of them are killed. One survivor is Robert Neville, an army virologist expert. He stays in NY fighting for his own survival, every day working to find a cure to save the planet.<br/><br/>Comments: This is a very good sci-fi thriller, and it is that because of many reasons. Mainly, it is because it keeps the suspense throughout the movie. Sure, there are no major twists or surprises, but most scenes are filled with suspense. Either from some impending threat or by using flashbacks to explain how everything came to be like it is.<br/><br/>Secondly, I really liked that we for once could have a epidemic without having all turning into zombies and turning the movie into a blood-dripping slasher-movie. Sure, there is blood, there are action but it is not the main theme. Instead the focus is much more on Neville's loneliness (portrayed very good by Smith) and lack of human contact than monster-hunting. A very wise decision by director Lawrence, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Director Lawrence's skill and ambition are evident in my third point. The details. Sure, there are some goofs. Some that should have been avoided, quite easily at that. But most are not that important. What I really liked however is the details, some are just lying in the background. A lot of the story is told by articles posted in the background, for example on Neville's refrigerator. And I don't think the inclusion of Bob Marley or the extensive part from Shrek (loneliness) is coincidental. And what about the butterflies... With this and Constantine (2005) in his repertoire, Lawrence's future work is worth looking out for.<br/><br/>I had expected a more action packed blockbuster but got a nice surprise. This is a pure thriller with a lot of talent in it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Karl Self","7","0","0","9 November 2008"," Zombies, again
","I know that this movie is based on a ""legendary"" book, and I presume that it received a lot of hype when it came out stateside. From the fact that it's already out on DVD, I guess it didn't do too well at the box-office.<br/><br/>I caught it on DVD and without expecting too much, which allowed the movie to surprise me positively. It is very entertaining while you're still trying to figure out what the duck is going on. Will Smith's acting is outstanding, and the movie builds up the suspense very effectively. It's an intelligent and at the same time entertaining movie which brings a fresh breath of death to the often rather stolid horror genre.<br/><br/>That said, it's not perfect either. For instance, the CGI-zombies don't work that well (they look fake, like out of a computer game), and there are many other elements of the movie which overstretch the viewer's credulity for the cheap benefit of a quick thrill (strangely in those movies, the viewer usually buys the general premise -- aliens from Nebulon-3 have invaded earth and are now feeding on puppy's brains -- but gets stuck on fairly minor details such as ""Sgt Brubaker fires 13 rounds of transmuto-semtex at the slime-bot when the clip of the T7/A1 holds only 12""). Right at the beginning, for example, Will Smith hunts deer in a ghost-towned New York City by pursuing them in his shiny Ford Mustang -- cool, spectacular, but also pretty moronic, especially as it later turns out that while he never manages to shoot a single animal for food, he has absolutely no difficulty capturing those blood-guzzling zombies alive. Less would often have been more in this movie, the zombies would have been more effective if they had been less visible, the basement lab would have been more believable if it had been a bit less vulcano-lair-ish and his flat more plausible if it had looked less like straight out of the Ikea catalogue, etc. The movie is best in its quiet moments, like when we realise how the relationship between Neville and his dog represents his last bond to his previous life, or how he uses his daily routine of ""renting"" DVDs from a store to keep sane (with varying success).<br/><br/>The movie kind of jumps the shark when Anna and that little boy arrive, but luckily it wraps up the story fairly neatly and quickly from there on.<br/><br/>And I really can't get over the fact that Anna's never heard of Bob Marley. She's never seen his face, heard his name, and doesn't recognise even his biggest hits. Even my grandma can sing the chorus to ""No Woman No Cry"". From that point on, I was rooting for the zombies.<br/><br/>Overall, not a classic but still a solid, entertaining, thrilling movie, with a fantastic performance by Will Smith, and a new twist on an old theme."
"erikgloor","7","0","0","1 November 2008"," Smith Saves Flawed Vision of Apocalypse
","Everything bad about this movie almost spoils everything that is good about it  almost. Will Smith once again saves the day by making sure we're at home in his latest effects-driven picture and invested in its story instead of feeling like the 20 we dropped for tickets might have been better spent on a new shirt.<br/><br/>Playing Colonel and scientist Robert Neville, Smith nicely updates the last-man-on-earth concept with his trademark humor and humanity. Only Smith could get a laugh from an audience while we watch him patrol an eerily sad and decayed cityscape overgrown with encroaching foliage.<br/><br/>But Smith's world is more than just eerie. At night, other survivors of the air-born virus that wiped out 90 percent of the world's population come out to roam the streets and feed on any person or animal unfortunate enough to cross their paths. For these survivors, the virus has twisted them into bald, sinewy, vicious and oddly acrobatic ""dark-seekers"" who'd just as soon eat your head as look at you. Smith is among the tiny fraction who survived symptom-free due to a natural immunity. The dark-seekers seek the dark because the virus has also cursed them with an inability to withstand sunlight and their skin starts to sizzle and smoke in the faintest of light rays. Being Irish, this reviewer felt an uncomfortable fealty with these poor creatures on this point.<br/><br/>Accompanied by his faithful companion, Sam, a German Shepherd, Smith's Neville wiles the days away watching three-year-old tapes of the 'Today Show;' chipping golf balls off the wings of flightless fighter jets; chatting with mannequins, and hunting deer in Time Square  now overgrown with tall grass. But he also replays in dreams his family's doomed flight from Manhattan; seeks other survivors by way of a daily radio broadcast and experiments on captured dark-seekers in an attempt to find a cure for the virus.<br/><br/>The sight of Smith fishing in corporate coy ponds and cracking jokes with his dog keeps the haunting solitude from overwhelming the film but we wonder in a number of scenes if that's such a good thing. Giving us a little more time to ponder the concept may have helped its weight. The sun sets in the distance over tantalizingly vacant skyscrapers but we're invariably tied to whatever shoot'em up action Smith is coping with in the foreground.<br/><br/>But then the film grabs you by the heart-strings and shows you just how invested in the plight of Smith's 30-something boy-and-his dog story you've become. While it's got you, Smith's youthful next-generation movie-star humanity steps in and does that thing it always does in his effects-driven films: makes you take it all just seriously enough. He puts you squarely in his character's shoes and then makes you proud to be there. Only Smith can embrace pop-culture crappola in one breath and put a lump in your throat the next. His sentimental soliloquy about life and love in which the film's title is tied to a beloved Bob Marley album ( instead of the more obvious, somewhat prideful interpretation ) marks an effective emotional crux. This reviewer has never seen the 1971 'Omega Man,' adaptation, but I expect Charlton Heston's Neville was significantly less satisfying in this respect.<br/><br/>What drags this film down is the usual Hollywood smart-assery that inevitably infuses major releases like too much bad cologne: The dark-seekers can't just be a pack of lost souls with a heightened form, perhaps, of rabies. They've got to be computer-animated vampires with lightning-fast reflexes and super-human agility. A character cannot just meet another character in likely fashion but must be rescued in the nick of time from certain death. You can't have just a likable scientist at the center of your plot; he's also got to be a muscle-bound hipster with a wisecrack for every situation and a blast of machine-gun fire for anyone who ticks him off. In a key opening sequence we accompany Smith on safari in midtown Manhattan where a lion  yes, a lion -- ultimately takes down Smith's intended prey. Despite the faith moviegoers have lately placed in computer animation, this film's makers are definitely abusing the privilege. This scene's ""lion"" looked like a refugee from Pixar's cutting room floor  circa 1998. Same goes for the dark-seekers. If someone at Warner Brothers neglected to compare the cost of paying some animators for a few months of work versus paying an animal wrangler and a makeup artist for a few weeks of work, they should have thought twice about it.<br/><br/>Major, major kudos, however, to the set designers and everyone involved in making you believe you're looking at a New York three years after every person on Earth has perished. Grass growing in the middle of Broadway and brackish water filling underground parkways definitely set the mood.<br/><br/>In the end, though, it's Smith's depth and star-power that land this film safely in the winner's circle. From everyday exultation to heart-breaking loss and everything in between, it's the rare note that Smith misses.<br/><br/>Good for him and see this movie.<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"
"dee.reid","7","0","0","31 October 2008"," Surprisingly good, albeit flawed, ""Legend""
","There is a certain majesty and genuine creepiness present in the early sequences of ""I Am Legend,"" an apocalyptic sci-fi/horror, last-man-on-Earth featuring Will Smith as Robert Neville, our heroic Last Man on Earth. The film opens with Neville, accompanied by his German Shepherd Sam, driving a new Ford Mustang through the streets of a barren New York City chasing a herd of deer. Stalking one through Times Square, he's about to pull the trigger when he discovers that a lion is about to have a much better day.<br/><br/>And so begins ""I Am Legend,"" an adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel, and had it come out in 2001 or 2002, it might fair better in the area of being a genuinely frightening sci-fi/horror flick. Other similarly themed movies have come out over the years, most notably ""The Omega Man"" (1971) and more recently ""28 Days Later..."" (2002), all of which have had varying degrees of success in adapting Matheson's work or taking the theme to a whole new dimension.<br/><br/>In ""I Am Legend,"" the year is 2012, five years after a viral cure for cancer mutated into an even deadlier virus that turned much of the world's population into bloodthirsty vampires. As a result, the island of Manhattan was quarantined with all bridges leading onto it destroyed. He has the city all to himself during the day, feverishly working on a cure (to which he seems to have had some success at doing because he's somehow immune) but at night, it's time to batten down the hatches of his Central Park brownstone because at night, the city belongs to them - the ""Darkseekers"" (the plague-infected vampires) that own the night and the city when they come out to feed.<br/><br/>A wrinkle in the plot comes in the form of beautiful Anna (Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who have somehow managed to survive through this thing, thus no longer making Neville the Last Man on Earth. She says that they're heading north because there is a rumored ""sanctuary"" somewhere in the mountains of Vermont, where the virus cannot survive due to the cold. Neville is skeptical, but Anna is absolutely positive because she believes that there is still a God up there.<br/><br/>The early scenes of the film featuring only Smith and his loyal canine companion Sam are the best sequences of the entire picture. I'm not sure how director Francis Lawrence achieved the effect of a deserted New York City but it is damn compelling. And we get to see fairly early who Neville's nocturnal adversaries are in one particularly suspenseful scene.<br/><br/>But one area that ""I Am Legend"" seems to suffer from is the Last Man on Earth Really Isn't the Last Man on Earth Syndrome. It's one of the things that has repeatedly killed these sorts of movies in the past. I seriously think the movie would have been better had it just been the ""Will Smith Show Live & Uncut"" for 100 minutes. And another area that really faults the movie is its climax, which is a sort of haunted-house routine that kind of ends anti-climatically and felt more than a little cheap. Of special effects, there is no shortage of them, even if these effects look a little unrealistic for today's highly sophisticated times.<br/><br/>While ""I Am Legend"" has plenty of faults, it is a chilling effective sci-fi/horror picture that does deliver in terms of shocks and special effects. I only hope the next Last Man on Earth is truly the Last Man on Earth.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Richard Matheson's 1954 novel 'I Am Legend' has once again been made into a major motion picture. Over fifty years and two previous film adaptations later, 'I Am Legend' is being presented to a whole new generation of science-fiction fans. The latest edition of 'I Am Legend' sees 'Constantine' director, Francis Lawrence, take to the helm, with Oscar nominated actor Will Smith playing the lead.<br/><br/>The year is 2012 and the usually busy and 'never sleeping' Manhattan is eerily silent and decadent. For three years, the earth has been plagued by a man-made highly contagious virus which was originally created to cure cancer but is now the reason for the rapidly approaching demise of the human race. Smith's character, Robert Neville, is seemingly the sole survivor who single-handedly tries to find a cure that will ward off the apocalypse. As if this wasn't hard enough, venturing into the city can only be done during daylight hours, as when the sun sets is when things get sinister. Under the cover of darkness, 'The Infected' roam Manhattan, frantically searching for any trace of uninfected inhabitants.<br/><br/>Though it shares many similarities to the book there are also many differences, such as the location: sunny Los Angeles was changed to New York as the writer said the city was 'never empty', therefore making the content seem even more eerie. Perhaps the most recent film you could compare it to is Danny Boyle's British horror, '28 Days Later', where the main character awakes from a coma to find a usually abundant and loud city deserted and silent. Smith's character does have one advantage though; he knows exactly what has happened.<br/><br/>The main character is military scientist Robert Neville who, for three years, has been trying to save the world with his trusty canine companion, Samantha. Every day Neville sends out radio transmissions, under the call sign 'Legend', calling out for any survivors of the virus stating that he has shelter and food. A reply is never received. For a man who has seen his wife and child die in the very evacuation attempt that was meant to save them, he is surprisingly strong, both emotionally and physically. Maybe it is his sheer determination, or perhaps not knowing what else to do that keeps him fighting for his life and the freedom of the world. That is until The Infected set a trap for Neville involving one of the many mannequins that line the Manhattan shops. As a result of this Sam is attacked by a pack of infected dogs. While he escapes unscathed, Sam succumbs to the virus and it becomes a case of 'kill or be killed' for him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was inevitable that once Sam died that Neville would want to follow. Maybe it was because she was the last living thing he had contact with or the fact that she was the last connection between his wife and daughter. Whatever it is, he is now on a mission to destroy himself.<br/><br/>As always, Will Smith fits into and plays the role of 'I'm a just a guy trying to save the world' as well as he did in his previous films: Independence Day and Men In Black. Smith can always give a good performance even if the film is terribly dire. You would think that with so few characters in the movie that the casting crew would be able to find perfect actors for the ones there are, right? Wrong. Alice Braga, whose character Anna turned up at last minute with her son, performed rather poorly and made it seem as if she was just there to offer a quick ending to the story. Her son served only as a 'filler' role for the sympathy vote and to add the similarity between Neville's dead wife and daughter, making Anna's son a daughter would have only made this even more obvious than it already was.<br/><br/>Overall, the film did as well as the script allowed. Minor changes were permitted to the film that maybe shouldn't have been, such as the female characters' name from Ruth to Anna, or maybe Anna is a completely new uninfected character with a son thrown in for good mix while Ruth was cut from the film. The ending also seemed rather weak, exploring the theme of theology by making Neville seem Christ-like in sacrificing himself to save the rest of humanity. To me this seemed rather illogical; surely all of The Infected in Manhattan couldn't have been in Neville's lab or within a blast radius. Potentially, it could have been great, but ended up becoming just another apocalypse movie with zombie types thrown in."

","When it came out there was a great advertising and promotion campaign. Yet it did not fulfill its promises. One more survival film, you will say. Maybe but I am afraid it is more serious than that. One more epidemic film. Yes for sure, but yet it is deeper than that. One more zombie and living dead film then. Absolutely, but the disappointment comes from farther than that. The film uses three very common forms and it could have intertwined them and twisted them in a new creative way. But with one character and a dog, you do not go that far. In fact it is the whole argument of Stephen King's The Stand. The super flu, the dying of everyone, the survival of a few. But Stephen King remains human and the two antagonistic camps are human survivors and then they represent the two opposite impulses of the human species: to fight and kill to survive against others, and to organize collectively to survive with others. In this film the survivors are good humans and all the others are bad mutants. Badness in man is thus not human but anti-human. That is very naive indeed, especially when we understand the epidemic was caused by the irresponsible experiments of one doctor on thousands of people with genetically manipulated viruses. It is this vision of good humans attacked from outside by some who are no longer human at all that makes the film poor and even weak. Evil is not outside. Evil is inside. Anyone who says the reverse is just a blind man. Then the plot is no plot because we know what it is going to be. There is no surprise and no psychological death. And the dramatic events here and there are defused by too much disbelief to suspend. How did the woman arrive in Manhattan, how did she escape the house, how did she drive out of Manhattan, how did she know where to go? And many other questions like those. Then the legend becomes a fable and a weak one at that. Too bad because the theme could have been better and the author behind, Matheson, is supposed to be better than that.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","""I Am Legend"" is the third film adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic novel but only the first to use the original title. However, don't let that fact fool you into thinking that this film hews any closer to the source material. Still, that doesn't stop the film from being a decent effort in it's own right.<br/><br/>The story takes place a few years in the future after a miracle cure sparks a virus outbreak that kills 90% of the earth's population and leaves the few immune individuals to be terrorized by bloodthirsty, zombie-fied hosts.<br/><br/>Sounds more like ""28 Days Later"" than the novel ""I Am Legend"", right? Yes, the screenwriters basically chose to throw out any reference to vampirism and go the copycat route. Even the meaning of the title is twisted around to a different purpose. That being said, the story is a pretty good one, judged on it's own merits.<br/><br/>There's not much to remark of in terms of the cast. For most of the film Will Smith is the only human around. Smith is a reliable leading man and is certainly up to the task here.<br/><br/>The film's look is pretty good and manages to create a fairly convincing New York that is virtually devoid of human life. The CGI, on the other hand, isn't 100% believable in my opinion. Music is sparse, which is fitting for the material.<br/><br/>In the end, I thought that this was a good horror/action film. However, if you're looking for something that's (a) faithful to the novel, or (b) not a blatant rip-off of ""28 Days Later"", then you'd be advised to look elsewhere."

New York was ""his sector"" and his moral obligation to ""fix things"" is obsessive. Wife and child lost to an accident during evac of the city, now he blindly goes about his daily toil of hunting food, experimenting on rats, broadcasting his location to a world who may not be listening, ""hiring"" DVDs from the local store, and going slowly insane from the isolation.<br/><br/>While his cute German Shepherd, Samantha, frolics in the blighted cityscape, he smacks golf balls off aircraft carriers in the bay. It would be a good life, were it not for being no life at all.<br/><br/>Derelict future New York is all passively incredible CGI - a city dead of human intrusion, yet breathing with the life of nature; an exceptionally stunning cyclorama, not a simple rear-projection or matte, but a three-dimensional landscape, brimming with all the vibrancy that suffuses any real life tableau. It is some of the best CGI work you will ever witness; the effects companies who worked on this movie outdid themselves. (Among others, Sony Pictures Imageworks, CIS Hollywood, Lidar Services, New Deal Studios. The Visual Effects credits of this movie run longer than most movies' full credits.) <br/><br/>Yes, the best CGI you will ever see... until the lion pounces. The passive tableaux look sensational, but animate objects are a little harder to create from dust or a twelfth rib or even computer pixels. After the film-makers raised dead New York from the primordial pixel stew, they got cocky and imagined that LIFE would look just as convincing.<br/><br/>D'oh! <br/><br/>Though surrounded by mostly green screen, Will Smith still pulls his A-game, and a scene where he sobs disconsolately to a storeroom mannequin almost brings tears to US, not just due to his human deprivation, but also due to his unmitigated talent. And it doesn't hurt the ladies' visual experience that his daily exercise routine shows him ripped like the whip that scourged Jesus.<br/><br/>When Neville encounters the Dark-Seekers, we descend further into CGI audacity - these mutated humans (note: NOT zombies) are fully computer-generated, therefore kind goony cartoony. As antagonists for Neville, they would have been more compelling had they been actual humans enhanced by CGI. Dash Mihok is the Alpha Male Dark-Seeker - or at least, playing the computer blip that does the most roaring at Will Smith.<br/><br/>I AM LEGEND is the third incarnation of Richard Matheson's 1954 sf novel of the same name.

This 2007 version is directed by Francis Lawrence (CONSTANTINE, 2005) and re-scripted by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich.<br/><br/>In the third act, atheist Neville meets Jesus freak Anna (Alice Braga) and her son, refugees immune to the virus and on their way to an imagined sanctuary.

","Throughout watching this, I was thinking, ""ok, this is a little boring, but I'll give it more time"". I resolved to give it a little time, and decided that it was just about decent, and that I'd carry on watching. That is, until I looked a the clock. I'd been watching it for an hour, and pretty much nothing had happened! I honestly thought that what had happened could have been cut down to last about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>I was pretty disappointed, although I had many positive comments from others. I got comments such as ""it's amazing, you really have to watch it!"" from my friends. I looked at the parent guide on IMDb, and read that the movie was very intense, and would have audience jumping out of their seats. I think I may have jumped - once or twice.<br/><br/>However, I have to say that the film is very well put together. The plague victims are very well done, however the animals in New York do NOT look very realistic. The acting is great, Will Smith was brilliant at portraying his character.<br/><br/>But I expected more. All those tens of minutes really could have been spent making the plot so much clearer, and better explained. After about an hour, a lot started to happen, but little was really explained. In that hour of pretty much nothing going on, there could have been potential for really amazing stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that it is worth watching once or twice. Definitely worth renting, possibly not worth buying."

What happens if you take this formula and make it go Hollywood? Well, the entire movie gets tamed down and clichéd beyond repair to make it accessible to the masses.

"piksplanet","7","0","0","10 September 2008"," Will Smith is THE MAN!
","I Am Legend is a 2007 post-apocalyptic science fiction film based on Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name. It is the book's third celluloid adaptation. The film stars Will Smith and comes from director Francis Lawrence who earlier directed Constantine.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a futuristic film which is dependent on basically two things : Will Smith, and stunning visuals. The later succeeds in grabbing one's attention to an extent. The visuals of a 2012 Manhattan; empty, deserted, abandoned completely after the spread of a deadly man-made virus, are truly something to marvel at. However, if one remembers, this is nothing new. We have already seen such images in Danny Boyle's earlier film which revolves around a similar story, 28 Days Later. The only difference is that the setting there was London. The let-down here is that the film is a little too dependent on the visual effects. Even the zombies here are CGI as opposed to what they were in 28 Days Later. After a point of time, it no longer seems interesting anymore. There are just two sequences that are actually scary throughout the 100minute film.<br/><br/>However, the marvelous thing about I Am Legend are not the visuals, it is Will Smith. The actor shoulders just about everything on his own. It is entirely upto him to keep us involved, to keep us interested. And therein lies the savior of I Am Legend. The film itself might not prove to be much of a legend, but the individual who shoulders just about every second of the film is. Will Smith is The Man. He, singlehandedly, makes I Am Legend what it is. He makes you care. For him, for his pet dog, for his remaining cans of food, for his mental state, everything. The ending of the film was a bit of a let-down, as was the background score. Then again, maybe I was expecting a little too much. It loses out to 28 Days Later when it comes to being a solid post-apocalyptic film with zombies, but it still is quite a good watch.<br/><br/>6.5/10. All for Will Smith."
"demon_hunter34","6","0","0","6 September 2008"," A little disappointed
","I did not know what to expect of this movie. All I knew about it was from the trailers, and I seem to recall some friends of mine saying it was really good. I sat a little disappointed at the end.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was great. Just the thought of a post-apocalyptic city gives me the creeps. You see how Will Smith holds up being all alone, and when he enters the darkness for the first time it really frightens you (atleast me). When he was hanging upside down, I was like ""get up and away from there already!"". It was kinda.. thrilling. The dog dying was unnecessary, but expected.<br/><br/>After the dog-fight scene the movie takes a dive and becomes just another CGI-action film, or whatever you want to call it. The thing that annoyed me the most though is when Will met Anna. Seriously, is that how'd you react after meeting a person for the first time after 3 years? I believe a person would react somewhere along these three extremes: Get a major breakdown, being overjoyed with happiness or think you were hallucinating. Also, the stuff about ""God told me"" was really annoying and the ending was bad overall. If I could re watch the movie, I'd stop watching it when Will was holding the infected dog on his lapse, singing. That would be the best ending you could get in this movie.<br/><br/>Also, I'd like to mention that I Am Legend should have contained more back story. It would make the movie more interesting. While not being an expert, I also found the animation not very convincing.<br/><br/>Overall it was an entertaining movie with a lot of potential, but it could have been, and should have been so much better."

There are a few annoying things here and there - inconsistencies, 'why did he do that?' moments etc - but overall its a good movie. The Neville (Will Smith) character is relatively understated which makes a good change. Smith himself is credible and easy to relate to. Some of the CGI is not up to modern standards but then I think there was more work to do on it than you would initially think. If you have an imagination it won't bother you! I wasn't happy with the ending though. I actually think it would have benefited from a cheesy love story more than the cheesy hero ending."

"MuchTooDutch","9","0","0","19 August 2008"," The Legend of Us
","By Bryce VanKooten<br/><br/>The night ended much like it began with many of us, fearful of our sleep that night, but overwhelmingly intrigued beyond reasoning, negotiating our way through the maze of tangibility brought upon us by this mysteriously unassuming story.<br/><br/>All too often, I bring to the theater the intent to be scared twice, surprised once and relish the big screen for little more than an hour. Never once is my heart touched. Not for a second do I forget that, at any minute, a grisly ghost could pop out and kill my popcorn. I am a simple man, living in a simple world. I am a lifeless, heartless zombie, watching unfortunatelythe same.<br/><br/>Enter, I am Legend. One of the most enjoyable films I have seen in past couple of years. Incredibly well paced and fittingly subtle, I am Legend showed compelling storytelling in its ability to pleasantly mold the characters around their objective reality, while never allowing you to escape the reality that alas, you were still perspiring from suspense. Determined to keep it simple, the saga of Robert Neville had me pleading for resolve in an inexplicably hardened world.<br/><br/>Neville presents a key aspect to the story in his appeal to reality. Focused on a cure and presently preoccupied with disaster, his thoughts on God make up little of the physical movie, but lay much of the groundwork in the emotional balance beam presented by Francis Lawrence. Convinced that God does not exist and that man brought itself into total destruction, Neville presses on in his attempt to free the remaining, infected humans of the disease.<br/><br/>Lawrence draws key elements from Neville's story in his underlying silence. Burdened with the fate of the world, Neville does not see humanity (or rather, infected humanity) as the enemy, but rather as a problem in need of his help. Despite fierce attack, heart wrenching betrayal and incredible anguish, Neville is focused on one thing: redemption.<br/><br/>Of all the cinematic elements, none is more gracefully poignant than the relationship woven between Will Smith and his dog Samantha (Abbey). The last survivor on Earth, Robert Neville is left completely alone, save one, his dog Sam, albeit the film relies heavily on silence making much of the dialog unspoken. In the twitching ears of Sam, hours of afternoon car rides can be rekindled and through the battered fur of his best friend, Neville's primary hope can be clearly seen. Their bond is factually explainablebut in many waysexhaustively complex, proving that despite their exclusivity, friendship remains that which is most scarce. Buildings still stand. Technology still brimming. Fear, still very present. But despite these realities, the most coveted of all emotions, love, remains atop the list breathtaking dialog, heart wrenching silence and the simple journey of a man and his dog.<br/><br/>This filmed touched me in ways only a soft, whispery song could reach. Its silence invited me to a place where the world was no longer about you. It used the most simple of tactics to garnish the most striking of emotions and created dialog not between the characters on screen, but between those walking on screen and those watching on a few feet away.<br/><br/>I wish not to go further into the details of this movie for fear of labeling something it very well may not be for every viewer. When I watched it, I saw a lonely man, angry at much and altogether searching for hope. Exhausted by effort, depraved of his sanity, he finds hope in his failures, showing us that it is only in our transparent weakness that anything can be done together.<br/><br/>I throw up my hands, over the impossibilities. For straight and tired, where do I go from here? Now I'm searching for the confidence, I've lost so willingly. Overcoming these obstacles, is overcoming my fears. -Relient k<br/><br/>Although this movie found true resonance in both my heart and mind after the first watch, it was significantly improved when Warner Bros. recently released the Original Ending. I'll put it bluntly: I like it much, much more. I could go into detail about the depth of this ending, but instead, I'll leave you to the clip. So much dialog in the silence, making it authentically amazing. This is the step that the film should have taken long ago."

","Well, I am not a great Fan of Movies which has a story line covering Zombies, any way 'I am Legend' has taken a different approach. This movie is based on novel by Richard Matheson of the same name.<br/><br/>Synopsis : The Movie starts with a flashback where it is revealed that in 2009 a genetically Re-engineered Measles Virus was created to cure Cancer; later on this Virus undergoes mutation and generates a new lethal airborne based disease which spreads worldwide killing ninety percent of those infected, while the remaining few percent who possessed natural immunity to this virus survived rest turned to a aggressive primal beings who were not able to tolerate Sun Light thus forcing them to hide in the dark till dusk. Slowly most of this immune people where hunted by the infected thus making the central character (Will Smith) as the lone survivor of the holocaust.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays as Dr. Robert Neville a US Army Scientist who posses the natural immunity against this airborne disease. He seems to have decided to stay back in Manhattan and try to find a possible cure. His daily day to day routine includes moving across the lonely Manhattan in the day time for hunting and gathering foods while in the night he works in his Lab trying to find a cure. He also waits every day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, where he instructs any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. The only sanity in him is seemed to be kept alive by his only companion 'Samantha' a canine.<br/><br/>Very soon his survival becomes difficult, as his once fortified home at Washington Square becomes an imminent attack spot by a group of the Infected. Within the course of time Smith teams up with a woman named Anna and a small boy named Ethan who save him from a night road assault. The movie ultimately winds up with the cure resulting from his blood and Neville's(Smith)sacrifice to protect it.<br/><br/>Well I think the whole movie pulled up well with the extraordinary performance by Will Smith. The movies first forty minutes has been really a riveting experience, it just gave us a haunting look of the lonely Manhattan.<br/><br/>Though CGI created infected looked a little bit annoying, the overall experience was good. This movie is very much similar to Castaway where Tom Hanks portrays a person marooned in an island. 'I am Legend' may have received mixed reviews from across the world; after all it can be justified as portrayal of person's psychology against all odds and his belief. So in one way the movie has been able to deliver what it had to offer in the first place. If you are looking for lots of action then this movie may not be the right choice; if you are looking for drama with a dark theme then this just proves to do so.<br/><br/>If there is no solid ground which rationalizes for watching this film, then Will Smith's performance is ample enough to give this movie a chance.<br/><br/>I will rate it 7/10 <br/><br/>Could have been better..........."

Along the way, he encounters Alice Graga, who happens to be very nice looking.<br/><br/>I did enjoy some things about the movie. Hunting with an M4 assault rifle while driving a Mustang certainly was unexpected. That just isn't a common occurrence.

What? <br/><br/>The lead character acted as serious as would one of the American Chopper goofballs playing a computer game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie the point is made that the lead character is in amazing physical shape -- layers of muscles and plenty of energy. Then later he is hanging upside down caught in a rope, and he struggles to cut himself free in a stupid, reckless and sissy-like manner. A fat couch potato would do no worse. So, why make the point about him being super athletic in the first place? <br/><br/>The lead character does not act as though he is living in a dangerous world. Most of his activity is reckless. If he does not bother much with his own safety, why should the audience care? <br/><br/>New York City is filled with high security apartments and condos, so why does the lead character live in a place that does not even have bars on the lower windows? <br/><br/>If millions of NYC people have died, why is there not one rotting body or bones on the streets? Why are some of the NYC streets completely jammed full with abandoned cars, while many others have no cars and are very easy for the lead character to drive on?

","This was a fair movie. This is the third attempt I am aware of to film Richard Matheson's book I Am Legend...and for the third time, they still missed the essence of the book. (The other versions were The Omega Man, with Charlton Heston; and The Last Man on Earth, with Vincent Price) And, actually, this version misses the best parts of the book even more than the Charlton Heston version does. And this was REALLY disappointing, because I think Will Smith really pulled the Neville part off well...if only the script had even remotely compared to the original.<br/><br/>They really missed something by having the plague victims be nameless, faceless monsters. In the book and the other movie versions, the plague victims KNEW and REMEMBERED Neville from before the plague. This was MUCH more chilling than what we were delivered here. Neville's sacrifice was also much more symbolic and poignant in the book and other movies.<br/><br/>I would say the special effects were good...except the CGI was so obvious that they really did not allow for a good 'suspension of disbelief'.<br/><br/>If you were at all interested in this movie, do yourself a favor and READ THE BOOK!"
"emfizur","4","0","0","21 July 2008"," Coulda, Shoulda, Woulda been a Legend
","When I first thought of how to review this movie, and did, it had been awhile since I had read the book. I realize now that what impressed me about the movie was Will Smith's performance and the flow of the movie until the death of the dog. Focusing only on that, I loved the movie. Stop there and the review would be an 8/10. Unfortunately, the movie continued and became the typical mush that seems to dominate the theaters and get a huge box office draw. The question remains, why does Hollywood, and the American movie goer, fear a ""sad"" ending? Why must the good guy always win? Here, I found myself rooting for the CGI zombies here, and not Robert Neville.<br/><br/>Recently I read the book a second time and in returning to the text I realized that the movie did not just swing and miss in terms of hitting the point of the novel: It never made it to the ballpark. I must attempt to concede two things before I rant and rave about what I did not like about the movie. First, it is understandable as to why the location was changed from Los Angles suburb at time of writing of the novel to modern New York. A change of venue to a city could have added a new dimension of terror to the movie, or show the stark reality of Neville's existence on a grand scale. Yet here the rationale to simply show the city empty for shock value alone, and this means that one misses a great deal of Neville's struggles at night, surrounded and attempting to cope with the situation. Second, the dog. I can understand why having the dog from the start helps the movie, I really can. I mean, Neville does need someone to talk to in a movie since we can not read his thoughts, but in the book the dog's death represented Neville letting go of the past. The dog's death helps him overcome his fears of death, whereas the movie decided to cut and paste and exasperate Neville's struggles. Third, the change from vampires to ""super zombies."" This I can understand as well, but when asked about this change I believe the director's comment was something like, ""Well, we didn't want to deal with the issues that vampires would raise, so we changed them."" That is not an exact quote, but it is close enough for a response. First, I wonder if anyone here read the book, since those legends of the vampire that Matheson's Neville faced, and proved incorrect, were central to the book. Avoiding those issues cuts out a great deal of Neville's character and his struggle in the post apocalyptic world. The vampire was a legendary and familiar evil, and debate about the topic would have, at least in my mind added more to the movie not less.<br/><br/>Now that I have conceded these three items, on some level, I can say that the movie lost me in the last half hour. Matheson's classic was 176 pages that became increasingly nihilistic as the novel progressed. With Neville, after the death of the dog that he found, not owned, readily accepting this nihilism, and realizing that he has found his place in the new world. I know that nihilism can be a rough pill to swallow, but the ending of the movie kind of came out of nowhere so that it could be happy. I am most likely not the first, and nor will I be the last to say that if you change the movie this much: Change the TITLE! This was not an adaptation of Matheson's classic, but rather loosely inspired by the book.<br/><br/>Matheson's Neville was a legend because the vampires feared him as humans used to fear the vampire. He was the creature who went bump in the day. When ghost stories were told Matheson's Neville was the antagonist in the new world. The obvious point is that Matheson's Neville would be the subject of tales and stories for centuries in the new world taking the place the vampire held in the human world.<br/><br/>The Neville of the movie did not inspire a legend such as this, he was simply heroic and would be remembered for his act, but the zombies did not tell horror stories about him. In the end humans were more afraid of the zombies than zombies of the human, which is why the movie whiffs when it comes time to hit the point. In changing Neville's profession from factory worker to virologist it removes the terror of fighting the unknown, a huge part of the emotional toil of the book. Even when Neville figures out how to fight the disease in the book, it is a struggle for him. Note to Hollywood: Changing the lead character from a smarter than average factory worker to an expert in the field actually reduces the terror people want in a survival horror film. My first remark upon finding out Neville's profession was, ""Oh isn't that convenient."" It is cliché to state that the book is better than the movie, since comparisons will always ruin the movie, with a few exceptions. Here though the book is a classic and the movie changes so much that you can not ignore the changes. In fact, they ruin the movie for anyone who has read the book due to the startling nature. In the end I found myself wanting: The nihilism of Matheson's classic; at least someone outside of Neville's compound yelling, ""Come out, Neville"" as Cortman did in the book; and I wanted Neville to become the legend that Matheson intended. Will Smith's performance saved this movie for me, but outside of that my review is: I AM Disappointed."

","I was somewhat disappointed with this movie. The first aspect was that so much was happening but not much of it was explained in any depth, as a previous user has already commented. The reasons of why a virus spread around the world which killed all but a few of the world's population was only brushed. Why did the virus spread; why did so many people die; how come a wee community of people were spared at the end of the movie? The movie was in some way a bit like War of the Worlds. The movie was so unusual and unrealistic that it didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Another aspect why I was disappointed was that the movie was very short. I expected it to be a bit longer with the budget of a typical Hollywood blockbuster. It could have been a bit longer if the issues were explained a bit more.<br/><br/>Also, the CGI wasn't very good.

","After viewing I Am Legend I have to say I am presently surprised. Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist who is evidently the last human on Earth. As we learn in the opening scenes, humans have discovered a cure for cancer; but flash forward several years and it turns out that the supposed ""cure"" has either killed those to whom it was given or turned them into light-fearing, monsters called Dark Seekers. Spending his days searching for a cure and hunting in the abandoned streets of New York City, Robert is slowly becoming consumed by his isolation. But after he captures one of the Dark Seekers, he realizes that he has become part of a dangerous cat and mouse game with the monsters' implied leader (Dash Mihok). As the Dark Seekers close in on him, Robert races to find a cure in order to save humankind before his demise.<br/><br/>I think that the cinematographer Andrew Lesnie does a great job at portraying New York City as a deserted no mans land, keep in mind that this is the same cinematographer from the blockbuster King Kong. When you couple this with director Francis Lawrence's music video background you will find a lot of fast camera movements and a variety of camera angles. This is demonstrated when The infected dogs are on top of Neville's character during this fight scene, and the camera positions itself at a high angle in order to intensify suspense and convey Neville's vulnerability. In this scene the director uses this technique to get viewers on the edge of their seats while further illustrating the idea that life is precious and frail, as the dogs threaten to infect the last surviving human.<br/><br/>After reflecting on the movie's environment and characters I have noticed that I Am Legend bears a close resemblance to such movies as Lassie because of the compassion that the audience feels for Neville's dog Sam, as well as Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow that closely resemble this movie when looking at the environment of these desolate and deserted cities in which the movies takes place.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I feel that director Francis Lawrence has done a great job at demonstrating the preciousness of life and how much we as humans crave a sense of companionship even if that means we have to resort to conversing with manikins."

It's exciting because it simply works as an action pic with many jump-in-your seat moments. The flashback scenes are white-knuckle stuff. I also liked that the film subtly promotes Neville as a man of reason. But, three years deep into the apocalypse he is losing his sanity and sense what's real. This character study is interrupted by the third act however which has received unfair criticism because I loved how awesome and intense the end was. The true stars of this film are Smith and that unbelievable scenery. Manhattan has become vacant (save for wildlife) and vegetation has sprouted every which way. The posters claiming that there was still a fledging hope were an excellent touch. To Neville they have become commonplace, to us we will never see anything like them.

","SERIOUSLY MAJOR SPOILERS CONCERNING PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING!!! I didn't catch this movie when it was first on in cinemas, even though most of my friends recommended it to me. I guess I just thought it would just be a lot of Will Smith fighting things. It wasn't.<br/><br/>Although it had a lot of fighting, it also had a lot of heart, and I felt sad during Sam's death scene (especially as my dog was lying at my feet at the time), and at the death scene at the end.

Why didn't Neville throw the grenade out of the glass box at the end (it probably wouldn't have saved him but surely it'd be a better chance of survival)? How did Neville work out that the cured zombie's blood was the cure? Why does Neville think everyone's dead even though there are news broadcasts? Why didn't the woman wait till the sun had fully risen before driving Neville back? Why did Neville walk so easily into the trap the zombies had set up, even though he knew that there was something awry? What triggered the trap? Why didn't Sam try harder to wake him up while he was in the truck (e.g. barking loudly)? Now I'm sure some of you know the answers to these questions, but the point is that I din't while I was watching it and it just seemed very contrived.<br/><br/>However, thats not to say I didn't like it.

","I really liked the atmosphere of this film and the lack of bureaucratic battles often portrayed in ""end of the world"" pictures. It had a straightforward way of presenting what happened. You feel genuine fear at times but it's not really a horror film.<br/><br/>There were a few factual errors and things I'd change. One worth noting is Smith's mention of ""6 billion people"" as of 2009, which he uses to calculate casualty rates. The real number at that time will be about 6.8 billion; no small difference. It was already at 6 billion in 1999, 10 years earlier. I mention this because overpopulation itself is making viral calamities more likely.<br/><br/>Also, the casual handling of a certain object is, well, too casual, considering its purpose.

","'I Am Legend'. What is there to say? Unfortunately, not a whole lot. One of last year's biggest blockbuster's is also one of the year's most empty attempts to make us feel, well, anything. It's not a bad movie, it's not a good movie. It doesn't do much to tilt the scales in either direction, and as a result, 'I Am Legend' simply... is.<br/><br/>I went into Will Smith's latest vehicle not expecting very much. It did deliver on this point. And that says it all. It was entertaining to a certain extent, granted, but 'I Am Legend' is like a roller-coaster. It's up one minute, down the next, up again, then down. It never comes into its own, and when a 100 minute film is at times a chore to sit through, you've hit a brick wall. Will Smith does delver a fine performance, but I don't believe it's the show-stopping performance many have touted it as.<br/><br/>Granted, Smith keeps 'I Am Legend' from sinking in its own muddled sea of emptiness, but it's just not enough. It doesn't take long to discover that 'I Am Legend' just doesn't have the script or direction to deliver a good movie. And what could have been the film's saving grace, special effects and action, quickly become one of its weakest efforts. The CGI is unrealistic enough to take us out of the film almost entirely, while the sparse and repetitive action breaks no new ground.<br/><br/>'I Am Legend' could have been an exciting and action-packed blockbuster. Deep down inside, this film had potential. But perhaps worst of all, it tries to front itself as a deep psychological character study and be a popcorn blockbuster at the same time. It just doesn't work, and it comes off feeling forced and cheap. 'I Am Legend' wants to say something, it wants to pack a punch. But I was never able to muster up enough enthusiasm to really care. A disappointment, but low expectations helps ease the pain.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

"WeponX","7","0","0","2 July 2008"," Should have been better/Nothing like the book
","One thing can be established off the bat. This movie is not at all like the book. It is essentially a different story from the book. So if you're a fan of the book and you plan to watch this movie, simply be advised it is not the same at all.<br/><br/>As a fan of the book, after watching this movie I felt a little cheated. My first impression was that it seemed like not a single one of the writers could have read the book. They honestly think it was appropriate to name this movie after it despite the fact that the only similarities with the book and the movie are the title, and the name Robert Neville. Now I'm not saying that a movie has to be just like the book it is based on, but it should try to stay true to the theme and plot as much as possible. Hollywood seems to have this habit of taking perfectly good stories and ruining them by compensating for story line with explosions and special effects.<br/><br/>From a critical point of view, the film was up and down. For about the first 30 minutes it is quite well done. You can also see that they really tried to capture the psychological strain that such a situation could subdue a person to. Will Smith gives a sincere performance, and quite frankly he was pretty much all that salvaged this movie. Most of the people who are knocking on this movie aren't giving him enough credit. Even if you don't like Will Smith at all, he was really the only consistently decent piece of this film....him and the dog. The special effects seemed a little cheap. On top of that, the Dark Seekers who were being portrayed through the special effects, seemed to develop abilities that somewhat defied the laws of physics. Not to mention that they just didn't look that good or believable. All I can say is that I'm sure I could name at least five movies off the top of my head that are much older than this one that have CGI literally ten times better.<br/><br/>(spoiler) One thing that really kinda gets me is that this movie was pushed and advertised with this ""The last man on earth, is not alone."" I'm sorry but what kind of garbage is that if 3/4 of the way through the movie a woman and her son come trotting along. Not to mention what happens at the end. I mean come on if you can't even stay true to your advertising scheme what credibility do you really have after that. Also I have a slight problem with the ending. It seems like the only reason Neville blows himself up along with the Dark Seekers is for dramatic effect. To solidify a justifiable reason for him being a legend.<br/><br/>I Am Legend, could have been a much better movie. They could have even kept the same basic plot if they had just added more story. More background story, more explanation, more...ANYTHING! Bottom line this movie just seemed like it had no effort as far as writing and story line go.<br/><br/>I must say though that I Am Legend is worth watching. It is an interesting story with a few visual treats. However, fans of the book should be prepared for something that likely will not live up to their expectations. As someone who was hoping for more than they got, I can say that unfortunately, I Am Legend, leaves no real legacy."

","Given the post 9/11 currency of stories about a besieged America (Americans) - Cloverfield, The Happening, Diary of the Dead, War of the Worlds etc. etc. - producing a new version of ""I Am Legend"" (which had already been filmed as ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man"") seemed to present a real chance to do something interesting and relevant. Sadly this interpretation of the excellent source novel really fails to get to grips with the potential relevance of the film's central premise. The film starts well enough with Will Smith's Robert Neville struggling to survive and retain his sanity in an abandoned New York over-run by escaped zoo animals. The first half hour works really well in building the atmosphere of terrifying isolation in a setting normally so associated with the hustle and bustle of 21st Century urban life. Things start to go horribly wrong, though, as the film begins to expose Neville's back story - his failure to save his own wife and daughter from the carnage leading to the apparent extinction of humanity and his struggle to deal with the emotional baggage this heaps on him. There is a trite and mawkish quality to the way in which the character's ""personal issues"" are set up which is made worse when we are introduced to the zombie style infected who lurk in the dark recesses of the city until night descends. The choice to use CGI for these monsters is a huge mistake - especially given the fantastic quality of special effect make-up these days - and smacks of a laziness so common in Hollywood's more High Concept production these days. Instead of believable and frightening villains we end up with cartoonish creatures reminiscent of the way in which Ang Lee's completely ludicrous Hulk was rendered. What's more the introduction of the mother and child who turn up on Neville's doorstep feels like a simple convenience of plotting which allows him to make the ultimate sacrifice at the end to save them - so exorcising his own culpability for the loss of his wife and child and setting up a tacked on up-beat ending which feels completely out of place against the general atmosphere that the film seems to be trying to establish for the rest of the narrative.<br/><br/>Apart from the opening deer-hunting sequence (where in fairness GCI is actually used to great effect) this film really has only one other thing to recommend it which is the great performance from Neville's German Shepherd. Lassie eat your heart out."

","Don't get me wrong, it was a good film and held up very well. It was emotional, action filled and the storyline was worth awards for sure, but it was built up so much, that it made it seem like something that it could not be and in my opinion, it is the fault of the marketing. You should market all of the big movies but if you overdo it, you may not only get disappointed fans, but also the chance of less DVD sales.<br/><br/>Now, off the subject of marketing and onto the movie side of the movie, it is extremely good. Too often now do we see movies completely ruined by special effects and big name actors, and lose everything that the (Very thin) storyline, but in this film, we see the good concept executed well and melted in perfectly with the special effects which were very good. Also, the direction in this movie is in the top 10 directing performances in 2007 by anybody, every scene is so thought out and magnetizing that if you turn away for a second, it takes 10 minutes to catch up.<br/><br/>When I first watched the film, I did expect more, as I have previously stated from market hype, but I did enjoy it more the second time. I do strongly recommend this to everyone who enjoys a good movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked this movie, but it could have been better, it does get boring in bits, but it is an overall exciting flick.

","Now in the year 2012, three years after the horrifying plague that was unintentional release by a Scientist (Uncredited Cameo by Oscar-Winner:Emma Thompson), who was trying to find a cure for cancer. Now in the empty streets of New York City, U.S. Army virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith) is living all alone in the city with his dog Samantha. Who is still trying to find a cure for the virus, there's 9 percent of the whole world that infected humans turned into violent, strong blood-thirsty creatures. Which they are also sensitive to the daylight that could kill them. Since 90 percent of the world, the population is finish. But these creatures also have an mind of their own, since they want to kill Neville as well.<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Lawrence (Constantine) made an entertaining science-fiction drama with moments of suspense and horror. This version takes the premise (Based on a novel by Richard Matheson) more seriously comparing to the previous adaptations like ""The Last Man on Earth"" or ""The Omega Man"". Smith is truly good in his role, which makes this movie worth watching. Even the dog is great. Director Lawrence makes effective use of making New York City isolated by adding clever used of CGI effects. It's also much better than the director's first feature. Perphas the worst CGI effects in the film are the looks of the creatures are not very effective (They look phony at times sadly). But it's a good thing, it is not a total turn-off in my opinion.<br/><br/>The single disc edition, DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD only special features are the four short animated features. The feature clever use of Widescreen will be lost on DVD, especially the wide NYC shots. Lawrence's second feature is a terrific 2/3 of a movie but sadly when two human characters shows up to help Neville. It becomes an different picture in someway. This movie might be too religious for some taste as well. There's also two-disc set of ""I Am Legend"". Which the second disc includes an extended version with a few additional scenes but the biggest change is the different ending. Which it fleshing out the characters of the creatures but also changes the faith of the lead character. I prefer the original theatrical version instead.<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" is not the great film i was hoping to be but overall it is still pretty good as entertainment. Smith's role certainly helps the movie a lot. It certainly looked terrific at the big screen. Screenplay by Mark Protosevich (The Cell, Poseidon) and Oscar-Winner:Akiva Goldsman (Batman Forever, A Beautiful Mind, I Robot). Goldsman is also one of the producers as well. Super 35.

","It's been a long time since I've seen ""Omega Man"" or read the original Matheson story, but I'd heartily recommend them as superior entertainment, while this... Well, if you've got nothing better to do, it's not TERRIBLE, but...<br/><br/>I have to agree with everybody who says this was all about the CGI, and not about the plot - or, in my opinion, the suspense. There's not enough characterization of the zombies, and too much of Robert Neville - I like Will Smith, but I didn't care for his rather hysterical interpretation, although the interplay with Sam was good. There was too much backstory on the virus (and Neville's family) and too little on the zombies. And things don't seem to have been too challenging for Anna and Ethan - nothing worth talking about, anyway! Ethan isn't really necessary in any way - Sam is the Richie character (I think it was Richie - anyway, it IS kind of a clever riff on the doofus who wanders off in search of the cat...)<br/><br/>I can't believe anybody respects the pacing. There are two moments of genuine suspense in the movie - Following the Deer, and the Copycat Trap - and both of them totally failed to have any shock value. Following the Deer turns out OK, while The Copycat Trap builds up and builds up, but then, well, up hops Bob and gets his gun, oh dear he drops it - oh, Sam isn't in as much trouble as we thought - oh, he was, was he - and we wind up waiting around for the dog to change, and then - well, that was that. Poignant, maybe (he has the recovered-rat antitoxin - why not Sam?) but suspenseful - are you kidding? And As for the film's finale, did we really need to see it? I think it was irrelevant (especially with the voice-over), and the prologue is also unnecessary - we could have spent the time getting a few real chills and thrills in.<br/><br/>Ruined New York is well done, but it's not like we haven't seen THAT before (couldn't this have been filmed in Detroit, without CGI?) The movie has a kind of moral, which has to do with Neville being wrong about what turns out to be true at the very end. There's a worthy idea there - nothing to do with Matheson's original idea, or the title of the film, of course - but there isn't enough supporting material in the rest of the story for it to be said to be the film's theme - and there's nothing else to the story, really - so why is Neville a legend? Apparently, it's the same reason he was on the cover of TIME magazine..."

","What a mishmash of nonsense. Any of these people raving (like then zombies?) about this absolute piece of garbage ever seen a sci-fi flick before? Omega Man? Last man on earth? Anything? Vincent Price was amusing as the Last Man on Earth and the movie had a wonderful macabre sense to it. Heston was Heston (in Omega Man)... good fighting evil, as only Heston could do, vampires trying to wrench that gun out of his hand (and crosses too). They were survivors, each in his own way.<br/><br/>Poor Will Smith's character, Neville, is just plain stupid, and he's supposed to be a brilliant scientist. Have you ever known a brilliant scientist? I have. They aren't dumb. They wouldn't go racing up and down deserted streets at 80 miles an hour in a sports car because they would be afraid something bad might happen... and then who would help? If he wanted to shoot some game for dinner, surely a stroll in Central Park would yield something.<br/><br/>The first major flaw was the death of Sam, his only companion. I knew it would happen. Poor writers always create a bond between man and animal and then kill off the animal to create pathos. But their act of scribbling only created bathos and my desire to turn of the set. You see, they knew they could get away with killing off a ""mere"" German shepherd. If they had given him a child to care for and to nurture, and then slaughtered it off, the audience might have revolted. But a dog? Oh well... for most. Not me. It created instant enmity. I struggled on to see how much worse it would get. I wasn't disappointed:<br/><br/>Anime monsters to create the illusion that Neville is in the battle of his life with video games. Ugh.<br/><br/>But then, comic relief... unintentional. A heroine arrives (you knew she would. That's why they killed off the poor dog.) She's heard his pleading broadcasts and has made a detour on her way to Vermont to see the Big Apple... the scribblers fail to tell us how she accomplished that feat in a mere car since all the bridges have been blown, but hey, if you've made it this far into this piece of utter nonsense, why start thinking now?<br/><br/>She saves Neville's life, somehow. That's also unclear and inspires him to ""continue his work""... you know saving mankind with a cure for anime monsterism...that's the mankind of which he thinks he a party of one.<br/><br/>Then there's the attack on the house, where infected humans (read animes) are shown to have developed super human powers (maybe they don't want to be cured... all they have to do is stay out of the sun and they are all Supermen.) Will of course, sacrifices himself in a blaze of glory... too bad they couldn't bring back the dog.<br/><br/>And Anna of two days goes on her merry way to Vermont, magic potion to cure the world... all ten people... with her. She traverses the waters surrounding Manhattan in her Hop mobile once again, I guess.<br/><br/>I'm a very demanding person, I know. I require a plot that makes sense. With writers like Protosevich and Goldsman you're SOL. No one could write this badly and have any talent. But I suppose we will be subjected to their tripe again since the movie was a hit... well, others may be... not I. I really can't stand anything this stupidly contrived. The only reviewers who liked the movie were New Yorkers and those who love NYC who marveled at the opening shots of weeds in the streets of NYC. It takes a lot more than that to get my admiration!"

","'I Am Legend' is a combination of two genres - one of the apocalyptic post-atomic/post-lethal virus stories with the sub-genre last_man_on_earth and the zombies movie. Here Will Smith is apparently the last survivor in a Manhattan that had been again Ground Zero for a different type of catastrophe. He is the only healthy survivor I should say as the rest are men and dogs made to look like flesh-hungry hordes of zombies by the epidemics that destroyed civilization permanently menace him and his faithful dog. It is actually the first part of the film that I liked most, the Manhattan_after_civilization looks well and scary, and Will Smith is doing a fine job, we always knew that he can carry a full film by himself. Conveniently he is also the biologist who can cure what remains of mankind, and when it proves as expected that he is not that alone in sanity on Earth the film slides to a more conventional and moralistic path. Not enough to spoil it completely but bad enough to lower my grade for this film from 'very good' to 'average plus'."

","Note: This is a review of the original theatrical version, not the one with the alternate ending, available on the special edition DVD.<br/><br/>The title is from a novel, not a quote from Will Smith when asked to describe himself in three words or less. Also, I don't know what disturbed me more, seeing a desolate, uninhabited New York City or the fact that Robert Neville (Will Smith) chose to alleviate boredom by watching endless repeats of Shrek. And despite the obligatory ""I'm pushing 40 but I'm still ripped"" half-naked workout scene, it's an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how simple this movie was, and also at how drastically it changed as soon as the other two survivors came along to rescue the ""I've given up all hope"" Neville. What was a riveting, intense character piece touching on issues of loneliness, humanity, isolation and grief, becomes a no-holds-barred fight to the death against infected mutants, then wham! the end clicks back into ""thoughtful"" modeI was more than a little jarred. But despite this, I still found the movie very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I was also surprised at how similar to I, Robot it is, and not just coz of the workout scene. There is a blatant (borderline advertisement) product placement moment at the start. Neville is seen cruising around in a swanky, tricked out Ford Mustang, which strangely disappears for the rest of the film. Converse All-Stars, anyone? If he had of skidded to a halt and said, ""a thing of beauty"", I would have been lunging for the STOP button. Aha, one of the writers wrote I, Robot, and a 150 million dollar budgetI guess they needed a boost. Anyway, it's forgivable because it's, wellforgettable.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is more a (although I shudder to use the term) ""re-imagining"" of 1971's ""The Omega Man"" than it is an adaptation of Richard Matheson's novella, however viewed as a standalone piece it still works, so forget all the naysayers on here who stupidly feel the need to pick apart every single movie they see. If you think this is your kind of flick, it probably is. If, like me, you really dig ""end of the world"" type movies, you'll get more than a few kicks out of this one. Not least of which is the empty, barren, lifeless New York City. It looks, in a single word, awesome.<br/><br/>Far from being crap, the screenplay and/or film appears to have been ""sliced and diced"" to achieve a round 100 minute running time, as certain issues are raised and not followed through, other things appear to just skim the surface rather than diving in, and the ending is a little deus ex machina, but I still liked it.<br/><br/>Okay, summing up, I like apocalyptic end of world movies, so thought I'd dig this one. I hired it, was pleasantly surprised, slept on it, then decided the next day to buy the speccy edition DVD because a) I'll watch it again, more than once, and b) I wanted to see the alternate ending. So, if you're anything like me (check out my other reviews to get a random idea of flicks I love/hate) you'll probably dig it too. Have fun!"

Sure, he says the words and seems to be familiar with the terminology, but you keep wondering how such an action packed athlete and music lover, somewhere in his lower thirties - oh and high ranked military officer - ever got the time to get a PhD, let alone specialize in the field of virology.<br/><br/>This is also where the movie fails big time. If you can't get the right actor for this (and there's very few that could deliver this), then you transform it to an action-packed high paced movie, where there's no time to wonder about the science behind it and the audience is more forgiven about plot holes. With Will Smith, this probably would've worked better if he was the 'protector' and some other person did the research.<br/><br/>As for the story, for those that have seen 28 days later and loved it for it's anthropological insights, should avoid I am Legend. You will notice that it is in it's core an ""americanized version"" of 28 days later. Take 28 days later, cut to New York, add family values, add a hero, don't make the military look bad, a touch of religion and lots of guns and explosions.<br/><br/>All in all, if you enter this with an action mindset and fast forward through the dramatic scenes, you'll have a nice hour of action left.<br/><br/>4 out of 10, where the 3 points are for the only positive point: the special effects."

","OK, first of all this is one of the best films I have ever seen, considering that the movie is focusing on one man and his dog, the dog plays a major part in this film because its all the family that Neville has left and he truly cares bout his dog, He would do anything of his dog, thats how much he loves her. Will portrayed Neville as a person amazingly(the lead character, Will Smith). The film makers done so much extensive research in the movie that it actually made the movie come a live because it was more realistic in the sense that the psychology of Neville is a genuine factor of what would actually happen to someone and the fact that he has a routine, which is stopping him from going completely crazy, you will go crazy after spending 3 years without any other human contact!.. He has the city wired to his standards and he never has to take anything from any shops because no one is there to steal anything from him because hes the ""last man alive"". The movie makes you think because things start happening during the movie so things don't go Nevilles way and he starts to loose his mind even more and when something dreadful happens he cannot focus any more and ends up going on a crazy streak!.. I can't explain this film, its just makes you think so much. Apparently the CGI isn't great from what viewers have said on here but I don't think there bad considering the fact that they had to also make the whole of new york look dead and show that nature has taken over which is an extremely hard thing to do and it took them months and millions of dollars to film parts of the film. Considering the nature of the film, showing one man alone in the world and trying to survive its not a bad film at all its one of the best I have seen because it makes me feel sorry for Neville. The DVD Special Edition Alternate Ending is better though, you'll have to watch to see what I mean, Neville finds out something about the dark seekers that he never thought was possible! There's nothing much more I can say, Will was amazing in this film and he actually got his Carbs lowered so he was actually knacked for some parts of the film, it was realistic and showed you the affects of surviving on your own and having a routine due to the fact that you just automatically do. Truly one of the best films I have ever seen!"

","So here we go again. To be honest I was not expecting too much from this movie having already herd friends opinions of the movie and that coupled with my liking of 'The Omega Man' did not leave me with high expectations and I was not surprised. The premise of the last man left alive in New York as he struggles to find a vaccine to the virus that has turned a portion of New York's population in to zombies who in turn have killed anyone else who could not escape. Nothing is done badly here just averagely the story, the acting and the special effects. Thankfully at least Will Smith manages to play a character that is not himself for once but I could not work out what age he was supposed to be and was confused by the mix of grey hair and gym body. The film slips by and even when we are finally introduces some other characters I did not empathise with any of them. Actually the dog was the character I liked best. So would I watch it again? Only if really desperate and there was absolutely nothing else on."

","Perhaps the movie's title alone should have convinced me that this movie is another product of banality. But, I have to admit, I was somewhat interested in knowing what science had done wrong this time...so I watched it.<br/><br/>Well, again the whole Faustian scenario that unfolds in this post-apocalyptic film is pure fantasy.<br/><br/>First a virus is genetically manipulated to eradicate cancer in patients, which it seems to do quite successfully. Then, additional, unexpected mutations 'naturally' occur, and soon there is a horde of supercharged, homicidal zombies after the flesh of the living.<br/><br/>I found few if any good qualities in this film.<br/><br/>The zombies, while nasty and secretive, might scare your grandmother or your younger sister at best.<br/><br/>Will's acting might please his hard-core fans, but the monologue and the script overall are too dull to give him anything interesting to work with.<br/><br/>The digitally enhanced streets of the post-apocalyptic New York make for a nice post card, but fail to earn the movie additional points.<br/><br/>Not so surprisingly, the plot is unsurprising and loaded with religious overtones of banal obscurantism like, ""God didn't do this - we did"".<br/><br/>Need I say more?"

","Society often enjoys giving their respect and praise to sports stars, musicians, actors and other people that don't really change the world. Sure they entertain us, some even start up charities, but even the Bono's of the world don't do much beyond making noise.<br/><br/>People that do make a real difference like politicians and scientists don't really get much of the ""hero"" limelight. The're not portrayed as heroes by pop culture even though a good one can save and improve millions (and billions) of lives.<br/><br/>I was really happy to see this movie putting a scientist in the hero position, not the nerd who makes the heroes car faster or ""hacks into the mainframe"" on his behalf.<br/><br/>Will Smith (in his best acting to date) played a scientist working to fix a screw-up caused by science in the first place (Think Einstein and the atomic bomb). We watch his tireless struggle and slow loss of sanity when science doesn't come through for him and, he is rescued from the brink by a woman of faith who has been sent on a mission by god.<br/><br/>Yeah he could of taken the horror approach and locked himself in a mall and either died off or tried to escape to a island. He could of taken the action approach and decided to kill all the zombies seeing as his family is already dead. Instead he decided to make it right by working really hard with what he knows. A real, realistic hero.<br/><br/>When I got home I was disappointed to read reviews and see people didn't like the movie because the CGI doesn't look good. Yeah it's not that good, and would of been better with the crew from a modern George Romero doing makeup on real people. But get over it! Any movie that is made now will look like crap when you see it in 30 years time. CGI doesn't make a legendary film. It always comes back to the quality of and plot, which this movie has plenty of.<br/><br/>CGI is worth knocking down 1 star in a movie to me, when you're giving it 3/10 because of CGI you need to ask yourself ""Do I enjoy movies or do I just enjoy explosions?"""
"Mercury-4","4","0","0","2 May 2008"," Flashy creature movie with no resemblance to the original
","The write-up by csullaf (http://www.imdb.com/user/ur0814462/comments) titled ""Extravagant wrapping around an empty box., 17 December 2007"" already said most of what needed to be said about this movie, in my opinion, but I wanted to add a little bit.<br/><br/>As he said, I find it mind-boggling how quickly Hollywood will make a movie based on a story or earlier movie and end up with something that bears little resemblance to the original. It's the height of stupidity. The REASON people want a new version is because of the original, if you take that away, you have nothing left, do you? Which is what this movie has, as far as I'm concerned. There's just nothing there. Video-game monsters, poorly-developed characters and poorly-developed plot.<br/><br/>What really gets me more than anything else though ... again, as csullaf said, the changes they made, absurdly, make the title meaningless.<br/><br/>In the original and in earlier filmed versions, the vampires are fairly intelligent. And the main character is a legend to them, THUS THE NAME, ""I am Legend"".<br/><br/>In fact in the earliest filmed version of this, the Vincent Price version, if I recall correctly the female character who he befriends turns out to be sort of a mutant strain of the vampires, more or less half-human and half-vampire. As a result, you really do see it from their point of view. They are the future of the human race, a new mutation (the vampires in general) and from that perspective, the main character IS in fact a monster in his own right.<br/><br/>That's what makes the story interesting. That's what makes it any different from a thousand cheesy monster movies or, for that matter, from a video game.<br/><br/>But by making the vampires super-powered video game monsters, that whole side of it is lost.<br/><br/>And there's nothing left but a video game.<br/><br/>I really have never been able to grasp how they do it, how they take an interesting story and, at some point, make the decision ""let's take everything that is interesting in this story and chuck it out"". I mean they couldn't just be doing it accidentally, could they? I would just like to see the meeting where they do that. Are they all doing massive amounts of cocaine so they are all in some cocaine psychosis and then they have the meeting? Maybe they can make that a mandatory special feature on the DVD for movies like this in the future. ""The meeting where we decided to take everything good and chuck it out"". I think that would be good cinema, I would like to see a roomful of coked-up Hollywood executives barking and howling like madmen and making completely deranged decisions. And they probably have some pretty cute secretaries.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be any better than the movie they end up making but it would at least be shorter."

","Pretty much below par movie. I didn't see this at the cinema, and I'm now very glad I never.<br/><br/>Will Smith is always a good watch, and in this case he is no different. An assured and solid performance considering he had very little to work with. The pace is slow to start, but unfortunately for the viewer never really picks up.<br/><br/>The most disappointing part for me was the poor development of anything. Characters, back story and explanations of whats going on is non-existent,there is no story arc. The special effects are terrible. The Darkstalkers are all generic and poorly rendered. Nothing about them is believable or intimidating. Eventhe animals that roam the deserted New York island look 100% fake.Poor, poor effects that are unforgivable considering the budget of this movie.<br/><br/>The only thing I did have any feelings for in this whole movie, was for the dog.<br/><br/>I just think that this film had so much potential, and also has one of the biggest names in the business as its lead star. So why it went so wrong I don't really know. The whole film is unlikable and forgettable.<br/><br/>4/10, not good at all, and only just worth a watch......"

","The opening scenes of I Am Legend show a deserted New York City, with abandoned cars and weeds growing from cracks in the street and broken storefront windows and these scenes look great. Indeed, the first half of the film is exciting. We meet the last surviving man on earth, Will Smith, and his dog. It seems a virus has wiped out everyone else except for some infected who prowl at night. Smith is a scientist who is immune to the virus and has dedicated his lonely life to finding a cure.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the last half of the film doesn't live up to its promising start. My biggest complaint is the infected zombies. They look bad, cinematically, obviously computer generated and they don't blend into the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I like Will Smith and he does a good job, as usual, in a difficult situation because he has only his dog to play against.<br/><br/>The film is PG-13 so the violence is toned down."

","I must admit that this is my first post and i am incredibly hard to please when it comes to floating my cinematic boat. A huge disappointment once again, this did have so much potential. The opening scene of abandonment and isolation are real enough and this continues for a good 2 thirds of the film. Sadly the film decended in to an 'undead' stereotypical monster movie. I doff my cap to Smith's acting it was really well delivered although i felt that the 2 extra characters were only introduced to allow the 'cure' to be passed on.....sorry but just too too cliché !!! There was also a distinct lack of characterisation for the pair, we just did not get to know them. All in all it passed a couple of hours time, very similar to 28 days/weeks later although packed with CGI not as good as the latter. Worth a watch for Smith's acting which is much better that you would expect."
"emplordxiii","7","0","0","27 December 2007"," From Great to Decent
","After hearing many of my friends and co-workers that ""I Am Legend"" was a great movie, I finally decided to go see it myself. Sadly, I found it a decent movie rental than a movie going experience.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with a T.V. interview where a person had discovered the cure for cancer by reversing the effects of a virus. Then quickly changes to three years later in New York City where it is now a ghost town (Stating that the cure backfired and killed most of the people, if not all, in the world.) Then it is revealed that only one person survived, Will Smith's character, and his German Shepard who struggled to survive, especially in the night where the infected people with enhanced strength and speed kill any living being in sight, while trying to find the cure for the virus.<br/><br/>It was great to see Will Smith alone with the dog for two-thirds of film where we see how he survives and stays sane by talking to his dog and mannequins, many have stated that he is clearly crazy doing that(Talking to the mannequins) but they're his imaginary friends, like you call kids crazy for having one. But then it became bad when a woman and her child appear as survivors who came to answer Smith's call of survivors through the radio. It just didn't have the excitement of seeing Smith trying to survive the apocalypse.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the last third of the film should of been about Smith trying to survive the entire night outside the safety of his house built in fortress after he was trap by the Alpha Male infected(The scene where Smith and the Dog are confronted by the Alpha Male's dogs since it was near night.).<br/><br/>Also, it became a cheap sci-fi the second the infected where known as the Darkseekers or something similar I can't quite remember."
"davidj722","5","0","0","27 December 2007"," Not Up to Snuff
","Like its predecessors ""Omega Man"" and ""Last Man on Earth"" this film had Richard Matheson's splendid story to use a blueprint. What the former films lack in special effects they more than make up in coherent and interesting storytelling. What was especially driving in the Heston version was the hero/anti-hero relationship built around Heston/Zerbe characters. Such a relationship is hinted at with the CGI characters and Neville, but falls flat. The choice not to allow communication between Smith's Neville and the ""infected"" does not allow the story to evolve into anything more than a adequate melodrama, and removes an a compelling layer of complexity. This film is another example of how Hollywood producers prefer to focus on special effects as a means to excuse an uninspired script, which is a shame since they had a wonderful existing story to build upon. Rent the Heston version instead or wait for the video game (there is going to be a video game, right?)."
"krebs67","6","0","0","27 December 2007"," Good could have been great (No Omega Man even w/better graphics)
","Good movie that could have been great.<br/><br/>The movie built up great, Will Smith is likable as always. The ending, although different perhaps in relation to the usual Hollywood ride off into the sunset, everything is wonderful ending, was refreshing in its unexpected result although seemed like a rush to finish rather than develop better. If you like end of the world, mutant human type movies then this is a good one. As stated good, but could have been great.<br/><br/>Stop here if you do not want hints and plot information ""Spoiler alert""<br/><br/>1.The CGI graphics were great for NYC and the animals, but lost it with the infected people. They all looked the same and not very real. <br/><br/>2.The infected humans were rabid, crazy, hyper-accelerated yes, BUT were still people that were infected but still alive since a cure could theoretically bring them back. These were super fast, climbing buildings, smashing through metal barriers and bullet proof glass. Physics says flesh and bone are inferior to steel and concrete. The actions and antics of the infected made the movie less believable. Had they retained some human semblance they would have been scarier and more believable, especially if they were crazy but still human in mentality, like in Omega Man. <br/><br/>3. They imply that they eat any live meat and blood they can find. Okay. However, infected or not, they must eat to stay alive and since they are, what are they eating? The movie suggests deer and other animals as well as survivors at first, but an island the size of Manhattan has a limit population support ability for deer and other animals, and if there are at least 100,000 to 200,000 infected humans on the island (movie estimates based on 2,000,000 inhabitants in Manhattan 10% survive etc.),they would eat up the food supply in weeks and starve soon after since you can't get off the island (bridges blown up). Big hole in plot. <br/><br/>4. Neville (Smith) is trying to find a cure. He seems to make progress on an animal early on then no more mention. His dog gets bitten, why not isolate it, and work on it for a cure? Instead, he holds it until it gets infected,then kills it. Sad, but makes no sense considering. <br/><br/>5. The lady and the boy just show up. How? By boat? Car? What? These 2 survive a landscape inhabited by hundreds of thousands of rabid humans and they simply stroll into NYC and find Neville. Better if they came with a small group on a boat say, with a plausible explanation how they survived,got there etc. Also, Neville is about to be taken out by infected and the lady turns on lights. Okay, how did this drive them off (I am aware they are photo sensitive)? Later, Neville turns on lights and the infected simply smash them and move on so lights can't be that great. Another hole. <br/><br/>6. The infected follow them to Neville's home and smash through metal to get in. Weak. Then, just as they are sealed in the basement, an infected Neville is working on seems cured. He draws blood, gives it to the lady, hides them in a tunnel of sorts and blows up the infected and himself as they smash through bullet proof glass, ridiculous. The lady then goes to Vermont and finds an uninfected colony and has the cure in the blood from the sample. Okay, how did the car that was on Manhattan get across the water without bridges? Again, a big hole. Rushed ending that would have been better if it had developed better.<br/><br/>Other holes, but still a good flick. Frustrating because it could have been a classic you would watch over and over (like Omega Man despite its flaws), but just falls short."

","In the year 2006, a miracle breakthrough, the KV virus, is created and toted to be able to cure the likes of cancer. However, in no time whatsoever, this cure mutates into a deadly virus which changes its host into a grotesque creature. Three years after the outbreak, Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the last human left alive due to his immunity to the virus, and he is continuing work on a vaccine to help change those who are no longer human, dark seekers, back to their original selves, while they attempt to hunt him down during the night.<br/><br/>With an interesting post-apocalyptic story, I Am Legend comes as one of many adaptations of it's source material, but is arguably the closest in it's rendition. However this is not to say that it doesn't take any liberties it's in story telling so fans of the novel might be disappointed. Even as a moviegoer, it's difficult to understand why certain elements of the novel were changed. While the novels soul remains in most of the film, such aspects as the locale change, Neville's population group and even the concept of the creatures themselves, are altered. These are minor issues, but more important story elements are changed as well. The worst of these being the difference in time line as it seems strange that Neville attempts to contact other survivors by means of a radio system. The film goes onto a vast array of symbolic themes such as heroism to , and importantly, religion, and these help heighten the story's depth. This is well assisted by few moments of reminiscence on Neville's part, where he accounts the last few moments he had with his deceased family. The story also lacks a firm buildup going from a calmness to franticness in the blink of an eye, bringing up a major problem with the film: length.<br/><br/>Closing in on the two hour mark, the film goes from a slow restrained manner for three-quarters of its length, only to spiral into a uncontrollable mess. This cinematic experience works best with Smith is absorbed in his isolation and more of these scenes would have really helped heighten the emotional impact. As well, not enough time is dedicated to his experiments on finding the cure and worst yet, the director completely disregards this part of the films essence towards the end, which itself is a real letdown. Firstly the ending is sort of Hollywood-like in it's execution and would have worked far better if it were more ambiguous instead of being stated. The other problem comes from the films skewed concept of the theme of being a legend. Instead of using the heavily metaphorical designation from the novel, the cinema version falls into a heap clichés. This could be partly due to the rushed filming of a new ending merely weeks before release, but this should not be an excuse. If anything, it does give an incentive to pick up the DVD release, just to see how the original ending worked with the rest of the film, how it compared to the novel's ending, and how effective it would have been for a movie.<br/><br/>The acting is solely dictated by Will Smith for virtually the entire film, and praise must be given to him for his portrayal of the last remaining human alive. Acting itself is not easy, and it's even harder when you are performing a solo effort. Smith has the ability to shows his character' s aged loneliness with his only companion being his loyal dog, Samantha, and how this affects his everyday ability to function in a society of normality. His performance is also emotional and so when moments of sadness are dripped onto the screen, they are powerful enough for the viewer to care.<br/><br/>An important aspect of the film is it's computer generated images, but these range from excellent to dull. The introductory scenes, and those which follow, of an abandoned New York City, are superb in it's realism. It's a real highpoint in the film and really sets up the atmosphere to follow, but it's a real shame that another important aspect to the film' s CGI, the dark seekers, are painted in a bland and non-realistic manner. From their skin textures to their awkward movements, the dark seekers are noticeably misplaced in a film that does so well to contain it's believability.<br/><br/>A relatively clean film as only violence makes any appearance. It comes in various forms of shooting, explosions and attacks from the human-turned-creatures. All of these scenes are never bloody , yes blood itself is seen staining the floors in a couple of scenes.<br/><br/>I Am Legend has had a strange development period with it's origins back in 1994, and various other attempts to get the film into production.. Thirteen years later and it appears that Warner Brothers has finally got their act together and finished the film albeit its marketing was not exactly up to scratch.. Regardless, I Am Legend is a remarkable title with some classy acting and an intriguing storyline. It's a shame that it has visible shortcomings, such as length and CGI issues, because it is one of those few films that you really want to succeed, to prove that the final product is better then originally believed. Sadly, no matter how you view it, I Am Legend is merely a good film, lacking in reams of potential."

I really felt like this movie would have been better if it had maybe ran a little longer.<br/><br/>Really wish it would have shown a little more of the ""dark seekers"". Maybe shown some flashbacks of the virus taking over, and people de-evolving into these creatures.

There were a lot of holes in the plot, and the CG 'zombies' got a little old. I wanted to know more about what happened and how things got the way they were. Let me say that I am a fan of Will Smith, but I think that he could have dug a little deeper as far as his character Neville is concerned. Just some questions: 1.How in the world did a cure for cancer turn into a highly contagious airborne virus that turned people and animals into zombies? 2.When Neville trapped the female zombie, and the male zombie looked at him during the daylight hours, why wasn't that addressed? 3. Who was the 'Alpha' zombie anyway? He seemed like he was the only one who exhibited any emotions as far as the zombies were concerned. 4. If it was too cold in Vermont for the virus to survive, why wasn't it too cold in the winter in NYC? 5. Who was Robert Neville really? Did he help create the cure that turned into the virus? Or was he just some random government scientist that decided to stay and research in city that was all but abandoned by humans? ( I may have missed this if the movie addressed it already)<br/><br/>It was an OK movie. Was it worth 9 bucks and a long uncomfortable wait in a theater seat? No. I'd wait until it was available on demand for $3.99 and then watch it in the comfort of your living room, where you can turn it off when it got to annoying with the plot jumps."

I liked the whole sketching of the atmosphere through the visuals of the empty streets and the feeling of isolation.<br/><br/>Will Smith as Neville wasn't too bad, although it was weird having only one character for half the movie.<br/><br/>Somehow though the movie never really grabbed me. The dog was the most interesting character, and when it died, it kinda ended the good part of the movie. After that it was just a zombie gore fest and unrealistic.<br/><br/>I must admit though that I found the movie quite funny. I know it wasn't supposed to be funny, but just parts like the Shrek scenes were so arb and disconnected to the story, as was the girl making breakfast in his house and him saying something about the bacon...it just kinda felt like the writers were running out of ideas and just added another movie clip to fill time. Was really strange. Also him having a gun handy at every turn was incredibly arb and although he was a military dude, quite unrealistic...and where did he get all those fresh fruit if no one was growing them?...<br/><br/>Overall a mildly amusing movie, with some unexpected freak moments which didn't have the power to really scare though, and only one truly sad part where Sam dies.<br/><br/>*END SPOILERS* If you like zombie movies, do watch it...it might be interesting.

If Will Smith asked for your car keys you'd give it to him. If any of the characters in ""Resident Evil"" or ""Dawn of the dead"" or ""28 whatever"" did you'd say no you like and trust ""Will Smith"" thats why you fear for him! my dad stood up and screamed during the few scary parts.

","I was dragged to this movie, but I did give it a chance. However there is nothing new here if you have seen 'The Omega Man'. Now 'The Omega Man' was a very cool (in a 70s kitsch way) remake of 'The Last Man on Earth' the very cool Vincent Price movie. Those two movies were different enough that I'm not sure I even realized that 'The Omega Man' was a remake initially. In this case however 'I Am Legend' adds very little, and if you've seen 'The Omega Man', I don't think there is enough to keep you from being bored senseless. What they've basically done is taken that film, added the fast zombies now that '28 Days Later' invented them, and added more backstory about Robert Neville and the virus. But it's minuscule. Some of the effects were pretty good and that's what I'm giving it 3 points for. Someone worked hard on those I'm sure. Otherwise, Will Smith should really focus on more actory movies, because he's good at it and stuff like this is just a waste of his talent."
"jaredmobarak","6","3","8","14 December 2007"," Daddy look, a butterflyI Am Legend
","Francis Lawrence had impressed me with his very under-appreciated Constantine and I was somewhat psyched to see what he could do with this material. Based on the novel of same name by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend has the potential to be a great psychological thriller, commenting on man's quest to be God, while instilling some nice scares and monster work. For the most part, Lawrence succeeds on all counts.<br/><br/>I will admit to being drawn in completely right from the start. In a film that potentially follows Smith around, alone, for two hours, I was completely taken aback by the introduction. We are shown a television interview between an uncredited Emma Thompson and Ms. Klue from ""Lost""I was not expecting that. Soon enough, though, we are vaulted right into the action, three years later, to the deserted and overgrown city, ground zero for infection/home to our hero Robert Neville. The filmmakers really handle the exposition brilliantly, showing us the day to day routine for our immune scientist spliced together with memories of the final minutes before quarantine with his family. You really do become quite engrossed with the environment and on edge from the subtle hinting of the Dark Seekers (don't you dare call them vampires).<br/><br/>Will Smith is a powerhouse here. I don't care what your feelings are towards the man, he truly is good at his craft. As far as making one film a year, he knows how to pick a role that will challenge him into giving his all, whether or not the work itself succeeds. His emotions are always realistic, the relationship with his dog Sam is heartwarming, and the moments showing how cabin fever has set in (talking to mannequins that he has set up strategically throughout the city) help explore the fractured soul he now must carry alone, while also lending some nice comic relief. It was all working so well, everything was methodical and relevant, his quest for finding a cure vastly important. And then, of course, it all fell apart.<br/><br/>Showing the enemy, completely made from computer graphics, is one thing, showing them for extended periods of time is another. When shrouded in darkness, the creatures are very effective, when they all of a sudden become conscious and intelligent, they become utterly laughable. Why does the leader have to hold such a dorky smile the whole time? Just be menacing and non-committal; I wanted monsters devoid of humanity. Sure Smith's Neville says they have finally lost all human qualities, but he is wrong. The fact that they have learned to fight back smartly and risk exposure to sunlight in order to catch a glimpse at him shows they have become more human. They are no longer roaming wild for blood lust, now they want to have some fun with personal vendettas. What's more human than that? Even then, the film could have been forgiven, but alas, it tries to tidy everything up with a nice bow on top. Much like Signs, where the minutia of the first three-thirds of the film all of a sudden gain mystical meaning to the point of scripturerectifying allI Am Legend takes its slow burn and turns it into a race for the finish. It is all too quick and way too easily done. If only it was all hinted on throughout, it wouldn't have felt so tacked on. This disappointment, however, makes me want to read my copy of the 1954 novel to see how much was changed. The credits say based on the 1971 screenplay for The Omega Man before they say based on Matheson's book. I won't be surprised if the ending is what was taken from the old film version, the effective character study being what was gleaned from the original source."
"nrr1991","Null","5","17","12 December 2007"," This is not a remake
","This movie is not, technically, a remake. It is based off of the book ""I Am Legend"" by Robert Matheson. ""Omega Man"" is also based off of this book, which is why the plot line is extremely similar. There is an even earlier movie adaptation of the novel, called ""The Last Man On Earth"". It to, has a nearly identical plot. ""Omega Man"" is quite different though, as in it the creatures are radioactive, and in all the other versions of the story, they are vapiristic infected people. Do not base your fore-thoughts on ""Omega Man"", as the storyline is highly altered. ""Last Man on Earth"" is better than ""Omega Man"", and is more accurate to the story. I believe ""TLMOE"" is on YouTube, as it is a publicly available movie. Watch it, and you'll get the idea. Just switch out LA for NY, as it is in this version."

Only if you're suffering from a sleeping disorder, this movie is highly recommended. For anyone over the age of twelve this movie is a complete waste of time. The acting wasn't bad (Will Smith was actually rather good), but the storyline is a ripoff from a ripoff from a ripoff from a ripoff ... I almost cheered when this movie was finally over.

","I thought this was a really really wonderful film although bits of it weren't. First off I have to admit I was thirty minutes late to the theatre due to an unfortunate and unavoidable incident involving francium. Anyways, my friends were already in the cinema and they said I hadn't missed much just Will Smith walking about all by himself. How does he cut his hair? I missed a bit more of the film as apparently it was my turn to get the popcorn etc. The queue was a mile long and when I got back to the cinema I couldn't find my friends and on screen there was just a bunch of animated bees buzzing around. After about half an hour I realised I'd walked in to the wrong screening room (damn these multiplex thingys!). When I did find the correct cinema there was Will Smith hugging a dog - to death! It didn't really make sense to me as Will looked to be quite distressed about killing this dog but then he went and did it anyways. What's that all about? It was then that my mobile went off. A purely random call from a complete stranger who was under the impression that I had a Yamaha DD55 drum machine for sale  which I don't but coincidentally I have a mate up in Larne who has three of them (don't ask) so I was able to hook them up. Always glad to do a good deed. I was not the most popular person in that cinema. Mean while up on the screen there was this baldy headed fellow bashing his head against a window. Then the Will Smith character killed everyone with a grenade. Why did he do that? It was confusing. Totally random!! Things I liked about this film. It was in colour. Actually, I was very keen on seeing this film as I'm a big fan of ""The Omega Man"". I've seen it about a million times and I'm always impressed when Charlton Heston discovers the Statue of Liberty. In the end I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see it."

","Many's the day that we've heard of cures, medicines, drugs, etc., having unintended consequences. So there had to be a movie like ""I Am Legend"". It portrays a future in which a miracle cure wipes out cancer but turns the cured people rabid. New York City is now empty except for Robert Neville (Will Smith). He and his dog Sam spend the days driving throughout the city looking for things to shoot. But every night, the mutated people come out of hiding...and you don't want to get bitten by them.<br/><br/>This is a remake of the Charlton Heston movie ""The Omega Man"", which was itself a remake of the Vincent Price movie ""The Last Man on Earth"" (what do you call a remake of a remake?). As I haven't seen the other two, I can only focus on this one. Much of the movie was certainly intense enough, and the issue of a miracle cure having a disastrous outcome is a relevant one. But truth be told, the movie mostly seems a little sensationalistic. While I mostly think that Will Smith has so far been a good actor, it seems as if the movie is just trying to show him off.<br/><br/>But I do recommend the movie. It really does create a sense of intensity like I rarely see in movies, and it does seem as if the overall plot could really happen. Worth seeing."

","Will Smith continues his streak of bad, practically unwatchable series of films where the premise has to do with him battling aliens. Apparently, people seem to enjoy this formula because this movie made a lot of money.<br/><br/>I must admit that while I could not sit through this movie in it's entirety, I saw enough of it to say confidently that it was horrible. Independence Day is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Men In Black was extremely overrated. I, Robot: I could also not sit through. Part of the problem with these films is that Smith plays up his comedic, likable guy personality so much that it is practically impossible to take the brink of apocalypse storyline seriously. But the main flaw with Smith's sci-fi / action vehicles is: they bring nothing new to the table. They all seem like badly made hack jobs by filmmakers and screenwriters who are walking the fine line between originality and plagiarism.<br/><br/>Maybe one of these days, Smith will get a script involving him fighting aliens that will actually bring something original to the genre. But I'm not holding my breath. The success of I Am Legend ensures you can expect more of the same."
"goverthana","10","2","5","6 February 2008"," I Am Legend - A Realistic Movie
","Most of our movies nowadays comes with CGI enhancements, they contain fantasized imagery of a vision predictable to our senses, sometimes they project too often or in aloft that spoils the viewers real intentions, ""I Am Legend"" is truly an amazing movie with Limitless Thriller on each consecutive scene of the movie. The viewers may judge for themselves if this would be a reality, I would end up in the same state, the 2 previous versions of Robert Mathesons novel based movies were fictionalized to an extent that the blood thirty zombies looked mere like a makeup artists impression of appearance, here you'll get only the realistic feelings, of how it should be and CGI just blends in, whereby you couldn't have noticed that would be a CGI imagery. This movie contains a message enveloped to it, and its up to you to decide how deep it can go in your thoughts and project an idea ""not to play with the nature wrongfully - scientific researches gone berserk"" or ""cause harm to others for the sake of being another - mentally becoming Zombies"". This reminds me of the song Zombie by Cranberries, listen to the lyrics well, you will understand me more what I'm talking bout. Comin back to the movie's comments, Who really knows what it might be in the future, therefore we make a stand for whatever it comes to us, thats where Robert Neville stands in for humanity. Neville played by Will Smith, in my opinion no other actor would suit the better for his down to earth acting. Dr. Neville represents a 21- century futuristic sci-fi Ghandi with a vision to save all humanity from being disintegrated to oblivion from the face of this Earth that he lives in. If your hoping for a superhero like Spiderman or Batman then this is not the kind of movie for you, or if you fantasize of ""Snake"" Plissken then you're way out of your target. So be prepared for a realistic adventure if you want to know the futuristic reality. I would rate it 10/10."

","When some movie ends, you can't help but ask yourself: ""Why?"", ""I am Legend"" is such a movie. <br/><br/>Why such a good start and such a cheap ending?<br/><br/>Why such a good acting (Will Smith) on such a poor story line? <br/><br/>Why such a minimalistic presentation of the victims of the KV Virus, leading to the incoherences or unfinished feelings?<br/><br/>Why trying to build a religious and moral crap 15 minutes from the end? <br/><br/>Why ending without answering some questions: the KV virus is apparently only for humans, dogs and rats?... Why some people are immune?... What is the liquid he pours in front of his door?... <br/><br/>Why the trained and fit military background man such as Will Smith character fails where an underfed religious fanatic and 12 years old kid succeed?<br/><br/>Why the hell does he start sleeping into his bath and ends up into his bed? <br/><br/>Why with all the technology at his disposal doesn't Neville even have a pair of night goggle or light amplification ones to go into dark building rather than use a torch lamp that betray his position...?<br/><br/>So regardless of how appealing the background is, or how good Will Smith struggle to survive and achieve something is, there are too many WHY for me to call it a good movie<br/><br/>From the middle to the end of the movie, the degenerated human victims of the KV virus had an uncanny CGI facial look (eyes expression, bald head) and superhuman movement (jump, fighting abilities) resemblance to their older brothers of ""I Robot"".<br/><br/>The special effect to turn NY into a desolated Island are great but the effects used onto the KV Victims is poorly convincing, which is a shame as recent movies have shown quite stunning looking undead/monsters...<br/><br/>The inconsistencies are constant in the movie, especially after meeting the first KV Victims.<br/><br/>What can be infected and what can't, deers, lions are at loose in Manhattan while from the first night we can hear hundreds of owls of mutants, how did they manage to survive that long? I can't see anything surviving a rat swarm if all the rats turned into the things in Neville's laboratory...<br/><br/>The KV virus turns its victims into a hairless, super zombie, sensitive to UV, OK fair enough then how comes that theses zombies are able to make a trap and not able to to just move within the shadow of the buildings or even wear clothes to protect themselves. Why do they know where he gets his DVDs from and after 5 years not even know where he lives?<br/><br/>The whole night/sun light which is appealing and creates a sort of pressure at the start of the movie turns crap after the mutants dogs' attack... If the dogs are just hurt by direct exposure of sun beam and stand in the shadow of the building why can't the other zombie mutants do the same? This part was probably the most disappointing one as it created a huge confusion.<br/><br/>Neville goes around all NY apparently mapping a list of buildings completely empty, surely these buildings are in the dark, no? So why does he freaks out to enter the building where the deer and dog have entered and just enters a new habitation building so casually?<br/><br/>Why not exploit the indication that the zombies have a new community with leadership and control over animals rather than as Neville says ""they have lost all humanity""?<br/><br/>Why not exploit the fact that the subdued zombie used by Neville for his experiment was the ""mating"" or ""female partner"" of the tribe leading zombie? The two points above would have reinforced the reason for Neville to fight to find a cure...<br/><br/>All through the movie we are fed with a couple cool ideas and it turns into an anticlimax, especially the last minutes at the safe heaven, with the cheap wall and door guarded by a couple guys with assault rifles and the sound of a church bell...........<br/><br/>Will Smith plays very well but sadly it's not enough to turn it into a good movie and it's appalling to see how many people have so little reflexion...

","What can I say? I really wanted this to be good. I do love the book but my comments are not merely those of a rabid fan-boy. By changing certain key elements of the novel they drastically changed the feel of the story. For example: What is special or amazing about a trained soldier who also happens to be a leading scientist surviving alone with a house full of guns and supplies? Answer nothing, so how can we feel that he is really against all odds, he has better odds than anyone else, unlike Neville in the book. I won't say anything else aside from the fact that by changing the ""vampires"" into mindless killing machines completely changes the dilemma posed by the novel, which is not about humanity being snuffed out but about it changing forever. You don't end up questioning Neville himself at all. He is just a typical action hero. Will Smith's performance was good though and the first half of the film was pretty good all round, after that though it went down hill FAST and ended with a typically sickening Hollywood ending. All in all, pretty bad."
"ste_et","7","2","5","27 January 2008"," I Am Disappointed
","Ever wondered what it would be like to be the last man left on Earth? To be totally alone and isolated, what would you do? How would you survive? These themes are tackled in Francis Lawrence's distressingly bleak version of Richard Matheson's 1954 cult novel, also called 'I Am Legend'. The story begins with news reports featuring a Dr Krippen, (an uncredited cameo by Emma Thompson) who claims to have cured cancer by genetically engineering the Measles virus. It then transpires that there is a mutation to this 'cure' which becomes airborne and decimates mankind to the point, where by 2012, one man only remains in New York City. Dr. Robert Neville, (Will Smith) is the only survivor from the outbreak, seemingly immune to the disease, whilst the rest of the species has mutated into the sunlight-fearing 'The Infected'. By day he roams the post-apocalyptic New York streets with only his pet German Shepherd, Samantha to keep him company. By night, is a different story, as he holes up in his apartment whilst the Infected come out and claim the night with blood-curdling screams and howling filtering into Neville's fortified home.<br/><br/>Whilst Neville has long since given up any chance of finding fellow survivors, he strive to use his own immunity to come up with a cure, first, experimenting on animals before capturing a Dark-Seeker to test his vaccine. However, his dreams are eventually answered when Anna (Alice Braga) and her child Ethan (Charlie Tahan) arrive. This restores his faith but when Alice begins talk of escaping the city for a survivor's colony, his fragile state of mind finally explodes. Meanwhile, having tracked down the location of the survivors hiding place, the Infected mount a vicious attack on the barricaded penthouse which results in a final stand with the potential to decide the fate of the human race. The astounding shots of a empty New York City and especially, an overgrown and abandoned Times Square are hauntingly stunning in the same way Danny Boyle's '28 Days' Later' shocked the system with a deserted London. The panoramic views of the scenery allows the story to be fully comprehended as the scene of tranquillity conflicts perfectly with the chaos that follows once the sun sets.<br/><br/>Will Smith really flexs his acting muscles in I Am Legend despite sharing the screen with nothing but a dog, mannequins and the CGI animated Infected for most of the movie. His portrayal of the effects of three years of seclusion leading to the growing insanity in Neville as he increasingly becomes more deluded and paranoid. The arrival of the survivors only serves to drive him even crazier until the finale when he realises what he must do. The beauty of Robert Neville's seclusion is that via the use of Samantha and the mannequins in the record stores, Smith is able to interact with them to create the illusion of Robert Neville, the companion, as well as Robert Neville, the loner. It is in fact reminiscent of Tom Hanks' role in Castaway with the role of the mannequin equal to the role of the football in that film. The CGI dark-seekers are shocking in both appearance and sound. The sounds they make whilst Neville is hiding in his bathtub must surely be amongst the most blood-curdling in horror history. The only criticism of them is that they inexplicably display extreme amounts of strength and speed for no other reason to raise the shock factor. The major flaw of this film is the somewhat lopsided structure. For almost an hour Will Smith is living his life of isolation and sliding towards insanity, if not teeing off from a fighter jet, he's flirting with the female mannequins at the record store. Then tacked onto the final 30 minutes, there's the arrival of Neville's fellow survivors and the final confrontation which feels unbelievably rushed."

My excitement soon gave way to disinterest, and at the end of the movie, I was frowning and cringing all at once. The movie deteriorates into the most predictable, uninteresting rubbish I've seen in recent memory. The ending is outright embarrassing.

","""Nothin' happened the way it was supposed to happen."" The amazing thing about this film, is that that quote sums up a lot about how this film came to be. Based on the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, Warner Brothers took hold of the rights in 1970 and produced ""The Omega Man"" in 1971 with Charlton Heston in the lead role. ""I am Legend"" was then attempted by director Ridley Scott (American Gangster, Gladiator) and was due to star Arnold Schwarzenneger but fell through when the budget blew out. Michael Bay (Transformers, Bad Boys) then tried to make it in 2002 with Will Smith playing the lead, but then decided to do Bad Boys II instead. Finally, Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) picked it up and ran with it, also with Will Smith, this time finally coming to the big screen.<br/><br/>The film is set in a post-cataclysmic New York where Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the sole survivor of a cancer cure which turned everyone into blood-thirsty, zombie-like creatures of the night. Neville tries to find a cure for 'the cure' while trying to find anyone else who may have survived like himself. Filled with 'flashbacks' to let us catch up to the present story, I found this method to be effective and while they occurred often throughout the film, didn't appear to be overdone.<br/><br/>Will Smith took the role of Robert Neville, and while he was portrayed as a tough warrior, Smith also brought to it an extremely emotionally damaged side, brought on by the fact that his character had been alone for over three years - a pleasant relief considering the usually generic characters in this genre of film.<br/><br/>I suspect that Will Smith and supporting cast member Alice Braga probably brought their own talent as actors and required minimal direction - but I feel that Francis Lawrence's direction lacked somewhat when it came to the two children's roles who tended to look very much staged and ""non-natural"". This could primarily be to Lawrence's relative newness to movie direction.<br/><br/>The set designers did a fantastic job, transposing the real New York city into a life-less, big city wasteland. No detail was overlooked, from the hundreds of weeds growing through the main roads in New York, down to the houses and apartments left in disarray as the victims of the 'cure' died.<br/><br/>Screenwriters Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman did a great job, bringing some comic-relief to break up the suspense. Both are familiar with the disaster-film genre having been associated with the 2006 production of ""Poseidon"".<br/><br/>The CG effects were pretty good, but at times, slightly too ""computerised"", especially with respect to the zombie-type characters, who seemed too computer generated. At times, I found myself thinking of them more like orcs from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, rather than humans who had deteriorated into sub-human form.<br/><br/>I wasn't and expecting Academy Award winning effort - after all, it is a disaster film. However, it kept me on the edge of my seat at times, made me feel upset and annoyed at others, made me laugh every now and then, and over all, kept me thoroughly entertained - just as a movie should. I really enjoyed I Am Legend, and will no doubt watch it again and again in future."

I gotta say the only thing positive i found in this video was the great quality BUT some negative thoughts i express about this movie that the story could of been better written instead will smith and his dog sitting around too much, There wasn't any action until like 3/4 onto the movie... I don't want to spoil too much bout the movie, but ill just say a little, all the main characters ended up being something awful especially my fav, the dog =(*cannot say what happens, don't want to spoil too much* The ending was really awful including a suicidal And later in the movie random characters just drop off in the movie like they were newspapers. i found very little worth watching, but trust me you will fall asleep b4 any action goes on..."
"simon-wilson-2","1","2","5","14 January 2008"," Awful Awful Awful
","So what can be said about this. A film which has no character development, no plot and above all quite possibly one of the most rushed and poor endings I have ever seen. Will Smith is as wooden as ever in his same old role (Pursuit of Happiness excluded) as the action hero. Give him an array of guns and that I'm so hard stare and there you go. For me this just struck of I, Robot (similar title?) just with a slightly different theme, this time its mutated, infected vicious men/women instead of psychotic robots. Smith doesn't act well enough to fool the audience that the CGI monsters could in fact be real and as a result basically looks like him having a bit of a workout. The relationship developed with Anna is very rushed, they seem to be on screen as a partnership for all of 20-25 minutes but in that time strike up a dependency on each other. Just thinking back, the animals running round the streets of New York at the beginning why aren't the antelope/gazelle whatever they are meant to be infected as has occurred to the dogs - the same with the lions. The ending? I know it has to remain true to the book but it was so overly rushed - the cure suddenly came about and wow just enough time for Smith to make his heroic last stand - which he certainly could have avoided. All in all a massive disappointment."
"didiween01","4","2","5","13 January 2008"," Minimal expectations...
","Not having read the book or seen 28 days later, I dove into this movie with no expectations, except to hear a standard Smithy line like "" Oh man! You did not just do that!"". On this front I was pleasantly surprised as lines of this flavour were included but they did not dominate the script, which brings me to my main problem with this movie: its totally under-developed script.<br/><br/>I have a few issues with consistency in this movie. Aside from the item mentioned above in the goofs, I had a problem believing that certain things should remain so conveniently available despite no maintenance for 3 yearsfor example: piped water, electricity, cars (I will concede that he could probably have just picked up another one, when his dies from not being serviced). The other one that bothered me greatly is that despite locking up and blacking out his windows every night, he somehow manages to be woken up by the sunlight shining through his bedroom window.<br/><br/>Anyway, let us leave the consistency editors alone and focus on the writers. As far as dialogue goes, this movie wasn't as silent as one would expect from one man and his dog. Like I said above the trademark Smithy comments are heard. My problem with the writers is with how they allowed soo many great opportunities to develop the story slide, in order to allow the action junkies get their fix of loud noises, explosions and chase scenes.<br/><br/>Without giving the story line away too much, I will try to explain my reasoning. The reaction and consequent proactive hostility displayed by the male mutant (let me just say ""Fred?!"" and mental head banging), at the capture of the female test mutant was something that could have, nay should have been developed further. It just felt like the writers has spent all their time and effort on setting up the movie, then realised at 1 hr 25 mins that their allocated time for their target audience was up, and wrapped up the movie with the requisite BOOM! After I, Robot, I was very disappointed in Smithy's choice of roles. It could have been sooo great!"

","this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was disappointed that Will smith was even in a movie this bad! I don't recommend this to anyone. I thought that is it was pointless. I think that it was a little creepy but not even worth the scare. I cant believe we spent money to see this film. I wish I would have known how bad it was before I wasted my money on it. Will smith is to good to do a movie like this.I was surprised to see children at this movie to. Please please please! don't take you kids to see this it is a little to scary for them to watch! It does have some scary parts to it. I was disturbed by some of this movie also. I cant see why someone would think that taking there children to this would be alright?

All the usual Hollywood themes pass: Loss of wife and family (offcourse not the way all the others died, but more acceptable to the audience), the replacement family, the cool guy, the smart guy, and the heroin of sacrificing ones life. <br/><br/>If you like a movie like this, 28 days later is way more intense.<br/><br/>Also: the quality of the special effects are rather disappointing: very obvious computer generated images, it often looks like watching a computer game. Only good thing I can say about this movie is the use of quite some Bob Marley music."

","Every time a Hollywood blockbuster is released i hold my breath to see which story/book they can destroy with visual effects and the complete absence of cinematography aiming directly to the video games market. And yet another time they have made it!! From the beginning of the film and throughout there is clearly the feel that it has been made for the easy/pop corn viewing crowd while there are several attempts to scare with animals or ""monsters"" jumping suddenly on the foreground.. There is complete lack of inspiration even at these action and scary scenes reminding us a blend of other films and worst the plot has the sequence even the uninvolved viewer would expect. I am really sorry for cinema critics taking seriously and highly commenting on spoofs like that and i hope i fall for this trap for the last time , giving them the chance to cash in with movies that start and finish with the waving American flag!!!"
"the1beard","1","2","5","11 January 2008"," Without doubt the worst Will Smith has ever made!
","Awful is an understatement for what is effectively a remake of the classic and superb ""Omega Man"". Slow, lumbering, awkward are just a few words to describe almost every element of the film except the sets, which are superb, but no matter how good, they can't save this hollow effort to show a world in which 99% of the human population is either dead or no longer human. Smith makes the best of his performance, but given the script he struggles to bring things up to any sort of interesting level there is little in the way of tension and even less in the way of attention holding in the uneventful passage of what can't quite be called a story. The flash backs on the story line are poorly placed and confuse this is not an elegant effort. Special effects are as good as can be expected but again do nothing to lift the slow progress. Hollywood efforts on remakes are bad in the majority of cases this takes their efforts down to a new LOW. I can't quite believe the numbers putting this top at the box office."" very suspicious indeed"" 1/10 Awful don't waste you money on the film of DVD. Just get the ""Omega Man"""
"A_Brizard","3","2","5","10 January 2008"," They did it again...
","Will Smith is playing good for once...but the dog play better. And why using the same title as the book when you are doing a remake of the already wrong adaptation of the Omega Man. I don't know who change the end but producers/directors/screenwriters should change their job and do something else. It's really a shame because the 3/4 of the movie is quite good. I thought it was a good adaptation even with the few changes from the book. I really hoped they made it properly. But the last bit it's even don't fit with the character build in the movie. The Visual of NewYork is very good. The suppose to be Vampire looks too CG. I am hoping having a director's cut that will correct all the crap story telling of the end."

"wmdm2024","7","2","5","25 December 2007"," Worth a look, but lacking in areas.
","I gave this film a 7 out of 10, to me this means it is entertaining, well-made, worth admission, but lacking in areas. Here are the positives: the acting was excellent, the set was brilliant, the story idea was compelling. The negatives: there isn't enough development of the storyline and all of the characters, the film ends too quickly, and the product placement is WAY to obvious and distracting. Everyone knows the basic story line I assume, Will Smith is the lone human left in NY following man-made disaster involving a cancer treatment. The setting allows for awesome sets and sparks your imagination - which it did with ease. The main character is tough, brilliant and organized, which makes it believable that he's still alive and thriving. The zombies are scary and suitable villains for Will Smith to battle, but that's where the story development ends. The film introduces a whole bunch of interesting mental health issues with Will Smith's character (to be expected after 3 years of solitude), but then abandons these thoughts. When two new humans appear, I was interested about their story, which was only discussed in 60 seconds over breakfast. And then, suddenly, God is introduced as a theme...then the movie ends. And all the way through I was slapped in the face with advertising (a staple of Will Smith films) in particular lots of Ford Motor Company sponsorship here. Anyways, a good film but it needed more."
"e-1529","7","2","5","25 December 2007"," CGI Disaster!
","Add another one to the list of movies ruined by the computer. Actually I think this one deserves spot number 1 because there was no need at all of CGI. Imagine if 'Dawn of the dead' or '28 days later' had some plastic computer generated puppets instead of realistic zombie characters. That can give you an idea of how bad this film looks as soon as CGI pops up! What in the world were the producer thinking?? I really wanted to like this movie having read the book and I also don't mind the changes they made in the story. The actors did a good job , the adaptation is alright, and everything else is well done. So that's it, this is officially the ultimate cgi disaster movie. And don't expect some King Kong like computer animations, no these ones actually look like rubbish."

","This was without a doubt one of the movies of the year, the special effects were top notch and the acting from will smith was Oscar worthy, even though he will never get an Oscar for this type of film because it is a blockbuster. But he does deserve a nomination for this performance. The atmosphere in the film really gets to you. It is like Will smith is the last man on earth, the way they made new york look like a ghost town was spectacular, empty streets with lions and other wildlife roaming it. Overall the film was interesting and entertaining, and I would totally recommend this to anyone who likes these sort of films, or even if your a fan of will smith who in my opinion is fast becoming a new tom hanks in that he can play many different parts"

I really hope there is a sequel or prequel.<br/><br/>Will Smith is amazing, the friendship between him and his dog allowed Will to fully show his acting ability.<br/><br/>If the ending is a bit better, i think this can be the next matrix. <br/><br/>The scene where the infected gather together breathing is amazing, I wish there more scenes like that.

"bgood26","8","2","5","23 December 2007"," Will Smith carries the movie
","In 2009, Dr. Krippen finds a cure for cancer by mutating a measles virus. Unfortunately, the virus, mutated to attack only cancerous cells, gains a life of its own. It spreads rapidly around the globe, and within three years, 90% of human life is wiped out.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a military scientist who is one of 12 million people who were naturally immune to KV. Dr. Neville is the sole survivor in the City of New York. So far as he knows, he and his dog Sam are all that is left of civilization. But he is not alone. The rest of the survivors became zombies, feeding off the healthy survivors.<br/><br/>To ease his loneliness, he sets up a few mannequins across the city so that he has someone to greet as he makes his daily rounds (like Tom Hanks and Wilson in ""Cast Away""). He also turned his basement into a lab in which he experiments with rats, trying to find a cure for the virus.<br/><br/>One of the unique aspects of ""I Am Legend,"" compared to other post-apocalypse movies, is the zombies had personalities. The Alpha Male is not only strong and tough, he is also very smart, able to set a trap for Neville and rally hundreds of zombies to fight with him. He was also smart enough to search all parts of Neville's townhouse.<br/><br/>The movie is not without its flaws, but it is much better than the Omega Man. There are some really good scares, and Will Smith was terrific in the lead."
"roamingbrit","6","2","5","23 December 2007"," Is this the best they could do?
","The plot of this film had great potential and the story could have been oh so richly and fully developed but sadly it falls very short of being the great film it could have been.<br/><br/>Will Smith's acting is fine, he is of course more than familiar with the Hollywood Sci-Fi genre (Men In Black, Independence Day, I-Robot) so no one should have any complaints about him.<br/><br/>New York deserted looks very striking and the visuals and the CGI are very good, fantastic even and if you examine them on their own you have to say a great job was done, there are some good edge of your seat moments involving the zombies or whatever they were.<br/><br/>HOWEVER while you experience the above you spend the whole time wondering 'Why is this happening?' There is not enough context given to the story, during the film we learn how Will Smith ended up in a deserted New York due to this world destroying virus, but we see only New York and small snippets from his personal life that just leave an empty feeling really. <br/><br/>There is not enough depth to the story and little character development. There is no setting of the scene in the early parts of the film to help you relate to the character you are watching who has only a dog for company. It could give so much more to the viewer. <br/><br/>There could have been an extra hour so this movie. If you like Will Smith and good CGI see it. If you like a film that can tell a story clearly leaving you feeling fulfilled then give I am Legend a miss."
"gimme-junkmail","6","2","5","22 December 2007"," Good concept, bad casting
","Plot: action-packed, high on uncertainty, carries out previous notions of scary-zombies (as given by resident evil, 28 days later, etc.) very well. It IS predictable; however, if you love thrillers, I think you'll find it an OK way to spend 2 hours of your life.<br/><br/>Characters: My opinion is that the original written version identified quite an intriguing, mysterious main protagonist. However, since the decision to cast Will Smith, it turned into a more obnoxious obsession of grandeur - somehow, again, it becomes a 'The Will Smith Show' episode, in under 5 minutes. I can hardly identify the need to see Smith exercise in the front of the camera for over 5 minutes or his severe advertising campaigns (or intent to thrust an image of contemporary-retro to viewers), for example. Also, would've been nice to have given some depth to 'Ana' and 'Ethan'! <br/><br/>Filmography: Mostly good. Despite the 'subliminal' advertising, most shots are set in a correct atmosphere, and the music (or, lack of) adds to this well. There's always a set-back in attempting to recreate monsters via computer animation, but since their exposure is significantly reduced (at least for the first 3/4 of the film), it isn't a huge obstacle on viewers."
"hurricane_floyd","5","2","5","22 December 2007"," Good Ending Is Bad Compared To Original Story - Overrated
","This movie is somewhat overrated.<br/><br/>It throws unnecessary religious talk in really quick near the end.<br/><br/>In the end Neville is a hero, in the other renditions he is either more of a monster than the night people or a mix of the two.<br/><br/>The night people were mostly barbaric idiots in this version of the story, not so in the others.<br/><br/>The first 3/4 is fairly cool to watch, especially for a Will Smith fan.<br/><br/>I thought it could have been done more to the original novel. However people nowadays would probably not accept the ending.<br/><br/>Why did he not put a snare on the front/side of the Deer Hunter Mustang? Why did he not just run into a deer and break its leg, he had an unlimited number of cars at his disposal.<br/><br/>It sucks that the dog dies.<br/><br/>Yet another mediocre remake of a classic. A somewhat sad remake for a novel that is one of the main influences of modern horror (including Romero's Zombies which are the standard for the way we see zombies in modern times).<br/><br/>Actually there is one more thing ""The Last Man On Earth"" and "" The Omega Man"" diverged from the novels title as well as its story, THIS movie messes the story up and yet puts it under the original title."
"rj0900","8","2","5","21 December 2007"," Excellent movie, but...
","This is a great movie, don't get me wrong! Will Smith was perfect for this role, the story was strong and the street scenes were great. It's a very intense movie that will absolutely stay with us for years to come. Or longer. But it could have been better, so much better, richer and more memorable! Where are the scenes with the protagonist walking down the aisles of a supermarket or a Walmart, say, looking for food and supplies? Or browsing the shelves of some library, or a museum maybe or looking out over the city through a tall skyscraper window at sunset? How about picking out a new car or window shopping on the lonely streets? In other words, all the things people think of when they think of The Last Man On Earth. Because, as scary and lonely as it could be, there is still a part in every one of us that has thought about that kind of simplicity which draws us to these types of movies, especially as our lives grow ever more restrictive and frenetic. The kind of things that the best book of this genre, Earth Abides by George R. Stewart, supposes. True, this book was not based on that novel, and someone will likely point out that this isn't a pastoral story, but wouldn't moments like these, those we all think about when we imagine that kind of scenario, have been just as relevant in I Am Legend?"
"pauldrinovan","8","2","5","21 December 2007"," ""ok"" is the name
","It's the best movie made by will smith so far, the rest of the movies he made were purely commercial. The action is intense and keeps u pined to your chair. there are some minor mistakes in the script but the movie it's OK. the only major fault i can find is that its too short and the action does not have time to develop like it should.the creatures appear too little in the film. And the appearance of the mysterious savior is timed by ""god"". In one scene will appears prepared to sleep in the bathtub an in the next shot he wakes up from his bed, all this are minor things and do not ruin the action an the line of events. As an ending line the movie is a major hit for will s. and its a 8 out of 10 for me."
"lodewijkpollemans","3","2","5","20 December 2007"," Not exactly legendary
","Although I must admit I'm not really a big Will Smith fan, he is actually the only actor in this film who really shows he can act (even though the cast is small). The story-idea of this movie is clever, up to date, and thrilling, but in my humble opinion it was brought in the wrong way. Maybe it was the director or the writer's fault... I don't know, but somehow halfway into the film it descends into predictable, and tasteless Christian morality that will leave you with a big 'meh'-feeling.<br/><br/>The first part of this movie is pretty fun I must admit, although its just basic things like Will Smith talking to his dog or mannequins just to have someone to talk to. It actually sets the right vibe and atmosphere and that is pretty crucial in a heavy story about the human population that has been mostly annihilated. 'I Am Legend' never gets particularly humorous, but thats alright. Another thing that I noticed was that the CGI seemed a little overdone in some scenes.<br/><br/>Also, what is up with those 'shocks'? It isn't exactly scary, but more annoying. Ever had a guy snuck up behind you and blow a horn in your ear really loud? It's like that and it's not scary, but pretty annoying, especially after multiple times. And trust me when I say that this film contains plenty of attempts to get you on the ceiling. I wish some directors looked for real attempts to scare they'r audience instead of those senseless 'boo!'-scenes. It gets boring quickly, and let me add that I wasn't 'shocked' at any time during my stay in the theater.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the basic thing that ruins this movie is its ending. While I already saw the ending coming from miles away, it still is very lame and cheesy. Better yet; I wouldn't be surprised if most film-freaks or regular movie-watchers can predict the ending halfway into this movie. The producers should have looked more at good zombie-movies I think, like 'Dawn of the Dead' or '28 Days Later'. Then perhaps it wouldn't have turned out into the mixed bag it is now."
"Adorable","7","2","5","19 December 2007"," Stops short when it needs to get going
","This is one sad movie, but not because it deals with the end of the world, not in the least. It's practically tragic because for every good thing it gives, it takes in kind, and then some.<br/><br/>Look at the setup, which even starts off with a convincing visit by Emma Thompson. Apparently in this remake of the original novel a cure for cancer goes haywire, killing most of the world's population, leaving almost no survivors and turning most of the few that don't die off reduced to freakish zombie-like creatures that lurk in the dark and have a severe case of the angst.<br/><br/>Enter Colonel Neville, done by Will Smith. This guy's not exactly the everyman, but Smith's powerful depiction of him makes forgiving his all-capable bio a breeze. Neville, a military doctor and scientist, was part of the team possibly working on an antidote, but it is suggested he was also originally part of the problem.<br/><br/>Anyway, three years post-apocalypse, and Neville has Manhattan all to himself and his likable dog Sam (keep your eyes peeled for a canine twist later in the movie). The two roam about and even get DVD's at the local video store as viewers are introduced with care to the routine the pair have, based around Neville's impressive fortress.<br/><br/>Excellent setup overall as we said, made all the better thanks to Francis Lawrence's competent direction. There's some nice touches like Neville watching recorded TV to keep in touch with reality, a huge Superman/Batman poster basically telling us a crossover movie's coming for Xmas 2009 (when the world ended in this film), and Smith's overall very strong narration. He's not a reliable recounter, though, suffering from isolation fatigue and gradually losing his grip on what's real. Plus, backstory is given via well made flashbacks, although some of those are overly sentimental.<br/><br/>All of these are good points to keep in mind, as is the one really scary scene, but they're all gone when the bad starts rolling in.<br/><br/>First off, this flick has the worst CGI ever in a big budget production. I mean, projects with a tenth the money have done a hundred times better. We've seen original Xbox games with better graphics. The people responsible for drawing and animating I Am Legend's action visuals need to take a moment.<br/><br/>This applies mostly to Neville's protagonists, what used to be the brotherhood in the Heston incarnation. These guys are now brainless, raging hostiles straight out of 2004 Dawn of the Dead, only the older movie used actual extras whereas this one opts for painfully fake and amateurish pixilated varieties. This could have so easily been avoided: what's so hard about finding a couple hundred people to run around screaming? It's not like they didn't have the moola.<br/><br/>Certainly, most of the backdrops look good, in this area the graphics artists did well working their magic on depicting a de-populated NYC. But the pathetic action bits are simply inexcusable since by this juncture EVERYONE knows better.<br/><br/>Additionally, I Am Legend, for all its great setup and good direction work, falters towards the end with an overly rushed conclusion and a too-convenient ending, albeit one that's nice to believe possible.<br/><br/>This is why it's all so sad. Smith likely feels the same, having obviously given this project his best, which is quite good indeed. I Am Legend should be remade, which is probably exactly what's going to happen. In fact, you can almost tell where they cut out the juicy bits to warrant an R rated home video release later on, this time hopefully with real action extras rather than lame ""virtual actors"".<br/><br/>For I Am Legend a commercial rehash won't necessarily be a bad thing, as it stands it still has lots of story to tell."
"abtronic","5","2","5","19 December 2007"," Decent Will Smith, but vacuous story and inept special effects.
","How does Hollywood make tons of cash? Well, first off, you get a A-list star that publicly emits the good guy pheromone: Will Smith. Then you take a great sci-fi, apocalyptic narrative and strip all the excess fat and juicy details from it until you end up with a rail of its former self. Then you make sure that the narrative only has one main protagonist that needs to be paid reasonably. Make sure that your film heavily uses CG and blue screen. Now, you have this basic script with this A-list hero and weak special effects and you have I Am Legend.<br/><br/>All I have to say is that the basic movie-goer has no understanding of how or why they are getting ripped off. All they see is the pheromone ridden A-lister with his shirt off performing with a constant psychosis fervor and they are in heaven. They don't notice that the antagonists are without real back story, substance, or humanity. Why would an average movie-goer notice this? Now, considering I read a 10 year old draft of a much better version of this film, I feel completely cheated. 8.50 for a matinée. Damn, is it any reason people have stopped going to the movies. Even the most naive of movie-goer eventually figures out that movies are crap for the most part. They are product placement vehicles and absentminded gutter punk trash. No depth.<br/><br/>I want my depth. Did Will perform well? Yes. Did he earn his money? No. Why? He accepted the crappy script.<br/><br/>Anyone that thinks this is a quality film is probably 8-17 years old and doesn't have a clue of what a movie should be."
"CPeter-Karski","9","2","5","18 December 2007"," I think this was a great movie
","Without Spoiling too much, here are some of the great things about this movie: Acting was excellent. Although it was largely just Will Smith, he pulled off being terrified and a little crazy perfectly.<br/><br/>Strong story. So it wasn't really like the book. Who cares? The plot was surprisingly strong for a ""zombie movie"" (arguably they were vampires or just really really rabid, but the movie never says). The search for the cure is convincing and very reasonable for the most part.<br/><br/>Suspense and environment. I'm not just talking about CGI (which depending on how you feel was either good or bad). Everything from the camera angles to the cut scenes and well-conducted sound cues helped make this movie a real nail biter.<br/><br/>Zombies (or diseased) were deep characters. These were not mindless creatures, just diseased humans with wildly skewed priorities and IR-sensitivity that would make a pygmy seem tan. Kudos to the production for making the monsters an important part of the plot and character development.<br/><br/>Filmography in general. Every shot was very well set, with just enough shaky camera in certain scenes without overdoing it (Bourne). Positioning in frame, color balance was all artistically noted.<br/><br/>Symbols. This movie has a great deal of religious undertones through a deep set of symbols. I feel that this enhances the movie because (with the exception of Anna) the symbols are well integrated and inserted into the movie so that only after a close review will they truly be appreciated. This adds more depth to the film.<br/><br/>I would say this is one of the best movies of the year."

Some of the dialogues seem straight out of a B-movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are actually ordinary even pedestrian, scenes that come to mind are the lions and antelopes, and the often sub-standard rendering of the creatures and New York, im wondering how much will smith was paid that the film makers couldn't afford special effects that were at least 5 -7 years old.<br/><br/>The cinematography was good,but the shoddy special effects made a big dent on them, the camera was the grainy type that is very popular nowadays, but you have to see movies like 28 days later, to see what what real desolation is about and how a post-apocalyptic future looks like.<br/><br/>The tense were good, but far to predictable, the fact that there's one protagonist in the entire film had almost everything to do with, predictability was a major issue with this film right till the end.<br/><br/>The story is as old as the mountains and there was nothing new here, each and every aspect of this movie has been suggested before either in films or in print, ORIGINALITY IF NOT SOMETHING THIS FILM SCORES ANY POINTS ON.<br/><br/>The end to is very abrupt,fifteen minutes more would have been much appreciated, the end itself left a lot to be desired, some smart editing would have cut lots of the beginning and added more to the end, if there were issues with the length.<br/><br/>Despite all this you cant take away that many points from this film mainly because- 1)Will Smith has done a fine job regardless of just being there too much.<br/><br/>2)Many scenes although predictable do send your pulse racing.<br/><br/>3)Some of the drama is actually quite endearing although again predictable.<br/><br/>4)The action is decent and realistic, he may be like superman but he fights like a real person.<br/><br/>5)The movie is short and sweet and although the end feels very abrupt you appreciate the small feature length.<br/><br/>In all a decent movie thats far from being a legend for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>Watch with low expectations and you will come out satisfied, definitely doesn't have the blockbuster potential of say a transformers or Die Hard 4.0, please don't give into the Will Smith hype and the inflated ratings.<br/><br/>-s ending, SPECIAL EFFECTS, ORIGINALITY, PREDICTABILITY.<br/><br/>+/-s too much Will Smith??.<br/><br/>+s lots of tense scenes, fine acting, decent cinematography, small length.<br/><br/>Total 6/10 (met my confused but definitely lower expectations but didn't factor it in because of the already inflated ratings)."

","Everyone that I know that has seen this movie think I'm crazy for not liking it so much. It was like I Robot 2, except more boring. It was like mixing Cast Away with Silent Hill. I mean, it has its good parts, don't get me wrong. But I fell asleep quite often. Will Smith is a good actor as well, but his masterpiece will always be Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Like I said, a lot of my friends think I'm insane for not liking the movie, and I don't wanna spoil this movie for anyone, but I probably would have enjoyed Alvin and the Chipmunks better. Let's just face it, the best movies this year has to be either Superbad or Knocked Up! There hasn't been a great action thriller since Terminator 2!"

","I was really looking forward to this movie, zombies or vampires, whatever they were supposed to be, I was excited. But I have to say. This movie for lack of a better word was. Meh. Everything was way way too intense. Even the parts that didn't need to be. I found myself have cramps in my shoulders because it felt like something was going to pop out at any second, something that the movie go-er doesn't exactly want to feel for every minute of an hour and a half long movie. And even though the movie was short, I was bored for the first 45 minutes of it. Because I pretty much got that he was alone in NY. I didn't need to know much more than that. And the Special effects for the ""dark seekers"" were sub-par. Very much reminding me of the Imhotep in The Mummy, which I believe was a movie that came out in 1998, almost 10 years ago.<br/><br/>So basically when it comes to I Am Legend I say: Turn up the good, Turn down the suck! Turn down the suck now!"

The ""empty NYC"" was cool, but it could have been Racoon City for all it mattered; the viral-vampires was done much better in ""28 Days After""; the end-of-the-world was done much better in ""Children of Men"". No laughs. No thrills. No real emotion. Charleton Heston watching/singing-along-with the Woodstock movie in ""The Omega Man"" was real emotion. I felt his pain. ""I Am Legend"" has no pain.

"Ann991100","8","2","5","17 December 2007"," Good Movie
","I thought this movie was really good - I had no expectations, having never read the book and not having seen the previous movies, I didn't even know what it was about. I thought the suspense was awful (but good!) and sat clenched up for almost the entire movie. I thought the quietness and loneliness was very intense, I kept wanting to get up and go outside to take a break for a minute, but didn't want to miss anything. I appreciated that although it was a zombie/vampire movie, it didn't have bucket loads of gore in every scene AND was surprised that it was enjoyable on an intellectual level.<br/><br/>On the other hand, my husband loves gore and zombies and was disappointed that there wasn't more of it. He had really liked The Omega Man and thought I am Legend was not as good. But he did enjoy it, especially cinematography and scenes of New York and didn't think the zombies looked too bad. Part of me wanted a little more of the back story, too, but I appreciated the ""less is more"" aspect. I really don't like it when movies try to explain TOO much and then become really boring or have a bunch of gigantic plot holes. From reading the other reviews, the book sounds really good and I think I will read it. I would have given the movie 10/10 if the ending had been better, but it didn't really make any sense - religious beliefs, grenade, safe zone unrealistic, etc. The original book sounds like it would have been good enough to use as the movie's plot - but who knows why Hollywood does what it does. Ps Will Smith did a good job - I can't imagine many other ""popular"" actors of today doing as well - he was a good choice."

","When i first saw the trailer for this movie i was so excited. I thought Will Smith, sci-fi, how could it be bad right? I was wrong. This movie was uneventful for nearly the first hour but i have to admit it did build the suspense very well before we found out what was actually hunting Will Smith. After that it was all down hill. It became boring, depressing, and above all disappointing. I give it a 4/10 simply because the suspense built in the first 45 minutes to an hour of the movie. The only thing good about this movie was Will Smith who managed to keep me entertained even though he mostly shared the screen with a dog."
"SteakSalad_101","8","2","5","17 December 2007"," Fascinating and terrifying
","What happens when in modern times, a revolutionary, almost too-good-to-be-true solution to a life threatening, scary problem appears and seems to be the cure for everything that goes wrong? As if someone walked up to you one day and said ""Oh, hi, here's a magical box that if you keep it with you all the time, you will never be sick, never have problems, and have a long lasting life."" Would you still feel the same about your life and the people in it? And would you rely on this so much...that it would destroy you? What if that solution was the cure for cancer? ""I Am Legend"" is a fascinating, new post-apocalyptic thriller starring veteran actor Will Smith. When the cure for cancer is brought upon humanity, and the drug is administered to patients, hell breaks loose. A virus is created, that starts as side effects to the drug. One day in New York, the virus mutates and ends infecting everyone on the planet, with a 90% kill rate. The virus takes these people and transforms them into possessive zombie-like creatures that are deathly afraid of the light and come out at night to hunt for survivors of the virus.<br/><br/>Robert Neville, a brilliant scientist, is apparently the only survivor of this pandemic, being somehow completely immune to the mutated virus. He lives alone with his dog Samantha who is also immune to the air-borne strain of the virus only in New York City, which has been completely deserted. He sends out radio signals to search for other survivors while trying to maintain his sanity and test samples of the virus in his lab he has in his basement. Everything seems OK for him, from strolling the disturbingly empty, weed-ridden streets of Manhattan, driving golf balls from rooftops, and taking unrestricted tours of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br/><br/>Until the night comes. At his watch's beep, Neville bolts himself into his house to protect him and Samantha from what's out there--the remaining 90% of the world's population who want to infect Neville and Samantha. He mustn't be seen in the darkness to avoid the zombie/human creatures who watch his every move, waiting for him to slip up. As if this wasn't enough, Neville is plagued with dreams of the final moments of human civilization, when the aggressive decision is made to quarantine New York City, and the horrific death of his wife and daughter.<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking--that I Am Legend sounds like a corny, cheesy, over-used, washed up, unoriginal B-movie Hollywood pile of crap. I can assure you, it is far from that. The film is scientifically fascinating (even from a person who despises the thought of science class) and is like a window onto our own current society that where we're headed, trying to fix everything, can end in horrific situations. The images of post-day New York are extremely disturbing and horrifying, especially if you're familiar with the city as I am, from living in its metro area. Images of a blowing, dusty Times Square, complete with its usual screens and advertisements, except with cracks in the street, weeds growing out, and no people--something that anyone who's ever been to New York will tell you is simply impossible.<br/><br/>The movie seems to be two-faced. There is a dire, extremely thought provoking sense of caution and tensity throughout the film, even in the calm scenes, that inspires otherworldly levels of suspense. You can do anything you like in the Big Apple that is now 100% deserted--except go out at night. This makes the film both extremely entertaining, very fascinating to watch, and utterly terrifying.<br/><br/>Apart from all of that, ""I Am Legend"" is the scariest film I've seen all year. By far. And it's not everyday a PG-13 receives that reward. Not only the premise of being totally alone in a disturbingly deserted huge city that used to be home to over eight million, but in other ways as well. Unlike other zombie movies, which may you leave you laughing, ""I Am Legend"" has got the stuff to leave you shielding your eyes and shaking in fear. I know it had me scared out of my mind. Some of the scenes are extremely intense, grotesque, and the movie is jam-packed with utterly horrifying jump scenes that had my completely packed theater jumping out of their seats (and no, it wasn't just me). I could say that this movie is scarier than all four ""Saw"" films combined. Therefore--unless you can take a very scary movie, it might be a good idea to pass this one up. I feel sorry for those who saw it in IMAX. But if you can take the horror, get your tickets. If one movie this season deserves your ticket money, make it ""Legend."" The film is extremely well crafted and executed. Francis Lawrence delivers incredibly good direction and the editing is very well done, with horrifying flashbacks to a panicked New York, and makes the film that much more fascinating to watch. There is a strange sense of realism in the movie, something that'll make you think, ""Could this be where we're headed?"" Not in the sense of zombies, of course, but in other disasters. The only complaints I have with this film is the ending was much less than satisfactory, and in my taste, was a bit too clichéd. The second half of the film is still very good, but fails to deliver the tensity, horror, and strange fascination that the first half brings.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a way out of a bunch of dumb laughable zombie movies, and searching for one that actually scares the crap out of you, check out ""I Am Legend."" You may find yourself pleasantly surprised."
"ali_rg","9","2","5","17 December 2007"," It was a great movie
","It was a great movie. Will Smith did a great job! Specially in the saddest part of the movie, where I almost cried too. It really makes you care about the two main characters (him and his dog Sam). I would say it is his second best movie after ""The pursuit of happiness"". Even though there is just one character throughout most of the movie, it keeps you interested. Great scenes of a desolated New York. In some scenes the zombies don't look that real but it has good special effects overall. His daughter did a good enough job although she doesn't have that many scenes. It was worth what I paid to see it and I would definitely recommend it."
"pressboard","3","2","5","17 December 2007"," A Legendary Bore - But Popular
","After reading many of the reviews for this movie I realize again how outside the mainstream I tread. I did enjoy the views of an empty, abandoned NYC, which are always interesting. One scene was of a derelict Union Square subway entrance which was a block away from the theater and many moviegoers had just used - always good for a laugh. I am not sure I appreciated the superhuman carnivorous ""survivors"" of the virus, the leader of which reminded me of the demon in the Aphex Twins video ""Come to Daddy"". I watched I am Legend with my wife and a friend and we all thought it pretty much sucked (how's that for a pithy review?) I felt no emotional connection to Will Smith's character Rober Neville's family or the millions who had died. I felt no emotional connection to the survivors who go to the Vermont refuge. For so many people to have responded positively there must be something here but for me - I am still looking for Waldo. In 1954 Richard Matheson wrote ""I am Legend"" - The first movie adaptation had Vincent Price and was called ""The Last Man On Earth"" (1964). The second movie had Charleton Heston and was titled ""The Omega Man"" (1971) - This Will Smith movie is the third and only version sporting the original story title. My favorite remains the Vincent Price version - I re-watched it recently and it still holds up - I recommend it - but not the latest Will Smith vehicle."

","OK, i was so pumped for this movie was dancing with joy when i was in the car going to the theater. about a week earlier i had picked up a copy of the book I Am Legend, mostly because i heard the book was amazing and i just enjoy getting a head start. lets just say the book was one of the coolest things I've ever read, so READ THE BOOK sometime or another. the movie on the other hand go really against what the book wanted. the first part was great, showing how lonely new york really can be by yourself, but like everyone else said, the last 3rd was TERRIBLE!!!!!!! OTHER HUMANS??? GERNADES KILLING WILL SMITH>>>????!?!?!!??!?! a colony of humans???? WTF!!! not only does it go COMPLETELY against the book, its TERRIBLE!!! will smith is great, the dog is great, graphics great, but in the end, they took a GREAT book, idea, plan, dumbed it down to hour and half, and made shoot em up. oh, also, the ""creatures"" were just crazy CGI folks, and guess what, well the book they were actually intelligent that creature a new culture. and also the ending, as always, the book Neville becomes a legend because he is a vampire to this new society, but movie changes that also. I'm soooo frustrated because the movie had SOOOO much potential, and i really thought it had it, but of course not, the wrong people got a hold of it so it fell apart. see this movie, cause can be good, but don't read the book till AFTER you see the movie. oh, and when the chic comes in the movie, just leave, cause there really is nothing worth it after wards."
"zetes","7","2","5","16 December 2007"," It starts off pretty well, but then hobbles itself with its cliché baddies
","The latest cinematic adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel, and the first one to use its real name. The other two are The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price, and The Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston. Haven't seen the Price version yet, but The Omega Man is a sentimental favorite of mine. Cheesy and fun, loaded with the trappings of its time (1971). Lawrence's version is more serious-minded. He wants to make the audience feel what New York City would be like if you were the only person there. And he succeeds very well. It looks brilliant. Will Smith is capable as the only survivor in NYC. This is more of a horror flick than The Omega Man, and it works well as that. My biggest complaint, though, is that this film really rips off 28 Days Later. The mutants of I Am Legend are pretty much exactly the same as the rage infected people of that film, mostly mindless zombies who roar a lot and hunger for human blood (The Descent also came to mind a lot, especially with the aversion to light the baddies have). With the monsters seeming so much like they did in that one, and with the post-apocalyptic setting being pretty much exactly the same, it feels more like a remake of that than it does of The Omega Man. And frankly, 28 Days Later didn't need to be remade. Not so soon, anyway. Heck, the sequel to 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, did a much better job differentiating itself from its predecessor than this film does. Still, the film is quite entertaining, and one of the better blockbusters of the year."
"ferguson-6","4","2","5","16 December 2007"," Light Up the Darkness
","Greetings again from the darkness. Huge disappointment with no intelligence and only a modicum of style. Director Frances Lawrence has provided such previous gems as ""Constantine"" and a Britney Spears video, so I probably had unrealistic expectations.<br/><br/>Will Smith stars as Dr. Robert Neville who believes he is the last survivor and only hope for a cure of the massive virus that has either killed off or infected all of mankind. These aren't your father's zombies ... they have super strength, speed and agility ... and be careful (Mr. Neville) not to underestimate their aptitude.<br/><br/>Really can't come up with much good to say here as the film is all over the place and doesn't provide much of a study of solitude or genius ... and even the clashes are pretty mild (but loud). Alice Braga (niece of the great Sonia Braga) has a key role, but even that is anti-climatic.<br/><br/>There are many better zombie movies, numerous more creative special effects movies, and for better solitude, check out ""The Omega Man"" or ""Cast Away""."

I just have one thing that bugs me about it, it leaves to many unanswered questions. Now if there was or is a sequel then that is alright but I doubt there will be but we never know. I am recommending this to anyone who is ready for excitement and to be thrilled because it is amazing at doing just that. I do not recommend it for children under 13 because this like some other pg-13 movies has a great chance of having been rated R a few years ago. So don't bring kids younger than 13 unless you are positive they can handle the suspense. But be sure that if you are not frightened easily that you do go see it. I am 13 myself and hope that this post was useful for you parents and others as well."

","First off, i was looking forward to this movie a great deal. It was hyped quite a bit, and being a will smith fan (but an even bigger zombie movie fan) i decided to see it on opening night. The movie starts slow, showing the audience basically what we saw in the trailers: will smith wandering around the deserted NYC with his dog Sam. The film continues at a slow pace slowly revealing more information about the creepy 'dark-seeking' villains as well as the series of events that led to this situation. Essentially, the movie turns into Castaway on Manhattan + a toned down zombie movie, with a rushed end and poor final message.<br/><br/>granted, very few movies can be 'better' than their original book, but this was a long shot off. <br/><br/>*Spoilers* my recipe to make this movie better:<br/><br/>+ zombie killing (at least triple the kill count) + at least one shotgun + more variation of Bob Marley songs - PG-13 rating - obviousness of religious connotations at the end"

This current movie looked like a cheep take-off of the 28 days camp, but not as well done.

Other than that the movies is a little flat and surprisingly boring. Not much in terms of action scenes until the finale. Will Smith is good in the role but he does so many dumb things that you wonder how he could have survived so long. But I guess he is supposed be at the end of his rope and basically given up. But man at least an army soldier should know how to hunt and what is a trap. I enjoyed Francis Lawrences' Constantine and he continues to impress but the movie needed a smarter script and a little more action. Hey what do you expect when the movies is co-written by one of the worst writers in the HISTORY of films Akiva Goldman aka Batman and Robin (need I say more). Some people might say the the movie is too short but i liked the 100 minute run time especially since the movie lacked a concentrated narrative to push it forward. Great first 1/3 of the movie which sets up the story, great views of nyc and good job by Smith and loved, loved the dog, Sam.<br/><br/>But only okay movie from Richard Matheson's novel. I didn't mind the changes from Matheson's novel, especially the depressing ending of the book, but give the story more umph, not less. <br/><br/>The plot reminded me of how in NJ they are trying to force all school age kids to get flu vaccine.

"BloodStone","8","2","5","14 December 2007"," Better than I expected.........
","""I am Legend"" is actually (I really hate to say this being a HUGE Vincent Price fan) better than ""Last Man On Earth.'Legend' is very reminisent of 28 Weeks Later & ""The Descent"" in regards to the appearance & mannerisms of the sub-human beings who dwell in the darkness. The air-born plague in Legend is also very similar to 'The Rage Virus' of the 28 Days/Weeks films in that these sub-humanoids are as violent & unrelenting. They are NOT the shambling weaklings of director Ubaldo Ragona's 1964 film (which in turn asks the question; why aren't they given their present situation?). I am Legend does contain a fair amount of suspense with very little to no blood or gore. And I fear that will be it's undoing at the box office because Legend's two recent predecessors ""28 Weeks Later"" & ""The Descent"" had more than their fair share of the crimson goo. Irregardless, I am Legend is still a very good (albeit not an original) film, with a very solid performance by Will Smith who plays Colonel Dr. Robert Neville (this is what now, the 3rd time Will Smith cinematically tries to save the world). However, I wouldn't be surprised if Will Smith doesn't pick up his second Oscar nomination for his performance in this film. *Note; I have not read the novel by author Richard Mattheson so I do not know how the film compares to its' literary counterpart.<br/><br/>BloodStone's Recommendation: I am Legend is a good film & one worth buying a ticket for.<br/><br/>BloodStone's Rating: 8 out of 10"

I stayed after watching a move to see a special Midnight screening that my cousin, friend and I couldn't pass. This film surely will have you guessing towards the end and it is something you can't keep thinking about, because it is just that good! Will Smith's performance was brilliance from beginning to end! He shows leadership in and each and every aspect from during the effect and afterward. I loved how his objective was to protect and find a cure even if it kills him! It seems as if his abilities as an actor only gets better and better making ongoing progress. The special effects weren't extreme but just enough to give the mind suspense and imagination ! Very impressive how a city was once so full of life be dead, but still amazing. This film keeps NYC as The number city that was made for films! After watching this movie you would definitely ask yourself, ""What if that was me"" ? The language wasn't extreme, it shows affection and companionship .

I am actually a bit disappointed about the end, but I still highly recommend the movie! Go to the theater instead of watching a DVD. It is with a little horror used to intensify the atmosphere. A good thing is that there was nearly no laugh during the movie although the theater is full. Not like what happened when I went there to watch --The Mist--, where a horror movie turned to be a comedy.<br/><br/>A REMINDER! Actually the story is exactly the same as 30 days of night.

The acting was horrid. Please do not waste your time and money on this garbage. I am upset with Will Smith's performance to say the least. It is hard to believe he would endorse a title such as this. I have never before been even remotely upset with a performance by Will. I have to say that now, I would rather eat a bullet than watch that filth again. Please consider that a good film must include at least two of these things: 1. good acting 2. good suspense 3. good cinematography 4. good music 5. good script 6. entertainment I pity the soul of any person that enjoys such trash."

","At first, I thought that this movie would be fantastic, but actually It was a disappointment. I was nice surprised to see Will Smith as ""Robert Neville. But he was too predictable, and he was doing what you wanted him to do. He brings no depth or personality to the character at all. He was just a body with some emotions for color. As for the other actors.......well, they are mostly creatures. The woman was tragic. No emotions, no performance, just reciting some words. I do not know why, Hollywood thinks that special effects will make a good story every time. Like a video game, imagery has become the stimulus. It was interesting to see Manhattan deserted, but my opinion is that the special effects were the pillar that the movie was relying on. If you take them away, there will be nothing left. The first 30 minutes are great, but after them is nothing Â– no script, no emotions, just running and some scenes out of their content. There were nothing as character or story development, no explanations about the plague and the cureÂ…NOTHING!!!!! The movie leave me with a bad taste in my mouth and with a lot of unanswered questions...To expect everything and to see nothing is may be the movie' s advertisement."

","I Am Legend is to me, the best movie of 2007. It should be nominated for the Oscars, and win even more than The Departed did last year. I haven't seen The Omega Man or the other previous movies based on the book, so unfortunately, I cannot compare this movie with the other adaptations. Will Smith is very good in this film, the mutant-vampires freaked me out and the plot is very good. What can you ask more? I also liked the ending (Spoiler: Neville's sacrifice for Anna and Ethan). The other actors were very good also. The film cost nearly 150 000 000$, and now I know why. The movie is pretty good for kids at least over 10 years old, or mature enough to watch the movie. I guess the MPAA had to give it a PG-13 rating, because they certainly couldn't give it a PG rating. Probably the best film ever, but it is now officially the best film of 2007!"

"CineCritic2517","7","2","6","22 December 2007"," Just don't expect Shakespeare people..
","The 7 I'm giving to Will Smith's latest entry should be regarded a relative voting considering this genre of films. Standing on its own the film just lacks too many ingredients for such a high voting. <br/><br/>Will Smith gives another Will Smith performance in a movie which's theme has been done to death so many times that even the undead would have a field-day with it. Yet when one would simply switch of the mind, maybe drink a few beers prior to watching it, one could have a good time. I know I did.<br/><br/>'Legend' is more or less one big string of clichÃ©s neatly tied up by very passable CGI. The story has so much in common with films like 'War of the Worlds' and '28 Days Later', to name but a few, that it almost becomes a spoof.<br/><br/>Still I regard it a very decent what-you-see-is-what-you-get sort of film which at least didn't suffer from cringeworthy dialog like in 'Transformers', a pompous tone like in 'Children of Men', sheer boredom like in '28 days Later' or horribly annoying characters like in 'War of the Worlds'.<br/><br/>7/10"
"elf_1001","3","2","6","15 December 2007"," Ridiculous
","I usually do not go to horror movies, but I decided to view this one because promised more than this.<br/><br/>And it actually delivered less than a well done horror movie.<br/><br/>I'll just list several of the mistakes that made this movie ridiculous: 1. when Neville (Will Smith) injects the cure into the captured mutant, it takes only few seconds to see the effect, which is impossible. That cure had genetic re-writing at its base, so it is not possible to be visible in a matter of seconds. Why didn't they choose to see the effect a day later? 2. the mutants first are said (and shown) to have lost any human characteristic, but then they prove to be very organized. They even know how to set elaborate traps and they have dogs, even though they communicate only via screams.<br/><br/>3. the heads of mutants must have been made of titanium. Only two of them are able roll a fully geared SUV. They smash special protection glasses with no scratch.<br/><br/>4. they move at incredible speeds, climb buildings as if are spiders, have amazing muscular force, how did they get all these? This movie was supposed to be realistic, not a pathetic post-apocalyptic story about spider men.<br/><br/>5. they have a very increased metabolism, which means that actually they had to eat all the time. nothing is left in NY after 3 years, but they're thriving. In reality, such animals wouldn't have survived one winter.<br/><br/>And the list goes on and on. I gave 3/10 for Will Smith and the dog. Otherwise, the movie cannot be rated."
"charchuk","5","2","6","15 December 2007"," A thematic adaptation ruined by the third act
","I was rather pleasantly surprised for at least the first 2/3. Though it's terribly unfaithful to the novel, and that bugged me at times (mostly in regards to the creatures and the ending - it didn't matter that the location was changed), it still manages to take some of the key themes and elements from the story and craft its own tale. The third act trails off into convention and clichÃ©, though, and the happy ending is completely at odds with the book, so it's not a perfect movie, but it is a damn good one and a very powerful one to boot.<br/><br/>Most of this is because of Smith's performance. Without seeing either of his Oscar-nominated roles, I think this is his best work to date. For much of the movie, he completely and utterly owns the screen, simultaneously making us laugh and cry, while never straying into overacting or self-parody. Even scenes that could be funny (and sometimes were, to some people), like talking to mannequins, he infuses with a sense of realism and seriousness that makes us believe in the character. Though his final act turn is predictable and corny, Smith makes the character, as a whole, relatable and likable, if a bit too perfect. It's really a remarkable performance.<br/><br/>As such, the rest of the film has trouble keeping up. The direction is impressive, never really being overly flashy while still adding a touch of style to the piece. The suspense is built up immensely at times and the action isn't overused until the finish. The production design and visual effects are fairly impressive; it's stunning to see the deserted city, but the creatures needed work and should have been left as 'normal' vampires. And the story, while straying from the novel, stays relatively strong until the third act, where all logic and reason is thrown out the window.<br/><br/>The problem with this third act is the gaping plot holes that open up. Who sets the trap that leads to Smith being captured? How do the other survivors rescue him? How have they survived for so long? How is there a camp set up? The film really does away with all of these questions and just goes for an action-packed, thrilling, and emotionally-charged finish. It's a far cry from the psychologically dark and disturbing ending of the book, and it's really a disappointment. It's too bad, because most of the film is nearly flawless.<br/><br/>As I said, the differences from the novel really didn't bother me, though I think the creatures should have been made into real vampires instead of some super-strong mutant things. Neville's psychological breakdown is there (a bit), his scientific work is there, and his dark past (brought about fantastically in flashbacks) is there. For the most part, the film manages to keep the message of the novel intact, even if it completely botches the ending."

","There is no joy in crazy town.
How appropriate it is now that we have a virus in 2020 that is running the same path as what this one in this movie is. Tragic, sad and melancholy. I believe Will Smith was channeling Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""End of Days"" because the ultimate sacrifice doesn't necessarily pay off.<br/><br/>In the case of Will Smith, something about him bugs me. He can never be...uncool. Even when he's doing a sing-a-long with ""Shrek"" he's still...that cool dude. Then when he attempts to show vulnerable, he is still trying to be cool. In that attempt at retribution scene with a car. By the way, it was his stupidity that got his dog killed. And also that got all those people killed. But he sort of owns up to it. It seems Will Smith's name got it made.<br/><br/>There was so much more fun to be had in ""Omega Man."" He understood the fun of being the last guy on Earth. He didn't fearfully tread through life but accepted it. Charlton Heston understood this. And he was cool. Will Smith is also a doctor in this. Sure. If he's a doctor, I'm an astronaut.<br/><br/>So so many questions. Like he created a fortress of metal, bolted railed sliding doors. Uh-huh. Where? From Home Depot? His house...have you seen a bigger house in NYC from a doctor's salary? What did he do? Sell Russian secrets. That basement alone. A grenade takes out every one of the monsters in a basement. It's a grenade.<br/><br/>This is just a boring sad flick. Good for quarantined life, if you want to create more panicked nonsense (this site censors thoughts) in your mind.
Monsters look cheap. CGI cheap.
This was a colossal mess."

","Hmm, its a hard movie to review without spoiling it, but i wanted to try and give it a review, since for a change i am not strongly feeling one way or the other about this movies.<br/><br/>First of all, i'm not really a Will Smith fan, so the fact that Will Smith is acting in this movie does not move the rating any higher in my case.<br/><br/>It is one of them ""end of the world, scenario"" movies, and i understood that it is based on some book? might be interesting read, as was the first half of this movie.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the movie too much, we have this guy Neville ( a scientist ) who seems to be the last man alive, somehow immune to the outbreak virus which got everyone else infected, we also have the real star of the movie - he's dog Sam, the first half goes on with him and sammy exploring the apocalyptic world and trying to find sings of life, and come up with a cure to the virus... The danger creeps in the dark, as the zombies seem to be afraid of light.<br/><br/>I don't know why they chose to use CGI for the zombies, they had better effects in the 1985's movie ""Fright Night"" so i can't figure how do the zombies look like cheap video game enemies planted on a movie at 2007.<br/><br/>Here is a serious spoiler, but if you have seen the movie or just don't care, about the second half:<br/><br/>The dog dies, it is sad but also frustrating because now the movies dies too, this only proves that the dog was the true star of the movies. Now Will's character loses he's mind cries to some mannequins and tries to kill himself. But suddenly some woman and a kid appear to save him, in this ""deus ex machina"" moment... But okay, its a movies, movies have deus ex machinae.<br/><br/>What really bothers me is that now that Neville finally did find someone, he is so messed up that he is getting rage fits over some old bacon, and being depressed in general - i mean, c'mon wouldn't he be thrilled to see other humans that he has been looking for? well, then there is some awkward moment when the kid watches Shrek on he's moment and Neville speaks the lines... Ok ? there is also some forced babble about Bob Marley wanting to ""cure people of racism"" just like ""he wants to find a cure for the zombies"" a promising (first half) of the movie turned into some awkward mess IMO, and they seem to know it as now it is going to end soon!<br/><br/>Its easy to guess what is going to happen next, the zombies attack to the house... They go to the basement with the live test subject (zombie) who the ""Alfa zombie"" and he's crew were apparently looking for...<br/><br/>they get behind the armour glass (Or panzer glass whatever it is called in english) with the zombie that seems to be getting cured? , Neville gets some flash backs inspired by the woman's neck tattoo and start believing in god...Takes some of the zombie's cured blood gives it to the woman who goes hiding inside the wall and blows up himself - End of the story.<br/><br/>( Or almost the end, then they show this clip of the woman finding the ""refuge"" place )<br/><br/>It is not bad for a Will Smith movie (like i said not really a fan) but it could have been a lot better, if they had not messed up the second half, and if they made the zombies look better instead of using cheap computer graphics.<br/><br/>6/10. The dog was very well trained."

"sol-","Null","1","2","7 October 2017"," Last Man Standing
","Inspired by the same source material as 'The Last Man on Earth' and 'The Omega Man', this third big screen adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel sits somewhere between its predecessors in quality. The positives include graphic special effects, a touching relationship between the protagonist and his dog, which he has come to see as a surrogate child in lieu of his own deceased one, and some genuinely creepy moments (following his dog into a dark building). The film also provides an impressive portrait of a desolate metropolis in ruins, with overgrown grass and escaped zoo animals wandering the streets. There is additionally quite a bit to like in how much time elapses (around half an hour) before we even glimpse the zombie/vampire creatures. The second half of the film is nowhere near as effective as the build-up to it though. There are some particular dull moments as two new characters are introduced that allow the protagonist to reflect on his existence. His flashbacks are also less haunting here than those in 'The Last Man on Earth' and the film abandons the memorable ending of the 60s version for something far more sentimental if not necessarily upbeat. All things considered though, Will Smith is quite effective in the lead role, and it would have been interesting to see an entire film dedicated to his friendship with his canine companion."

","In 2009, a doctor named Alice Krippin (an unbilled Emma Thompson) develops what is supposedly a miracle cure for cancer. However, this so called ""cure"" leads to an outbreak of a new disease that turns victims into photosensitive ghouls. Three years later, a lone military doctor named Robert Neville (Will Smith) seems to be the last human standing in a devastated, post apocalyptic NYC. His only companion is his faithful dog Sam (played by ""Abbey"" and ""Kona""), while he avoids the creatures known as ""the dark seekers"" and determinedly tries to find a cure for this plague.<br/><br/>The third official screen adaptation of Richard Mathesons' novel ""I am Legend"" is the first one to use that title, after ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) and ""The Omega Man"" (1971). Also drawing inspiration from the screenplay for ""The Omega Man"", it's an acceptable horror- action mash up that works quite well for about two thirds of the running time. When it's mostly just Will and the dog(s), it's rather moving in its depiction of loneliness as well as devotion to mans' best friend. (There's also a theme here of rediscovering ones' faith.) The production design (by Naomi Shohan) and cinematography (by Andrew Lesnie) are first rate, in addition to the pretty convincing creation of an utterly desolate NYC. There's one powerful suspense sequence that sees Neville and Sam trapped inside a dark building. It also draws a lot from the screen presence and believability of Smith, who delivers a very affecting performance. Those dogs are wonderful, too.<br/><br/>However, as it starts turning into a much more conventional action flick, it becomes decidedly less interesting. The dark seekers themselves are standard CGI / motion capture monsters, and while some people may enjoy the visceral thrills of various lively moments, there's simply not that much threat to be had from these things, except for an ""Alpha Male"" (Dash Mihok), who's more aggressive than most of them. Overall, they're a pretty mindless horde.<br/><br/>Reasonably entertaining, but it sure doesn't reach its full potential. Say what you will about ""The Omega Man"" - at least the antagonists there had some personality.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"SteveResin","6","1","2","7 September 2015"," Nowhere Near Legendary
","Sadly, yet again we get an adaptation of I Am Legend that fails to remain faithful to the book and instead panders to audience expectations and demands for happy endings. That's not to say this a bad movie, it's a perfectly decent way to waste a couple of hours. Then again, it's not a truly great movie either, and is definitely a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>The good parts start with the set up, which sees a scientist create a virus that is curing people from cancer. Unfortunately it mutates with time and ends up infecting almost everybody on earth, turning them into crazed sun-fearing maniacs. Will Smith seems to be one of the few who are immune and unaffected and spends his days trying to survive in a desolate New York, which looks great on screen with it's empty and litter strewn streets. Smith is largely excellent and his relationship with his faithful dog is a highlight of the film.<br/><br/>The bad is the CGI of the infected. They don't look remotely convincing, more akin to something from a video game and are a huge distraction every time they appear. They take you out of the experience because they look so awful.<br/><br/>Another major flaw is the decision to completely ignore the book's ending and have Smith discover he's not alone and there is a community of survivors he can join. Happy ending again. This is hugely annoying to fans of the book because the whole point of the title I Am Legend is the realization that he is indeed the last human on earth, and therefore has become an almost mythical creature in the eyes of the infected, who now possess the earth. The fact he survives and discovers others like him totally negates the title of the movie. It should have been called I Am Not Legend."

Literally everything else was disappointing, from the SFX to the script, to the cursory treatment of some potentially intriguing questions (left completely unanswered).<br/><br/>I only see this working as a post-apocalyptic zombie flick, and where those are concerned, you're better off watching something like 28 Days Later, unless you're an undying fan of Will Smith, or an undying fan of the undead."

Sadly the combination of a Science Fiction theme & the word 'God' immediately disqualified him from a well-deserved Oscar Best Actor nomination owing to the minutiae various self-styled intelligentsia dredged up to justify slamming the film.<br/><br/>After reading 'I Am Legend' & seeing 'Omega Man' both when released and more recently, Smith's 'Legend' makes a statement all its own & it's a statement that some worked to dismiss out-of-hand (such as those who nominate for Academy Awards & Popular Mechanics(!), the latter not exactly a Top Ten arbiter for excellence in film).<br/><br/>The biggest complaints are absurd: ""this isn't the book"". Of course not, it's a film *based* on the book. The ""retrovirus is impossible"". Not a retrovirus, pay attention: it's mutated Paramyxovirus & could indeed spread just that quickly (Ebola, anyone?). Last, someone claimed 'God' spoke to them bringing the three letter word into an *SF film* - heresy!! - even though Neville's response is an interesting comment about Science & 'God'.<br/><br/>Smith's performance elevates this film to a Must See - I *believed* it from the start. Neville is a man who makes mistakes, who by this point is hanging on to his sanity & his will to persist by his fingernails: far more than a science fiction action flick this is a film about humanity & a man driven to not give up on it.<br/><br/>How odd that some SF fans want to trash this film because it mentions the God word. Einstein be damned, film S/F has turned into the art form where science *must* ignore any aspect of faith, unless to it is stand in arrogant denial of any philosophical statement that doesn't have a formula for proof even if those disdaining such have only a Discovery Channel appreciation for any of the sciences. Film S/F seems to have turned itself into Science Fundamentalism, an equally narrow-minded approach to the massiveness of the universe."
"alindsay-al","7","1","2","18 July 2015"," a good survival film with an awesome lead performance
","I just got this film on blu Ray so I decided to watch it and I must say that this is a decent survivor film with some positive things about it. The premise of this film sees one survivor of a disease living in New York city trying to find a cure while trying to survive the zombies and the craziness of the situation. Now I am a pretty big fan of will Smith but I think this is one of the best performances I have ever seen from him and possibly Oscar worthy. Honestly what I liked was that for the majority of the film he didn't play the character that he is known for but he was clearly a damaged guy and you felt for him as his life has been taken away from him. He delivers a really powerful performance that really shows in a certain dramatic scene that really has you feeling sympathetic for him and sad yourself. Now this is a one man show but there are a couple of support in characters that turn up in the film but they really aren't important and you know nothing about them and won't care one bit. The story is good, I mean along with those heartwrenching scenes you really feel like this is a realistic take on how New York would look like if it had been deserted and you see him trying to live a life and it makes you feel empathetic for his character. However, the film takes a twist in its tone and it ends up feeling a bit like a simplistic horror movie that didn't have anything unique about it which is a shame. The script has some great moments, the drama is done superbly and it really is at its best when it sticks to the tone of loneliness and emptiness. But like the story when it tries to be a bit more funny and have a bit more cliché writing it takes away from the films overall grit. The style of the film is great, as I mentioned before I really liked the look of new York in a post apocalyptic environment. All the action scenes were done well down to good cinematography and the zombies looked really cool which is a positive. Overall this is a good film but it does have some flaws that need to be addressed."

","Will Smith shocked the heck out of me by taking a role that would seem to be an eye-roller, but turned out to be a heart-pounding burst of energy of a movie. ""I Am Legend"" is not only emotionally powerful causing tears to roll down your cheeks, but a lonely adventure of one man's incredible and desolate situation. Years after a plague kills most of humanity and transforms the rest into monsters, Will Smith in New York City struggles valiantly to find a cure while struggling to survive from the infected creatures that come out at night. With his only companion being a magnificent German Shepherd, we see the stress and isolation way down on this brave characters. Director Francis Lawrence plays with you mentally as he adds super-cool action sequences and provokes your mind with unpredictable flashes of terror and peril. Through gripping and terrifying chase scenes that feel authentic, and stunning cinematography and editing, ""I Am Legend"" proves sci-fi can have meaning and can hurt like a kick in the face. Will Smith gives a dynamite performance that shows the soul of a man. The flashbacks are relevant and emotional, the production design is jaw-dropping... there really isn't a bad thing to say about this blockbuster."

The film does a great job at displaying a man's struggle to find hope after losing his family. There were moments were I was on the edge of my seat, hoping and even crying.

","I'm giving this movie a 2 star review instead of 1 star because I have seen The Wicker Man, and if you have seen that disaster of a movie you know every other movie has to be at least a little bit better.<br/><br/>I Am Legend came out as a typical, boring Hollywood movie. The story was just like every other 'pandemic' style movie we have seen in the past years - a mysterious virus is infecting everyone and no one knows what to do. Will Smith plays the typical 'Hollywood hero' and the movie follows the typical 'oh humanity is screwed but we have hope and that's why we're awesome' plug.<br/><br/>The movie is 'based' on the short story by the same name by Richard Matheson. But the only correlation between the two is the title. I can typically look beyond my love for a book to evaluate a movie on its own and judge whether it has a leg to stand on, but I Am Legend offers nothing.<br/><br/>Save 101 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie. Instead, find the short story of I Am Legend by Richard Matheson and read it. Reading the story will take the same amount of time or less and you will love it!"
"paul_haakonsen","6","1","2","24 April 2014"," Adequate movie, but lacking something vital...
","""I Am Legend"" is interesting enough in itself, because of the plot line. Humanity is all but extinct, and a lone survivor in New York is desperately trying to reach out to other survivors, while he is also working to find a cure against a cure for cancer that turned out to be a blessing in disguise as it turned people into ravenous maniacs.<br/><br/>The storyline is good and captivating, and it is helped nicely along by the cinematography and visually impressive scenes throughout the movie. And the acting in the movie, despite it mostly being only Will Smith, was adequate and appropriate to the movie.<br/><br/>However, everything is not grand and great in ""I Am Legend"". The CGI effects for the infected people was laughable and horrible. They looked really awful and fake, and that severely cut the movie short. So if you were infected with the KV infection you turn into a poorly animated person that is capable of lowering your jaw to inhumanly proportions? It was just ridiculous.<br/><br/>While running at about 101 minutes, then the movie passes by quickly. A bit too fast actually, and the movie feels very short, especially because it also leaves too many unfinished ends and unanswered questions. And director Francis Lawrence brushed over the events that occurred with Neville's family too quick and without offering any proper insight into the events. That was a shame, because it would have added a more detailed dimension to the movie.<br/><br/>If you sit down to watch ""I Am Legend"" and hoping it will be a zombie movie, then you are in for a sore surprise. The infected in this movie are fast, agile, and capable of scaling the side of a building with no problem, but like vampires they are hurt by the UV rays of sunlight. Yeah, it was just a little bit too out there.<br/><br/>But if you want a movie that is nicely shot, nicely directed and does have a good storyline (if you can look past the horrible CGI creatures), then ""I Am Legend"" does deliver. While the movie is entertaining, it offers nothing challenging for anyone with a working mind in the audience. Just unhook your brain and sit back for a fun ride and try not to laugh too hard at the horribly animated CGI creatures."
"ALauff","7","1","2","1 April 2014"," Satisfying blockbuster
","Despite a final act that isn't quite up to par, this is one of the most satisfying blockbusters in recent memory. A supposed miracle cure for cancer has wiped out Earth's population, except for scientist/soldier Robert Neville (Will Smith), who's immune to the virus, and a genetically mutated species of ""darkness seekers,"" hairless vampire-zombies that roam free at night. The best sections of the movie simply document Smith and his German shepherd passing the time in a deserted New York City, hunting deer on the barren streets, hitting golf balls from the wings of fighter jets, and checking out videos from the local shop. The eeriness of being the last human in a city built to sustain a population of millions is acutely evoked, allowing us to absorb the situation's enormity through long takes, panoramic shots that dwarf Smith in his environment, absence of music, and the absolutely brilliant integration of production design (shot on location) and special effects to present a hollowed-out metropolis littered with empty cars, wild animals, and buildings submerged in water (seeing this in IMAX increased my appreciation tenfold). Reminiscent of the abandoned London in 28 Days Later, yet it doesn't feel derivative in the slightest. By the time the story opens, Smith has already developed a routine and familiarity with his surroundings, so we're watching a man who has fashioned a degree of normality from chaos, which is strangely more unsettling than if we were to witness him waking up to a changed world. Smith is altogether fantastic portraying a man of active intelligence whose faith in finding a cure slowly crumbles due to tragedies that consume his soul and all-consuming loneliness (his complete meltdown in a video store is a lesson in how to show turning-point despair without going over the top). The dog playing his companion Sam deserves a large degree of credit as well, essentially standing in for Smith's daughter—a metaphor completed by the daughter handing the puppy off before departing—and making the human-dog interactions touching and indelibly sad; it reminded me, in a small way, of how the adults in Children of Men kept trinkets and dolls to help them remember and to assuage their loss.<br/><br/>However, the film isn't just a poignant character study: Lawrence delivers skillful suspense in Smith's daylight encounter with a pitch-black zombie hovel that relies more on anticipation than effect. At the beginning of this review, I mentioned that I was somewhat disappointed with the ending. The movie works so well as an isolated survivor tale that the introduction of a mother and son from a Vermont colony felt like an unwelcome intrusion (it doesn't help that their characterizations are perfunctory compared to Smith's three-dimensional one). Then, the film imparts an element of religious faith that at first appears forced, but leads to Smith's last mortal act that is more hopeless and despairing the more one reflects upon it. Although the God-fearing mother's voice-over ends the movie on an optimistic note, consider two things: the futile look Smith gives the uncomprehending, glass-bashing zombie when Smith realizes the sick don't want to be cured; and, therefore, for whom is the new vaccine intended if not for the sick? If the already immune possess the cure, then what purpose does its existence serve? Factoring in the challenges to the audience represented by the minimalist, experiential narrative, and the emphasis on observation rather than visceral force, the irony present in the seemingly clean wrap-up seems like one more challenge to look beyond the obvious. Even if not entirely successful, I'm grateful for the attempt."

I read on the internet and found that there are two endings, the one that was originally released on the big screen and the other on DVD/ Blu ray, the one which was released on the big screen was a little bit decent for such a movie and make more sense. the one on DVD is disappointing and I think it was made commercially.

","This movie could have been really a great work. Will Snith IS a superb actor, and he can save almost any poor script, but here there are many weak spots, and generally, the movie is very predictable, so even great Will cannot help it. The movie is shot well, that is what I gave it a 5, special effects are very decent, and empty New York really seems grand. The doggy is a real cute, and she saves most of the weaker spots with her genuine canine simplicity. Yes, this is all good. But then, the zombies. Did we see them all before? Sure, we did. And many times and in many similar films. They run, eat, roar, howl, yell, yelp and scream. They are ghouls, real monsters. This is all good, too. But not fresh and not original in any sense. We saw it all before. We can easily predict what will happen soon and who will die. Well, if you want a better zombie movie, try Resident Evil, Part 1 - this is really a better take on the topic of flesh eaters. So, the conclusion? Not bad, but not so great or fresh"

"PlugInYourBrain","6","1","2","3 May 2013"," I like the dog
","There are too many loose threads. Why does Neville (Will Smith) have one-man bio-lab in the basement of his New York Apartment building? He says 1% of the world's population are like him immune. Wouldn't it make sense to go to a secure government lab with other immune scientists guarded by immune soldiers? They could work a lot faster together. He keeps telling the audience he can't leave New York because it is ground zero, but British scientist Krippen (Emma Thomson) said she did 10,009 cancer clinical trials using the virus. Were they all in New York?<br/><br/>This film is based on an excellent book which spawned two other film versions. The most famous of these is ""Omega Man"" panned for being unfaithful to the book, but Heston's Neville clearly was going mad from loneliness. You could feel his despair. Smith's Neville on the other hand has a sweet dog and they seem pretty happy together.<br/><br/>Things change halfway through when the dog dies. Some viewers are really offended by this: Kill six billion people. Fine. It's just a movie. Kill a dog. OMG l'horreur! It's actually a very touching scene. Now if only the rest of the movie was like this.<br/><br/>But after this it makes even less sense. A girl and boy find him and somehow rescue him from a huge mob of zombies. We don't see how this happens. One moment Alpha zombie has his jaws around Neville's throat. Crash cut to Nevile waking up in his apartment to the smell of bacon and eggs.<br/><br/>Smith doesn't seem right for the role. He's convincing in the physical and military roles he plays, but putting on a white lab coat doesn't turn him a scientist. He's missing that spark of curiosity and geekiness that every scientist has. His humor, singing Bob Marley, classic Will Smith, doesn't work here. His real-life son has a cameo but the dialog isn't convincing: Kids don't talk like that, and it's hard to take a kid in dreadlocks seriously. In another movie they could work well together, but I think they're both miscast here. Some have praised Smith's acting here, but it didn't work for me perhaps because he would be teary one scene and back to his usual carefree self the next.<br/><br/>Too much of what Neville does doesn't make sense. He broadcasts on the radio for other survivors to come to New York to meet him, but when they do he doesn't believe there were any survivors and is angry they cooked some of his bacon without asking. And why broadcast on AM which has limited range. Why not short wave? In some scenes he is mad with loneliness, but on others he's having a great time with his dog and seems as happy as a guy enjoying free time while his girlfriend is out of the house.<br/><br/>Poor vampires. Ever since Anne Rice turned them into teen idols no one can take them seriously any more. Let's face it. If a vampire knocked on your door you wouldn't invite them inside, but you would offer them a Bloody Mary, sit on the porch and have a fascinating chat about their long and no-doubt very interesting life. Compared to your average high school boy, no wonder every girl wants a vampire boyfriend! And so here zombies replace vampires.<br/><br/>The CGI is really bad. The lions look fake, and the zombies look like a video game. Directors everywhere are misusing CGI. Here the apocalyptic scenery is amazing, but the rest really detracts. Hollywood really needs to roll back the CGI. It doesn't impress us any more.<br/><br/>The biggest cop out here is the ending. There are two of these. The original ending was more faithful to the book: Neville realizes the zombies still have some human feelings. But this tested poor with audiences, so they replaced it with an alternate ending where he commits suicide using an incendiary grenade. It explodes burning him and every zombie in a large room, and yet the boy and girl right next him are unharmed and unsinged. It leaves too many lose threads unexplained, like the earlier scene where zombies set a snare trap for him.<br/><br/>The religious themes are annoying: God killed six billion people but still wants to save a few of us. If you're going to take that line, do it like Stephen King did it in ""The Stand"" and do it all the way. (And to hell with the other reviewer who said he didn't like Smith's character because he was an atheist!)<br/><br/>It would have been fascinating to see how the virus spread, but this isn't really shown. All we see is flashbacks of Smith evacuating his family to a helicopter. Even that doesn't make sense: If they're sealing off the city, why let a few people out anyway? Even if they are Will Smith's family? Especially when one of the tests just showed his wife may be infected?<br/><br/>The movie has too many holes and is unsatisfying, but it has its moments and is watchable. I ""enjoy"" post-apocalyptic movies so despite its many flaws I don't regret watching it. I just think it could have been done much better.<br/><br/>My recommendation. The book is short. Read that instead. Watch ""Contagion"": Long and dry but fascinating nevertheless. Watch Stephen King's TV Adaption of ""The Stand"". If you have watched it check out the other film versions: ""The Omega Man"" and ""The Last Man on Earth"". Both have their faults, but it's interesting to compare."

","I Am Legend is an other spin on the zombie apocalypse. In this one, the emphasis is on the mental state of a survivor trying to find the cure and the ambiance of New York three years down the road.<br/><br/>Will Smith does a great job of putting us in the boots of that recluse, and makes us feel everyone of his challenges. The set are well made. The story is interesting. The mood is riveting, especially the first time you see it. You're quickly immersed and taken for a ride.<br/><br/>Now for the negative. The CG animals are missing a tiny bit of realism, probably due to the limitations of the technology at the time. However, the biggest mistake is the ending. It should have stopped after the lab explosion. The rest is just post test screening adjustments crap.<br/><br/>If you like Will Smith, zombies, or post-apocalyptic situation, you'll be in for a nice ride.

The scenes in which these computer-generated characters are present, are embarrassing to watch. I know nothing about movie-making, but even I cringed when these creatures (or rather cartoon characters) stepped into the picture.<br/><br/>(2) I was offended by the religious propaganda that is, quite obviously, being promoted in this movie.<br/><br/>--- Plus, a few more: - Will Smith is a decent actor, but he is, essentially, playing Will Smith in every movie. It doesn't help matters that there was hardly any character development in ""I Am Legend"". You don't see Will Smith's character, you see Will Smith.<br/><br/><ul><li>That kid (Ethan), was really quite annoying. I think the movie would've been better without him. The first annoying kid (Will Smith's daughter) would've been enough. More than enough.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are quite a few very obvious plot holes. For example, how did Anna manage to drag a guy, who is twice her weight, out of an upside down car and shove him into hers, while there was a bunch of hungry monsters right there, and her own 10 year old kid to protect at the same time? - The scene where Sam (the dog) is bitten by a monster (cartoon) dog, is utterly ridiculous.

Instead, Hollywood dumbed it down and completely destroyed the ending, which also opens up some plot-holes in the movie.<br/><br/>The whole point of the movie being called ""I Am Legend"" is because Will Smith is the bad guy, the ""legends"" that the vampires refer to because he keeps going into their dwellings and snatching their kind for his research. The vampires are intelligent, benevolent creatures, trying to rescue one of their kidnapped girls. But Hollywood didn't like that ending, they wanted Will Smith to be the hero.

Although then things started to get a little haywire, but I'll get to that in a minute first I have to tell you about why the film was so good to start with. First of all I have to stress how well done the rundown and abandoned New York City was created using real and computerized images, also all the animals such as lions and deer look amazingly realistic. In case you don't already know, I Am Legend is about an infection that quickly spreads across the globe leaving Will Smith's character, Robert Neville, alone (apart from his dog Sam, who is great), his family dead and him trying to discover a cure to make everything better again (his character is a doctor). Will Smith is at his best in this film, showing well the effects of isolation. Although I think that the film should have done more back story on Robert and how the infection fist started, those flashbacks by Robert are very exciting.<br/><br/>The effect of not being able to see the infected at the start is well done, leaving you tense in some suspenseful scenes, though this is all ruined when the 'zombies' are revealed looking like their out of some sort of video game, and also when fellow survivors find Robert (Will's character), they couldn't possibly be more frustrating, the women actress is alright but the kid is unbearable. I won't give too much more away, but I will tell you that the ending is terrible, having some infected 'leader' banging his head on bullet-proof glass like an idiot. I Am Legend could have been so much more and it really is a disappointment.<br/><br/>Mainly because of its masterpiece start, I'm giving I Am Legend about 7/10."

","I Am Legend is a truly incredible piece of entertainment and a great achievement for the sci-fi genre. Set in the near-future of New York City, after a virus strain has basically wiped out the human civilization, a doctor named Robert Neville (Smith) does his best to survive the now barren Earth. Or so it seems. Half the Earth's human population died after infected, but a slightly lower number didn't die; they changed. People became vampire-like creatures, only coming out at night looking for food. As Neville survives with his only companion, his dog Samantha, he sends out distress broadcasts out over all radio-frequencies, hoping someone will answer.<br/><br/>This sets the scene for I Am Legend. Will Smith is beyond fantastic as Neville, being partly paranoid as he has had no connections with any humans what-so-ever for years. The setting of New York City is astounding as they actually shot the movie there, filling in the post-apocalyptic pieces with CGI such as grass growing in the street, wild animals roaming the city, and the once-human monsters that Neville must face. The plot build-up that occurs throughout the film is extraordinary, filling in the basic details about Neville's life and how it changed for the worst, and how the world became what it is now. I Am Legend is no doubt an award-winner, and it's truly sad to see it not come to that. But for those who know how great this movie is, we will never forget it, for (in respective terms) 'He is legend.' 9.5/10"

","I confess i had put some expectations on this. I haven't seen the old films that supposedly this one references, but still i have a great sympathy for films constrained in space and characters. This one had a great set up: New York, completely abandoned, regained by Nature after the collapse of mankind, and used by one single man! The visual possibilities of this are great, and the dramatic arc as well, even though here the success would depend greatly on what the actor did. Will Smith is a craftsman, not an artist, and what might be done with such a character is way out of his league. It was also out of Tom Hanks possibilities, and even Nicholson only came close to doing it right.<br/><br/>I admit, the visual result was satisfying, they resisted the temptation of exaggerating in the special effects and creating a wilder city than it deserved. Some pieces of city were really nicely imagined. But than again, they might just have done that, show us in an exhibition, and they needn't wrap it around the crap plot, story, so on...<br/><br/>The major problem is the goofiness of a half-crazy character, who starts alone, and ends up the hero of all mankind. In they way he (1)finds out the cure for the virus, all alone! and (2)physically saves that discovery so that the remaining humanity might live on and learn from his example. What a hero! He suffers, he survives, he has moral, he is a scientist, he is a martyr. I think this might sound a little bit exaggerated if placed in a pre-Leone western, but right here, right now, it aches. It is a kind of straight forwardness that i may put up with in old films that have other qualities, but i just won't take here.<br/><br/>So, the virus not only kills, but in reduced percentages turns humans into vampires, so that we can have the city free during the day, and so that we can have scary faces and physical challenges for Smith, as well as exploding numbers. It's just too forced, and out of focus.<br/><br/>Mike Patton sounds for the vampires are nice (i read somewhere he made their sounds).<br/><br/>My opinion: 1/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

The CGI monsters were truly a let down and worst of all, the action sequences were pretty lame.<br/><br/>The positive thing about the movie is Will Smiths' performance and the dark, sad feeling surrounding of the post-Apocalyptic settings.<br/><br/>My theory is that the movie tried to be a new post-apocalyptic masterpiece or a huge blockbuster flick. The truth is that the ideas are very good but the execution is just regular. This is an action flick you will soon forget.<br/><br/>Nice try, but it didn't work."

","The year is 2012 and New York is an abandoned, derelict and ruined city. Alone in this barren, and utterly disturbing vision of New York is Robert Neville and Sam, his dog, who are the only survivors of a deadly virus that has wiped out humanity.<br/><br/>First and foremost I have never read the book to which this film was adapted nor have I seen the previous two films connected to the book. I can however state that I Am Legend is brought vividly to life by the superb special effects. The images of New York are impeccable and for that reason alone this film is worth seeing. Will Smith is on top-form, and he is wonderfully supported by the talents of the dogs that played Sam. Indeed I Am Legend works well in places, there are a number of memorable scenes (Neville talking to the mannequins, his radio message, the chills when he goes into the dark looking for Sam, and playing golf aboard USS Intrepid) including the perfectly rendered relationship between Neville and Sam, and their final scene, which is heart-breaking.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I Am Legend fails to be more than it could have been. The beings which roam the New York streets at night are not that badly designed but I wish they hadn't been created with the same lack of mental capabilities or humanity as those zombies created in '28 Days Later' and given such super-human strength. The appearance of two other survivors into Neville's lonely existence is not a bad thing but it lacked depth. I don't know but I guess I wanted something more grander or philosophical from I Am Legend which unfortunately does not transpire.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a good film, and I want to like it more than I do, as it has the right ingredients to make it great. However, it lacks something... Maybe a bit of heart and soul, which it has in portions but not in sufficient substance."

","All those harsh critics will like condemn ""I Am Legend"" as being a cheap remake of ""Robinson Crusoe"" and the 2000 movie ""Castaway"" starring Tom Hanks. When in reality, ""I Am Lengend"" is actually a tribute to the classic movie from 1971 titled ""The Omega Man"" starring Charlton Heston about a deadly virus that wipes out the human population. After watching this movie again, I found it to be very out-dated by today's standards, therefore this remake seems more up to par with today's modern world and will likely have an impact with today's generation. <br/><br/>The way a remake should be done is modeled by the more recent ""Dawn of the Dead"" compared to its predecessor. The original version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was lagging in pace, but touched upon many issues. Whereas, the remake was equally riveting because it was a whole different ball game overall filled with more original idea compared to the original. ""I Am Legend"" succeeds in that path as well, by creating new ideas and a different concept to the story. <br/><br/>Like in ""The Omega Man"", ""I Am Legend"" has a fraction of the people passive from the virus and others morph into mutants. Unlike ""The Omega Man"" where the mutants are intellectual and function well in society, ""I Am Legend"" takes a 360 degree turn by making the mutants as a homage to the old classic zombie movies as being scary and dumb.<br/><br/>Another major key element to the success of ""I Am Legend"" is the wonderful performance of Will Smith. Usually I'm used to seeing him perform in a fast paced manner, here he's taking his performance in strides. And acting by himself in most of the movie can be very complex. Just ask Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"" and the only things that are surrounding you are a CGI mutants and a dog. <br/><br/>Director Francis Lawrence deserves plenty of kudos for creating a dark and brooding image which creates the lonely isolated atmosphere that was brought to life here. And without the sounds of music in the background, the quietness in the background is rather effective. Then when the zombies come out to play, is when the sounds of silence is broken. <br/><br/>The narration is brilliantly nuanced in its entirety. Sure it would've been a standard zombie movie with the population wipe-out, the zombie takeover and a eclectic final climax. But Lawrence decides to take that pivotal one step ahead of the game by uncovering the wipe-out in a series of flashbacks throughout the movie. Also the little observations should be carefully noticed (i.e. the gas prices). The little things are what makes this movie real. For a disease prone people transforming into zombie flick, there is actually very moderate violence. <br/><br/>My only complaint is that the zombies in ""The Omega Man"" are coherent and seem to know where the leading character lives and knows his every move. In ""I Am Legend"", the zombies seem retarded and Robert Neville (Smith) can easily hide from those incoherent mutants. Perhaps it was done deliberately by Lawrence so he wouldn't be accused of plagiarism. But it scores high points in originality and it also works effectively by starting so fresh it doesn't feel like its a remake."

","This sci-fi thriller at first seems to be a perfect copy of 28 Days Later; you can draw striking similarities with it. 28 Days... was based in UK, this is US hence this is visually more appealing and also the special effects are top class. It almost impossible to imagine Manhattan with a single soul, but here we get to see Manhattan where wild animals roam free.<br/><br/>The story of the movie is pretty straight and simple, a virus break out in human race which converts them into monsters and these infected kill tries to kill every human around. Our hero Will Smith, is somehow immune to this virus, also an army guy and researcher, stays in New York City and tries to find a cure.<br/><br/>'I am legend' also highlights the friendship between human and his pet, which is really good to watch, they also try to show the state of the mind of a person, who for years have stayed alone, and the only one to talk to, is his pet.<br/><br/>The monsters in the movie are visually top notch, as the SFX is of very high level. Specially the sequence where Will Smith driving a Ford Mustang, tries to chase down a wild animal in downtown Manhattan.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is pretty much predictable, and no prizes for guessing whether he is able to develop the cure or not. The movie is at least a one time watch, for its special effects and for the man canine friendship.<br/><br/>http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/"

","This movie was a total let-down. There were some nice scenes that elicited a reaction, but it was overall terribly disappointing. My wife came in at one point and asked about it since it sounded interesting. I assured her that she was missing nothing (though she might have disagreed about the completely self-indulgent scene of Smith working out). I assured her that, it being a Will Smith movie, humanity would be saved, but not after the dog dies, probably by Smith's own hand (of how right I was).<br/><br/>Will Smith stinks as an actor. I really wanted to like him for years. However, he has really screwed up three of my four favorite genres: aliens (MIB), robots (I Robot), and now zombies. If he screws up a vampire movie I will never trust the man again.<br/><br/>Was this not a (very) poorly made remake of 28 Days Later? The CGI zombies (dark seekers, whatever) were TERRIBLE. I was waiting for Gollum to call them out and ask WTF were they doing to the legacy of the Ring trilogy. Those movies are worse because of this one. That is hard to do, but Legend is that bad.<br/><br/>How dense was Will Smith when he did not figure out that the reason the one Gollum went into the sun was because Smith had just captured his old lady.<br/><br/>I wish that Will Smith would go back to doing bad sitcoms that my dumbest friends would watch in their college dorm rooms. He is not a movie star, or at least should not be. He cannot chose a script and he plays the same character in each movie."

","This is a great movie, and I don't care what anyone says: the scene where the dog dies is one of the saddest things i have ever seen (some of you may say a grown-man almost crying over a dead movie-dog is one of the saddest things YOU'VE ever seen, but i don't care).<br/><br/>The only bad part about the movie is the crappy CGI, i really feel that real people in makeup would have made better monsters.<br/><br/>Personally i'm a big fan of apocalypse movies, something about the world seems so alien in these movies, coupled with the awesomeness of protagonists who can do whatever they feel like (and frequently do)(see the gun-store raiding scene of the original Dawn of the Dead for my favourite example) . <br/><br/>The movie was fantastic visually also, creating a believably destroyed New York City. The scene in the blacked out building where WS is searching for his dog is visually amazing and terrifying.<br/><br/>Will Smith acts his ass off in this one, I don't think its just me who sees an Academy Award in his future."

The other point, of course, is Will Smith, usually associated with 'must watch' movies. Alas, not this time. But this begs the question, why does an actor of the calibre of Will Smith make such rubbish. Yes, rubbish. If you hadn't guessed already I thought this was a bad film. And by far the worst film that Will Smith has ever made. Shame on him. Its really just another cheap 'zombie' movie. Perhaps you will read this, and watch the film so you can disagree with me.

","I've long loved post-apoc movies. The filmmakers shutting down roads, towns, showing us normally populated meccas as baron and remote. Allowing us to peek in on ""what if we were the last person of earth?"". My first memory (hey, I grew up on the 80s) of this was a teen entry into the genre with 1984's ""Night of the Comet"". That ran out of ideas after 45 minutes and threw in zombies to complete the running time. And he we are 23 years later, with the same result.<br/><br/>Yes, I know this is a based on a book from a LONG time ago, but it doesn't diminish the same sad fact. That why do all of these catastrophe movies have to ALWAYS exclusively involve a variation of blood-thirsty bizarros roaming the streets, looking to kill? Can't anyone just focus on a lone survivor, and what one would do with so much time? ""Cast Away"" came the closest to getting it right, and ""I Am Legend"" can be lumped with the ""Night of the Comet""s and ""28 Days Later""s.<br/><br/>But that's only the half of it. When Smith isn't dodging wack-job CGI geeks, his ""down-time"" is handled in the most embarrassing fashions. Setting up mannequins in a video store, interacting with them, listening to Bob Marley(??), delivering pablum to a German Shepard such as, ""If I'm not back by nightfall, leave"". Think he can't top himself later? Grab hold of somethin'.<br/><br/>In the film's most inexcusable, deliriously moronic moment, Smith actually recites lines...to Shrek!! No, not one line, not two. He delivers nearly an entire scene's worth of dialogue as he freaks out a woman and child he's discovered. I had felt like the filmmakers had switched genres mid-way through and had decided on slapstick.<br/><br/>The CGI...is well, the CGI. Monsters look fake, move fake, overly artificial refuse. But we knew it would be, so enough on that subject.<br/><br/>The ending then suggests that Smith be regarded as some kind of saintly warrior with a deliberately nauseating voice-over that had me throwing pens at the television. Not to mention zero resolution to main plight of the characters (I guess that's in the second book?) <br/><br/>Smith is good as usual, but he can't pull this underdeveloped, shoddy screen adaptation out of its own mistaken direction. Netflix ""Night of the Comet"" instead. And hate me later."
"galensaysyes","4","1","2","23 November 2008"," Grrr, arrrgh
","The company that made the TV series Buffy was named Mutant Enemy, and its logo showed a cartoon cut-out of a bald monster with outstretched arms bobbing through the frame while an offscreen voice says, ""Grrr, arrrgh."" That's more or less what the monsters in this movie amount to.<br/><br/>And facing off against them is another TV cartoon, Fresh Prince: no longer so fresh, but exuding the same air of affable cheekiness, now ambling through the apocalypse with only his trusty dog as companion. (Note to screenwriters: As a device for allowing a character to confide his thoughts, a dog is just one step up from a sock puppet.) This is the third movie of Richard Matheson's book. It must be much the most expensive (the star's salary probably exceeds the budgets of the other two movies combined), and much the best-looking. It's also much the worst, because it leaves out the reason for the story. The story is a suspense story; the movie leaves out the suspense.<br/><br/>The book was based on one simple idea: the last surviving human shares a ruined city with a band of vampires; during the day he hunts them, and at night they hunt him. Every sunset is a source of dread; every sunrise is a relief. You feel the suspense of the situation just hearing about it. The first two movies got that. I would have imagined it impossible to make a movie of the book and not get that. Yet here's one that manages not to.<br/><br/>It opens well, at first sight. It begins with a TV interview of a great biologist and humanitarian (well played by Emma Thompson), discoverer of the miracle cure that will save us all. Cut from her glowing optimism to the desolate streets that were her ultimate legacy.<br/><br/>And amid the desolation, who do we find? No legend (except of the box-office kind): big Hollywood star Fresh Prince-Bagger Vance-Hitch, former rag doll now become bendable action figure, as likable and unreal as ever. He's like a big kid, and the director is clearly a kid at heart, so that between them they vividly transmit how it would feel to have a great golden-hued city all to yourself (or nearly): like having the world as your playground.<br/><br/>These opening scenes are great to watch.<br/><br/>The trouble is, they're all wrong for this movie.<br/><br/>The interview that shows the seed of the crisis would have been a good start for a science fiction story like Day of the Triffids (the TV serial of which actually had an equivalent scene); it does nothing toward introducing a horror story about a man playing cat-and-mouse with vampires--or, as here, mutants.<br/><br/>And then, the opening scene shouldn't be sketching out a character who isn't part of the story but the character who is, the one we should care about.<br/><br/>And then, the city shouldn't seem like a theme park but a real place, with real menace in its streets.<br/><br/>And then, those opening scenes shouldn't exist simply for their own sake but should be unobtrusively laying the groundwork for what is to come, so that it appears to happen of its own accord.<br/><br/>The movie gives no sense of scope. No sense of the passage of time; of the contrast between what was and what is; of the devolution of humankind. It doesn't even give a sense of the points of the first interest in any story about a lone survivor: how does he survive? how does he stay sane? what is life like for him day by day? Again, the first two movies got that. Although both were poorly staged, they were right in essence: stark, grim, and slightly seedy. And their leading actors were well chosen. Vincent Price shared in the seediness himself, Charlton Heston acted like a cop on a beat who was used to it. A certain distaste for the people (or other species) around them, which is almost an essential for this story, fell squarely in the middle of the actors' ranges. Not so Smith's. He's still the Magical ******, stepping in at the moment of crisis to disclose the authentic swing. He even manages it here, so that the title, which served as punchline and climax in the book, doesn't even apply.<br/><br/>In the first movie the vampires were more like zombies (probably the models for George Romero's in Night of the Living Dead), in the second they were changed into a mutant cult that seemed rather silly, but even then they made up a unified force and had a certain stature to them. In this movie they're just Mutant Enemies; they might as well be baboons. The movie is set up like a video game. The director keeps it from looking like one, and that's to his credit, but the flamboyance of his imagination turns it into a French comic book instead. He probably doesn't do seedy.<br/><br/>--which means, more or less, that he doesn't do suspense."

He's military scientist that is working on cure for the virus that will return the people back to normal. Int he mean time he hunts deer with his German Shepard. The best parts are the tense moments where he has to stay in the light away from the crazies. The boring parts are when we get to see how he goes about his day. It just wasn't that interesting. The movie picks up after some bad things happen and then some good things. Just when it looks like it really might be getting good, we have an ending which I didn't care for.

","It took the horror out of survival horror and should have created its own category: Survival. <br/><br/>Will Smith proves he can act and keep this movie going, and that's fine. But it came without any sense of carnage from it's comic book origin. This movie seemed lost without it.<br/><br/>Were the producers so afraid about the turn out for the movie that they decided to make it suitable for all ages? If its story was in its original form, it would have been an R rated film. But more importantly, it would have been a much better film. ""I Am Legend"" was a movie that needed to go all out. I felt that this movie held back too much.<br/><br/>Acting aside, there needed to be more story than Robert Neville being able to cope with post apocalypse New York City. The details of what could have made it better was maybe, it should have concentrated on the world falling apart a little more, just to give the plot a better atmosphere. Maybe some more focus on Robert Neville after losing his loved ones and coping with the gradual devastation of society in progress would have been the answer.<br/><br/>It felt too quiet to be labelled as an action movie. Will Smith could have done a Shakespearean monologue on a dark stage with a light over his head and it would have given me the same affect as this movie did. <br/><br/>It has some good elements between the relationship with him and his dog. I probably would have been more moved had Will Smith had more interaction with the Vampire Zombies. Because monologues get boring after a little while. The additional characters come into play a little too late only to give Will Smith a little more juice in his acting ability. <br/><br/>The poster said ""The Last Man On Earth Isn't Alone"". Well that's because he is not the last man on Earth! So why would Hollywood want to deceive the audience? <br/><br/>On top of that, the zombies were just as bloodless as the rest of the story. 5 for 10."

Great performance from him as always.<br/><br/>Agreed that the movie has a chilling storyline, but there are far too many flaws and mistakes around. In fact even a single watch is sufficient to spot some of them! And the worst part of it is after making such a great start to the movie, the director just seems to lose it all thereafter.

","In nineteen sixty four, the immortal Vincent Price, made a futuristic film called 'the Last Man on Earth.' It was so well received by fans of Price, that it was hailed as a classic. In 1971, the late Charleston Heston did a remake of the Richard Mathenson novel entitled 'The Omega Man', where he fought Anthony Zerbe. Here we are in 2007 and have yet another attempt of the horror classic rechristened, ""I Am Legend."" The story has changed little and in essence remains the tale of a dedicated doctor Robert Neville (Will Smith) who is challenged by a world destroying virus. Having eliminated 90% of the humans on the planet Earth, what little remains of the human species are little more than sun-fearing ghouls. While the rabies infected enemy seeks his lab and base of operations, Neville seeks their nest where he hopes to destroy the last of their monstrous race. In the 1964 version, Price seemed to acknowledge his lonely fate, in 1971, Heston took solace with an African American who became his partner. In this final version, Alice Braga plays Anna who tries to convince Neville of a 'survivor' colony which he finds hard to believe. It makes for a good follow-up to the earlier versions and all three should belong to those who enjoy a good scary story. ****"
"Danielramos16","5","1","2","20 June 2008"," This was the best they could do???
","I've seen a lot better post-Apocalyptic movies in my life. This film for me walks a thin line between Disappointment & Average. I was hoping for something of a mix between Castaway, Dawn of the dead, and 28 Days later. ultimately Im not quite sure what this was. personally I left the movie theater thinking I Am Legend was a little disappointed but also a bit overrated.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is based off a novel of the same title, in fact there have been two previous adaptations that were very successful; The last man on earth (Vincent Price/1964) & The Omega Man (Charlton Heston/1971). Neither weren't to faithful to the novel but they still worked because of the lead actors & the story. I was hopeful this movie would be more faithful to the novel. There were a few alterations from the novel that I didn't like, for example:<br/><br/>1. In the Novel the creatures are Vampires or Vampiric like, Not mutants. The mutants in this film were obviously fake! In an age of masterful CGI special effects, this is what they came up with!? I was not scared, intimidated, nor impressed by the mutants they looked like cartoon animations at times. If they were like the Vampires in 30 Days of night then this film would have been real scary. <br/><br/>2. The main Character Robert Neville is not a scientist in the novel, he's more of an average guy who finds himself the last survivor of a horrifying plague. In the film he spends time trying to find a cure. In the novel he spends most of his time foraging for supplies, hunting the vampires during the day, and fending them off every night when they siege his house. I like the novel version much better!!!<br/><br/>3. This movie take the title completely out of context to the novel. In the movie Neville becomes a legend to the last surviving race of humans for finding a cure to the disease. In the novel Neville hunts & kills so many vampires that he becomes a legend to the Vampires & the Human-Vampire hybrids, like Dracula & vampires were to humans.<br/><br/>In the beginning of this film a scientist states that they have found a cure for Cancer by engineering this super virus, and of course things begin to go terribly wrong. Man those scientists were really reckless in developing this virus because it was killing everyone that it infected and turned others into deformed mutants, I guess we were that desperate to finally cure cancer (how cliché). I liked the Omega Man premise of a disease brought upon by Biological-Warfare. This film I think missed an opportunity to explore our fears of disease & bio-weapons. Also it skimmed over the outbreak of the virus, so we didn't see really get to see much of the world falling apart from the pandemic. This film would have been a lot better if it followed the novel more closely, I loved the novel & this movie took too many liberties.<br/><br/>So what makes this movie so great? Will Smith. In a movie that in reality underachieved he was the one bright spot, in fact he carried this film. Smith's performance was magnificent. Smith's talent was on full display though. Imagine if you were the only person in th world isolated for years fighting for survival every single day, Will Smith captured that psyche so well. Also the scenery of an abandoned New York City was really stunning, could have been better but still awesome. <br/><br/>ultimately I have mixed feelings about this movie. It was good and I loved Will Smith's performance. Unfortunately this film just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I mean really think about it, if you thought about how you could improve this film then it would have been so much more amazing. Was this really the best they could do? please there are far better & relevant Post-Apocalyptic films."

","I AM LEGEND (M) Directed by Francis Lawrence Reviewed by Matthew Gunn<br/><br/>Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the last human in New York City, maybe the world. This is, if you don't count thousands of bloodthirsty mutant-zombies as humans. <br/><br/>In 2009 a supposed ""miracle cure for cancer"" went disastrously wrong, infecting all humans with a deadly virus. Those who didn't die (around 10 percent of the world's population according to Robert's statistics) morphed into crazed monster killing machines. The exception to this rule is, of course, Robert Neville who (quite conveniently) is immune to the virus. Robert is faced with the task of developing a cure for the virus and to save mankind from being wiped from existence.<br/><br/>OK, so it all sounds a bit ridiculous, but I Am Legend may not be all that you expect it to be. There isn't a lot of cliché zombie gore here, nor is Robert Neville your cliché popcorn movie action-hero. The film is all about brain before blood, delving into Neville's psyche as isolation takes a toll on his insanity. Will Smith does a superb job of filling the screen as, for the majority of the film, he is the only actor present. <br/><br/>Besides Smith, I Am Legend's strongest point is its suspense. Director Francis Lawrence intricately fuses light (or lack of light), sound and camera-work to create this edge-of-your-seat tension. At times the on screen action makes you feel as though you are playing a first person shooter video game, and these sequences are not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I Am Legend does suffer from a plot that is not only far fetched but predictable plot. Smith is the only thing driving the story towards its inevitable and under whelming ending and although his performance is admirable it fails to distract the viewer from the fact that I Am Legend's storyline is underdeveloped and one dimensional. Oh, and the CGI zombies look dreadful, you would have thought the film's monstrous budget (somewhere in the ballpark of 150 US million) could have taken care of this aspect at least.<br/><br/>Although it has its downfalls I Am Legend is regardless an exciting action-thriller that is as fun is it is unbelievable. My verdict? Rent it out, get some mates around, and you'll surely have a blast."

Fortunately our hero is immune to this infection and, along with his pet Alsatian Sam, fights his way through countless number of Dark Seekers (Zombies) to find a cure for this disease.

Hordes of shoddy CGI zombies running towards our last man on earth and you wonder why the director was so keen to show us these beasties when the creatures looks that dumb, even with the help of Computer Graphics.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the ever likable Smith and the 40 minute build up this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on, the unfortunately underwhelming ending doesn't help either. Still it has more flavor than 28 Weeks Later and more smarts Than Resident Evil: Extinction. And well let's not even mention Black Sheep. I can proudly pronounce I am Legend the best zombie flick of 2007. A position which was not hard fought but even still.<br/><br/>Now a word on Dash Mihok's Alpha Male if you don't mind. Whilst scary upon first encounter he reviles himself to be no more that a cheap Mummy (1998) rip-off.Also prepare yourself for one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying ending of this century at what appears to be the climax of the film the action slows and the end credits roll. Without warning the film abruptly stops. If you don't mind being disappointed this film is for you.My final Verdict. Far more flavored than 28 Weeks Later, far smarter than Resident Evil: Extinction. While I am Legend may not have the subtly to classify it as a horror film it will do just fine as a mindless block buster. Legendary? Not quite!"

","I find it hard to describe my feelings abut this film without using wee short words.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a good buildup followed by a bit of specious God claptrap and a cop-out.<br/><br/>Will Smith's character's taking apart of that woman's ""God's-Plan"" codswallop is excellent, but after that they can't let him live: they paint him into a corner, give him a divine vision of a butterfly and with one hand grenade he takes out a whole Boy's Brigade Troop of ""vampires"" and himself to boot (thus making a hero of a suicide bomber), then she drives casually up to Vermont; and the first thing you notice when the Gates of Salvation swing open is a down-home white church with a bell calling the faithful to prayer. Give me a break! It made me wonder how much money the Religious Right had poured in.<br/><br/>As someone else observed, it's a missed opportunity, but really it's a lot worse than that. The cop-out and swift voice-over ending are a great let-down. The woman (appropriately kitted out with little boy from the stock properties department, to which he may now be returned only lightly used and very glad we are of that) appeared too late for us to form any attachment, so really we didn't give a hoot whether she got saved (with a small S, with a big S she was already a goner) or chewed up. I formed the impression that she was dropped in there as a last-minute decision after a plot meeting that went ""OK, we're stuck. Here he is in this house, he's lost his dog (easily the most impressive actor on the set, incidentally), he's got a bolt in his neck, sorry, leg, the ghoulies are breaking in by the hundred and gee, how are we going to have the audience Feel Good when they finally stick the gum under the seat and go home?"" News for you: it would have been a lot more convincing if the ghoulies had won. They could have spared us the ghastly woman - or maybe got her crunched, what joy! - and simply left a picture of inevitable desolation. I would have bought it. But they way they ended it I didn't Feel Good at all, I felt I'd been conned.<br/><br/>Something else, too: anyone else notice how the villain of the piece, yet again, wasn't American? They can be French, English, German, Serbo-Croat, Italian or whatever, as long as they aren't from the good old U.S. of A. And calling her Krippen! Oh my godfathers...<br/><br/>Thinking of buying the DVD? Save your money! I wish I'd saved mine."

","Don't get me wrong. I DID think this was a good movie. Good acting, good action, and good use of CGI. However, it's not a movie I'm actively hunting for in video stores.<br/><br/>In the movie, Will Smith stars as Robert Neville, a military scientist, and the last human in New York, and possibly the world. An epidemic has killed off most of humanity. The humans who haven't died have evolved into a race of bloodthirsty mutants that live in the dark. Neville has spent the past three years looking for a cure to the epidemic, but he feels it may be too late to save humanity.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Will Smith's acting in this movie was great. The mutants were done well and certainly scary. There were plenty of great action scenes. On the downside, however, I felt the movie was too grim. Although there was a definite plot to the story, it just seemed that nothing was working out for Neville. I thought it was a bit weird for Neville to treat mannequins like real people. It was a good idea in Cast Away, but here it didn't seem to work. Maybe I'm just over-analyzing, but that's how I feel about it.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for any fans of sci-fi horror and/or Will Smith.

","An effective evocation of post-apocalyptic loneliness and heartbreak as buff scientist Will Smith, who does great work here, experiences the big city as jungle. As long as he's on his own with his dog, this is quite riveting, and there are several good suspense sequences and emotional moments. But when it tries to get deep it slips badly. The talking-to-mannequins stuff just doesn't work, and can you get more corny than using the Other Survivor as a pretext for a Science Versus Religion debate? The stuff about the zombies' social/kinship instincts fails to engage for the simple reason that they all look and act like they were in a video game. And the ending is insufferable. Can you imagine how much more Land of the Dead would have sucked if they got to Canada and it really WAS a utopian refuge?

That brings up my one complaint: the title. By the end of the movie, we have some sense of the meaning of the title. Yet it still seems to me to feel cheesy and really unworthy of the movie."" Sorry, but I think exactly the contrary. The movie is unworthy of its brilliant title, and totally unworthy of Matheson's book. Some of the scenes in deserted NY are truly impressive, but the animation effects are simply ridiculous, and the best actor remains Samantha (the dog). Will Smith seems, at times, plays another movie and sometimes overplays. And the ""explanation"" of the title, in the movie, is inept. The same title was PERFECT in the Matheson original."

This round two is based so much on round one of the film version that I begin to wonder if anyone making films today is actually literate or can bear to hold paper. This movie is inspired purely by the Omega Man, which is a great film but NOT THE ORIGINAL TALE. Poor Matheson. Why when Hollywood knows that vampire tales pull in viewers are they not making an adaptation of THE BOOK? If you want to see something close to Matheson's original, check out Midnight Mass, based on a Paul F. Wilson novella. And be very afraid without the foolish overtones of government interference and someone's overwrought interpretation of the original tale of one man's battle against an incomprehensible evil that has overtaken his world."

I am just trying to say that this movie was brilliant and should be at least checked out by anyone. Unless you are afraid of movies about the world ending. People should see this movie just to see a fictional view of the world ending. Im sure that their will be a lot of talk about this being bad and not enough action, but that didn't matter it was more to show you what one man does on his own. This movie did have some sad parts in it as well. I thought that Will Smith should play in more movies like this. This wasn't very scary but some scenes were pretty frightening. I did happen to jump a lot in it. Their were many boring scenes but once it picked up it kept going and did not stop. The ending will be very controversial.

","Honestly, directors nowadays take too many freedoms when converting media. For all of you who thought this was good, pick up the book. If you haven't seen this, read the book.<br/><br/>The story of I Am Legend is not about a military scientist put into a situation where he is the only one to stop it. Robert Neville was an ordinary man. And his wife and child didn't die in a helicopter crash, his daughter's body was burned when she died (to prevent reanimation) and his wife became a vampire and he had to kill her.<br/><br/>The movie takes brings glamour to the personality of Robert Neville. In the movie, he's not crude, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink. In the book, aside from what he did during the day, he drank away the night.<br/><br/>The ending was the most dreadful part. In the end of the book... Robert Neville became legend, along with humanity. There weren't any survivors that he sacrificed his life for.<br/><br/>Through and through, the book is about the human emotion when staring at immediate mortality. The movie, on the other hand, is about a crazy guy, who just so happens to be outlived by some woman. Good job at killing the legend."

The zombies are not really even characters; they're simply props. The Mustang is nice, but how come we didn't see it being stolen? And we have to watch Colonel Neville loving his dog instead of seeing him make out with the last woman on earth.

","This is the third (so far) adaptation of Richard Matheson's book of the same name. The first two being the 1964's Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price and 1971's The Omega Man with a rifle-toting Charlton Heston. You have probably read or seen something of Richard Matheson's and didn't even know it. His stories were used in several Twilight Zone episodes and Night Stalker. This movie ,however, is best for anyone that hasn't seen any of the previous two attempts. If you have seen one or both of the previous versions, this repolished version is unlikely do anything for you.<br/><br/>Robert Neville (Will Smith) is living alone in New York City, the only survivor of a cancer cure going wrong. 90% of the world's population is dead, with the remaining either becoming the creatures from the Descent or lunch. Now remember that hypothetical situation ""if you are alone on a deserted island, what would you bring with you?"". That is what is happening for most of the movie. New York City is by far the star of the movie (though Will emotes more than his usual fare). The rendering of a lifeless and decaying New York City is simply phenomenal, until the CG lions and antagonists ruin what is an incredible achievement. Also an amazing performance by the dog. I want a dog like that someday.<br/><br/>This is technically director Francis Lawrence's second film endeavor after the ""it really wasn't as crappy as it could have been"" Constantine. The problem with Francis is his tendency to break down a movie into a tapestry of music videos vignettes. His movies, so far, look good and are tip-toeing the line of actually being good. I don't think this is because of his skill as a director but more of a credit to the original source material (Matheson and Gaiman/Ennis/Ellis) and Francis' sweet tooth for flashy imagery. We will have to wait and see what he does next.<br/><br/>The movie is average interesting for a seasoned viewer of the previous versions and slightly better for neophytes. The turning point is when Neville's dog dies. The movie spirals from that point forward. It is the top of mountain and end of the road, on the way down to crashing into the chasm below. This isn't a terrible movie and impressions will vary based on the viewers filmography.<br/><br/>There are two endings to this movie and I have prorated my review score based on all the criteria : theatrical ending, alternate ending, seen the previous two versions of source and first time viewing. Obviously the highest rating would have been if I had seen the alternative ending of this movie and never saw the Omega Man or Last Man on Earth (7.5). The worst ,obviously, would be seeing the previous movies and the theatrical ending (of which I had the pleasure of seeing and rated a 5). The alternate ending does make a big difference, especially when the movie seems to point to the alternate ending and then suddenly throws the pie in your face. The theatrical ending is just too sudden along with the 2nd half of the movie. The pacing is off. Most of the movie is a slow, deliberate elaboration of Neville's current situation. How without people, his life is just an endless rinse cycle. Then the end.<br/><br/>Time for me to reciprocate."

","I had heard a lot of hype about this film before I was finally able to watch it. I didn't catch it in theatres; I had to wait and purchase it on DVD. I wouldn't say it lived up to all the talk I'd heard, but it was still an awesome movie. The film is based on the 1954 book by Richard Matheson; in the year 2012, the world's entire population has been driven to near extinct by the Krippin Virus. The majority of the remaining population have been turned into Darkseekers, mutated into primitive creatures with a weakness to UV light. Will Smith plays Robert Neville, the last survivor in New York City who lives alone with his dog and struggles to find a cure.<br/><br/>Will Smith has been one of my favorite, most-respected actors in recent years and he does a great job in this role, considering the man is alone for the majority of the film. His only interactions occur with his dog or the mannequins he has placed around the city to give it some semblance of a civilization; I can think of few other actors that would've been able to give the same performance with so little. My favorite scenes in the movie all involve his conversations with the ""locals"", particularly a scene with Fred.<br/><br/>My only real complaint with the movie is the CGI. The Darkseekers were all done with CGI and probably some motion-capture. Unfortunately, most instances where you see the Darkseekers, it's very apparent that they're computer-generated. It's never obvious enough that it pulls the audience out of the movie experience but it does detract from the film a bit.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a totally positive experience. If you get a chance, make sure to check out the alternate ending on the special edition DVD. I found that I actually prefer the ""controversial"" alternate ending versus the theatrical ending. While the theatrical ending provides more closure, I almost felt it was pointless. Whereas the alternate ending provides the filmmakers for further exploration of the story in the future."

I also found Will Smith completely unbelievable in his role as 'soldier scientist' - perhaps with another actor in the role I might have liked the film better.<br/><br/>I better liked the alternative ending with the creatures exhibiting relationships and love to each other. And the shots of the wall full of all the photos of 'monsters' the good doctor had killed in his quest to fix everything, to make up for the deaths of his wife and daughter.<br/><br/>The original ending just seemed silly and manipulative forcing him to be martyr while claiming he was listening to god suddenly. All the manipulative ""god stuff"" in general really annoyed me, too. I could tell right from the beginning they were going to use that tactic.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie was silly and unbelievable and I would not recommend it.

"DKosty123","2","1","2","23 March 2008"," Certainly This Omega Man Remake Falls Flat
","Much of this movie is a one man (Will Smith) & one dog (Samantha) show. While Will Smith does a terrific job acting which is why I give this a point, and the dog is terrific too, the script has many problems. There is a long list of production goofs already noted here on IMDb in addition to the script problems.<br/><br/>The story, while logical is an extreme leap of faith. How do you explain Smith alone being able to set up the entire lab complex & defenses when there is no time or logic in what is set up before the virus strikes the city? The defenses are set up like he knew what he needed to do ahead of time & logically, that would be impossible in real life.<br/><br/>How does Anna & the boy, when they finally arrive late in the film, get into a destroyed New York City when all the bridges have been destroyed coming into Manhatten? Even more incredible, how does she get back out after wards? It is not shown because it can't be explained logically.<br/><br/>I like Will Smith so watching this film is not a chore as he does a fine job. The flashback technique to his wife & kids deaths is done is 3 clips & it is very predictable what is about to happen to them with the chopper from the outset of the first one. The story might have worked better to have gone through the crash first instead of flashing back 3 times.<br/><br/>Any health expert would tell you the biggest problem with the story. If NYC were really quarantined, no one would be allowed to leave because allowing anyone to leave would spread a deadly virus no matter what tests you did on the people leaving. This makes the entire premise of the film a major leap of faith. <br/><br/>It's been a long time since I saw Charlton Heston in OMEGA MAN but that film did a better job script wise of handling reality. Even Omega Man has some problems. No one has done really well adapting this book to film yet. While Smith is terrific, I wish he'd have gotten a better script to work with. This film & Omega Man are based upon the 1954 novel I Am Legend. Neither film gets things completely right.<br/><br/>Will Smith was upset when the film started shooting as there was not a script. There is no doubt that is true when viewing this film."

The only thing one might enjoy from this film is Will Smith's acting for he (as usual) did a great job at portraying his role. Beyond that, this movie is awful! First off, you don't really get into any REAL action until towards the end of the movie... Second off, this movie had the cheap CGI of a low-grade B-Horror film. All the creatures looked the same, and defied physics. The only cool concept the movie brought to the table was Zombie Vampire things... BUT, they failed. Zombie Vampires would be a great concept possibly for another film, but this film killed it something awful.

The ""infected"" could have easily been better portrayed with a bit of make-up on some extras....even bad acting is better than ropey CGI. There are also too many things in the film where you have to work out yourself various ideas makers were trying to portray, what they were going for, because they were so badly conveyed, but suffice to say I can't tell you what half of those things are because it may spoil your enjoyment. The film starts in a deserted New York which could have had such an impact if it had been portrayed by the director just a little darker and more grim, but this scene leads on to the traditional action-film loud beginning to get the popcorn-muncher's attention and the introduction of some bad CGI, which basically brings the film to a rather disappointing start. At least they went easy on the comic relief.<br/><br/>The whole thing comes off a bit one-dimensional, the same old zombie flick, warmed over for 2007 (Oh look they're shaking the camera around a bit! How contemporary), done worse than many recent others of the same genre.<br/><br/>So, in summary, too much CGI, too much product placement, too much Will Smith, not enough film."

It's one of his best performances. The film, which slowly reveals its (and its character's) history in flashbacks, is engaging for this hour. Then...the plot thickens.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending except to say that the film deviates DEEPLY from the novel's second act.

It is beyond me how a movie director thought a film could be made with predominantly one character throughout most of the film. The lack of deep social interactions creates a giant void. The dialogs between the man character and his dog, and random mannequins is just not what entertains people. Sure, their are scenes which relate to the beginning of the crisis, however this hardly change the fact that this film is poorly entertaining. The lack of music, and the large amount of silence also creates the tension... of annoyance. I personally had to add low level volume techno music in the background, just to finish watching the movie.<br/><br/>The scenes intended to invoke emotional connections to the film were unsuccessful, due to the long, boring, silent and annoying portions of the film, which overshadows the only bearable parts.<br/><br/>Will Smith can play his part in the role, however the role is what is lacking. I give this half a stars. Not because it deserves it, but because maybe, just maybe, a film out is out there that is worse... and has zombies (Any film with zombies is given half a star, to make up for the rest of the film). I got to say, it takes a special ability to make a film, this horrible. I have got to say, the techno music in the background does give an extra 20 minute viewing time, before you which it off.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who doesn't mind, watching an hour of mind numbing boring cinematography, followed by a bit of bland zombie mayhem, and enjoys sappy ending with a supposedly legendary sort of sappy ending music."

They destroy the story to a point where it just gets boring.<br/><br/>The plot, while OK, seemed to be a push towards a 'zombie' film genre, and the writing just did not make much sense, moving towards lots of action and use of pyrotechnics to make up for the lack of imagination by the writers. Unfortunately lack of imagination is common I find in remakes. <br/><br/>I think if you are watching a film and constantly think, 'why are they doing that?', then its not been properly though through, there should be no time for you to come up with solutions to the characters problems while sitting in a cinema.<br/><br/>At many points in this film you have time to think why?<br/><br/>I left the cinema with a feeling that it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>In my opinion, its worth watching on TV, but not worth adding to your DVD collection."

","Not a bad movie... however one thing that really bugs me... why is it when writer/directors decide to go with CGI bad guys, that they decide to give them superhuman powers??? I'm not going into any spoilers i don't believe, i'm just talking general behavior of the bad guys. OK so there's a big virus that spreads, and the pre-movie-release Press/Media calls them zombies because zombies are big now, and ""World War Z"" is on the horizon, so i think people want traditional zombies... Well, we discover that these aren't traditional zombies.... OK, a bit disappointed, but i can handle it.<br/><br/>However, once they start running 100 miles per hour, climbing up light poles like a lizard, jumping from the top of said pole 30 feet to the wall (i won't even mention those that could climb vertical walls faster than most 'real' humans can walk).... well, i have to say it was absurd... How do i get this disease? sounds like i'd be better off if i could do crap like that. All i really need to do is stay out of the sun. It's clear the 'zombies/monsters/whatever' are organizing, experience love of sorts, and have a leader, even pets, so why is Will Smith fighting it so much? Wouldn't you like to be able to climb up a light pole in about 3 seconds? it'd probably take me a good 20 minutes, if i didn't slip and break my legs in the attempt which would more likely be the result.<br/><br/>This could have been a great movie but for some reason the Hollywood writers now insist on absurd CGI action to impress the audience. Maybe they should go back on strike. I'm tired of all of these 'blockbuster' movies being so ridiculously absurd that even when you're willing to suspend some disbelief for the sake of a movie, it completely transcends your limit.<br/><br/>I guess all i'm saying is did we REALLY need to see these 'monsters' shimmying up poles and walls? wouldn't it have been spookier with a horde of them ripping down the door/first floor windows slowly and methodically????"
"alexvergan","8","1","2","23 February 2008"," Who set the trap that caught Will Smith? Here's my take on that!
","After watching this movie a couple of times, I have come to the following conclusions:<br/><br/>The zombie who looks at Will Smith for a couple of seconds in the sunlight, after Will just finished catching the other zombie with the trap he set up (I'm thinking it's the zombie's daughter Will just trapped, since she's approximately eighteen according to Will, and the zombie staring at Will in the sunlight looks late thirties, early forties),<br/><br/>IS THE SAME ZOMBIE AS:<br/><br/>-The one who sets up the SAME trap as Will using one of Will's mannequins as bait and trapping Will.<br/><br/>-The one who screams out loudly in the pier scene at night, just before Will is rescued by the Brazilian girl and the boy.<br/><br/>-The one who stops in front of Will's house and who lets out that horrible scream.<br/><br/>-And finally, the one in the final scene, where he (the zombie) crashes his head against the glass in Will's laboratory.<br/><br/>In all these instances, you see the burn marks on the zombie's face inflicted by the sunlight when he stared at Will for a few seconds. Also you can see in those scenes that the zombie is wearing exactly the same clothes.<br/><br/>This zombie also comes across as some kind of alpha-male leader of the zombies. Notice how he makes his way in Will's lab, tossing the other zombies aside violently to get to the glass protecting Will, the girl and the boy.<br/><br/>Will's character, Robert Neville had probably underestimated the zombies' intelligence. This would explain how the zombie was able to copy Will's trap."

The few scenes that make up the film are of generally important or even life and death situations, but you remain only mildly impressed by what you see as there is no depth to the story. There are so many elements/avenues that could have been explored but weren't. I felt like I was being hurriedly led down a corridor having chance to only snatch a peek into the rooms that lay to each side, before being pushed back outside. Apologies for straying into nerd-dom but Will Smith's character's name (Robert Neville) gives us an inkling into what's in store. It's anagram is ""Terrible Novel""."

","I've not read the book, shamefully, but I did read an excellent review by that Guru of all left-field movies, Kim Newman. As he and some of the comments have pointed out, the original 'Legend' was the main character himself  an almost mythical exterminator as seen by the 'vampire victims' of the plague. What the title didn't refer to was a reggae album by the late Bob Marley. In fact, the more I think about it, this reasoning is pretty racist. You can see the suits thinking ""Well, Will Smith is black and this Bob Marley Guy, he was black, and his favourite film would be like Shrek, because Eddie Murphy is in it and he's black too!"" So all-in-all, the film leaves a nasty taste in the mouth for all the wrong reasons. Which is a shame. Will Smith gives a very believable and human performance, far better than the script deserves. The opening sequences of an abandoned New York have an eerie power, while the CGI Monsters are suitable feral, even if being 'beastly' is all that they do. I just wish the same amount of care had been put into what is a pretty moronic script. And, as for the butterflies, I'm still trying to work that one out."

"Antagonisten","6","1","2","16 February 2008"," Not awful, but not great
","Sitting down in the theater to watch what is basically another zombie-movie didn't feel all that appealing. But ""I Am Legend"" seemed to have a few things going for it. Like a being based on an actual novel, like having nice cinematography and a style that seemed appealing. In the end though, i found that this movie had serious trouble rising above mediocrity.<br/><br/>We can start with the good. This movie has a few things really going for it. It looks gorgeous to begin with. The empty and partly overgrown streets of New York are awesome. The visual style is generally very nice and atmospheric. Second the music is great. Both the score and the very well-picked songs add to the mood of the movie. The third thing i liked was actually Will Smith. I'm not one of his biggest fans, although i do think he has some talent, not least in comedy roles. Here though he carries the first half of the movie quite admirably. After that, the whole thing degenerates in a way that not even the best actor could save.<br/><br/>The actually brings me to the bad points. In general, people have been saying that the first two thirds of the movie were great, the last third awful. In most parts i can agree, although i would say that the first two thirds were good, and the ending disappointing. Honestly i can't say that this would have become a favorite of mine even with a good ending. But the ending they chose for this movie must have been one of the worst choices they could have. Since they didn't seem to follow the book that closely, they could easily have remodeled the ending to something a lot better. One of the other things that bothered me were the zombies (or ""Dark Seekers"" as they call them) themselves. They are a mess of decent quality CGI that somehow turns quite awful in a few scenes. This is not the first time that movies have shown fluctuating quality in it's CGI, but i'm wondering where it comes from. If you have a big budget it shouldn't be that difficult to make the quality decent through the whole movie.<br/><br/>In the end this movie didn't really appeal to me that much. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. I almost always have a problem with movies that are basically one-man shows. I loathed ""Cast Away"" for instance due to the fact that Hanks is far from good enough to carry a whole movie. It worked better in this movie due to the fact that Will Smith had more things to interact with, but it's still a problem. Also the whole ""zombie-virus"" thing feels explored already. We have 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later which are both better movies on basically the same theme. I think it's time that Hollywood left the zombie-theme alone for a while and started on something else. This is getting repetitive."

They are completely unreal. You just don't believe them. They are not believable. ET is believable. Superman is believable. These zombies are so fake. I am so sorry for these computer guys, they are destroying the movies and going nowhere fast. Remember the first Star Wars movies in the 80s? Great effects, you could believe them. And remember the new Star Wars movies? Crap effects. All the great things about this movie - like seeing new york taken by wild life, all the great scenes (and even dialogues) are destroyed by this stupid fight scenes of Will against the zombies. Oh, and another thing: the end is pretty pathetic and abrupt. It looks like someone removed some 40 minutes of the movie. If this is one of the best films out this year, it means that cinema is really crap these days. And the stupid Bob Marley dialogue in the end. That was disgusting.

Aside from the fact that he was born to play the pilot hero, the army hero but the scientist hero? No scientist on his mind particularly a valuable one will be left to stay alone in such a closed environment alone he just needed a sample not the whole city.

Why do big studios and bigger stars greenlight such projects when it is so obvious that stories with natural running times of 45 minutes are being stretched to 90 minutes & beyond? Apart from a not-easy-to-digest premise, where our hero is ostensibly the last man on earth after a human-engineered cancer cure goes horribly wrong wiping out all mankind and leaving only some hideously deformed light-sensitive mutants who come out at night to prey on whoever/whatever they can find, the film suffers from shockingly low-grade SFX - something just not expected from a studio tentpole release of this magnitude.

","Alright, the movie is both, good and bad. The scenario of a cure spreading is realistic, the scenes of empty NYC are great, Will Smith is, well, good. Also, the explanations come at the right time (10% of worlds population surviving, of which only around 12 millions were immune, while the other 98% of the survivors turned into monsters)<br/><br/>However, here its starts to become strange. You'll feel more strange at the end of the movie than at the start, as just a lot of things will feel not logical.<br/><br/>Why can dogs get infected but lions can't? If there would be lions, I would at least think cats would be immune as well. Where are they?<br/><br/>Why the hell did the survivors not took a island somewhere? Like Hawaii. I read/watched much more logical stories. This is just highly unrealistic. Also, an evacuation based on apparently not-save-running ""scanners""? Hell, yes! <br/><br/>Enough of the complaining about how unrealistic the movie was. Another thing which just went on my nerves was the reaction when the noticed the not-anymore-zombie-girl. Why did they not tried to show her to the zombie ""boss""? It's like they hided here... also, did they just hide in the oven? How did they get out, with more zombies around? Just very strange scene in the lab...<br/><br/>The village in the end is also a bit strange. In such a situation, there would be massive re-population events, so every woman should be pregnant, and tons of young kids should be around.<br/><br/>Despite all the complaining, I liked the movie. An hour longer, more realism in the story, and it might have been really good. So it stays special but average."
"Redcitykev","5","1","2","31 January 2008"," OK, but that ending...!
","This modern day remake of 'The Omega Man' (itself a remake of an earlier film 'The Last Man On Earth') is, for the most part, a typical slice of Hollywood nonsense, but it does suffer greatly from possibly the worst ending I have seen in a major Hollywood film for a long - more about that later, and if you don't want to know about it I suggest you stop reading this comment now! Will Smith is perfectly fine in the Charlton Heston role of the last man alive in New York after a cure for cancer had mutated into a nasty little virus - I think it was LA in Heston's version - although there are times when he is upstaged by the dog, Sam, one of the best animal performances on film for a long time! The empty streets of Manhatten are well achieved, as is the initial panic in the flashback scenes. The Dark Seekers are very menacing, and there are a few early scary scenes involving them. I also found the symbolism running throughout the film interesting, the eternal hunt for survival by man, animal and ""other"", the symbolic butterfly - seen both in the park when Sam the Dog watches puzzled as one flutters by her nose, and in the tattoo on Anna's neck. Of course the most obvious is that of day and night, dark and light etc, ie all good things happened in the light/day, whilst night/dark is seen as evil, all very Christian! For me the film begins to unravel when Anna and her child arrive on the scene. Suddenly one man's fight for survival and loneliness are replaced by a desire to reach a near mythological place of freedom - a none-too-subtle analogy of America pre-9/11 itself, which of course this film is. From being this interesting study of all the above the film becomes no more than just another chase movie ala 'The Invasion'. Also, there is no real explanation for the Will Smith's character's immunity to the virus, just why was he immune to it? This brings me to the ending...<br/><br/>WARNING - BIG ENDING SPOILER COMING UP (DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM AND DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS) <br/><br/>After all the sacrifices and surviving all the creatures of the night Anna and her child eventually arrive at the place of safety, and, guess what, it is some idealised version of White Picket Fence America, with a White Board Church, Sundrenched Roads, and, naturally, a HUGE American flag fluttering lightly in the breeze. All this surrounded by a massive wall and armed guards, all very symbolic of an America which has defeated all before and is rebuilding itself in an image of a rose-coloured past! Sorry, but considering that the whole world had been affected by the virus surely the place of safety would be something along the lines of the UN, not some sanitised version of an America which had lead to the birth of the virus in the first place. No I did not buy this ending at all, in fact it all but spoilt what had been, up to that point, an enjoyable bit of entertainment."
"ddhiacou","9","1","2","31 January 2008"," Great movie with religious undertones?
","Simply an awesome movie. The graphics were quite good, especially the extent of the detail in the abandoned city of New York. The soundtrack was also really exciting - whenever the zombies were attacking Will Smith the music would always make it that much freakier. Also i loved the idea of putting in some music that was totally contrary to the whole theme of the movie - as soon as i got home from the movie i downloaded Bob Marley's discography (lol). Smith gave a stunning performance - when he felt like crying so did i, when he laughed i joined him...i basically felt what he felt. And the dog was worthy of at least one Academy award! Congrats to the animal training team.<br/><br/>I just wanted to know if there was anyone else that thought this movie has strong religious undercurrents. While they are subliminal at some times, they were quite obvious to me. An example is in the shot through Robert's kitchen, which pans past the fridge. On the fridge is a Times magazine cover with his face on it, and in big writing the word ""Saviour?"" Indeed, it turned out that Smith was the Saviour, and although he didn't necessarily believe in God (as was evident in his argument with Anna), he ends up sacrificing himself to protect the cure for the zombies. And then of course we have Anna, who turns every conversation into a religious one, and has a vision from God that turns out coming true. And lets not forget the famous last words of the movie, composed by Bob Marley - ""Light up the darkness"". Just a thought."
"Lewaris","6","1","2","29 January 2008"," Entertainment only
","A vary popular actor, a big commercial campaign and not much more. The movie is okay, the special effects are art of state of art, the emotions and shock effects well portioned and placed. As far as the acting is concerned there is no complain, and if you are a Will Smith fan you will love watching it since he is the center of the movie.<br/><br/>The bad side of the movie is that a realistic sounding story is mixed with implausible components. The story is used to provide some actions and some emotional scenes but there is no fascination, no message, no passion. My mayor criticism is, that the main person is a stereotypical hero with some flaws as we have seen already in hundreds of movies."

I sat watching this film and looking at my watch far too often. Its not original, is not very well acted. (I like Will Smith but this was the wrong vehicle for him). I found the whole idea that he would not have ventured out of the city hard to swallow especially as he had been attempting to make contact with the outside world for quite a while. If this was the case then surely he would have attempted to find other humans further afield.The scenes showing the city empty and overgrown were impressive but the Zombie like creatures were not and goes to show that CGI is not always the answer to saving a film. 28 days later did it a whole lot better with minimal CGI and much better make up. Perhaps if I hadn't had some irritating person sat behind me asking their partner to explain every bit of the movie I might of enjoyed it more but overall the film was a disappointment. 5 out of 10."

"janevail-1","6","1","2","24 January 2008"," A terrible movie with a very important message
","I was not impressed with I Am Legend  but I encourage you to see it anyway. The message around which the action is built is very important.<br/><br/>I'm very concerned about the direction that medicine has taken over the years. The emphasis today is on masking symptoms instead of curing disease. In some cases during the past couple of decades, scientific advancement has taken a turn to the dark side. Basically, science is neither good nor bad, but the misuse of scientific principles can be deadly. Watch I Am Legend and get a glimpse of what can happen if we play God in our laboratories.<br/><br/>I viewed I Am Legend at the local IMAX. Although no movie experience even comes close to that provided by the IMAX, it didn't help this film. Will Smith is an actor's actor. There's no doubt that his craft made I Am Legend a more positive experience  and I can't forget to mention the dog, Samantha. I was stunned by her acting (probably a combination of offscreen commands and editing but still really amazing). Despite those positive points, I Am Legend is a terrible movie; a predictable storyline with a lone hero standing against certain self-destruction to accomplish the greater good: save all of humankind.<br/><br/>I Am Legend opens with a newscast. A female physician is being interviewed about her discovery: a modified measles virus vaccine that cured the various cancers of all patients who received it. The actress playing the doctor did a remarkable job of portraying the elite smugness of someone who is sure that she has just saved the world; she oozes false modesty. In her short time on screen, she presents all the traits that are dominant in today's medical culture: aloofness, superiority, postured omnipotence, obvious disdain for people whose views don't conform to the standard medical platform, supreme confidence in ""science"" per se, and tunnel vision. Physicians who fit that profile seem not to care about alternative therapies. Actually, they care too much. They care that people don't want to use their drugs, their surgeries, their radiation treatments, or their modified virus strains. They care that increasing numbers of people reject their ""cures"" in favor of better prevention against disease: improved nutrition, sufficient exercise, taking supplements, and seeking out health practitioners whose therapeutic goal is not just the masking of symptoms.<br/><br/>However, I Am Legend makes one point very clearly: ""It's not nice to fool Mother Nature!"" It's part of human nature to presume that we can fix things and change the universe for the better. But how often does our interference cause irreparable damage? We have to be very careful about how we tinker with the natural gifts that we've been given. Playing God is dangerous and usually backfires. I Am Legend takes that warning to a new level by showing us how a manmade virus has the potential to destroy all human life. Of course it's all fiction, but underneath the storyline is the glaring truth that it probably wouldn't take much of a change to destroy all of us. In this movie, that small change is a practically invisible virus, not a massive nuclear detonation.<br/><br/>If you can see I Am Legend at an IMAX, great; it's a sensory experience that you won't soon forget. Don't be disappointed that this movie doesn't really live up to its hype (or its opening weekend box office sales). Will Smith is a wonderful actor, but he can't save a film that is short on meaningful dialogue and long on trumped-up graphics. It's the take-home message that makes this movie well worth seeing."
"threepines","6","1","2","24 January 2008"," Feeling stupid and contagious
","I Am Legend is basically Richard Matheson's unrelentingly bleak novel of loneliness moved to New York and turned into a Rastafarian propaganda vehicle, but still pretty watchable. I mean it definitely has its moments. It has its anti-moments too, though, and the ending sucks like the proverbial vacuum cleaner, but what can you do? Nihilism is dead, I guess, and we've just got to live with that.<br/><br/>The story of the plague is well told. In fact I liked the flashback scenes more than the main story, perhaps because the meta-narrative is so familiar from so many other movies, several of which also starred Will Smith. The daily life stuff is okay as well. The humdrum activities of a man and his dog with nothing much else to do except watch Shrek and find a cure for the cancer cure reminds me of my own life in many ways, although I'm a bit fatter and a lot less pro-active. And of course I don't own a dog. In fact I'd probably just sit around watching TV and eating biscuits until they came for me. In movie terms, I'd be dead or infected halfway through the opening credits, end of story, so it's good that Smith's nameless hero, Lt. Col. Robert Neville M.D., has a bit more get up and go. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him boodle around in the excellent deserted city (they used the set from 12 Monkeys) pursuing deer and other digital effects.<br/><br/>In dramatic terms, the trajectory of the film was the traditional post-Dawn of the Dead mixture of comfortably flat and sickeningly tense. Very up and down. Sort of like the readout on a vital functions monitor. I liked that. I was even getting ready to have watched a really good film by about the one hour mark. But then all indicators flatlined big time with Alice Braga's miraculous appearance, which was a shock I'm not sure I recovered from, and certainly the movie didn't.<br/><br/>That feeling that everyone lost interest half way through the initial story conference. That tacked on sense of pointless hope. The God stuff. Yikes! The kid was good though. Apart from the brilliant dog, he was the most convincingly human character in the movie and the only one who seemed authentically disoriented by the apocalypse, if only because he was so awed by being near Will Smith.<br/><br/>But I'm getting snide, and that's not fair. I mostly enjoyed I Am Legend. It's not perfect by any means, but it's an okay film, looked great, and the first half was really promising. If they'd trusted the novel more (and why on earth wouldn't you trust a story conceived by Richard Matheson?) it might have been wonderful."

You can see him change through out the movie and his emotions are so great that you feel them too. The film has a great ending, it is very realistic and makes you think that the same could maybe happen to us.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film has poor background. You don't know why Will Smith is chosen to ""fix"" the problem, you know very little about him. And another thing that bothers me is the length of the movie, it could have been longer, but that also has its pluses.<br/><br/>All in all the film is great and definitely worth watching."
"xenolupa","6","1","2","17 January 2008"," Awful ending of a mediocre movie
","I'm a big fan of Will Smith. In this movie, he's a mixture of a good guy and a nervous basket case who's cracking down more and more. Will Smith in a zombie movie. Outsmarted by zombies. We have seen much better zombie movies, where the zombies really look convincing, but that's not the case here.<br/><br/>The end is really crazy. He does not want to survive with the two last survivors, but he sends them away to a surprising way out (hey, where did that come from), that would stop the zombies from following them. Will Smith could have gotten away, while still letting the hand grenade explode and let it kill the zombies.<br/><br/>At the end, the two survivors arrive at a huge wall. Other survivors with big military power. But earlier in the movie, we saw the zombies having superhuman strength and speed. They could easily climb that wall! Ridiculous that here's a human stronghold that isn't run over by the zombies. It should be on some island, not here."

","Okay, I gotta be fair. I'm not much of a sci-fi fan. And dystopias are not among my favorite sorts of literature or films. Anyway, I needed to see this movie, just because of what I read in the papers about it. <br/><br/>The first half is just breathtaking. New York City, and no one's home. To see all these deserted streets with Christmas decoration rotting in the hot sun and plants growing over the pavement and buildings was enough to make this film a memorable one. The zombies/mutants were silly though. On the one hand they were supposed to be ""mindless killing machines driven only by their fear to starve"", on the other hand they manage to trap Neville and to set up some kind of a war strategy. The computer animation wasn't very good either. But to be honest: It was enough to tie me to my seat. The best thing about this movie is Will Smith's performance. I knew that he's a good actor. But it's really hard to put this amount of emotional depth into a film about a lonely fighter fighting to survive. I will not forget his grief over the loss of his dog and his attempt to get an answer from a doll in the video store. Or the fear that he puts into his voice when his dog disappears in this dark building.<br/><br/>Even for someone who does not like unrealistic futuristic storytelling this film is a must see. Just because of Will Smith."
"driffma","7","1","2","15 January 2008"," Falls apart in the final act
","I am Legend Review By MaxD<br/><br/>There are only two types of movie reviews that lend themselves to being easily written. Those types are either the very good, or the very bad. I'm not sure if that is an axiomatic but it really ought to be. Writers or readers of movie reviews will either already know this or have deeply suspected it. Harder to write are films that exist somewhere in the middle of that distribution of quality, the almost good or the almost bad. Quite unmysteriously the worse the film the easier the review. I am Legend is closer to good than bad. In fact until an unfortunate, unexpected, and sadly unjustified turn of narrative in the final act I had been about to add it to my list of good science fiction movies of which there has always been a paucity. I am Legend differs markedly from other screen versions of Richard Matheson's story but manages to be just as flawed as those other treatments (Vincent Price's equally passable Last man on Earth and Charlton Heston's dreck Omega Man). That the film has succeeded is more a testament to what is good about it rather than what is not. And its first two acts are engaging. In fact the first two thirds are a testament to the great actor that is the heart of the film. The dog that pals around with him is quite a capable thespian too. It is these two leads that make the film watchable, emotionally moving, and tense. It is the film's final act which turns the once magnificent edifice into a shaky façade that crumbles under the weight of questions any thoughtful viewer will inevitably be forced to ask. Before that terrible turn the film is worth watching for everything that it does right. I am Legend tells the story of the end of the world from the perspective of Lt Col. Dr. Robert Neville, military virologist who even after the end has come and gone continues to work on the cure for what ails it. A disease, the unintentional by product of a miracle drug, has decimated humanity. The pathology of the disease is some strange cross between zombiesm and vampirism. Affected humans seem much less bright and have a zombie's inelegant fashion sense (one may wonder that any clothing would last three years with the kind of wear these creatures put on it) but they like to eat more than brains and become positively beastly at the smell of blood. They also sunburn easily. This is all fine and good. It is a monster movie after all, and done quite well. Where the film really succeeds though is in its vision of a world without us. What would happen if humanity were to suddenly vanish? It is a question the film answers in its stark vistas of an empty Manhattan. Empty streets dominate a city that is rather rapidly being reclaimed by forests and marshes (the island was itself home to numerous rivers and that history still bedevils the city that now stands on the island). White-tail deer roam the car choked streets, birds other than House Sparrow's and Rock Doves flit and sing. It isn't a wasteland unless you are the only human survivor left in the city, and, gregarious primate that you are, crave human contact and interaction. This is all terribly compelling. It is an exercise in good choices. Will Smith's portrayal of one human's descent into the madness of loneliness is wonderful. Neville's experience is hard to describe as miserable, but it seems deeply unfulfilling at the same time. Were it not for the dog and Neville's deer hunts it would be a decidedly joyless exercise in survival. Neville talks to mannequins at a video store that he has obviously arranged, and he seems genuinely to have forgotten this fact. Were they people he once knew? It is a question that is never answered, nor is any answer needed. (Some morons in front of me in theater thought this was the comic relief and not an utterly sad statement on the man's mental state.) There are scenes in which Smith essays terror better than any actor I've seen in years, perhaps ever. His frustration at being unable to find a cure is seen clearly as an extension of his loneliness. Underneath all this is the important work of composer James Newton Howard who is fast becoming my favorite screen composer. A lesser composer would have scored everything. Howard wisely held back. Most of the film lacks a score. It was an excellent choice. It adds to the stark experience of Neville's life. Music is often used to heighten a viewer's emotion. What is often forgotten is that music also consists of the silence between the notes. Someone, I can't remember who, has said this silence it the most important part of all great music. Howard has learned this lesson well. The film doesn't begin to fall apart until its similarity to a better film, Signs becomes utterly apparent. It is the final act and involves two other people. It isn't that is poorly acted. It isn't that the action is un-engaging. On both counts it's really quite good. But there is, I think, an unjustified turn in the narrative. I won't reveal what that is. I'm no spoiler. I will ask a couple of questions though. Why does the author of the universe tend to speak in such obscure language? Why all the codes and easily missed clues? Why do so many people have to die for the completion of said being's designs and games? It seems inelegant and inefficient not to mention capricious, perhaps malicious and certainly stupid. Why didn't the writer of this script pay more attention to Neville's math in the key argument?"
"bandfreak_9","6","1","2","12 January 2008"," Careful... It's Not Like the Book
","The movie was good but the entire time I was zeroed in on how different it was from the book.<br/><br/>1. The Setting: This really isn't an issue but the book is set in LA in like the 70's compared to futuristic NY.<br/><br/>2. The Disease: In the movie the disease is caused by a ""cure"" for cancer. Also the infected in the movie are awake during the day just as long as they're in the dark. In the book the vampires (This word was never used in the movie.)act like vampires (sleep during the day, afraid of garlic, mirrors, and religious items, etc). The major difference here is how Neville kills them; in the book he has to use stakes. Also the infected or vampires (whichever you want to call them) are not completely animalistic in the book.<br/><br/>3. Neville's Past: Neville is immune to the disease because while stationed in Panama he was bitten by a vampire bat. He is not currently part of the army nor is he asked to cure the disease. He's part of a middle class family. His wife and daughter are not killed while escaping from the disease but on two separate occasions. Virginia becomes infected and comes back to life so Robert has to kill her. Neville's daughter dies and her body is burned so she does not come back to life. Sam is completely movie related; there is a dog in the book but Neville never owns him.<br/><br/>These are just a few of the issues between the book and the movie. If you've read the book and want to see the movie I suggest one of the two earlier versions. (I personally think The Last Man on Earth is the best.) If you still must see this movie wait for it to come out on video or at least go in not expecting it to be like the book. If you have not read the book and just want to see the movie I suggest you watch it before reading the book. If you have seen the movie and thought it lacked back story I suggest you read the book."

","Intentionally or not this looks a lot like a remake of the old film ""The Omega Man"". I was very caught up by this film when I as a teen watched it for the first time and again much older saw it for the second time. The keyword is ""atmosphere"" with a lot of tension, the more it can be built up without it looking ridiculous the better. It is important that you ""are alone"" with the main character, that you feel lost with him. I'm thinking that the dog shouldn't even be in the new film. So I have mentioned the old and the new one. My point is that I saw them both and even though Will Smith is one of my favorites and one of the most devoted actors imo the 2007 movie fails to build the atmosphere as good as in The Omega Man. As other people have said, we have seen so many computer generated images that we can tell easily when we see one. It kills it a bit for me having to look at too many cgi's.<br/><br/>All in all its a good movie BUT it was a remake that wasn't better, even though it was made 30 years later and had one the leading actors on this planet.

"JimmyConway2","6","1","2","4 January 2008"," Good/Bad
","To start off, Will Smith, again, doesn't disappoint in anyway. If anything he keeps the film going. He is awesome in everything he is in and nothing has changed here. <br/><br/>The film? I really can't make up my mind about. The idea of the film is amazing. Last man in New York, finding a cure for the deadly virus that turns humans into Zombie/monsters. But I feel that they have seriously rushed it. Missing out bits, putting things in which aren't explained properly. The best example of this is in the form of a question. Has he gone mad or hasn't he? This really isn't explained properly. In the film, every morning he talks to mannequins as if they were real people, this shows that he is going mad because of being on his own for so long. But obviously he hasn't gone mad because he is finding a cure and is able to do everything else properly. The whole ""mannequin"" story is pointless. It just confuses the audience. <br/><br/>The film is good but rushed. Idea good, film bad."
"PWNYCNY","6","1","2","4 January 2008"," Watchable, but not great.
","It's not a great movie but it's a good movie. The premise is simple (thank goodness), somewhat far-fetched (hey, it's Hollywood), and Will Smith is no Tom Hanks (the movie is kind of a take off on Castaway). However, except for a brief lull about two-thirds of the way through the movie where the Neville character is trying to make a point using the music of Bob Marley (which I'm sure will create a surge in people wanting to buy reggae music), the movie is watchable. As usual with most Hollywood movies, special effects are way overblown and after awhile are almost laughable. The dark seekers are frightening, at first, but what's somebody supposed to do when a bunch of them infest your house? This movie shows that if you get sick but lose your mind and regress into something resembling the cross between a screaming banshee and a housefly, you will not only survive but will flourish. Also, Will Smith was miscast for this movie's central role and his character's behavior and overall good mental and physical shape is completely inconsistent with his circumstances which are dire and life-threatening at best. Despite these shortcomings, the movie tells a story and for that reason is worth watching. But Will Smith is not Laurence Olivier and this movie is not Shakespeare. So if you're expecting something with a deep philosophical message, move on to something else."

","If you already know about the novel and/or the ideas behind ""I Am Legend"" you would be excited about it finally being made into a movie.<br/><br/>The set design & scenery of abandoned New York look amazing with Will Smith being the (alleged) only man left alive going where he wants, doing what he wants but always having to check the shadows.<br/><br/>The film leaves questions as to what actually happened (with the occasional flashback showing the contrast of what was and what is) keeping the focus on the present, which for a while works and you start to see the effects of an isolated man in a desperate situation.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is where the story ends and the dodgy CGI kicks in. The zombie/vampire combo's look extremely unrealistic and for some reason seem to have the athleticism of a puma and the strength of a bear - the film quickly goes downhill to its predictable off-the- shelf conclusion.<br/><br/>There are some quality moments and Sam the Dog (Will Smith's sidekick) is awesome (over shadowing Mr Smith) but unfortunately the movie gives up too easily and leaves you wanting more.... mediocre at best."

","Having read the original novel, I expected much from the new film adaptation. The start was promising but that soon faded into a mix of poor and unconvincing CGI work, and a total disregard for any of the books original concepts. <br/><br/>As far as action movies go, it was an OK film, with nothing particularly outstanding, apart from Will Smith, who i felt played his part very well. But as a film adaptation of the book, it was an abomination. Very little from the book made into this film, apart from character names. The locations, and situations have all been changed beyond recognition into a bog standard post-apocalyptic film. Like a lot of book to film tie-ins, this film was corrupted by Hollywood and turned into a clichéd film of heroism and action, rather than kept as a tense thriller depicting a mans desperate struggle for survival. People who have read the book beforehand I'm sure will agree, but for those who haven't it's a film worth seeing, but with little lasting appeal."

Everything coming after that is strange and there is nothing new the producers came up with to make this movie unique. I really like Will Smith as an actor, though in this movie we experience (again, after iRobot) that it is all about his body and his outward appearance rather than his actual ability to act and play a role. There is not much action taking place in the beginning and the middle part of the film. The turning point is somehow the strangest turnover of a movie I've seen and really spoiled the movie instead of making it better. Not worth for seeing it in the theaters, but alright for a DVD evening."

","Maybe I AM LEGEND is just immune to being filmed. This is the third try, and once again close but no cigar.<br/><br/>Visually it's truly amazing. I'm very glad I saw it in a theater and didn't wait for the DVD. The scenes in an abandoned and overgrown Manhattan will take your breath away. Every time the action moved to the streets I kept thinking, How in the world did they do that? And that's just the problem. I shouldn't have been so aware of what a technical achievement it was, and wouldn't if there had been any surprises in the plot.<br/><br/>It's very possible that I just see too many movies (I write reviews for two websites) and that if I were a 'civilian' I might have been more impressed.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance is commendable. If he'd had a stronger script to work with, this would have been even better.<br/><br/>One of the most amazing things about the film was its use of sound. More accurately, the lack of sound. The director wasn't afraid to use silence or just natural sounds like wind and birds to create an effective mood. There is a very sparse musical score. In scenes where it would have been easy to have bombastic music telling us how to feel and response the film's makers trust the audience to make their own connections.<br/><br/>One of the weakest story elements is the flashbacks to the hero's attempts (failed, of course) to get his family to safety. The studio spent $5 million and hired an army of extras to show the chaos of the evacuation. Nope, sorry. Didn't work. The only thing the flashbacks do is break the forward development of the story.<br/><br/>Something I really missed was Neville's relationship with the chief vampire/mutant/whatever, who had been his friend before getting sick. There's a character referred to as Alpha Male, but we know nothing about him before he changed over. The monsters- almost entirely computer generated- are just the fast moving zombies from SILENT HILL and 28 DAYS LATER and RESIDENT EVIL and goodness knows how many other films.<br/><br/>To me one of the most interesting things about DAWN OF THE DEAD (both versions) was, oddly enough, the costuming for the zombies. Nurse, nun, football player, bride, cap and gown, work uniform, Hari Krishna robes, we had a sense of who these people were before the died and came back as mindless killers.<br/><br/>People look down their noses at THE LAST MAN ON EARTH because it was made in Italy on such a low budget, but it is still the most faithful adaptation of the book in many ways. The scene where Neville's wife returns after she has died was hugely effective.<br/><br/>Maybe, as I said earlier, I AM LEGEND really is unfilmable. Having tried with varying results three times, maybe Hollywood will finally give up and move on to other things."

","While the plot was fantastic and flashbacks were masterfully placed, overall this film was much more intense than I expected. In several scenes I was left cowering into my friend's shoulder and regretting bringing my younger sister along. <br/><br/>I felt that the terror was too intense for a PG-13 rating, and I felt very bad for a child of about 9 who ran crying from the theater about half an hour into the movie. This was definitely not a film for children or people who suffer from nightmares. <br/><br/>There are clever nuances which hint at psychological processes deeper than I would have expected from such a violent film, but these were, for the most part, left unexplored.<br/><br/>I give this film a 6 out of 10 for the hints at deeper meaning and the vague yet profound character development.

The storyline was similar to 28 Days Later and stole the fear and devastation of the ""deadly virus"". The problem with this film was that they casted Will Smith. Will is an amazing actor but this role belongs to an upcoming actor who has talent but not fame. While watching this film sometimes you can't take his role seriously because of the entertainment he has done previously. Another problem i had with the film was the infected zombies. They just weren't realistic. You couldn't take the infected seriously because of the CGI. The CGI ruined the whole concept of the infected. However a few scenes did have me concerned and frightened. I also did enjoy the scenes that showed how being isolated can really make you start recreating your life. This movie was an okay movie, but I doubt I will ever be in the mood to see it again. If I am ever in the mood for an apocalypse film, I might as well just watch 28 Days Later and use this as a back up."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Scientist Dr Robert Neville (Will Smith) is seemingly the only human survivor of a deadly virus that has wiped out the whole of civilization. But every day he still sends a message over radio frequencies for other survivors, if there are any, to meet him at the highest sunset point in New York City at midday, as well as still desperately trying to find a cure. But when he loses his only companion he goes mad and tries to kill himself and any zombie he can see...only to be drawn into contact with two other survivors, Anna (Alice Braga) and her young son Ethan (Charlie Tahan) and a final, apocalyptic showdown to save mankind.<br/><br/>You thought a deserted London looked impressive in 28 Days Later (the film this will inevitably be compared to?) Try a deserted New York city for size. This certainly catches your eye in the opening scenes as some overshots eerily show the Big Apple with no people in total silence which really makes you think. And though I'm sure Smith enjoyed being able to zoom around the city as fast as he liked, I'm planning my first ever trip there next year and I didn't appreciate the surprise of what it had to offer being sort of ruined for me. But I'm sure that was the last thing the producers of the film were thinking about when they made it.<br/><br/>Since he's the only thing in it (for the first half of the film, anyway), it might be a good idea to focus on Smith's performance in the film. This is the type of film he does, but this isn't your typical 'blockbuster' film. It isn't driven by special effects, more on eerie silence and imminent threat. And the 15 certificate (which, being a zombie film, it must have got by the skin of it's teeth) bars it being one that will draw in the whole family. He shows his development as an actor here, with a more mature role that requires him to be less showy than he may have used to be. He struggles with some of the more emotional scenes, but a far worse actor could have been doing it. Midway through the film, he's joined by Braga and Tahan as the mother and son pair and this provides a chance for some more tense emotional scenes. Sometimes Smith does wonder into a DVD rental store to talk to some mannequins but it has to be said they are a bit, well, wooden.<br/><br/>The zombies themselves do the usual leap out of nowhere/make you jump kind of thing and they're certainly quite loud but they're not that scary when you see 'em up close and personal. The film also suffers some contrived moments in the script that require some huge suspension of disbelief. It's a slick and glossy film that gets by on a neat use of silence and air of threat but, even being a big Hollywood film, it basques in the shadow of homegrown effort 28 Days Later. That film's great style, look and feel sadly make this one, despite not being bad, look half the film it wants to be. ***"
"wastebot","6","1","2","28 December 2007"," Smith may be legendary, but not the film
","A variation on recent zombie films like Resident Evil and 28 Weeks Later. But it's more isolated/disconnected than either, a lot more. If you can imagine either of those zombie films combined with Vanilla Sky, you'll get a very good feel for how the film comes off. As good as that may sound, it doesn't actually come out as well as either. Like Resident Evil and Vanilla Sky, it's centered all around a single character (acted by Will Smith). Unlike either, the film takes this a step further and Smith is literally the only character, unless you count a dog, for 90% of the film.<br/><br/>In terms of the opening setup and overall story, it's very impressive. There are some annoying product placement moments involving cars and promoting a very bad film that get in the way of what is otherwise a very impressive performance by Smith to make the story feel real. But the story, or the directing, doesn't fill out what Smith filled in, and the result is interesting but not legendary."

","The movie get's an ""eh"" from me.<br/><br/>I appreciated the story well enough, and will smith did his normally fantastic job as an actor. to date i don't think i have ever seen him in anything that i did not like.<br/><br/>However, what really did it in for me was the stupid looking CGI. is Hollywood ever going to learn that computer generated imagery is like make up, it's best used to enhance what is already there, not try to create something that's not.<br/><br/>it took near 2/3 of the film before me and my wife realized that all the ""creatures"" looked like the mummy (the brandon fraiser one)<br/><br/>Would it have been so hard to take a cue from movies such as resident evil, or perhaps 28 weeks/days later and made freakishly evil looking dogs? <br/><br/>Truthfully i don't think i cared much for the movie. while i do know that the story was written way back in the 50's (don't quote me on that), i guess it's just that i have seen successors beyond this that makes me feel like i have heard the story over and over again.<br/><br/>If you want a simple explanation of what this felt like, would simply be to say that it felt like castaway meets 28 days later.<br/><br/>And the story wasn't all that bad but the ending, and apparently i am in the majority on this, was so random and quick and really didn't help the strength of the film any. Now from what i understand, the same thing happens in all three versions of this film, which apparently is the same thing that happens in the book. quite honestly with all that was going on at the time i think that this movie could have deviated from it's predecessors and done something different. it certainly was strong enough to stand on it's own two feet and do that. and it certainly wouldn't have seemed so anti climatic.<br/><br/>So i would say that it while it wasn't bad, it certainly is not worth seeing in theatres (not that it's much of a point to say now as it has nearly run it's course)but might not be bad for a rainy night DVD rental."

","Once again Will smith gives an outstanding performance proving he's an amazing actor despite of what some people say. The monologues and the script overall is very well written and combining that with the great performance gives an atmosphere of true despair! The story was weird and original , not something you see every day! The effects are very well used and the sets overall are fantastic meaning that the movie achieves brilliant levels of realism which make the viewer part of the film and the character of the film. Agony, despair, fear, are some of the feelings displayed in the film and which the viewer also experiences at some points.."

","I am legend is a new look at and apocalyptic epidemic. In the sense of the plot it most closely resembles the still fresh in memory flick: 28 Days Later. In the sense of the quality of the execution it is far better than anything of its kind.<br/><br/>The story follows Robert, a scientist who is, apparently, the only human who remained unaffected by a horrible pandemic that slithered across the world a few years ago. Robert attempts to survive, and at the same time, do something about the situation.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is one of those movies that can serve as the learning material for young directors. It's a masterpiece in its original sense: a professional product that incorporates the best of each acquired skill.<br/><br/>It starts with Will Smith, who is the first sign of the high aim of this production. Since throughout about 90% of the movie the attention is centered on one man, it makes sense to pick carefully, and Will does deliver.<br/><br/>The picture is nicely built. Transitions, like the ones with flashbacks, are particularly notable. There are moments when the camera follows the character around and shakes naturally; there are special angles and zoom-ins.<br/><br/>Special effects are used but not abused. The abandoned city, monsters and explosions are there in the necessary amount and give the movie a distinct flavor.<br/><br/>The sound is one of the most notable things about the movie. It plays a large role in scene transitions and the music really pumps up the excitement of each scene.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a must see, as an important moment in filming history. It's not quite epic, but it's something that works in every aspect."
"pyrovet","9","1","2","27 December 2007"," Will Smith ceases to amaze me
","From his beginning in rap to his TV show up to the great holiday films he is notorious for, Will Smith delivers again. I was skeptical at first wondering if he had the ability to be in a movie all by himself. After taking my girlfriend to see this movie last weekend i am a skeptic no longer.Anyone who even has an inkling to see the movie should do so. I wasn't too hyped on it when I walked out of the theater. After some retrospect and thinking this movie had it all. Special effects could be a little better but other than the CGI this movie was phenomenal.Will Smith is evolving into a real power superstar with every passing movie. If you like movies that make you think what if or make you question your surroundings I suggest this one."

","There are many things that I could say about this movie, but I will just say two words that will sum it up for you...F*cking Amazing! The plot of the movie is the whole worlds been wiped out by a virus which was suppose to cure cancer. Will Smith Character Robert Neville is the last surviving human on the planet. He is living in New York City or as he calls it Ground Zero with his dog Sam (who is boss!). He is not the only thing living in Ground Zero as the virus has mutated some of the infected to mindless cannibalistic monster that only come out at night. The movie shows Will Smith character's every day life in this apocalyptic world and his efforts to survive and find a way of getting rid of the monster that not only plague the streets but his mind to. If you have not seen this movie yet, go see it now! Will Smith pulls all the stops out and reminds people why he is an actor. Watching his every day life and his efforts to survive is truly amazing. It will make you go ""dude"". The effects in it are boss and watching Will Smith hunting in Time Square is a thing that you could never get tired of watching! All I can say is go and see it now! I will give it 8 out of 10."
"eternalsea","7","1","2","27 December 2007"," Entertaining Will Smith flick, but not as good as the book
","I Am Legend 2007, 101mins, 15 Director: Francis Lawrence Cast includes: Will Smith, Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan, Salli Richardson, Willow Smith, Dash Mihok<br/><br/>Written in 1954 Richard Matheson's I Am Legend is among my favourite books ever. The text is in novella format and yet along with Orwell's Animal Farm it never ceases to amaze me how potent and utterly brilliant the book is, within it's tiny format I Am Legend achieves more than the entire Harry Potter saga. It's been filmed thrice, during the 50's with Vincent Price in the lead and entitled The Last Man On Earth, twenty years later this time with Charlton Heston in the Omega Man and now in 2007 with Will Smith in the first production to maintain the sources name. Funnily for such a fan of the book this is the first adaptation I've seen, it's pleasing to see the pages brought so fluently to life on the silver screen, but in terms of book to movie transfers it's Lord Of The Rings light. The story for those unaware is that of Robert Neville (Will Smith) a brilliant Government scientist, and as of five years ago the last man on earth. The world has become thronged with vampire cum zombie monsters, a consequence of a virus that hit half a decade ago turning people into these rabid and senseless villains. They can only operate in dark and so during the day New York is Robert's playground, by night he's reduced to hiding in his sealed off house. Neville is trying desperately to find a cure and reverse the disease that has turned his fellow human sinto shadows of their former selves, but whilst he may be immune the monsters are keen to taste his blood. I Am Legend is directed by Constantine helmer Francis Lawrence, the man exhibits the same strengths he did in that picture, the visuals of New York he conjurs up are eerie yet awesome and he builds up a strong central character well. Given that the source is better and that on this occasion he's blessed with the ever watchable Smith instead of Keanu ""forest"" Reeves he still deserves a pat on the back for getting these elements so perfectly zoned. I can only do this review from the perspective of one who has read the text and so one of my biggest issues surrounds that, so if you're a Matheson virgin and intend to stay that way (why you would is beyond me...) bump the picture's rating up to 8/10. However there is one universal flaw and thats with the presentation of the infected, in a post 28 Days Later world these weird looking super goblins just aren't that scary and we don't really see enough of them to think otherwise. The CGI surrounding the creatures is by turns good and by turns bad. The deer we see Neville hunting in New York look great and one scene in a darkened warehouse features some fine use in terms of creating the zombies. In the better lit scenes however they aren't convincing enough, and the creature design is dubious to say the least. The film does have a fnatastic performance from Smith and in a later plot development Alice Braga. So far based on other performances this year I wouldn't hesitate to give Smith an Oscar nomination and whilst Braga isn't present for long enough she at least deserves hearty credit. The two carry the film superbly and if ever a category for ""best performing animal"" opens up Sam Nevilles dog deserves a look in. The connection between Dog and man is engaging and fantastic, this is one of the deviations from the book I thought worked well. Some of the other changes don't however feel as satisfying, the way in which Nevilles family perish (shown through flashback) is unconvincing and slightly clichéd and at times one feels to much is absent. In the book at least one villain is built up, here we get virtually nothing. The finale is also slightly altered, more upbeat but not in a senseless Hollywood way. The change feels fine on the big screen and is still far grimer than most endings within it's respective genre. The action is well done and there are some scenes that are pure action, others purely horror. The book doesn't contain many of these but in the end with a Will Smith Holiday movie they where going to be essential. In the end I enjoyed most of them and they complimented the fantastic cinematography well, but again there was more within the source material than big bangs and awe inspiring landscapes. In the end I Am Legend is an above average film and given the recent output like Eragon and The Dark Is Rising it's a way above average page to screen adaptation. However one feels that Cinematography, Will Smith and Alice Braga to the side the film would be a lot weaker which suggested heavily that the material has been slightly mishandled. It's more than strong enough to carry itself yet here it feels a little patchy. The movie is good entertainment and features a great central performance but it isn't legend. Richard Matheson's book on the other hand most certainly is."
"shadowman123","8","1","2","27 December 2007"," Whole new meaning to concrete jungle...
","I had my reservations about watching I Am Legend as Will Smith's last sci-fi attempt which was I Robot was Luke warm at best although it did raise some very interesting philosophical questions. However as the holiday season roles on I was still on my anti-Christmas crusade and I for one was glad for checking this movie out on Boxing Day. This for me has to be again another one of Will Smith best performances! His portrayal of a man who is all alone is moving yet sometimes emotional hard to watch and as time goes on it becomes more and more easy to sympathise with as we see the desperation of this man unfold. The setting and the scenery of NYC was done very nicely which made it feel very bleak and depressing . Having said that I felt that there were some good usages of CGI although I do personally feel that a little bit too much was used and that kind of dampened the enjoyment . Another thing was that the movie might of dragging on in some minor places and the ending just felt a little too rushed but having said that Will Smith was the man who carried the whole movie on his shoulders. To conclude I Am Legend is a dull, bleak and uncompromising vision into the future which again beckons more questions to be asked and really gives a vision of a cold unforgiving version of a concrete jungle, it was also a nice change from the typical post apocalyptic genre and makes a nice edition to it with its uniqueness although I don't know how they kept it in spirit of the book but I shall check that out as well. Highly recommended for those who are not in the festive mood and for fans of the sci-fi/end of the world genre as it will keep you firmly in your seat.<br/><br/>I AM LEGEND: 8.6 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>THE LAST MAN ON EARTH IS NOT ALONE..."

","I was sort of dragged into the cinema by my dad to watch this movie before my holidays were over.At first i thought is was just another ""Resident evil"" ripoff. As i watched the opening scene, i was became interested. It seems that Colonel Robert(Will Smith) is the last man in the city. His only companion is, Sam his dog. As the story unfolds we find out that the city had been infected with a virus and why Robert is the only man there.(Watch it to find out why) So Robert and his companion stays in the city as he finds a cure and other surviving people, if there were.As almost everyone is a living flesh eater.<br/><br/>Will Smith delivers a top-notched performance in this film, as he survives in this lonely city. He drives emotion in the hearts of the audience and I love it.Though the movie a little short but it gives us a huge impact, whether this may happen to the real world in the future. And it is a little different from ""Resident Evil"" if i might say. <br/><br/>Go Watch It!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"nefertari86","8","1","2","26 December 2007"," Loved it
","A good look at a man-made apocalypse situation.<br/><br/>My one complaint is that I found the scientific accuracy to be uneven. From the very beginning it was dubious with Emma Thomson's cameo as the scientist who genetically modified a common virus and produced what she thought would be the cure for cancer. The cameo is a news program interview, which, of course, features an everyday analogy for the benefit of lay audiences, however, I found myself saying out loud ""that comparison made absolutely no sense!"" One thing which bugged me was that the main character Robert Neville seemed firmly convinced that the ""Dark Seekers"" were not at all human anymore, but it was clear that they were still displaying human intelligence when they copied the design of a trap he used to capture one of them. It was also unrealistic in that they seemed to have super human agility, because, while obvious that the Dark Seekers' metabolic rate is much faster, they're still in human bodies. Although, I'm willing to forgive that because I'm well aware that much accuracy is a bit too much to expect from Hollywood.<br/><br/>What I liked most was the thoughtful details which are not explicitly stated, some of which you might actually miss the first time you see the movie. The main one is the vacant New York City, the trees and grass growing over aged Christmas decorations and Broadway billboards. It's incredibly sad because it's a reminder that everyone is dead, and yet there's so much green and you can hear birds singing so in a way it's more beautiful than the real New York City is. Another one is in later scenes when you realize that the paintings in Neville's livingroom are, not only classics by artists such as Tousseau and Van Gogh, but are actually the originals (which he presumably salvaged from one of the NY museums). This fact, however, is never discussed or even really noticed by any of the characters.<br/><br/>The power of the film is, of course, Will Smith's performance. He brings emotional drama as well as comic relief due to the fact that his character is a little nutty (though after watching all of NYC die and spending 3 years alone, who could blame him?). He ends up being somewhat of a Christ figure, but he's a very flawed character. During the flashbacks as well as the later scenes when two other survivors finally find him, he seems overly stubborn and his quest to cure the disease more like a personal obsession than a noble aspiration to save humanity. In the end you find that you'd rather be there with him in the middle of the city, instead of in the pastoral ""survivors community"" that is revealed at the very end."
"GB_Koolio","7","1","2","26 December 2007"," A compelling story wrapped inside a decent film (CAUTION: Contains spoilers)
","I must say, I was expecting this film to be quite the action-thriller after viewing the previews. I have never read the book, but both the book and film certainly contain one of the most elaborate and compelling stories of all time, and therefore because of this, a phenomenal, epic film, must be produced, right? Well, kind of.<br/><br/>To me, I Am Legend is one of those movies that looks really, really good when watching the previews, but when you actually see the movie, it turns out to be just decent but not excellent. The plot is easily one of the most wicked plots a movie has ever had, and the film did indeed deliver on the intense action-sequences and suspense, but I personally didn't think that all of the characters were given enough time to develop an emotional attachment with the audience. If a character, especially a major character, never makes that connection with the viewers, then the character may as well not even exist. Lack of character development is easily one of this film's biggest drawbacks.<br/><br/>Also, most movies, especially sci-fi thrillers with 'perilis' elements to them, have happy endings despite the suspense. I Am Legend didn't have a very happy ending; in fact, the ending left you wanting so much more. Perhaps lack of a more fairy-tale type ending is a stupid thing to complain about, but do you really want to leave your audience feeling down and depressed when it's all over? The fact that Robert Neville, the proverbial hero of the movie, committed suicide to save that woman and child is admirable but horrible. Also, Neville having to kill his only partner, his beloved dog, because she was infected was quite tragic as well. And, what ever happened to his family for crying out loud? Did they die? Were they saved? The movie never makes this very clear either. All that you're left with when it's all said and done is a woman telling you that Neville is a hero because he destroyed all the remaining infected people. Perhaps that wouldn't be so bad if you actually had cared about her and her kid. Neither one of them were featured in the movie long enough for the audience to give a rip about the seemingly only core survivors that had lines in the movie. So, the ending could have been considerably better.<br/><br/>All and all, probably the only major things that held this movie back from being an all-time-epic was its lack of story telling, lack of character development and morbid nature. I understand that horror movies are morbid, but this was really more of a sci-fi suspense thriller with horror elements. Unlike many horror movies, you were able to get emotionally attached to some of the characters and therefore you cared when they were in danger or what have you.<br/><br/>I give this film a 7 out of 10 for some awesome action sequences and phenomenal suspense, I just wish Neville had survived and that he was reunited with his family. It sucked that he wasn't. I would also recommend this movie to anyone who loves explosive action and intense, jump-out-of-your-chair moments, but don't look for tons of character depth or storyline development. I Am Legend is one of those movies that you can go see in the theater and enjoy it, but not necessarily purchase on DVD months later."
"guyjones007","8","1","2","26 December 2007"," Excellent Story, acting and visuals. A definite hit.
","Not your run of the mill undead/zombie/vampire film. Reminds me of a more personal 28 Days Later. Excellent story even if it the genre has been milked for all its worth, this film combines enough personal storyline that the action sequences really complement the story without making it an all out scare and gore fest.<br/><br/>On an acting note, Will Smith (Neville) was brilliant throughout. I would definitely say one of his best performances to date. Not sure about Alice Braga (Anna) so much, but then her screen time was incredibly limited.<br/><br/>Visually the film was excellent. CG was limited, which is always nice to see in a big budget film. The look of a deserted NYC was very striking. The Dark Seekers were very realistic, although a later reveal in the film of a whole body shot seeker would have worked better going with the old rule of the villain you don't see is more effective/scary.<br/><br/>Camera work was right up there with some of the greats. Epic long shots of NYC really showed Neville's loneliness in such a hostile environment. Particularly good use of close up shots to pick up on are in the action sequences in the buildings. Tie this in with scarce yet very effective sound work made some of the action sequences and scares jump out of seat intense.<br/><br/>Use of exposition through dialogue is very limited, again a nice change for this genre. you are kept guessing about a number of points throughout the film and when you leave the theatre."

"shaneo632","7","1","2","25 December 2007"," Smith dazzles in an above-average sci-fi romp...
","Shaun Munro's Film Reviews (www.shaunmunro.co.uk): <br/><br/>Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend is the latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel (which has already been put onto film twice), starring Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville, who may well be the last man on Earth. Neville is charged with reversing the effects of a botched cancer cure that killed 90% of the world's population, leaving 1% immune, and turning the other 9% into ""dark seekers""  mutated beasts that wish to feed on any living humans they can find.<br/><br/>Following a welcome cameo from the wonderful Emma Thompson (as the doctor who started the whole mess), we press on to three years later, where the entire world is seemingly desolate, ravaged by the effects of the ""Krippin virus"". Is such a post-apocalyptic setting conventional, with its overturned cars, and its litter-filled streets? Absolutely, but the buck stops there, as the film's introduction is anything but rudimentary  I Am Legend is not a film filled with dialogue, and the opening fifteen minutes is curiously, adventurously devoid of speech almost entirely. Given how Smith's character is alone in New York City, with nothing but his dog for company, it is commendable that screenwriters Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman chose not to have Smith regurgitate an inner monologue, which would only serve to insult seasoned cinema-goers. Instead, Neville simply has occasional, ever-believable banter with his dog, which serves not to progress the plot, but to telegraph Neville as the sympathetic character that he is.<br/><br/>The seeming emptiness of the opening scenes reflects the drudgery and loneliness of Neville's own existence  each night he is forced to lock himself away in his home, sleeping in the bathtub with his rifle at his side. All Neville has left is his dog, and at one point early on, he enters into a dark, potentially dangerous building in order to search for her after she runs away. In similar fare (such as Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake), risking one's life to such lengths to rescue a pet seems ridiculous and non-sensical, yet in this paradigm, whereby Neville's mental state cannot be ascertained, and he has no other living contacts, diving into the abyss for a hound doesn't seem so insane.<br/><br/>In a brief series of flashbacks, we learn of Neville's loneliness and personal torture to an even greater extent. Neville has endured unspeakable family atrocities, and such interludes aid in envisioning him as a truly, uncomprisingly sympathetic character. Neville is a tortured soul of the greatest variety, and combined with Smith's moving performance, we are presented with an affecting, highly driven character that the audience can support for reasons other than the usual star power and recognisable face.<br/><br/>Robert Neville is, in many aspects, an unconventional action hero. Neville is a uniformly Hollywood-esquire scientist, in that he is muscular, yet when faced with volatile situations, he breathes heavily, and he shakes  he is scared, and more often than not, he will flee in the face of danger rather than stand his ground in rather gung-ho fashion and unleash his rather hefty rifle. Only when faced with even more personal tragedy does Neville turn into rent-a-kill, and even then, it is understandable considering the gravity and emotional impact of his loss, and moreover, his true motives (such as his care for his own wellbeing) are unclear.<br/><br/>To this effect, there are a surprising amount of genuinely affecting, heartfelt moments in I Am Legend. Following a savage, brutal attack, in which Neville is faced with a heartbreaking choice (with an unexpectedly disturbing payoff), Neville is left empty and shell-like  he sustains emotional bankruptcy beyond measures he believed possible, and it appears to be this tragedy which drives the climax, rather than the other, ham-fisted way around, to the film's further credit. The sadness of the situation is furthered by Smith's entirely convincing turn, particularly in a rental store scene, where he, in his jaded loneliness, begs the various mannequins scattered around the store - ""Please say hello to me!"". In the hands of a lesser actor, such a scene would have fallen flat and appeared preposterous and histrionic, yet Smith, the ever-underrated actor that he is, digs down deep and packs his performance with the appropriate emotional wallop that it dictates. Smith claims that preparing for I Am Legend was his most challenging turn since Ali, and given the surprising emotional depth of his character, one need not wonder why.<br/><br/>The film's third act is a tonal departure from the preceding hour  Neville's environment is altered drastically, and in doing so, brings with it a wealth of clichés, metamorphosing a minimalist, restrained survival film into an overblown, rudimentary horror endeavour. The scenes in which Neville makes his most important discoveries are also the most conventional, dabbling in a dash of deus ex machina, and transforming plot-driven action into action-driven plot. The final moments, whilst wonderfully lit and a tad inspiring, are typical of such films, and whilst Neville's actions in the film's final moments are unassailably heroic, it failed to convince logically. I Am Legend's final act of violence works more as a reason to cause a lot of explosions rather than to paint a universal picture of heroism, yet when one considers Neville as a character, and what he has been through, it is a considerably more acceptable, yet nevertheless frustrating creative decision.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a rarity  it is a mainstream Hollywood action thriller that packs an authentic emotional punch, and allows Smith, holding the picture solely on his broad shoulders, to demonstrate his acting credentials with flare and zest. The film suffers from some incredibly hokey visual effects, and the film's third act seems to undermine the inventive preceding hour, yet as far as high-concept action fare goes, I Am Legend is a cut above the average."

","Pardon the pun, but I usually avoid remakes like the Plague.They always seem so cynically predictable: every 20 or 30 years (or less) a studio decides to milk a cash cow again. Never mind that the original was perfectly good, and stands up to the test of time.<br/><br/>""The Omega Man"" way back in 1971 was a perfectly good take on Richard Matheson's novel. Indeed, this film is partially based on both the book, and the Omega Man screenplay. But, scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"") elevates the material, as it were, and delivers a screenplay to Will Smith and director Francis Lawrence of searing dramatic intensity and believability.<br/><br/>This is Will Smith's finest work to date. He brings an emotional range to his acting that I thought only Russel Crowe could deliver. And Will carries this movie for a full three quarters with only a dog and CG animation to react against. An astounding performance, but one that likely won't get recognized, because this is nominally ""science fiction"".<br/><br/>As Ron Moore's Battlestar Galactica has shown us, SF can deliver the best drama there is, and ""Legend"" joins that elite club.<br/><br/>I also want to comment on the ending, the finale, the point where most films, especially American films, fail to deliver. Not ""Legend"": the climax is satisfying and dramatically appropriate.<br/><br/>Directors like Steven Spielberg, who's ""War of the Worlds"" was just the sort of mindless, paint by numbers film that I abhor, should look at this film and see how important it is for the creators to care about what they are doing, rather than cynically engaging in cinema as market survey.<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" is one of the best films of the year."

","Years ago, THE OMEGA MAN scared the bejeezus out of me, then again, I was young and even seeing somewhat dated visions of an empty world and rather badly done shots of people collapsing from a viral attack, still scared me. I AM LEGEND, which is the third movie based on the Matheson book, I Am Legend, really is scary for the here and now and thanks to some inventive photography and CG effects, we see a grim but fascinating vision of a completely abandoned New York City from the get-go. A well intentioned virologist Dr Krippen(played uncredited by Emma Thompson) in a news clip as the film's opening production tags play, shows a quick ""human interest"" story as a TV host talks innocently(and somewhat disbelievingly) with her, about her success with ""curing cancer with a genetically engineered 'friendly' Measles virus"" and that this was administered to over 10,000 cancer patients who are now ""Cancer free"". Cut to three years later and a dead, overgrown NYC with Will Smith speeding around it in a new Mustang(In THE OMEGA MAN, Chuck Heston sped around LA in a new 1972 Mustang, one of the film's many homages to it's predecessor) we see the extent of Krippen's horrible mistake to mess with and trust the nature of viruses-which can do mutate without prediction. Will Smith is Robert Neville, military virologist who witnessed the end of mankind-he's watching a tape of news as the illness begins to mutate and media is becoming alarmed. Krippen's Virus had a bizarre side effect-it mutated and became a contagious, airborne rabies-like illness that either kills outright or drives it's victims to become rage-filled, blood/fluid drinking mutants who hide in the shadows and only come out at night. (In THE OMEGA MAN it turned them into psychotic hippies called ""The Family"" styled after Charles Manson who was still hot news at the time-films are products of their own time) The virus spread very fast as we see in quick flashbacks(Omega Man was told in several flashbacks as effective). Mannequins play a role in THE OMEGA MAN, and they do in I AM LEGEND.<br/><br/>It is Smith's amazing acting talent that holds one riveted. It did me. The ""mutants"" are styled after the running infected in 28 DAYS LATER the only difference-and the film's drawback-is that too much CGI is used here and we're now so used to seeing CG in movies, that it appears that is what it is. In 28 DAYS LATER and it's sequel 28 WEEKS LATER, dancers were used as the running, screaming rage infected victims to much better effect. The CG FX shine in the visions of a ruined NYC, with grass and weeds everywhere, wildlife roaming, and destroyed bridges thanks to the military quarantine of the city. Obviously, it did little good as we overhear in a flashback, the President saying that ""every major world city has taken the same action"". Smith reminds us later, in dialog, ""nothing was supposed to happen the way it did"" It's a frightening vision, and I think the point being made was if, in reality, the Bird Flu hit and became easy to transmit, such scenes of sheer pandemonium, in larger cities would not be so much fiction. It's a terrific film."
"tellmetales","7","1","2","25 December 2007"," Better than expected
","saw this movie last night on Christmas Eve. The cineplex had a typical holiday eve crowd and my wife and I were there to see a typical holiday season movie - big bankable star, trailers that seemed to indicate standard low brow science fiction-ish stuff: Big Budget effects, Will Smith showing off his buff body, totting gun, shooting at ghoulish looking creatures, crashes, screams, the works. Boy, was I mistaken.<br/><br/>I am Legend is a rollicking ride, but not the one you would expect. Robert Neville (Will Smith) is a survivor from a cancer vaccine gone bad that has infected the world and may just be the the last surviving human on earth. The rest of humanity is either dead or transformed by the virus from the vaccine into flesh eating hyperactive monsters that are allergic to light and therefore emerge from the shadows only at night. How Robert survives while attempting to create a cure for the virus constitutes the main plot of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie flows nothing like a mainstream blockbuster (which most certainly it will be). For the majority of the movie, Will Smith is the only human character around and he entertains himself by talking to his dog, hitting on female mannequins in video rental stores, hitting golf balls from an aircraft carriers into New York city and (best of all) gathering corn and hunting game in a deserted and now overgrown downtown Manhattan. The only hint of menace in his seemingly pleasant routine comes when his watch alarm reminds him that nightfall is at hand and he rushes home to barricade himself from the marauding monsters and to work on a cure for the virus.<br/><br/>The movie has several things going for it. First, this is a great suspense movie. Like all good horror/suspense movies, it understands that what is lurking in the shadows or just out of our field of vision can scare us far more than any horrific sight that the filmmakers can conjure up. The moments in 'I am Legend' that are truly scary (and there are several) come from what we don't see rather than what we can. Second, hard as it may be to believe the movie can be quite philosophical if you know how to look. The thought of being the last human being on earth while being deeply unsettling also raises questions about god and our existence. The movie does not spend too much time on it, but the eerie loneliness of the streets of New York and the screams of the monsters in the night outside Robert's house force us to ask what it would be like to be all alone and whether we already are not. Third and last, Will Smith who has grown from film to film over the last several years has turned in a great performance as a man focused on the job at hand while being tormented by great and unusual adversity.<br/><br/>Net, I am Legend is definitely worth a watch. Regardless of what you expect - a holiday potboiler like I did, a mindless action flick or a deep and powerful action adventure - you are likely to leave the cinema with a little more than you bargained for."
"jkamal","9","1","2","25 December 2007"," ""Outstanding"" is putting it lightly
","I have recently been under the suspicion that good films are no longer made and that profit is the sole motivation for modern filmmakers. I am relieved to discover that there are still films that go beyond drugs, sex, and violence to impress audiences. ""I am Legend"" is one of those films.<br/><br/>In the film, Dr. Robert Neville, an army colonel and a scientist, survives a worldwide viral outbreak due to his natural immunity. He spends three years alone with his dog Sam searching for a cure while hiding from hoards of infected humans trying to kill him. He spends his days trying to live as normally as possible (except for the casual deer hunt) and rides out the nights when the infected creatures roam free. Every day, he tests potential cures for the virus to no avail. His life changes when he discovers that he is not the only human immune to the virus as a woman and her son join him and subsequently compromise his hiding place. Neville must survive and discover the cure that only he can find.<br/><br/>I was worried at first that director Francis Lawrence, who is known to favor action over plot, would make this into another ""Resident Evil"" but surprisingly, he did not. The plot was very well thought out and events were put together in a non-confusing order that adheres to the standards of continuity editing. The greatest challenge in writing the script for this kind of film is giving enough back story and relevant events to the audience without overwhelming or confusing them.<br/><br/>The very first scene, featuring the interview with the virus researcher, sets the foundation for the rest of the action and hints to the audience why a man is all alone in New York City. Casual flashbacks to New York in panic, which are spread out over the duration of the film, offer us bits and pieces of the puzzle instead of leaving us high and dry or telling us everything up front. The plot was very unpredictable; you could not anticipate what was to happen next and if you tried, you soon found out you were wrong.<br/><br/>Knowing that the film featured zombie-like creatures, I was once again dreading that it would be another ""Resident Evil"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"". However, the creatures in this film were intelligent, or at least they seemed to be getting more intelligent to the audience's dismay. We find comfort in knowing that we are at least smarter than they beast-like creatures, in this film, however, the fear of brute violence is amplified with the fear of facing monsters that can use cunning and have problem-solving abilities. Though some of the creatures were portrayed using real actors, the majority were computer generated. Though this allows them to perform superhuman stunts, it takes away from their horrific effect. Let's face it, no matter how true-to-life animation gets, we can still spot it and convince ourselves that it's not real. The appearance of the creatures was truly terrifying: I was shaking during the scene where Dr. Neville (Smith) discovers one of their dark shelters and gets attacked by them.<br/><br/>*Major spoiler warning* Will Smith was absolutely brilliant in this film; I have never seen him perform better. He creates a sense of camaraderie with the viewer especially after the death of his dog and closest friend Sam. During the scene where Neville murders him (since he became infected), the theatre went silent except for the sound of sobbing. I have not cried in a film since Titanic and this one drags on that heartache for as long as possible to show audiences that they are not as desensitized as they thought.<br/><br/>This film will make you laugh, cry, and grip your seat in suspense. It is definitely worth the admission ticket and will leave you fully satisfied. If you are a fan of horror, sci-fi, suspense thrillers, or epics, go see this film."

","My stomach muscles were tight as I waited with dread until the viral mutants were revealed. Then I was even more overwhelmed. No chain saw mock killers here. The upbeat ending to the end result of mass vaccinations to 'prevent' a disease that the majority of us will not get was to be expected.<br/><br/>This movie took me immediately to the theme of a book I just read - The Black Bug: The Genetic Bomb - which deals with the same theme of viral doom after mass vaccinations, this time Of Black Africans. I thought though that the suspenseful ending of The Black Bug was more horrifying and I still recoil from the ending. No pollyanna there. The vaccines for young girls - I have two - to prevent the low incidence of cervical cancer is also foodfor much thought especially after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>I Legend is a scary sucker of a movie without the comic blood splatter of the 'horror' movie. This is thoughtful SF and social commentary. See it and check out the book I mentioned if you like the movie."

","Being a big fan of the Richard Matheson Sci-Fi Horror book of the fifties, I wanted to really like this. Especially after hearing all the talk of it being an art house movie using the big visual effects to frame it. Unfortunately, this rumour was true for the first half of the film. There is much to like during these earlier scenes.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the solitary nature of Neville's existence and the relationship between him and his anthropomorphized companion- a dog named after his son. Its truly touching- and without the dog doing any silly Lassie heroics! The FX are used well to show the deserted concrete jungle, the rampant wildlife and nature slowly swallowing New York city.<br/><br/>So far so good. I could accept the tinkering with a few of the books various premises and the actual source of the virus that has decimated the planet to create the legions of vampiric survivors, who are ruled by their desire for blood above all else. However,there is too much messing around with the books better ideas; and tragically the heart and soul of Matheson's message. It should have changed the name of the character and title of the film much like the 70's version- ""The Omega man""- did.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film slowly unraveled before my eyes. The decision by the makers to go with CGI vamps and dogs is a tradegy- not too mention a total waste of the budget. It totally messes with the very real feel to the set up and the belief in the man ""monsters"". I feel the director was worried it would end up looking more like 28 days later and its sequel- two films which also borrow heavily from the ""I Am Legend"" concept of Matheson's book. This reviewer would have preferred if it had been more like those films!<br/><br/>If these vamps were people once, then why not have people running about and then simply use a combination of physical FX with a little CGI to ""twist"" the visual appearance of them. The cartoony nature of the final half of the film destroys the credible first half efforts.<br/><br/>Will Smith acts really well for the most part, but as it goes on, little ""Willism's""- the one star of the film basically saying "" Its still me ya-all, Big Willie style"" moments,namely the ""trying to sing"" moment and word for word act-a-long of Shrek.<br/><br/>The big deviations from the book- the comically unreal vamps cannot speak at all; and Neville's meeting with other survivors- cost this film dearly.<br/><br/>One of the reasons the book is so good is because it does not compromise the reality of a sole survivors story. The bleakness, solitude and slow self-destructing madness that would set in. The realization that they are no longer the freak- you have become the minority and are now ""their"" monster. The ending is a near on total cop-out! This being a big star vehicle, there has to be light at end of the tunnel. Not only that, but the phrase "" I Am Legend"", which was given a very specific and heartfelt explanation in the novella, is totally altered to fit this new ending!<br/><br/>If you want a comparison to this kind of Hollywood tinkering ,see the original Dutch version of ""The Vanishing"" and then the American remake to get an idea of what I mean!"
"djray65","5","1","2","23 December 2007"," where are the soul zombies with afros?
","Another ho-hum so called blockbuster staring Will Smith. As an actor Mr. Smith delivers the goods, however the story is so-so at best. In the end it is a re-telling of the 1971 movie ""Omega-man"", staring Charlton Heston., just with better special effect and CGI. OK in a nutshell; scientists engineer a super virus that destroys humanity and reduces mankind to sub dwelling zombies. Sounds good, hu? Well it could have been better. I for one enjoyed the 1971 version. How can you hate a zombie with a giant white Afro? ""Soul zombie"" Will Smith is a military research doctor trying to find a cure for the virus. Some how he is immune to the zombiefying effects of the K-something virus. I had a lot of problems with the story line. For one, why would you isolate your self on an island, in this case Manhattan, with flesh eating zombies? I would have taken' my butt to Brooklyn and did my research work from a safe place. Will Smiths character lived smack in the middle of zombie ally in a fortified house with a lot of zombie traps. Every time I see one of these zombie movies, I can never under stand why the hero does not build a mote around his house. Zombies can't swim. Any way, Will Smith was good in this, but not god enough to receive my hard earned $12. All in all, it was an OK movie, not great or even very good. I would wait for it on DVD. If you crave good doomsday, end of civilization zombie action, rent 28 days later. 28 weeks later is not bad ether."

","The movie was not bad, but there is nothing to make me say it was cool. I would recommend it to some of my friends, but not any of them that like the classic type of film making. A lot of the story elements were not followed through on. I think the coolest thing was seeing NYC all broken down. Since that is the best thing about the movie then I would not call it a great movie. But it was entertaining. The action was OK and the special effects were not the best. The creature effects were not great. I think Will Smith did a decent job, but for the most part I do not see any range in him as an actor (I have not seen the Hurrican yet to be fair to him). The dog part was touching, but I think that is just because I love dogs so much. The end was pretty stupid and I was like why did it have to end that way. I do not know how the book ended, but I think there could have been a little less Hollywood ending. It seemed like the producers wanted a non-Hollywood ending, but it was still producers asking for a non-holiday ending. The coolest thing that the movie never touches upon is that the vampires get smarter and are learning. I like how they did not actually make them vampires, but just vampire like, but I think that is more of an element from the book. In the end it was pretty unsatisfying. I do not think I would watch it again, unless I have a bunch of friends that insist on it."

The second half it has more action but the ending of the movie is very, very different from the book and I prefer the book's ending instead.<br/><br/>Will Smith play very well his movies. When I watched him years ago in Fresh Prince of Bell Air I would never expected him playing such a dense characters like the one in this movie so well. He did a really good job.<br/><br/>Special Effects and scenarios is very nice. All the vampires are CGI (computer generated images) of course but it's very good.<br/><br/>The ending is a little frustrating and I think it compromised the general result of the movie. It's ending is something like Independence Day's ending ... quite happy and full of hope. The ending of the book have intelligent vampires creating a new society and than contaminating the characters too for becoming part of their new society.<br/><br/>Well, I think this movies worth the price of the ticket and I recommend it.

","In the year 2009, Earth's scientists made a major breakthrough when they thought they discovered a cure for cancer.

Dr. Robert Neville is a former military scientist and the last remaining survivor of the outbreak. Alone in New York City and accompanied by his faithful canine, he conducts extensive research to find a possible cure for the disease during the day, but at night he must go into hiding to avoid the threat of being infected. Apocalyptic thriller is unavoidably reminiscent of the eerie 28 Days Later, at times even feels like a horror take on Cast Away, but it builds plenty of suspense, features superior special effects, exciting action scenes, and goes a long way on the strength of Smith who creates genuine pathos as a lone and resourceful survivor. Only letdown: the third act, which leaves one too many questions unanswered and settles for a conventional finale. A decent way to pass the time, though not recommended for anyone who isn't a fan of the lead actor. **½"

Neville was involved with the so-called cancer cure that wiped out billions of people.<br/><br/>We can see that because of Neville's insistence and rank pulling, his family boarded an ill-fated helicopter...not his fault but nevertheless, they perished.<br/><br/>We know for a FACT that Neville kidnapped and experimented on scores of people, causing excruciating pain and horrific death.<br/><br/>We know for a FACT that Neville was a exceptional military officer trained in survival and lethal combat and possessed an assortment of assault rifles, handguns, mines, and grenades.<br/><br/>We know for a fact that Neville was trying to kill a deer and caused the deer to be killed by the lion.<br/><br/>We know for a fact that Neville and his dog invaded a resident's home (hive) looking to kill a deer but after being run out, decide to kidnap what turns out to be the queen. After he brutally knocks her unconscious right in the face of the king, things fall apart, as they should have.<br/><br/>This sick insane Neville even shoots up Fred (a mannequin) after taunting him for not being a real person for pete's sake and then turns and sprays bullets into the surrounding buildings...just because he thinks he hears something.<br/><br/>After his dog is mauled does he try to cure the dog? nope, he strangles the doggone dog. Now guess what he does next? He takes his Ford Explorer with killer Firestone tires and absolutely goes on a vicious rampage and intentionally runs over scores of people. Even the woman who eventually rescues him from the completely mangled, upside-down SUV had to pull a gun and the sweet little boy who was with her had to pull a freaking knife on the man when he had one of his typical raging outbursts.<br/><br/>And finally, the residents launch a rescue mission for the queen. After they breach his hideout, guess what...he freaking kills the king, the soldiers, the queen AND himself with a hand grenade. And we want to build statues to Neville in a small town in Vermont just because he let the woman and child slip out. WOW, what a hero. Truthfully, it was the ONLY decent thing he did the entire movie.<br/><br/>The tale of Dr. Robert Neville is indeed a horrible spooky legend (like the headless horseman, or ghouls and goblins and vampires) to the residents of that city.<br/><br/>Someone had to put an end to all of the madness. Those brave people that stormed the hideout in a suicide mission led by their king, deserve recognition.<br/><br/>Neville realized he could not stand trial for his crimes just like the Nazis who tool cyanide.<br/><br/>So who was REALLY the madman?...Who was REALLY the boogeyman? <br/><br/>As demented Colonel Kurtz said in Apocalypse Now, ""the horror""...<br/><br/>Look, I saw some newspaper clippings...I heard Neville's testimony but we also saw that he was demented as well (he was scared of a female mannequin and probably killed Fred to get to her - jealousy/coveting perhaps?) So since we could see that Neville was disturbed and we know how the media can be biased and deceptive (you see that they had Katie Couric/Today Show reruns, ironically LOL)...Who's to say that everything that we were told about the so-called mutants was nothing but propaganda because of fear and/or ignorance? Who was to say that mental illness was not a side-effect of being ""immune"".<br/><br/>In the entire movie, I didn't see a mutant kill ANYONE!

","First of all to all of you who only gave this movie low rate because you read the book,you have to understand that you can't make a movie exactly after a book for many different reasons, for example they have to cut the material shorter so the movie isn't too long,if they were to put everything in the movie that was in the book it would be way too long, honestly who wants to sit through hours of a movie no matter how good it is? not many! then again some things that works in books may not be as good in movies, and when you read a book you use your imaginations you can create everything with your mind, I know Hollywood is good but not that good so they can create everything and still make it believable. I'm that kind of a person that can still judge a movie just for what it is and not get affected because of the book. but I prefer to see the movie first and then read the book, because of the fact that I do that I can read about things that weren't in the movie and I don't get disappointed but if you read the book first you might be disappointed because something isn't in the movie. So if you can't get just watch the movie and not think about a book then don't watch the movies they make based on books because the movie was awesome and deserve better ratings then it got. There are so many authors and books I would have missed if I didn't see the movies first. And keep in mind that the movie is only BASED on the book its not made exactly as the book!!! Back to the movie I loved it! truly a great movie and well executed. Will Smiths best acting ever! and he carried the movie very well after all he is almost acting alone in the hole movie. It contains everything tears,laughter,action and so on everything you need basically for a movie to be good!I would have given this movie a 10 but I gave it a 9 because I didn't want him to die at the end but thats my personal opinion. Go see this movie you will love it Don't go and see this movie if you've read the book and can't watch the movie without thinking about the book!"

It's thought provoking because we are currently looking for a cure for cancer at the moment in technology and this movie takes place not too long in the future. Will Smith's character Robert Neville is the only survivor after a epidemic takes over the world killing and infecting those in it's path. The main characters are Robert Neville, and his dog and only friend left Sam. Which is what made this film really interesting because for half of it he's the only one talking. And when I read on this website there was no script for this movie that made me appreciate that they cast Smith for this even more. The infected people do remind me a bit of the CG effects they used for movies like ""The Mummy"", especially the way they growled with their mouths really wide open. I'd recommend going seeing this movie. Great acting. Great effects. But everyone should form their own opinion.<br/><br/>I will probably rent this and watch it again."
"guitarfreak2013","8","1","2","21 December 2007"," Lots of action, loss of character development
","This movie was good for some ways. Hell yeah, it had a lot of action, intense hunting scenes in the streets of new york city, and some intense monsters. It lacked two things: a steady plot and character development. Torwards the beginning of the movie, the plot was great. Francis Lawrence did a great job with the flashbacks. The speed and intensity that you learn about the origin of the disease is great. There was one scene that seemed very strange to me, though. (contains a spoiler!) The scene when the monsters set up the trap with his doll seemed confusing. They set the trap, but you never see the monsters get organized enough to set a trap until the end. The only other flaw was character development. Will Smith did a great job being sad, so good that he couldn't be not sad. He never seemed happy, and you would think he would be after 3 years of living alone. He never seemed to develop from the beginning, (spoiler) even after the woman and the boy find him and try to convince him that God sent them, he does not believe until the end. They could have extended the movie and made it a lot better, although it would be tough. If you just want some straight up action, go ahead and see it, but if you are like me and like to see a good structure in the plot, don't waste your time. This movie will be a huge hit and tons of people will love it, although it is not one of my favorites."

","Matheson's novel was, eh, novel in at least two senses: it devoodoolised vampires and tried to put some science into the mythical creatures' being. This book of his, by the way, was not the only one doing this. But that is another story. The movie honored this part extremely well leaving out only tiny bits. Where the movie fails blatantly and inexcusably is on the second point, some three quarters in: The point that actually made the book stand out...<br/><br/>*** here comes the a possible spoiler *** ...was our protagonist's status as a legend not among survivors but among vampires, effectively letting him become the Dracula of the story, completely twisting the sympathy the reader has come to get for him as it becomes evident that the vampires are the true heirs to the world.<br/><br/>Nice effects. Very (very, very) effective acting, I must say! But very little to boast about as the credits start rolling."

","Will Smith is very good in this movie and he really knows how to pick his projects. It's mostly just HIM this time around and he does a fine job as the (nearly) sole survivor of a cataclysmic biological event, who is beginning to succumb to his inescapable loneliness. He has really grown in his craft. The stark New York City setting is great as is the back story, told in flash back form. The unfolding of the story was pretty much what I had expected, remembering the Charlton Heston version, and it has been updated with modern CGI effects. Over all I think it was pretty good, however, NOT worth the regular $8.50 admission price, but I would highly RECOMMEND it as a decent DVD rental, or budget theater outing."
"coolbernie","5","1","2","19 December 2007"," Will Smith strong acting...writing not perfect for his role.
","Cool sci-fi much like Omega Man, etc...<br/><br/>I would have appreciated Will Smith's role as Robert Neville better if his character had been an every day guy/dad; perhaps the movie would have had a better flow or a more in-depth explanation as to why Neville was able to be the last man standing. <br/><br/>Will did an excellent job with the role, the writing should have tailored the character to him with more definition. The ending had a video game feel to it; bordering on too much swashbuckling. Also, I never had that sense of loneliness that one might experience in Neville's situation (i.e. Cast Away with Tom Hanks) or, at the end of a Miss Teen America speech.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was exciting. The ending...well, like eating pancakes. At first their wowing you, half way through, your wondering what possessed you to ordered them.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>bernie"
"in-casino-out","8","1","2","19 December 2007"," Will Smith is no longer fresh prince, but Robert Nevelle in my eyes...
","To begin... this movie did exactly what so many movies have not done for me for the past 5 years (besides Lawrence of Arabia, ...heh and Superbad) it honestly made me want to see it again.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I'm recommending this movie to everyone I know. Even if you don't like zombie movies, because my girlfriend is in that same boat and loved it. Just to clear up some confusion that people are apparently having... now where throughout the entire movie does Will Smiths character ever say that the zombies aren't intelligent!!!!!! Also in regards to other people saying that his character also said that they weren't smart and then all of a sudden they created a trap... HE NEVER EVEN SAID THAT THEY WEREN'T INTELLIGENT! All he said was that they were becoming less human. And to who ever said that you can't grow the fruits he was eating in new york city I'll be happy to show you my back yard... Granted this movie is obviously not perfect (which usually depends on who is reviewing it) but it terms of reality I think they did ...alright. Plot holes yes just as any but what movie doesn't!? And this is certainly not a movie about one man its about 3 people in many ways... Robert Nev., the dog, and you. Also many people are saying that it could of been longer and much more epic. Well personally how much more of an empty city do you want to see!? I thought that the running time was adequate although the ending was a bit rushed.<br/><br/>As for acting. I'd rip out my hair on Ethan's part and eh on Anna's, but Will Smith did more than save both of them. He basically owned up to how I feel anyone would act. Some people are specifically bashing the scene when he finally meets Anna and Ethan after being alone for so long. Specifically about how his reaction is totally unrealistic.. Well hello!? He's just been all by himself for the past 3 years under the suspicion that every one on earth is dead then all of a sudden his ONLY friend dies (the dog) and now he finally has someone around. Another set of hands just after when he could've really used them. obviously he'd be upset at someone not to mention a bit crazy and suffering from post dramatic stress syndrome.<br/><br/>***END***<br/><br/>I'm recommending this movie to everyone I know. Even if you don't like zombie movies, my girlfriend is in that same ""I hate zombie movies"" fix and loved it."
"Hellrazr360","7","1","2","18 December 2007"," Solid, But Really Awkward At Times
","Oh joy, another last man on earth movie with zombies, that's the next thing this world needs! Putting sarcasm about the film's plot aside, I Am Legend is really an interesting movie to sum up. Will Smith plays a lone doctor in the middle of a barren New York City during the year 2012, the year that gas prices-according to the film-will be $68 a gallon. Apparently, three years earlier a medication was discovered that could supposedly cure disease, but it slowly turned into zombie-like infesting epidemic. As you might expect, Smith's character is immune to this infestation and he's off fending for himself trying to find a cure with only his canine friend.<br/><br/>The set up for the film isn't the most original in the world, but there's enough in the film to at least carry it all the way through. But what's really neat about the set design is how New York looks as a deserted wasteland; it's downright mesmerizing. Now, based on the trailers for this film it's easy to look at it as an almost completely action-filled flick with Smith tearing the infected humans apart. Do be warned: this really isn't the case with the film and it's easy to be mislead by a few reports and trailers. For instance, with a name like I Am Legend it would only make sense for one to think it's another way for Will Smith to say ""I am a bad man"" (or something along those lines). But again, this isn't the case; he's a doctor merely trying to find a cure in the city. Speaking of Will Smith's character, he does an excellent job carrying out his role, even if he doesn't have that much to really work with he manages to make the best of it.<br/><br/>With that in-mind, don't be surprised when you find the bulk of the film's faster parts to be merely incidental. While the movie does go for multiple genre styles, ranging from horror to drama, a good bit of the film's relatively short screen time is dedicated to dialogue and monologue parts. As a result, I Am Legend winds up being a rather slow film with the action scenes breaking up the monotony very sparingly. And do note that the film has a PG-13 rating, so the amount of action a movie like this could go without hitting the R rating is so far. If this were a straight-up balls-to-the-wall action extravaganza it's likely the film would've walked away with an R-rating.<br/><br/>A good majority of the film has Will Smith carrying his role all by himself, with the occasional flashback also trying to break up the repetition. And really, the film needs as many of these parts as it can get, because it's only so long before a movie following one lone character begins to lose its touch. These parts do tend to work pretty well since it offers some background to Smith's character and the state New York City is in during the film. There are also a fair number of moments used to provide comic relief in the film, which do usually work. But there are a few that are clearly unintentional and at times extremely awkward. I won't spoil every one, but do be prepared for Smith to start impersonating a scene from Shrek and yell at a mannequin.<br/><br/>The ending does at least wrap things up well enough to where it doesn't feel like a sequel is so obvious. However, it isn't exactly the most satisfying of endings and it really pushed the meaning of ""morality"" too far. Not to mention it's not even the most believable ending that could've been picked out of a good load of options. And by this I mean believable in resolving everything, not in whether it's actually possible or not. So again, be prepared for some awkward and on a couple occasions nonsensical moments. Will Smith fans will do well to give this film a shot, but keep an open mind when heading into the theater."
"iKramerica-1","4","1","2","18 December 2007"," I Am Bored...
","Tedious.<br/><br/>They make us write much more to have a review accepted, but basically that one word sums it up nicely. There is nothing new this movie offers in any way. Sure it's a remake (or rethinking), but even remakes can add something new to the material. But ""Legend"" isn't anything new, and nothing makes us think. It's heavy handed, uninteresting, lacks any psychological depth, has no character development, and has an only somewhat believable premise that devolves into unbelievable garbage by about 1/2 way through. I wanted to leave, but thought I'd stick it out and see if it got better. It never did. <br/><br/>Since I must write more, here's a major, major problem with the film (WARNING: my contain a spoiler). In a nutshell, Zombies are a fun idea, but humans don't instantly turn into super strong killing machines with powerful jaws, 10 foot vertical leaps, and the ability to screech like banshees. Muscles don't instantly grow, body fat doesn't instantly drop away, etc., etc.. Sorry, can't happen. And while in a typical Zombie movie, you might say so what? In this movie, one that is grounded in reality, sorry, you MUST maintain that level of reality. We are asked to suspend disbelief too many times in this film, and that's what makes it a bad movie, not just a mediocre one.<br/><br/>On the upside, 1/2 of the special effects were good. Anything mechanical (cars, helicopters, buildings, etc.) was amazingly realistic. Anything living (Zombies, more zombies, zombie dogs, lions, deer) was horribly rendered and over the top. I lived in Manhattan, and I was convinced they were there. They passed right by the entrance to my building, and it was completely real. But the lions and deer and dogs were not. Not even close.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie will make a lot of money at first, but will drop away very quickly and in a year nobody will remember or talk about it again. There is no Wilson moment in this movie... ;)"
"jamhorner","9","1","2","18 December 2007"," I Am Awesome Movie
","I'll be truthfully honest, I only went to go see this film because of the Batman 10 minute showing, and I had to see it in IMAX. Now the concept, as some stranger told me, is vastly similar to Omega Man and stars Will Smith. In this post apocalyptic world, a vaccine, not a virus, but a cure for a virus has wiped out people. Robert Neville (Smith) is the only known survivor living in Manhattan and fights to find a vaccine to the vaccine and a pack of ravenous mutants. What I very much enjoyed was Will Smith's performance, who had taken a major step from acting in comedy's to a role that demands him to act harder. And boy did he achieve. I enjoyed what they did to New York and the whole layout of the story, the PG-13 horror was fantastic and presentable theme of human decay and isolation were best demonstrated through this movie.<br/><br/>First off, Will Smith's acting was superb in this film. A step above his other great performance in Pursuit of Happiness and a huge step above Wild West. (MIB is a different story). There were points in the movie, and I stress the flashbacks, were you see where is passion and outstanding performance really shows, and you kind of feel for his character because of what had happened. His tears, his anger, his psyche and his humor are all present in this film. Not so much the humor, as I originally intended to watch, but there are points that compensate for some of the intense horror scenes. What I enjoyed, which goes along wit Smith's performance, was how the writers and director achieved the very breakdown of man and who fickly man can get when isolated for so long. Smith's intensity with this feeling was mind blowing, when he's yelling at mannequins or asking them out, you feel sorry for him, but he doesn't know any better because he lived with nobody except his dog. His acting, overall, was really, really good. Really! Say what you want about apocalyptic New York City, and we've seen many renditions of this scene. We've seen NY covered in snow, we've seen it just abandoned with trash all over, we've seen it burnt down and we've seen just abandoned with clean streets. Never have I seen New York gradually turn into grassy plain. The way that the director approached this was unique, there are weeds and lots of tall grass growing up from the major streets in NY, there are wild animals. The way that the movie is structured is not like your typical apocalyptic movie; this one is non-linier format and only provides a vague prologue. However, the flashbacks provide a window in to the past and tell us what happened. I like this format because it keeps you watching and wondering what would happen next, since most of the flashbacks cut out. I really enjoyed this format and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Now this movie is not complete without scares. Now this if PG-13, and there are some pretty strong 13's out there and this movie ranks between high 13 and low 13, but for a moderate ranking, this movie has some pretty great scares. There are jump out scares that make you jump, some unexpected scares that make you ponder, ""How did I no see this coming?"" This movie had effectively freaked me out with the ""vampires"" scream. A thing that I want to mention is that in this movie, much like Near Dark, they don't actually say vampires, nor do they make any reference to anything Holy or sacrilegious. The only thing that gives us a hint is that they are very sensitive to light. They could be mutants or UV sensitive zombies like 28 Days. What I enjoyed is that there is an antagonist that could rival Big Daddy's character from Land of the Dead. This leader of the zombies seems very violent and charismatic at the same time. This movie also makes head thrashing seem like it would really hurt, but also scary! The only bad thing that would have been great with this movie would be if they extended the relationship and the friendship that Neville has with Anna and Ethan. They would have added a great edition to the film as well as a great bond the characters would have. However, then it might be too much like 28 Days, but I don't think so. This movie could easily be stretched out to 2 hours, and I would have enjoyed the chemistry they would have had, but then again, you win some you loose some.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a very different kind of apocalyptic and should and would gladly fit n the line up of films of that same genre. I think that in of itself is a very great movie with some grade A acting, scares, non-linear plot line and a great family movie to some degree. There was one thing that could have been better and that had to so with the runtime and expansion of the movie, but other than that, I think this film was very good for so-called remake of Omega Man. It was really good, I would see it again and maybe a second time, but not a third time, because the scares are in this movie need to be seen only once or they would loose their scare. But, if you enjoy Will Smith, apocalyptic movies, vampires of some degree and some brilliant directing, then this movie would be right up your alley. I certainly enjoyed it."
"mbgpackers","9","1","2","17 December 2007"," Will Smith is Legendary!
","First of all, is it possible for this man(Will Smith) to make a bad movie? Once again Will Smith blows me away with his acting perfection. If He's sucking you in with his vulnerability and humanity in one role or he's blowing your mind by killing aliens or drug dealers in other roles. He can not make a bad movie. Anyways,to the point i'm getting too. ""I am Legend"" was a AMAZING movie. I took the time to read the book before i went to see the movie which was the first time in my life i have ever done that. I thought the book was entertaining enough to make me not want to put the book down but left me feeling a little unfulfilled. I was hoping they would and expected them to change things in the translation from book to film. I loved the change that to Robert having a dog with him in his travels in the film which he does not have in the book. The whole part in the book were Robert is trying to befriend a dog for like a whole chapter and then the dog dies just when they finally get to that trust level. I felt like crying my eyes out when Robert has to strangle Sam to death after they escape from the infected dog attack. I also liked the ending change from book to movie. I thought that was very well done. Although I kept waiting for Anna back stab Robert. I enjoy movies that leave you feeling a sense of hope when its over. That gives me that warm and fuzzy feeling inside. Anyways go see the movie, it's good enough to spend you hard earned money to go see in the theaters. Go see it and enjoy:) Hollywood"

","blockbusters usually don't do it for me, and the same goes for zombies (though, these critters weren't exactly zombies...more like hairless mutants w/more brains than they're given credit for, which of course, leads to trouble). but this is a digression...<br/><br/>it goes w/out saying that the setting of manhattan, so utterly sunken and desolate, was amazing. it's hard to imagine that people could view this and not be transfixed, or at least, a bit taken aback. what made it so fantastic was that this post apocalyptic vision wasn't portrayed in some over the top tableaux, because what we're seeing could possibly happen if circumstances did indeed wipe out the population. but even for its possible realism, there was nothing benign about it, either. <br/><br/>but what I found most unsettling (and well done) was how the film didn't allow its bits of comic relief to provide said relief for longer than a minute. case in point: Neville is chatting w/his dog, Sam, about a possible party she may be throwing for him. it's funny, it's a will smith moment. but just as we're feeling that touch of lightheartedness, BAM, there's Fred the mannequin, not at all where he should be. the effect was beyond disturbing; it just wrecked me. and I liked it."

","They did a really good job building suspense. This was not a horror movie so-to-speak. But I would love for this team (Writer, Director, Producer, Will Smith) to do a pure horror movie. They are great! And the story was very captivating. I was really pulled into the struggle for Will's sanity and survival. And out of the chaos you started to see some intelligence and emotion in the zombie leader. Which gave you just a hint that they are not mindless brain eaters. That faint revelation I never forgot.<br/><br/>They pulled these emotions out of me, and it put me on the edge of my seat, because I was itching to see what they where going to do with them.<br/><br/>And that's when the horror began. Dr. Neville wasn't the only person that lost consciousness. The director, and everybody else on the set did as well. It was like a big $70 (I took the whole family) April fools joke. Letdown is too mild a word, worldwide catastrophe would be in bad taste. I think ""Dereliction of Good Movie Ending Duty"" seems more appropriate.<br/><br/>When Will stumbled upon a nest inside the vault. It was mind blowing. Cinematic gold I tell you. After they showed the zombie leader, they could've kept building upon that reveal and maybe showed more of how the zombies survive. Because Dr. Neville story hits a brick wall with no where to go. It's a great ride getting there, but what's left is the ending (that I hated).<br/><br/>I think that's what the director missed. By the time Neville proclaims ""I can fix this"" again, you really don't care. The book is great because the zombies are not mindless, they have purpose.<br/><br/>I'm left to wonder what could have been...."

","I am not impressed with most movies but I am digging I am Legend!<br/><br/>I will first start out by mentioning in this review as I have said before that I am not impressed with the vast majority of movies cranked out by Hollywood these days. Its even more seldom when I find a movie that I truly enjoy<br/><br/>Some of the negative reviews are well taken and I can see why some people may not buy the movie but I will attempt to explain why I do.<br/><br/>I am legend is just the right balance of action/thriller/scary/thinker type movie. I was not expecting this when I walked into the theater. I was more expecting a scary movie with Will Smith walking around in the dark blowing creatures heads off for two hours I was glad to see that it did not do this.<br/><br/>I am Legend takes you directly into the action and the setup of the movie. I just remember thinking during the first three minutes of the movie that I was very thankful that we did not have to sit through a half hour rising-action of how the earth got infected, exactly what happened, and why he is the only one left. It is my opinion that these details were not simply omitted by the other as a point of oversight and neglect but I believe they were purposefully left out. Furthermore, they added to the post-movie think about it factor to the whole thing.<br/><br/>The sense of loneliness and isolation was awesome from the get go. From the talking to manikins to the re-run TV Will Smith does a great job of setting up the character in a desperate state but still retaining the Will Smith comedy factor, very well played.<br/><br/>The movie continued to keep me on the edge of my seat! I loved the scene when he chases the dog into the abandoned warehouse. Such awesome suspense and very cryptic images<br/><br/>All in all the movie left me with some great discussion points and questions to think about<br/><br/>1. Was the trap that Will Smith got caught in set by himself or the infected humans? (did he place the manikin there in a schizophrenic episode caused by extreme isolating or did they figure it out) 2. How smart are the infected humans? He says they had complete ""social devolution"" but they seem to still retain the ability to employ lesser animals (they had dogs on leashes in the trap scene). This implies that they still retained some human abilities. 3. Why did the infected humans want to kill him so bad? If they are so desperate for food why don't they just kill each other? Or the dogs they had? Clearly they did not just want to eat him. 4. How is this ""cure the world"" thing going to work? Can the creatures reproduce? They found a cure great, but how are they going to go about reclaiming the world? 5. Etc<br/><br/>All in all this was an excellent movie. I will for sure pay the $12 to see it again this time in IMAX format!"
"lvyota91","8","1","2","15 December 2007"," A ""good"" film with a ""GREAT"" actor.
","I Am Legend is a good film with a great performance by Will Smith. The film starts off by showing the audience how Neville deals with being the last man on Earth. This continues throughout the first half of the film while putting the ""Dark-Seekers"" as minor characters in the story. This film could have been improved by adding more scenes about how he adapts to living alone. The second half of the film doesn't capitalize like the first half does. We find out that he is not actually alone. Two other survivors save him while he attempts suicide via Dark-Seekers. He has a short but powerful relationship with these two other immune people. This leads to an abrupt and underdeveloped ending. All in all, this is definitely a film that is worth seeing. IT is a very interesting approach to the ""Last Man On Earth"". I give this film an 8 out of 10 in spite of its semi-disappointing second half. Fortunately, the first half makes up for it."

"high_on_Cloverfields","7","1","2","15 December 2007"," Semi-satisfied
","First of all I didn't read the book so I can't comment on that but knowing the trend, this movie probably butchered it.<br/><br/>On to the Review...<br/><br/>Robert Neville(Will Smith) and Sam(the dog) are all alone in a world where a virus has turned humans into zombies. These creatures are afraid of sunlight which forces Robert to live during the day and survive during the night as he tries to find a cure that will save humanity.<br/><br/>I've always had a thing for apocalyptic movies, my favorite being Children of Men. The strength of these type of movies lie in the atmosphere. It has to suck you into this world of fear and tragedy and never let go, not even after the credits roll. It should let you ponder the meaning of existence and perhaps shed light to present issues. I am Legend contains some elements of a great movie, but ultimately feels neither chaotically fun, nor intellectually stimulating.<br/><br/>Will Smith as Robert Neville is great as usual and his interaction with Sam is probably the best thing about the movie. You feel that their grateful companionship is the only thing keeping them alive which leads to some great scenes of hope and despair. The first 3/4 of the movie is actually pretty good with the emptiness of NYC and the constant feeling of looming danger. This buildup is ruined by the weak ending. I won't spoil it for you but you'll be disappointed given the quality of the rest of the movie (minus the zombies which look totally fake and not scary). Some movies seek to be intellectually stimulating while others choose to be mindless fun. This movie seeks to do both which doesn't work too well. You'll probably like it. Just don't expect too much."

"mooseboulders","6","1","2","15 December 2007"," Good Movie. Maybe I expected too much
","***** CONTAINS A LOT OF SPOILERS, INCLUDING ENDING. PLEASE, ONLY READ AFTER YOU HAVE VIEWED THE FILM **************************** <br/><br/>I'll start by saying it was a good entertaining movie. However, I left this Will Smith outing feeling more Wild Wild West than Independence Day. Smith's acting was superb. He put a lot of emotion into his character and you really sympathized for him and how it must have felt to be the ""last man alive"". A lot of the scenes in this movie have been seen before (and not in previous versions of this particular story). There's some elements from 28 days later, Logan's Run, Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil, The Road Warrior and a few other movies. People are making a big deal about viewers feeling sadder about Sam the dog's death than Smith's death. My interpretation (and why I too felt stronger about the dog's death scene) is that the dog's death was sudden, unexpected, heroic & heartbreaking (she died saving her master), and most importantly, the loss of his only friend and sole surviving ""family"" member. In other words, people aren't lamenting the loss of a dog, they're lamenting the loss of the last tiny piece of Will's past that he possessed. Let's face it, other than finding the cure, he basically had nothing left to live for after that. That's why he tried to deep-six himself on the dock after the death of his dog and why his ultimate death wasn't nearly as hard a blow. The CGI is good, if not a little cartoony at times, however the abilities of the creatures were baffling at best. They have degenerated to grunting savage beast walking on all fours, yet spontaneously they become smart enough to set elaborate rope traps, take out harmful light posts, and track Will to his residence???? Why not have one just become the ""Brain"" creature like in Gremlins 2, and have him speak in a real snobby English accent? Can't be any more ridiculous than thinking one of these things could rig a rope trap that would baffle a 10th degree Eagle Scout (or even a typical Marine). Speaking of their abilities, I also find the new super-zombie model completely unbelievable. When will horror writers learn that you can't make ""sick"" barbaric, mentally handicapped, virus-ravaged sickos faster, stronger, more agile, and sometimes smarter than even our healthiest athletes taking excellent care of their bodies? I honestly don't think the creatures added to the movie. The only time I truly enjoyed a confrontation was when Sam ran into the dark empty building. The ensuing search and ultimate confrontation sets the pace for his remaining creature interaction and also produces some good chills, at least until the above ridiculousness kicks in. I enjoyed the cinematography and feel of a completely empty New York City. I also enjoyed the flashbacks, that told us the preceding the story, in a ""Lost"" kind of way. So overall, I left the theater feeling uneven: Satisfied with Smith's acting, the amazing feat of making New York appear abandoned, and some of the creature confrontations (like when Sam ran into the dark abandoned building in broad daylight). The rest was ehhhh....so-so. Better luck next time Will and I'm still going to see your films because you ARE the man in H-Wood right now.

"rooprect","Null","1","3","1 October 2014"," The best version of the novel... ya gotta love the dog.
","From Vincent Price in ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) to Charleton Heston in ""The Omega Man"" (1971) to Will Smith in ""I Am Legend"" (2007), each version has had its strengths in telling the age old story of the human race being wiped out. But for my money, this was the best. Here's why.<br/><br/>In all three versions, the focus is on the last man on earth--in particular, his psyche in dealing with the crushing emptiness of being the last of an extinct race. Vincent Price's character is focused primarily on survival with only momentary episodes of deep reflection. Heston takes it a step further and displays the subtle yet poignant degradation of a plagued mind, more in line with the cryptic meaning of the book's title ""I Am Legend"" which we only realize after contemplating the ending. Here, Will Smith knocks it out of the park with a tremendous performance, making this version as much a psychological thriller as it is an action story.<br/><br/>In particular, we watch with deep empathy as he creates a world of imaginary people, having emotional conversations with inanimate objects. Smith plays a scene with a wax dummy that may bring you to tears... can't say I've ever seen an actor do that before (barring maybe Erich von Stroheim in the 1929 classic ""The Great Gabbo"").<br/><br/>Even better, the filmmakers saw fit to make one small but significant addition to the cast of characters: a dog. Smith's connection with his canine co-star is by far one of the most powerful displays of the human-animal bond that I've seen in any movie. If you're a dog lover, you should watch it for that bit alone. Beyond that, it demonstrates our hero's critical need for companionship, something that all humans would require just as much as food or water. And that's why this version is particularly affecting.<br/><br/>This film also goes further into the meaning of the title ""I Am Legend"", although it's still a challenge to figure it out. There is an alternate ending which, I think, explains this theme a little more clearly. I'm torn on which ending I like best. Just be sure to check out both if you see the movie, since they are very different.<br/><br/>In all, I don't see this as a straightforward action flick. To me, it's a great psychological character study augmented with lots of action. And like I said, the acting is absolutely 1st class. If you like movies that pack a little more substance beneath the surface, don't miss this one."
"JamesHitchcock","5","1","3","1 September 2011"," Never rises above the level of cliché
","""I Am Legend"" is the third film to have been based on Richard Matheson's novel, and the only one to keep Matheson's original title (even if the significance of that title is somewhat altered). The others were 1964's ""The Last Man on Earth"", which I have never seen, and ""The Omega Man"" from 1971. (There was a second adaptation of the novel made in 2007, ""I Am Omega"", which again I have not seen).<br/><br/>Like the original novel and ""The Omega Man"", ""I Am Legend"" is an example of post-apocalyptic science fiction. The action takes place in 2012 in New York. (The novel and ""The Omega Man"" were both set in Los Angeles). Most of the human race has been wiped out by a virus. In ""The Omega Man"" the source of the virus was a war fought with biological weapons between China and the Soviet Union; in this version it is the result of genetic engineering designed to develop a cure for cancer. This difference perhaps reflects the way in which our view of the world has changed in the intervening 36 years. In the Cold War years of the seventies our greatest fear was the outbreak of World War III; today we are much more frightened of the possible consequences of misguided tinkering with nature, even when that tinkering is carried out for benign reasons. The virus is known as KV, short for Krippin Virus, named after its inventor but with a possible reference to the notorious murderer Dr Crippen.<br/><br/>The central character is Robert Neville, a military research scientist who believes himself to be the only surviving human who is immune to the virus. He lives alone in his Manhattan apartment with only his faithful German Shepherd dog Samantha for company. (New York still seems surprisingly well cared for; I would have thought that a city which has been deserted for three years would have fallen into a much more dilapidated, ruinous state than the one we see here). His days are spent in conducting experiments on infected rats to find a cure for the virus; for food he raids supplies from abandoned homes and stores or hunts the deer which have moved back into the city. He faces, however, many dangers, and not only from other wild animals. Not all those humans who were infected by the virus died. There were many survivors, but they have degenerated into aggressive beings known as ""Darkseekers"" because they are intolerant of daylight and hence nocturnal. (An idea doubtless borrowed from vampire legends). During the daytime Neville is safe from these creatures, but during the night he dare not venture outside.<br/><br/>The Darkseekers are not quite the same as ""the Family"", the light-sensitive albinos who played the equivalent role in ""The Omega Man"". Although the Family were Neville's sworn enemies, they retained their human intelligence and had a relatively sophisticated system of beliefs based upon a fanatical religion and a hatred of the corrupt old scientific, industrialised world. The Darkseekers are savage feral beings, more like animals than humans and lacking the intelligence of the Family.<br/><br/>There is, in fact, a big difference between ""The Omega Man"" and ""I Am Legend"". The earlier film was essentially a philosophical, anti-racist and religious parable. At the end Neville, played in that film by Charlton Heston, becomes a symbolic Christ-figure giving his blood to save the world. The later film is much more of a straightforward thriller; although religious ideas are not entirely absent, they are much more played down, and there is no attempt to present an anti-racist message. (Possibly because such messages are today seen as less controversial and more hackneyed than they were in the early seventies).<br/><br/>Will Smith is better here than Heston was in ""The Omega Man"" which is not one of his better performances. Whereas Heston's Neville starts off as a cynic and ends up as a symbol rather than a person, Smith does at least attempt to make his character more rounded and believable, a man tormented by loneliness and despair. Overall, however, I would rate ""The Omega Man"" as the better film. It is not without its flaws but its philosophical themes do at least give it a greater depth than the average zombie flick. The ""survivors-of-an-epidemic-fighting-off-disease-ridden-zombies"" version of the post-apocalyptic thriller was already well established in 1971, and in the four decades since then has become a cliché with films like ""28 Days Later"" and all those ""Night of the Living Dead"" sequels and spin-offs. Despite Smith's efforts, ""I Am Legend"" never really rises above the level of that cliché. 5/10"
"jrusteberg22","8","1","3","7 October 2009"," The Legend of His Time
","In the 2007 film I am Legend, directed by Francis Lawrence, three years have passed since a viral epidemic swarmed the globe turning the world's population into nocturnal mutant predators. Will Smith stars as Robert Neville, an Army scientist who is immune to the virus and also possibly the last man on earth. The film takes place in New York City, 2012. The movie follows Robert Neville as he attempts to find a remedy for the virus. Neville hunts the infected vampire-like creatures to conduct experiments in search for a cure. Neville tries to experiment with the infected to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. I am Legend has two different endings, such as a theatrical ending and the alternate ending. The alternate ending corresponds more with the book than the theatrical ending. I tend to like the alternate ending more because it helps people understand the meaning behind the film. It gives viewers a better perspective of the message the director is trying to establish. It is very hard to understand the meaning of the film by viewing the theatrical ending and can throw off viewers who have not read the book. Like Tom Hanks in Castaway, Will Smith commands the screen alone for most of the movie along with his companion dog Samantha (Abbey). There are multiple forms of critical intention in the film to make the film seem more realistic, although some are more practical to the film than others. The director of the film uses music minimally allowing the cityscapes to remain mostly silent to give the impression of extinction to no other life forms at all. An overgrown and deserted Time Square adds suspenseful moments to the movie. The scene of the lion hunting the deer brings the thought of how civilization has ceased and natures overwhelming power over mankind. The film was nominated for seventeen awards and won seven awards. The film won the Saturn Award for best actor and the Teen Choice Award for Best Horror Film. The film also won an MTV Movie Award for the best male performance."

","This film is one remarkable masterpiece if you ask me. Dramatic, visionary, yet delivering comedy at the right moments, ""I am Legend"" presents one of Will Smith's best performances yet. The story is solid and never fails to keep our attention to say the least. The total highlight of the film in my opinion would definitely be the empty Manhattan, which in itself will send chills down one's spine. Francis Lawerence brought this concept to life just the way it should've been. Will Smith really out does himself here. The emotion he puts into his performance is astounding and he portrays the last man on earth perfectly. I myself was actually brought to tears when I first saw this film in theaters. And trust me that's a rare thing for me! The way the action is shot makes the whole movie feel more realistic in a way and the terror is unrelenting. And with a tragic and well done score by master composer James Newton Howard, this ""I am Legend"" is one of my favorite films of 2007."

"hausrathman","Null","1","3","5 October 2008"," Strange Adaptation
","Will Smith plays a scientist who appears to be the sole survivor man-made plague that turned the vast bulk of humanity into vicious, inhuman zombies in this strange adaptation of the novel by Richard Matheson. I say strange adaptation because, although it retains some of the original storyline, it is a mirror opposite of the themes of the book. The book was a dark meditation on a rational man left alone to battle a world of vampires. Being unwilling to accept a supernatural explanation for the events, he slowly finds the rational explanation and comes to the realization that he could one day be the source of another legend himself. In this film, Will Smith must abandon his rational worldview and accept the supernatural. Perhaps the filmmakers thought the mass audience wouldn't accept a film with the original viewpoint, but if that were true, why bother making the film at all?<br/><br/>Still, Will Smith gave a great performance, and the film had enough thrills for a summer blockbuster. There is simply nothing in this film with the power that novel ends with when Neville says ""I Am Legend.""<br/><br/>The Vincent Price version was the closest to the novel. The Charlton Heston version displayed the most campy fun. This version isn't bad. It just isn't the novel."

","I wholeheartedly agree with many other reviewers that as pure entertainment goes, I Am Legend is fine - just fine to be more accurate. It is compelling enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, the CGI and visuals are impressive, Will Smith is Will Smith, and the story generates just enough of a comparison with the great apocalyptic novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson to be engaging. It is very short for a movie that could have been much more in depth. Character depth is missing. Story depth is missing. Thematic depth is missing. Yes, we get the action scenes. Yes, we get Smith being charming and glib. Yes, we get high tech gadgetry and big box office sensibilities. Yawn. This film could COULD have been so much more than what it is. As it is it is marginal entertainment, but had it really taken Matheson's novel and based its screenplay in a more committed manner to it - the film could have been entertaining and profound. Why so short? Why the dog in the beginning of the film? Why the high-tech crap - to cover up the glaring weaknesses in plot and character depth no doubt. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film enough so that I would definitely see it again. But having read the book and knowing what could have been done is the most supreme disappointment. The book could be easily transformed to film page by page. Of course you would forfeit action chase sequences and big budget gloss. But the book had a theme of one man against the undying void of loneliness that comes with being the very last man on Earth. That never happens here as we have a dog with Robert Neville immediately and soon...well, you'll see. The story was done twice before with Vincent Price in The Last Man on Earth and Charlton Heston in The Omega Man. This one is about as good as those two - though as far as story integrity goes - I'll take The Last Man on Earth as a better realization of what Matheson achieved in prose."

","In I AM LEGEND, Will Smith joins as the star of an adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name. Often surprising in its focus on loneliness and loss, this thoughtful, eerie, and restrained sci-fi horror film provides a parade of startling visuals, but never allows special effects to overcome the human element. Smith, in a strong performance very different from his usual persona, is Robert Neville, the lone survivor in a New York City where streets are overgrown and deer gambol among deserted automobiles. Following an epidemic, the Earth's population has been turned into an army of nocturnal zombies. Immune to the virus, military scientist Neville searches for a cure in his Washington Square townhouse. Haunted by visions of his family leaving quarantined Manhattan two years prior, he drives through the city with his German Shepherd, Sam, by day and barricades his home from the monsters nightly. Director Francis Lawrence (CONSTANTINE) uses music minimally, wisely allowing the eerie cityscapes to remain mostly silent. The set pieces, including an overgrown, deserted Times Square and a lion hunting a deer in the Flatrion District, are goosebump-inducing moments of stark beauty. Though some may question the rendering of the monsters in CGI instead of using actors, it does allow them to be frighteningly acrobatic. A chilling and effective adaptation of a horror classic, I AM LEGEND is also a thought-provoking piece of Hollywood film-making."

"deathly_smirk","10","1","3","5 March 2008"," Another gem from Will Smith (POSSIBLE spoilers)
","Will Smith plays Robert Neville a scientist and it seems the last man on Earth. Even he with all his abilities could not stop the deadly virus that was meant to cure all diseases on Earth. Instead, it wiped out most of the population on Earth turning the dead into vampire cannibals that hunt at night. Aware of the danger, Neville sticks to a strict routine element to his survival with only his dog for company for 3 years. He scavenges food supplies in the city of New York where wild animals roam free too. But the danger mostly he faces is probably from himself, evidently his mental state deteriorating when he addresses mannequins in shops as real individuals and asks his dog not to throw him a surprise birthday party. Watching all this in the shadows are his mortal enemy  ""the Infected"" the vampire cannibals excited by the prospect of fresh meat and enraged that Neville kidnaps them to cure them. Yet, Neville keeps his hopes up by sending out radio messages faithfully, in desperation to find other survivors; knowing his immunity is becoming increasingly tempting to the ""infected"".<br/><br/>This movie for me was never disappointing even with the lack of booms and bangs in terms of action. In fact, was refreshing. Maybe, it was the fault of the critics or even the company that mislead many to believe this movie would be as action-packed as 'I-Robot' but for me it was a pleasant surprise (that's not saying that there weren't any heart-stopping moments). As a fan of Will Smith I just love the way he tackles such diverse characters and then goes and does a movie that not only shows his acting abilities but flexes those muscles. I can tell you that is great viewing. What people fail to understand or see in this movie is the raw power of emotions Will Smith portrays, when he teases his dog like a child to eat his vegetables, when he politely makes conversation with a mannequin in a store. He showcases a lonely man, a Robin Crusoe, desperate for the taste of civilisation that once was. It's a nightmarish situation that Will Smith portrays incredibly, believably through his determined movements around his house and the city. Nonetheless, he can't cut his self completely off from his past as through his flashbacks we realise the sacrifice he makes to make sure his loved ones survive but that's not just what tears at him. His morals are called into question the day he lets his family go as he watches a mother in the early stages of the virus begging him to save her baby whilst crying tears of blood.<br/><br/>His morals and ethics are continuously tested though, throughout his 3 years of solitude when he has to kidnap the night creatures to cure them. Each time he fails the pain is just more than visible on his face, an internal battle rages. His failure means their 'death' and no cure but Will Smith shows that Neville doesn't for one moment believe that it is a mercy killing. Instead, as the anguish shows on his face it becomes clear that he believes that he is murdering them; so he lays the only tribute he can, by recording their deaths in profiles and gives them a number. The failure dampens his determination at times as he rages but as he steps outside the door of his house you can see the fire lighting up Will Smith's eyes again but only just.<br/><br/>His tantrums frighten and shock, his depression deepens which to another man this sense of 'freedom' may have been liberating or shattering but ultimately we understand through Will Smith's incredibly acting that the wrong man was chosen. This man lives in his past to break the silence and looks after his dog because his daughter handed it to him. Putting it to bed, giving it a bath, its meals are his concerns when not in his lab. His dog is his baby which is shown when he sleeps curled up with it in the bath. The simple quiet action is so intimate and superb that you can actually see Will Smith clinging on to it as though he is his only lifeline. All boundaries of society are forgotten and Will Smith penetrates the viewers' defences into thinking that Robert Neville is not mad but starved of affection and human company. If that doesn't give you the chills then I don't what will. Admittedly, though the graphics were a bit of a disappointment but the convincing acting and the hair-raising shrieks are enough to frighten you and you soon realise that not only are they vicious but intelligent as Robert Neville Nonetheless, I wasn't too broken up about it them; after all, the legend that inspired terror was Robert Neville not ""the Infected."" I could keep going but I think I'll stop now. So, now it's just a case of watching out for Will Smith's next movie!"
"Merklin","8","1","3","24 February 2008"," An engrossing and scary post apocalyptic thriller.
","To be honest, i wasn't looking forward to I Am Legend. It seemed as if a film that portrays Will Smith as the last man on earth could only be one of two things: 1. A post apocalyptic ego-fest, like Kevin Costners The Postman, or 2. A cross between Mad Max and the fresh prince.Thankfully, it turns out that the film is neither of these things- what it is in fact is an engrossing, tense and satisfying thriller.<br/><br/>As the lone human survivor of a plague that has reduced new york to deserted ghost town, Will Smith does an excellent job of holding the film together with a world weary, vulnerable performance that really makes you feel for his character. Large moments of the film is just him and his dog going through their daily routines and it makes for gripping viewing.<br/><br/>As for Smiths mutant costars, they are creepy freaks that do their job in the scare department but visually, they're kind of bland. Design wise, we've seen creatures like them before, particularly in Blade 2, and in many shots they look too much like CGI. The same goes for many of the animals that show up in the film (apart from smiths beloved doggy)- they are very obviously fake and its distracting in moments that are meant to be scary.<br/><br/>Some ropey CGI isn't enough to bring down the rest of the film though- I Am legend is a darn good post-apocalyptic thriller carried on the very capable shoulders of its star."

","I must admit that I actually almost enjoyed the beginning of the film - beautiful cinematography, views of the deserted jungle-New York, the unhurried but still suspense building pace. Yes - the mutants look like cheap imports from a video game, but even that didn't bother me too much. I've never been a fan of Will Smith, but even he was almost OK.<br/><br/>Then with the introduction of Anna character it all goes down the toilet. After a real Deus Ex Machina-twist we see crucifixes and stigmas, hear embarrassingly bad dialog of God's plans etc. Never mind the enormous gaps in the plot (how did Anna manage to get to the New York, how did she escape etc.). Naive religious Christian sub-text is painfully blatant: science, especially attempts to change God's creation, is the ultimate evil and only hope of salvation is unquestionable faith - and even the doubting hero finally embraces this in the very end. And the final image of the film: stars and stripes, a white church, happy families. Frightening.<br/><br/>Maybe US audiences hardly notice this kind of thing anymore, but in less religion saturated cultures it really hits one in the face. Of course a film can have a religious (and pro-religion) theme, but in this case it feels like a cheap and calculated trick instead of intelligent and thought provoking view. People get warned against sex, bad language or violence in films, but in my opinion there should also be a warning against a religious propaganda."

","The makers of 'I am legend' did an absolute great job creating an atmosphere of total desolation. The images of a long uninhabited New York are very disturbing. You can imagine, if it were for real, it would be something like this. A job well done.<br/><br/>Though a great movie (among the best I have seen in the last couple of years), I feel much of the story remains untold. The movie left me partly unsatisfied. I would have liked to see more: the initial outbreak of the disease, the panic and frenzy, and finally the collapse of human civilization. In short, everything that led to Dr. Neville finding himself all alone in NY city. For my part, it's the only flaw of 'I am legend'. An absolute must-see!<br/><br/>SPOILER:The Dark Seekers are brought to life extremely well. The makers didn't overdo it, and it paid off. They are a well-balanced mixture of human and monster. For the most part they act brutal,yet they show some degree of intelligence and deliberation, making them all the more realistic."

","I was tremendously surprised when I saw this film. Will Smith is always capable and entertaining. His work in this film is his best, yet.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, he moves through the full range of emotions required, and does it excellently. From his concerned father and husband trying to save his family, to his loner trying to keep his sanity with flip remarks, to his grieving over the loss of his last friend, to the final realization of his purpose in this crisis, Smith sets just the right tone, just the right stage.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is also a story of faith, loss of faith and the restoration of that faith. The family of Smith's character is obviously a religious one. His losses that lead to his being the last man are what makes him question his faith and to temporarily reject God.<br/><br/>However, in the last moment, in that defining instant when he sees clearly what his purpose is in this whole tragedy, his faith is restored and, through it, he is steeled for that which he MUST do.<br/><br/>Smith deserves an Oscar for this performance."

","I've enjoyed Will Smith in many of his performances. However, even with his well above average acting skills, the screen play and story line are a very WEAK substitute for the Omega Man. Very unrealistic, if everyone is dead except him, why haven't the nuclear power plants melted down? why is the gasoline still usable? Just a plain stupid movie. He has a dog and has not eaten it yet? A garden in the middle of Manhattan and there's pollutants all over the place. He should have been dead many times over LONG BEFORE he made contact with the chick and her son. Why in the world would he not jump in the furnace with the woman and child if he found the cure for the virus affecting everyone. Stupid! Stupid, stupid, STUPID movie.

I have never watched a movie that makes me looking at my watch all the time. Even the people sitting next to me (In the cinema)fall asleep, some of them are even listening to their iPods.

It said that this is a horror movie, however I couldn't find anything make me feel scared as well as the audience, I think the story was good but the acting and the organization is a disaster.

","OK... I really don't understand the bad reviews this film has had. I've read the book and granted, it is not closely followed, they have more just taken the theme of the book of a virus turning humans into something evil. 28 Days later is probably more accurate to the book than this film.<br/><br/>HOWEVER - the characters (few that there were) made you really care about what happened to them. Will Smith portrayed Neville perfectly as a man who has lost everything and has become obsessed with trying to put it right, probably because he has lost his family and thinks there is nothing left for him. The dog is his companion and the relationship between the two is far more touching than you would think it possible to portray in a film where one of the two lead characters is a canine.<br/><br/>Some parts of the film I was on the edge of my seat, others I was trying not to cry and the whole way through, I cared what happened. If you go to the cinema expecting to see some action flick as is usually expected of Will Smith, then yes, you might be disappointed. But go with an open mind and don't expect it to follow the book exactly, and you should enjoy what is an excellent film, well acted and well shot, with some fantastic scenes of a deserted New York.<br/><br/>I thought this film was brilliant."

So the plot is nothing new but still i have the hope that this film could be like ""28 Days Later"", in the way that it offers from an old story a new kind of film never released before. But this film let me down. Since the very first scene with Will Smith this film start to let me down, i mean that scene is like a commercial of Mustang and well in fact it was because the Mustang doesn't appear again. Well the cast is just OK, i'm not a fan of Smith and in this he is nothing special. The visual part of the film and the music are amazing, to see New York desolate is disturbing and in that way the film is good and i'm a big fan of Bob Marley so i enjoy listening ""Three Little Birds"", ""Stir it Up"" and ""Redemption Song"". Also the dialog of Smith about Marley is terrific and i big tribute to a unique musician with a big soul. So for me those are the best things of this film, but the weak plot, the stupid character of Smith who could live very good in New York in consequence of weak enemies that aren't as disturbing as the enemies in the British film, are enough to make this a big disappointment.<br/><br/>Conclusion: i don't regret of watch this film because it was entertaining but i want to say that if you haven't watch this film you better save your money,wait to watch it on TV and watch again ""28 Days Later"". 5 out of 10"

","Movie starts well, but then when you think the characters will be more developed and you'll know more about the main character's past, the movie ends. You don't even know (although it appears so, I recognize that) whether his family died in an helicopter accident or not. The fact that Neville found the cure and said ""the cure is in the blood"" doesn't help much as to why that blood has the cure. And the altered humans banging their heads in walls and glass doors without feeling anything...I'm sorry, I don't buy it. Bottom line, great idea for a movie (not original though), but it lacks character development and it lack story development."

","I'll start by saying that Will Smith delivers a superb performance. He completely carries this film on his shoulders, and I don't think that anyone could have succeeded like he did. A phenomenal work from him. The film does drag a lot, for me, in the first couple of acts but it really could have only been done that way. I adored the complete lack of a score and felt it added to the ambiance, making the audience feel like they were also the last person on Earth. Some of the contrivances really irked me (like the girl showing up right before he died....after not hearing his radio message for three years and finally coming just as he lost all hope) but they were pretty easy to look past. Just like everyone complains about, I wasn't a fan of the monsters. The idea of using CGI instead of makeup effects really disappointed me. And I wasn't a big fan of the ending. The martyr thing always pulls on my heart, so I was fine with that, but the whole ""super-duper happy commune"" thing felt really contrived. Oh, and I couldn't watch Sam's last scene."

","I was never able to sit through Omega Man but I did enjoy The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price. I was really anticipating I Am Legend - I knew Will Smith would do a great job and he did. He was very convincing as a man clinging to his sanity by his fingernails. The scenes of him with the mannequins in the video store were sad, funny and a little scary. Overall the movie was very enjoyable mostly because of Smith. The cgi effects, creatures and cinematography made the movie even more fun. I read Mattheson's book before I saw I Am Legend and I have to say the movie is much better. The book is good in parts as Mattheson spends a great deal of time on aspects of the story he seemed to enjoy but then would stop when he seemed to tire of what he was writing about. The story is great, but leaves much to be desired and lots of room for improvement. I think this is why it has been made into so many movies. Here be spoilers** In the book Neville lusts for the female vampires who come to his house every night. I thought it was clever of the makers of this movie to focus this aspect of Neville's frustration and loneliness to the mannequins instead of the vampires. I also enjoyed Neville's relationship with Sam. In the book Mattheson spends a lot of time describing how Neville attempted to entice a stray over days and weeks before finally forcing the dog into his house. The next paragraph reads - the dog died within a weak. WTF!!!! Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it - the book too honestly. It's a little more realistic as to how someone would behave if left alone to their own devices. Neville of the novel drinks and smokes excessively - I know I would too."

","I was quite convinced, ""I Am Legend"" would be a pretty bad movie, before I went to see it.<br/><br/>I knew ""The Omega Man"" and I really liked it. So I thought, why does Hollywood produce just another remake of a beautiful film? And I think, there are definitely too many remakes and far too many part two's. And most remakes do not match the originals, for e.g. ""The Time Machine"".<br/><br/>But ""I am Legend"" IS different. It focuses on the main characters emotions. And these emotions are rather credible. Will Smith's play is just outstanding. He makes the audience like Neville, and suffer with him.<br/><br/>OK, they use all storyboard-tricks to achieve this effect. To have a dog as second main character, a dog as only and true friend of Neville, well, that captures the viewer's heart. If such is done well, it is fine, and it is done well in this film.<br/><br/>The fight against the virus victims, the ""vampires"", is not the main theme. These monsters are adding the fear and despair to the story. But this Neville is not running through the city (as did the Omega Man), shooting creatures wherever he meets them. No, this Neville is afraid. He captures them, but he fears them.<br/><br/>Up to the end ""I Am Legend"" is great entertainment. It has strong emotional moments, even some very quite moments. And all this is convincing.<br/><br/>Does it have flaws? Oh yes. The cgi is not very good. And the ""vampires"" are a disaster! If the vampires had been actors, humans, it would have been just fine. But no, nowadays one has to use computers. But if you use cgi, you got to be good at it. The creatures in ""I Am Legend"" suck! Costs it a star. And the movie ignores the confrontation between Neville and the ""leader"" of the vampires. It is there, but the personal dimension of this fight is just depicted rudimentary. <br/><br/>Overall, very entertaining."

","I have to amend this review. i will leave the original here, but have to amend what I stated before. I didn't realize at the time that this film was a blatant rip-off of a far superior movie, starring the incomparable Vincent Price. Having since watched that one, which I'd somehow missed before, I'm disappointed. Will Smith is no Vincent Price, and can't even come close.<br/><br/>Also, I was a bit disappointed that the story was not presented fairly in the previews. The way those were made, I'd expected some wild, legendary creature, causing all the problems, and got something completely different. Don't sell me one thing and deliver another.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Actor Will Smith has, once again, delivered an exceptional performance, bringing to life the character Robert Neville, alone in NYC after a disaster, trying to save the world with only a dog for companionship. We are drawn into his world, his routines, his recreation, and his fears, in this chilling setting of the familiar gone horribly askew. He brings to life the trials of this man, showing us every strength and weakness, every hope and fear, every joy and sorrow. The direction is superb, and the supporting cast does a wonderful job. The setting is all too believable, and the special effects and make-up are very high quality, making us able to believe that all we are seeing is real. Overall excellent film, actually deserving of awards."
"divadrummer","7","1","3","18 January 2008"," Myth and Legend
","Will Smith is the last man on Earth (probably?), living in a New York city turned wild. We know there's more from the trailers - ""Nighttime: survive."" So who or what is this mysterious force that opposes Robert Neville as he ekes out a lonely life from society's dusty leftovers? I Am Legend artfully ropes you in with the premise, but it's like a clumsy teenager trying to make love from that point on. Some people will be disappointed by the way things wrap up, but I appreciated the sentiment and obvious affection for how the film was crafted.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where the setting is its own character, it's so well-developed and omnipresent. The movie's appeal lies mostly there, and with Will Smith being almost impossible to dislike. Plus there's a dog. Who doesn't love smart dogs in movies? I enjoy survival stories that don't highlight any serious physical pain. Robinson Crusoe, Lost, the Boxcar Children from my youth. You get to see everyone revert to a much simpler life as hunter/gatherers. I Am Legend is full of tiny, well-thought out details for how man might survive in a post-apocalyptic city. Neville keeps a hydroponic garden in his kitchen and harvests corn in the park. Even with a fancy rifle, hunting deer is difficult and best done on foot. Drugs, TVs, and money are useless, but bacon is priceless. Robert is strong, but painfully lonely, and talks to mannequins to maintain some sort of social normalcy. Daily exercise must be rigorous if Robert wishes to compete with the wild and survive the monsters.<br/><br/>And the monsters are where I start to get lost. It wouldn't be enough to have Robert Neville wandering around for two hours, so there must be a direct conflict. That's well built up when we see Neville revert to hysterics when Sam the dog runs off, or when his daily routine is timed to sunset. Why does Robert freak out when the dog disappears into darkness? Why is it important that Robert returns to his home by sunset? Why must he bar the windows and doors to his own home and pour some unknown liquid over his tracks on the doorstep? The monsters, of course, are us. By playing God and finding a viral cure for cancer, the punishment handed down was death and vampirism to all. Neville is immune to the vampire virus, but still has to worry about surviving their mindless aggression. This could have been very poignant if we'd never seen a monster, or if the monsters had retained at least some of their humanity.<br/><br/>Halfway through the movie, it stops becoming a survival story and starts morphing into a survival of the fittest story. Neville gets into violent battles with hordes of CGI vampires. It's not very realistic, though the irony of being immune to a virus and dying from the secondary effects anyway is not lost on me. As with Signs and nearly every survival horror story before it, the suspense vanishes completely when the horror stops being psychological and starts being primal. It's appealing to a lot of people - enough that survival horror is its own genre - but I seem to loose my connection to the hero as soon as he enters a dark hallway. I'd never do that, after all! And the monsters never frighten me when I can see them. Pyramid Head is a pushover.<br/><br/>The movie ends abruptly and unnecessarily, and for that, a lot of people won't like it. But I enjoyed the ride. I Am Legend really delivers through the first half of the movie, where the build is immensely interesting and suspenseful. But the conflict and resolution just isn't scary or satisfying.<br/><br/>PS: leave the children at home, please. CGI vampires are not for younglings (usually)."
"mthworld","8","1","3","18 January 2008"," Can he find a reason to continue?
","I watched this movie twice and grew tired of seemingly no-one appreciating it like I do. It's not the FX or the action (or non-action, as some would put it) that make it a good movie, but Will Smith's performance as Robert Neville, a man who has brought about the responsibility of saving the human race upon himself, while all the time trying to cling to his sanity in a situation that seems overwhelmingly hopeless. As he wanders the streets of New york reliving what happened when the virus broke out (for the benefit of the audience), he bears the mark of a man who will stop at nothing to get things fixed even though he suffers daily by his failure, loneliness and odds, and nightly by the anguishing cries of the Dark Seekers and his own troubled memories, barely holding on in his determined effort to save those who mercilessly hunt him. Pay close attention to the background as well as the foreground from start to finish, and also to the emotions portrayed by Will Smith, and don't sit hoping for a movie better than his last or for something exactly to the book that came before it.<br/><br/>""A week into filming, Francis Lawrence felt the Infected, who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) meant post-production had to be extended and the budget increased. Lawrence explained, ""They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can't get out of people in the middle of the night when they're barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they're constantly hyperventilating, which you can't really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out."" While the infected become vampires in the novel, the film script avoids such a direct reference; even though the character Anna calls them ""dark seekers"", and they consume living flesh, their design is inspired more by the concept of their adrenal glands being open all the time than by conventional vampire imagery. The actors remained on set to provide motion capture."" (Quoted from Wikipedia page, ""I Am Legend"")<br/><br/>I saw the previews and knew nothing further of it, thinking only ""What is he (Will Smith) up to now?"" after seeing a picture of him carrying a massive gun. I went, I saw, I enjoyed. So I went again."

","I really liked this movie. I was pretty mad when it ended because it was so good so far and when I realized that its about to end I couldn't believe it because it was.. the story wasn't over at all. In stead of making a 200 minute long movie and get to the top250 in IMDb, they decided to stop there and just everything else important said in the last 5 minutes. After seeing this, I really was stunned. Didn't expect that huge of a fail and tore down my ratings of this movie. After realizing that this movie was no more than a regular zombie movie, I can't rate this highly because of Wills performance, which was unbelievable. Hes performance can turn Manos into The Godfather. <br/><br/>Also, what was the point of the flashbacks. The flashback was total of 10 minutes long in this movie and just showed the obvious - the spread. It character information or its background which is usually the point of flashbacks.<br/><br/>The movie had a 150 million dollar budget and was so short and really, really poor CGI. I mean, there was NOTHING there. I think that CGI is a mistake to make models like humans, dogs etc. Its easier, less expensive and MUCH better and realistic to just use costumes and makeup. In the case of like ""Transformes"" yes, you cant use make-up to make the transformers, but all the best horror movies have costumes like Silent Hill and Jeepers Creepers(although there is a huge movie mistake in JC where you can see the zip of the costume).<br/><br/>This movie is nothing more than an above-average action film. Sorry."
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","3","16 January 2008"," An isolated thriller
","Being a huge Will Smith fan (Fresh Prince, Ali) I was really looking forward to this film. Smith stars as Robert Neville, a scientist who is the last man left alive in New York City after a virus wipes out human life, leaving horrible creatures to roam around in the dark.<br/><br/>Will Smith is wildly known for his roles in action films such as Independence Day, Bad Boys 1 and 2. Here however he is challenging a new genre in this scary horror film. I'm personally not a huge fan of horror films but I enjoyed this particular one because mainly of Smith, the direction and the plot.<br/><br/>Smith is on top form as the central protagonist Neville, who is a very quiet soul, who lives his life on the edge every day with his dog Sam, trying to find a way out of the city. He is well suited for the role, occasionally throwing in the odd joke now and then, (watch for the Shrek scene), and an interesting look on Neville's character.<br/><br/>The direction is marvellous. As Neville is the last person alive, Lawrence creates a wonderful atmosphere to portray this with heavy use of long shots and the dialogue with Sam the dog create sadness and wonder of life alone.<br/><br/>The plot is well written, giving us a brief introduction of how Neville came to be the last alive to slowly engaging the audience into how Neville goes about staying alive. As the film progresses, we are given flashbacks to understand what happened on the night it all changed for Neville, a heart warming story in itself. I found the use of flashbacks very dramatic and portrayed the loneliness of the character.<br/><br/>It's scary with the creatures of darkness very quiet at the beginning but being more threatening during the latter parts.<br/><br/>As good as the film is I couldn't help but make comparisons with Danny Boyle's 28 days later. That film has the same ideology of a virus escaping and taking over human life.<br/><br/>Both films are equally as good. I Am Legend perhaps has a bit more character in but both are scary and are must watches for any horror film fans."

Will Smith did a great job with being alone in most of the movie. It has to be hard not having people to do lines with. I think this is the best physical shape he has been in since Ali. I am truly impressed with the skill that went into making this movie. I actually went through a lot of different emotions during this movie. At some points I was laughing and others I was nearly in tears. There was a great dynamic between him and the dog. I almost wanted to go out and get one just like her. I can truly say that the movie was not a disappointment."
"Caps Fan","8","1","3","15 January 2008"," Some weaknesses, but well worth seeing
","I have not read the Richard Matheson novel on which this is based, so cannot comment on any deviations between the two.<br/><br/>From the point of view of enjoying the film, however, this doesn't matter much. Will Smith turns in an excellent and convincing performance as Robert Neville, a military doctor living in fortified solitude on Manhattan. Neville believes himself to be the last real human left alive after a devastating plague arising from a genetically modified version of the measles virus developed, as we see in a short prologue, by a cancer specialist as a cure for that affliction.<br/><br/>Also on the island are various animals and some other humans who have mutated rather than died from the virus. Their sole aim is to kill anyone not like them, but they cannot stand UV light, so cannot come out during the day.<br/><br/>The sequences set in a deserted New York owe more than a little to the equivalent scenes set in London that were part of what made Danny Boyle's chilling 2002 effort ""28 Days Later"" so effective. Unlike that film, however, we see flashbacks (including the prologue, which shows an interview with the cancer specialist, played with eerie smugness by Emma Thompson) that tell us how things got this way.<br/><br/>Apart from a rather pat ending, the film is remarkable for its hopelessness. Neville is reduced to conversing with shop dummies and viewing recordings of old news shows. It is when he starts expecting them to answer that we realize the effect all of this is having on his mind.<br/><br/>Camera work and music are satisfactory rather than inspired and the CGI effects for the mutants are less than convincing. The atmosphere is great though and sterling work from Smith makes this a movie well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Recommended. Rating: 8/10."
"matches81","5","1","3","13 January 2008"," Somewhat disappointing
","I just watched ""I am Legend"" and have to admit I had expected more. During the first half the movie succeeds in developing a sense of isolation and manages to get across how 3 years of loneliness can affect a man. Will Smith does a good job in portraying that, and actually the dog manages to become a character as well. The shots of an abandoned metropolis, New York in this case, are just as impressive as the shots of an empty London in ""28 days later"" were. The main difference for me is that the main character has lived in this world for a few years now, and has managed to stay relatively sane by playing small ""games"". That makes him quite likable. Still, he is on the border of insanity, which makes him interesting. For me, that's a really good mix. Sadly, after the first half, somehow it seems that the CGI department took over. Why they used CGI for the infected is just beyond me, lots of other movies did far better jobs at portraying similar ""monsters"" with just some makeup and perhaps prosthetics where needed. The infected in this movie just stand out far too much to be taken really seriously. Lots of badly done CGI monsters with no variation to them whatsoever to make them at least look like they could have been human. From there it goes straight downhill and finally comes to a conclusion with a typical Hollywood happy ending, which is the most disappointing thing of all."

The way he felt after was portrayed brilliantly, full of regret in that it was his own stupid fault for putting himself and his dog Sam at risk. That dog broke a heart string of mine being so loyal and such a good listener.<br/><br/>Look at the other reviews for the details of bad C.G.I cop out rubbish. It was unrealistic and incredibly fake.

Only the director pursues her deranged statements into the ending of the film.<br/><br/>... Do not rely on yourself for survival, put that into the hands of GOD... Many people who know of ZEN know that this is a sorry way to live your life."

","When i first saw the trailer for ""I am Legend"", i was intrigued by the mysteriousness of the story. Although the beginning was rather slow-moving, it still made me watch quite intently, with light humour. However, the more i watched, the more it turned into another one of those monster movies...with a similar story-line of ""28 weeks later"" where humans turn into monsters with super-strength and kill other humans and the hero tries to save everyone, or run away.<br/><br/>Although with the un-original movie story line, it does have a slower moving story than the other plain horrors and we really get to know and connect with the main character (Smith).<br/><br/>But i'm still let down by this movie, as i did not know it was based on a book. So i guess i was just hoping for something special...but i was sadly mistaken..."

","The dark knight trailer at the beginning was better than this whole film combined. it just was slow and had about 3 or 4 good thrilling spots in the film that i enjoyed but everything else was dull and questionable. it left me with a whole lot of questions that didn't get answered and i don't like that if i am more confused to end the movie than before. I'm just glad it was only like 1hour and 40 mins. Will smith did well for basically being the only star in the movie, but there is still more things missing that he cant fix by just taking off his shirt and working out for all the women to see!! like i said before, i could of walked out after the dark knight trailer and been happy. this just didn't do it for me, for all the hype it got."

","Sometimes a good story, a big budget, and a hot leading actor is not enough, as this retread of ""The Omega Man "" demonstrates.<br/><br/>As a straight story, it is OK. But the good bits are lifted from the original, and the 21st Century reinterpretations are flat.The title itself is pretentious, bordering on the preposterous, and the rest of the picture largely follows suit.<br/><br/>Largely played as a single hander, Will Smith plays the part of Dr Robert Neville convincingly enough. The fact that his dog Doesn't survive is a nice twist on accepted disaster movie convention.His pre occupation with Bob Marleys redemptive aspirations are a pale echo of the Woodstock film at the start of the ""Omega Man"".<br/><br/>In the original the mutants have a role, and a leader, and are far more powerful for it. This time round they are lifted straight out of Lord of the Rings / The descent/ The Cave, and whilst offering shock value deny the script dramatic tension. In 1971, you could forgive the formulaic and one dimensional part written for the female companion he comes across, in 2008 it is unforgivable, and part of a headlong rush in the last quarter to wrap things up as quickly 9and unconvincingly) as possible.<br/><br/>Neville's flashbacks add little to the story and could easily have been sacrificed in favour of more body for both the mutants, and the girl.Francis lawrence, director, has a background in TV and video, it shows, and ultimately he is out of his depth with this effort."
"Panterken","9","1","3","12 January 2008"," Apocalyptic Poetry
","In the past few years a handful of cineasts has tried in vain to put together a new adaptation of 'I Am Legend', the renowned Richard Matheson science-fiction novel dating from 1954 (the latest version came out quite some time ago, the 1971 Charlton Heston flick 'The Omega Man').<br/><br/>In the nineties, Ridley Scott and Arnold Schwarzenegger were eager to begin on the project, but the costs shot up and the studio decided to pull the plug. And Michael Bay also didn't succeed - Thank God!- to drum up the required support.<br/><br/>Eventually, Warner Brothers gave director Francis Lawrence ('Constantine') and actor Will Smith the long anticipated green light, something that didn't exactly made me rapturous - all I can remember from 'Constantine' is Keanu Reeves' laughable performance while Smith's 'Independence Day', even though it's a guilty pleasure of mine, was a grade A example of poorly balanced use of special effects (too much) and a neglected script.<br/><br/>But what'd you know: 'I Am Legend', by the actor totally accurately defined as an 'artistic character drama disguised as a blockbuster' is pretty strong stuff. Smith is truly tremendous as Robert Neville, a scientist who as the only person on earth stayed immune from an evil virus. In the daytime he wonders the streets of the fully extinct Manhatton terribly alone - you could even call the the film a One-Act film - and in the nighttime he entrenches in his with food cans and sad souvenirs stuffed flat, where he begins to show alarming (and brilliantly acted) symptoms of pinching loneliness: the scene where Neville, as if under hypnosis, is dubbing 'Shrek' is downright creepy. Not to mention the heartbreaking 'please say hello to me' scene. The film clearly shows it has a backbone.<br/><br/>The images of the Manhattan re-won by nature (wild deers on Times Square!) look both hallucinating and unearthly beautiful. To end up with this effect - will our cities réally look like that in the future - as a director you need not only an astronomic budget and a large digital magic box but also a good traffic officer (some avenues were, to the rage of the New Yorkers, closed off for hours) and a certain touch for apocalyptic poetry.<br/><br/>And, last but not least, I can't forget to mention this: the 'Dark Seekers' who appear quite literally like ghosts in the night and make Neville's life a living hell, really breath out an atmosphere of genuine threat. Unlike the creatures in almost all sci-fi films who appear comical and plain ridiculous. The film also avoids all other common mistakes of these kinds of film. <br/><br/>1) Logic: The hero isn't an all powerful mindless no-neck. He doesn't go out to destroy all the creatures but has a natural reaction which is...avoiding them at all costs. 2) No overkill: the audience isn't drowned in a sea of special effects. Almost all sci-fi movies make the mistake of overusing their digital magic. The story remains central in the film. A great big plus. 3) Well acted: other sci-fi movies (again I'm labeling it sci-fi, while it is clearly a multi-genre film. Sci-fi is just one of the genres) tend to squander money on special effects meanwhile neglecting the casting.<br/><br/>This multi-genre film that is really thé ultimate adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel, is an incredible movie experience. It'll scare and sadden you but will also most definitely amuse and touch you. Put it at the top of your to-see list.<br/><br/>9.1/10"
"muspelhem","1","1","3","12 January 2008"," Things that would improve ""I Am Legend""
","I'm going to list improvements that could be made to this movie. WARNING: SPOILER START 1.If the British scientist(Ahhh, us evil Brits) in the opening sequence had said ""copper"" instead of cop. A British person would do this. 2. If the same scientist had been less confident in her claim of having cured cancer. Real scientists, when interviewed, are usually very careful with what they say. 3. If we had seen Robert Neville's family die, before seeing Robert Neville alone in New York. This way, the suspense would be intact. 4. If we got some explanation why Neville's wife, when scanned for the virus, first tested positive, then, when scanned again, negative. Also, it would be cool to know why the quarantine guards accepted this? Seems there's a 50/50 chance she's infected, that's some risk to take letting her through? 5. If Robert Neville was a little less resourceful. On a typical day, he manages to get up, work out, hunt deer, harvest vegetables, transmit his call for help ""on all AM frequencies"", return his DVDs and get out new ones, conduct his lab experiments, work on his drive and finally, he feeds and washes his dog. For some reason, at the end of the day, he goes to sleep in his bathtub. 6. If the ending was rewritten. For some reason, we get this holier-than-thou crap about genetic engineering being a sin, and then Anna starts on about how God wanted them to meet. She also claims that He has told her about a surviving colony of people in the mountains. Also, who has ever heard of a zombie flick with a happy ending? 7.If Anna had heard of Bob Marley. Like everyone else on this planet. The movie cliché, where Neville looks incredulous, and subsequently introduces her to the music, would have worked better with some lesser known artist. For God's sake. A woman like Anna, in her late twenties to early thirties KNOWS who Bob Marley is. And so did we, so thanks a million for telling us, Robert Neville. SPOILER END If all these things were improved, you might end up with a descent movie."

And, after everything is said and done, the whole story falls flat on it's face.<br/><br/>I find it slightly disturbing that I can't find a particular reason for my sentiment. One thing that occurred to me though, was that there are a few subtle (and not so subtle) references to movies like ""The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2)"", ""The Night of the Living Dead"", ""28 Days Later"", ""Resident Evil"" and ""The Stand"" (mini TV-series). Combine these, add a sprinkle of ""Castaway"" and you get the picture. And this, I think is the problem. The story told is just a mish-mash of themes from other movies without bringing much of its' own material.<br/><br/>The picture just lacks the fizz and surprise this kind of movie should have.

","I wanted to like the movie, but left wishing I had not seen it. Big budget special effects and good acting qualify this as a well-made movie, especially in the first half, but then Will Smith's character fails to be a hero or a legend. He dies and his dog, Samantha, dies in a sequence that appears forced into the movie and is not helpful to the progression of the story. The second half of the story does not follow the setup of the first half. Ending the movie with a scene of him, his dog, and other survivors walking into the sanctuary while holding a cure to the virus would have given this disaster movie a happy, inspiring conclusion worthy of the title."

","I saw I Am Legend opening night with a sold out crowd. I've been hearing mixed reviews from others, but personally I think that this movie was great. It had suspense, comedy, and action. It also depicted in a pretty realistic way what the future would look like. Will Smith as well as the other actors were amazing. How would you act if you were the only person alive with no human interaction except mannequins to keep you company? You would most likely snap. Many people said they were disappointed with the ending. How should you end it? In every post apocalyptic movie I've seen the audience has been disappointed because of the ending. Well, it's not like everything is magically going to go back to the way it was. Put the people who do survive still have hope. Such as the characters at the end of I am Legend."

I also can't believe that THIS was the movie that toppled Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King off it's Highest Grossing Weekend perch, I guess it was the result of a very good marketing package - I was influenced to see it by the marketing.

After them, there is a big break in the movie. After the first hour we see nothing special or new stuff more. The CGI effects and the story goes down fast. And at the end I asked myself: why? Why happened that again. Hollywood destroys a good idea again. This movie would be better with a European director. They can do much more than money making. Will Smith was -thanks God- good in this character, he is the only one worth to see. And of course his dog. Shame..."
"raysond","Null","1","3","8 January 2008"," Riveting Science-Fiction at its finest as only Will Smith delivers and executes brilliantly
","Military virologist Robert Neville(Will Smith) is alone,somewhere on the edge of sanity,patrolling barren New York City streets in a battered SUV,with his steadfast German shepherd,Sam. No pedestrians bustle along Fifth Avenue.,in Times Square,or Chinatown. Yellow taxis sit idle,bumper-to-bumper,with no passengers and no place to go. Grass grows up through the pavement as nature exerts its revenge. Deer herds run wild. Demons lurk in the shadows. It's not a dream. It's a nightmare,a living nightmare. The frightening picture of a world gone astray is very realistic as it gets.<br/><br/>Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the aftermath of a plague and desperate isolation has inspired earlier films,including ""The Last Man On Earth""(Vincent Price,1964),and ""The Omega Man""(Charlton Heston,1971). Screenwriter Mark Protosevich,who developed this script with writer/producer Akiva Goldsman(Academy Award winner for ""A Beautiful Mind"");Will Smith along with producer James Lassiter(who was behind Will Smith's Oscar nominated film ""The Pursuit of Happiness"");and director Francis Lawrence(""Constantine"")saw this adaptation as a contemporary science-fiction allegory. The year the story is set is in 2012,three years after a manmade,retrofitted virus has run amok. Neville follows his daily routine. He's cordial and keeps conversations with unknowns(such as talking to mannequins)light;it helps him retain some semblance of normalcy. He sends out an S.O.S over the airwaves,""If there is anybody out there,anybody. Please You are not alone."" For means of survival,he patrols Gotham hunting deer and chasing images. As the night falls,he and Sam hunker down in a brownstone near Washington Square. Neville bars the doors and shutters the windows. He curls up in the bathtub in a fetal position with Sam and a submachine gun. Terrified. Things scream outside:the living dead,mutant victims of the plague,dark feeders led by a vicious alpha male(Dash Mihok).<br/><br/>Although post-apocalypse films aren't new(""Planet of the Apes"",""Mad Max"",""The Road Warrior"",""28 Days Later"",""Vanilla Sky""),most feature several protagonists. Neville,however,is bereft of any human contact. Haunted by the past,the mass evaculation of New York City,and the loss of his wife(Salli Richardson),and child(Willow Smith),he reasons that he must find a cure for the mutants' misery. The setting of Manhattan has rarely felt so desolute. It's isolated and abandoned. It's dreadful and very terrifying. Danger is around the corner never knowing what Neville would expect toward the unexpected. Never knowing what is over your shoulder. Then from the moment when the dark feeders appear,Robert knows he has to fight for his life,even if it means survival of the fittest. The stark skyscraper ghost town sets an eerie tone. Uncanny special effects and the sound team's fearsome,growling mutant canines,zombie wails,and thunderous deer stampedes augment their efforts. These technical strengths mitigate the film's transgressions. By all rights,""I Am Legend"",is stunning entertainment. And it may win that distinction,but not without some flaws. Everything goes right for the first 45 minutes,then over-ambitious plotting,slow pacing and melodrama,it lets the viewer hungry for more quick-tempo action sequences and concise character studies,since overall Will Smith himself,is carrying the balance of the picture. Yet,just about anything goes in a Will Smith movie,and here Smith's performance is magnetic. He digs emotional depths and exhibits a spellbinding aura while sharing screen time with only a dog and menacing shadows. This is riveting science fiction at its finest,with a philosophical concept cloaked in a new age of a world gone astray and a man facing sheer terror at every turn."

","I really liked this movie. I have to admit I wasn't expecting too much coming from Francis Lawrence due to his prior Constantine, but he surprised me in a good way with this 'I Am Legend'. Although a reminisce to Cast Away is impossible to avoid, this movie has its own excuses to twist even a bit more the 'one man in no man's land' context. And it does it pretty good, at least 3/4 of the movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that the ending is poor or that it can be foreseen, but when 'I Am Legend' is finishing (and you feel when it's doing it) you have that annoying thing in your head that tells you ""I would have liked a bit more"". The idea of the movie and the way it's developed along the filming is close to superb, but suddenly it goes down abruptly enough to actually avoid the ""Classic"" category that it should have deserved otherwise."

","I'm not going to lie to the readers of this review. I use the word review I would call it more of a response, my reaction to this art. I'm not going to bring my overall experience of this film down just because If I champion a certain aspect it might make me look uncool in the eyes of other film lovers. I enjoyed I Am Legend. It was one of the first films in a long time that genuinely had me on the edge of my seat with a racing heart at certain points. I thought Will Smith was decent and pulled off his character well. The film was well-shot, well-paced and directed well.<br/><br/>The reason I get so angry with some of the reviews I have read on this site about this movie is how pathetic some people can be. The film is BASED ON the original novel. Therefore, we can deduct that it is an ADAPTATION of the director's perception of the book. It is not a cast iron copy, it is its own story, based on and inspired by the novel. Therefore it should be rated individually on its own merits.<br/><br/>Another point that I'd like to raise is that most people seem peeved about the typical Hollywood 'happy ending.' If the ending was much darker, those same people would be moaning that it was too dark. At the end of the day Hollywood films have a formula, that's what gives them there genre. AND by the way, I thought the ending was strong because it leaves you to imagine what might happen  a strength often only found in the world of novels.<br/><br/>As far as post apocalyptic world films go, I found this film to be realistic (if that is the correct use of the term) and most of all, thought provoking. It challenged me, and that is why I enjoyed it."

It is not a HAPPY FILM and definitely not the one you should watch after having a bad day. If you are a rather thoughtful person, you will like this one.I think the reason, why a lot of people did not like it, is that they got embarrassed as this one is a DEPRESSIVE one.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, I felt all Will's emotions and at the same time I was observing myself after how long I would have given up the whole thing if I was him.It is a great self-testing how strongly you insist on life.It translates a message about strong will, faith and that the meaning of life is to fight for survival at any price.Indeed, I do agree on that."

","I rarely feel the need to share my feelings on a film with people outside of my circle of friends, however having seen 'I Am Legend' I now am compelled to. Having read the excellent source novel it would be easy to criticise the film for missing out some key points. The interpretation of the 'vampires', the explanation of the books/films title, etc. but to do so ignores the central performance in the film. Will Smith's examination of loneliness in an empty world is deeply moving. The subtle madness of a man desperate for company is portrayed in a way that is neither caricatured or unbelievable. The relationship between Neville and his dog is stronger than most films can generate between two human leads, and this relationship leads to a scene that I personally found heartbreaking. The trailer did not do justice to the film and I was expecting an empty, if enjoyable, apocalyptic movie. What you actually get is a thoughtful film with a very human heart."
"brazzer","8","1","3","5 January 2008"," Smith is Legend
","The curiously titled I am Legend is a surprising breath of fresh air in an otherwise bland lineup of recent, similar titles. This is down to both the excellent performance from Smith and also the genuinely atmospheric post apocalyptic setting.<br/><br/>Expanding on that, Smith really shines as Dr. Robert Neville, portraying a man pushed to the brink of insanity with just the right amount of Smith's trademark humour. Witnessing the good Doctors' day to day life, with his only living companion a dog named Sam, in the empty streets of New York is one of the films greatest highlights.<br/><br/>In its opening scenes Legend is reminiscent of 28 Days Later and Cast Away, although there is some real doses of claustrophobic terror as Smith comes closer to the ghouls lurking in the shadows, and at points could be likened to the original Alien. However, the film does perhaps lose an element of this genuinely intense atmosphere as the ghastly 'Dark Seekers' are revealed in all their polygonal glory. As is the case in most scary flicks, the 'monster' is always most effective when you never quite see it.<br/><br/>This is a minor gripe, however I feel the main drawback of Legend is that it is quite frankly, too short! I can only assume that the reason for this movie just about reaching the 100 mins mark is due to doubts that a movie containing primarily one human character wouldn't captivate a modern audience for very long. However, after viewing Legend, you will probably find yourself wanting more of Dr. Neville, even if he is alone.<br/><br/>We can only hope that there will perhaps be an extended edition released on DVD giving the film the screen time it deserves, but for now, Legend is definitely worth seeing on the big screen."

I am legend had me laughing, jumping out of my skin and i had tears in my eyes throughout this great movie. It made me think of a ghost town I robot with monsters instead of robots and no future look.<br/><br/>Three years after a plague kills nearly everyone a immune survivor called Robert Neville tries to find a cure for the virus so he can save the humans-turned zombies/vampires. Also while doing this he is trying to make contact with any survivors out there.<br/><br/>This is the saddest movie i have seen in a very long time. The tragic story of Robert Neville will have you thinking about his story long after the movie is finished. Some will look at him as a hero and some will look at him as a monster.<br/><br/>The laughs come later in the movie but i will not spoil the laughs for you.<br/><br/>This movie was much scarier then i thought it would be. I was jumping in my seat at least every few minutes. I recommend not to take young kids because it may have them up all night. But thats your decision whether or not to take kids.<br/><br/>The CGI is not what you would expect from what todays CGI can deliver. So don't go in expecting amazing CGI. The environments look amazing but the monsters seem to be lacking the amazing CGI today offers. IMO they should have use real people with make up on for the monsters.<br/><br/>I recommend this to everyone.

","This kind of film is what going to the flicks is all about. I was scared witless from the first moment to the last. Admittedly I hadn't realised it was a zombie movie (of sorts) before the titles rolled and it was a good 40 minutes before we even came across one, but Jeez, this is a film designed to make you jump. I won't spoil it but, as they say, wear brown trousers.<br/><br/>I know zombie flicks are overdone of late. But that's not a reason to overlook this freak-show.<br/><br/>Will Smith is in fine form, essentially carrying the movie singlehandedly with very little human intervention. That's because we understand him to be the last man standing after a genetically treated measles virus which was intended to eradicate the world of cancer went ugly overnight.<br/><br/>The scenes that have most redolence in this movie are the truly stunning and really eerie street scenes of an abandoned New York populated only by escaped zoo animals who aren't that handy with lawnmowers, the result being that, for example, Madison Avenue is well on its way to becoming a maize field with a bunch of abandoned, rusting cars lying around. Whole buildings are wrapped in polythyene, presumably a failed attempt to contain the virus in some way.<br/><br/>Smith looks great, acts pretty well and builds up a strong relationship with his only companion, his three year old Alsation, Sam.<br/><br/>The film is lavish. The sound engineering is both deafening and a major component to most of the shocks.<br/><br/>The zombies, while CGI'd at times, are genuinely creepy. They cannot come out in daylight as UV burns them on the spot so they huddle, vampire like, in 'hives' in gloomy dilapidated buildings waiting for nightfall when they take over the streets with their ghoulish hounds.<br/><br/>In one set piece when we KNOW Will shouldn't go into a darkened building the tension is unbearable and more drawn out than a Strictly Come Dancing result. You KNOW it will culminate in a massive fright and it does, but that doesn't stop it being eye-wateringly scary.<br/><br/>This is a cracker and my first 8 out of 10 movie of 2008.<br/><br/>Go see."

You will find that I am Legend is just exactly that - a legend, an outcast among Zombie horror movies - in the sense that it retains the all-important human element (an emotional, sensitive core) while the mutilation progresses on screen.<br/><br/>Basic Plot Premise: ""Genetically engineered virus, initially hailed as a cure for Cancer turns killer, wiping 90% of human population. 2% remain alive and sane. Remaining 8% become zombies. Enter Will Smith as the only sane surviver in New York city and the apparent impression that he is the last man on earth (with a dog named ""Sam"" for company - apparently canines are resistant from the air-borne form), searching for a cure. In one of his Zombie encounters, he is overpowered, then .... "" - for the rest, watch the movie (or read Wikipedia :P) What is surprising about the movie is that there is very little of the mutilation and gore. The movie delivers its scares by building up a persistent, never-ceasing tension throughout and introducing suddenly the agile, super-strong zombies. While the scary stuff lasts you an instant, what lingers on is the emotional core of the movie, played perfectly by Will Smith, in what could be described as one of his best performances.<br/><br/>New York as the choice of the desolate city couldn't be more apt. In many ways, NY is perhaps the epitome of human financial & technical achievement - the result of an empowering vision of capitalism and free-will - the bastion of man's creativity. And in many others, NY has suffered tremendously (Sept 11, 2001). In a world bereft of sane human habitation, this city serves as a haunting window to glimpse into a world deserted and forgotten. Manhattan's famous skyline lies deserted, the entire of NY becoming an eerie ghost-town, with weeds growing on the streets and wild animals roaming freely. NY, once home to a bustling populace, now inhabited and overpowered by nature's forces - an illustration of how natures tames human beings. In an atmosphere as overwrought with desolation as this, enter Will Smith as the city's lone survivor scientist, who even after 3yrs continues to believe that he can ""fix it"".<br/><br/>Will Smith might have wasted himself over disasters such as MIB, MIB II, Independence Day (yea, you can call them time-pass, but they are little more than the Britney Spears equivalent of movies) , but here he brings to play the same sense of emotional ache and angst that we saw in The Pursuit of Happiness. As the last man alive, his motivation to live is constantly wavering and he searches for some tangible meaning to living alone the rest of his life. In order to maintain some degree of sanity, he views tape-recordings of NEWS broadcasts from the happier past, arranges mannequins in a DVD store and strikes up a conversation with them while picking out DVD titles, all along trying to act normal. And we see streaks of how heartbroken and desolate this man really is. And we see how close he is tethering on the border of insanity and hysteria.<br/><br/>Especially notable is the scene where the dog attacks Smith after being infected by the virus and Smith responds by killing his own dog (Sam), his lone partner in his struggle. In that one moment, we see the absolute, maddening grief of a man who has just lost that one thing that has sustained him through a phase of immense turbulence, that has given him some false yet quantifiable sense of hope. And that grief - the magnitude and enormity of it - is completely evident by the subdued yet profound way in which Smith portrays it.<br/><br/>And these are the moments where the movie strikes a chord with your emotional side, as you sympathize with this lone sane (borderline insane) man in a world bereft of all human consciousness and where centuries of human progress lies unused, unappreciated and forlorn.<br/><br/>And thats where this movie is different from other Zombie thrillers - the protagonist (Smith) here is not an super-cool, unemotional guy, who doesn't flinch even once while going on a massive zombie killing spree or utter even a monosyllable of horror at widespread cannibalism (read: Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil series). Instead, the protagonist is an emotional intellectual, who fervently wishes that he can set things right and is so totally vulnerable at times. This along with a haunting, deserted ghost-town of a megapolis (NY) gives this movie a certain authenticity. Granted there are moments when the movie is not believable (the source/reason for Will's motivation to live as the last man, the manner of Will's rescue, etc), but overall this is definitely a fine piece of cinema with a tangible emotional core that rattles you at times and leaves you distinctly unsettled.<br/><br/>Bottom-line: I am Legend is more a movie about the desolation & grief of a lone man and how he battles it, than a Zombie thriller. It is also a very chilling visualization of how NY, Mumbai, etc will look like once human habitation withers away. In many ways, it reminds us of how far human civilization has progressed and how fragile our existence is. Go watch this movie for more than a scare or two - it will leave you in a thoughtful state, as you contemplate the horror of no human habitation, of all things human - culture, art, music to cease existing - just imagine Da Vinci, Shakespeare, Pink Floyd all coming to naught ...."

","I would like to come out and say first that this movie was not completely awful. Though it was not by any stretch of the imagination anywhere near the genius of the book. I mean its a movie vs a book, but I the story itself was changed for the movie. It started off OK, but too little information was revealed about the past in very very small glimpse that really did not help much. The feeling of being alone was somewhat there but the actual point of the book was loss about halfway in. Many scenes felt rushed, some almost a little confusing. If only they kept the story from the book and successfully planted it into the movie~ That said if you don't like reading skip the movie and get the audio book. If you like zombie flicks then this is up your alley even though they were vampires they sure acted like zombies. In the book they used to haunt Neville by talking to him heh."

","Have any of you people ever been to a restaurant where you ordered cheese cake for desert and got ice cream instead? Well this is what you'll get if you watch this movie if you have read the book. My advice is: Don't watch it!<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't- go for it! You might even like it. Having spent so much money on bloated propaganda and adverts makes it very appetising to watch. Even I fell for it and I am ashamed to admit it. If a friend tells you that the book is great don't go to the cinema with expectations to ""see"" the book: this is not the type of Harry Potter film. This is some other book. In fact the film has been misnamed. It should have been called ""The Legendary Zombie Killer"" or something within those lines. Sure enough it has a few things ""stolen"" from the book but it has nothing to do with it. The entire point of the book has been changed. Here are some highlighters for you:<br/><br/>1. Robert Neville is really the last survivor of the human race. The rest are Vampires- not Zombies of a mutated cancer curing virus.<br/><br/>2. He does not have a dog. He finds one and it dies in his arms within a week thus deepening his agony and desperation.<br/><br/>3. He does not meet another immune human. He is tricked by a Vampire so he can be captured by the emerging Vampire Civilization.<br/><br/>4. The human race is no more. He dies as a ""Human Dracula"" Legend to the new Vampire race that now populates the world and he will forever plague their dreams (like Dracula plagues ours). He dies with this realisation in mind and that is why he says: I am legend.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the movie is quite ordinary: Just some guy killing zombies. Cool effects (sort of) and nice action but that is all.<br/><br/>Will Smith also gets a huge chunk off his impressive reputation. For a demanding role like this one he plays good but not good enough. He is just not the actor that the viewers can accept as gone crazy and does not live up at all to Robert Neville's personage.(Bruce Willis might have been the better choice) The propaganda and ""official"" critiques makes me ask questions to which I will probably never get answers. Why would I Am Legend get such high rankings and Catwoman received seven Golden Raspberry nominations in 2005? When you think about it both films are too far off the original script. At least Halle Berry accepted the award for Worst Actress personally, apologising for the film. Let's see if Will Smith will have the courage to do the same. Let's all hope so for his sake. After all this was the worst film for 2007"

"Schriber","5","1","3","2 January 2008"," Disappointing... Just another zombie movie
","I've been waiting for ""I Am Legend"" to come out for quite a while. Having seen the other films (""Last Man of Earth"" and ""Omega Man"") and read the book, I was hoping they would try something different this time. Unfortunately, they didn't. This latest version does not stay true to the book (like the others) and misses the whole point. The reason ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson is such a classic is that it's not like every other zombie story. The end is not happy, nor is it really expected. It offers a profound point of view that really grabs the reader. The movie on the other hand does none of this. It really is just another zombie flick.<br/><br/>On it's own, it's similar to ""28 Days Later"" only not as original or good. Everyone has done the angry and powerful zombie thing now and it's getting old. ""Omega Man"" was better and they made it more than twenty years ago.<br/><br/>Like many new movies, they've relied on CGI effects rather than real objects or stop motion. The result is quite obviously fake with very poor looking animal and vehicle motions.<br/><br/>Will Smith is indeed good but even his performance can't save this film.<br/><br/>The producers of ""I Am Legend"" had the chance to do something different and thought provoking with this film but they missed the opportunity. How disappointing."
"Chris_Halpin","8","1","3","2 January 2008"," Fantastic film, well acted with a great plot.
","I have just returned from seeing I Am Legend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Admittedly the CG monsters were a bit iffy in places but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film. The only two needless parts were a rather steroid-laden Will Smith gets his kit off to exercise (for the ladies I presume?) And the gratuitous car porn a-la the Shelby GT-500 that wasn't used apart from a few shots in the opening of the film. It was exactly what I wanted from a post-apocalyptic film and I really thought it did a much better job with the source material than The Last Man On Earth and The Omega Man. I felt the ending was logical and well placed and came at just the right time and Will Smith did an excellent job with the role, particularly the scenes hinting at the on-set of humanity. The twist was intact as well although I know a lot of people seemed to miss it.<br/><br/>I'll definitely be picking this one up on DVD and really look forward to watching it again. I can understand why there is a lot of criticism about the film, if you go in expecting a zombie flick you'll be sorely disappointed, and you'll also be left a bit despondent if you expect typical Will Smith action man/tongue in cheek adventure. It does leave a lot to the imagination and it asks more questions than it answers but that's exactly what I like from a great film, I hate cheesy dialogue and daft comments that have been forced into films just to explain things that the audience really should be able to figure out for themselves (""we learned earth's languages from the world wide web"" a-la Transformers springs to mind""). In my opinion it's a solid 8/10, although a lot of people in the cinema seemed to think differently from what I could overhear when everyone left the auditorium. That said I thought 28 Days Later (another post-apocalyptic zombie style film that springs to mind) was abysmal and everyone I know seemed to enjoy it. I can't put my finger on exactly why but it seems to be a real ""love it or hate it"" marmite type of film."

","When I sat down in the theater to watch I Am Legend, I anticipated a great movie, and when the credits rolled, the film had done just that. Watching New York with no one there but deer, lions and Dark Seekers is just amazing; however, the CGI Dark Seekers were a little disappointing, but that isn't to say that they weren't scary, and indeed they were. Although the conclusion was a bit erratic, I Am Legend certainly was not, and well worth seeing. Oh, and Will Smith dazzles. Also, in the scene where Will Smith is golfing off of a fighter jet, it makes me wonder and ponder the whole situation; I never knew that a film could do that and it does."
"antra_chief","8","1","3","31 December 2007"," Great adaptation spooled by CGI effects
","This review might be considered as bias as I am into these kind of films, anything relating to zombies and to a post apocalyptic setting I tend to watch. What makes this film so special to me is the fact that its based on a book which had inspired other directors to create films of similar themes (zombies, last man on earth, desolate environment etc.) and I thought that its time to see the origin of these films from I Am Legend. Even though its an adaptation, it is a good adaptation. In fact all three film adaptations that I've seen are great (The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man and I Am legend) and each puts in their own version of how the story is conveyed. I guess the first film stays true to the book in which the main character Robert Neville actually goes on a vampire hunting spree. But later adaptations are good variation to the story and I Am Legend is indeed in one of those category. Focuses mainly on Neville's psychological characteristics and rather than concentrating on him killing the infected its main focus is on him trying to find a cure, this film ask the question of what it would be like to be the last man on earth. And how can one cope with being that last human in an empty world. I never thought of the movie to be full of action packed sequences, the film does what it says on the tin and again stays faithful to the original story. Using the mannequins to talk to and having a dog as a companion keeps his insanity at bay. The ending again is slightly different and instead of being killed by the infected Neville sacrifices himself in order to save the others and instead of his legend being established due to 'vampire-killing', his legend is established due to the cure he has founded. Not exactly a bad variation to the ending but imo it suffers from the Hollywood system of a happy ending. Not particularly what I had expected considering that the previous outing ended far better with him being staked but it was better than nothing I supposed. My only gripe with the film is the CGI. Horrendous looking CGI with the mutants. Supposedly the director replaced real actors with CGI as it was not convincing enough. Well these CGI mutants weren't any better nor convincing enough as well. However I've got to say the environments were amazing to look at and it really created that desolate looking setting. Overall it started off great, was fairly decent in the middle but kinda spooled in the end."
"fourfloorsbelow","7","1","3","29 December 2007"," Gripping Tale Of Post Apocalypta
","I have just arrived home from seeing a great, well produced film, but with its abrupt ending left me disappointed and let down.<br/><br/>The film begun with an absence of dialogue for almost an hour, which was strange but refreshing and original. It was brilliant at first, an excellent storyline with champion acting - despite a fairly low amount of action, I found the film very intense and gripping.<br/><br/>However, the end of the film was rushed, leaving the viewer with a sense of confusion and with many questions unanswered. I didn't like the way that the characters Anna and Ethan were introduced, it seemed very sudden and a little too convenient.<br/><br/>The film ended with Anna and her son entering the colony in the mountains. If she knew about the colony, why not go there instead of staying in the infected city? Also, I would have felt much more satisfied we saw more of what happened when she found the cure. The film literally ended as soon as she handed the cure to one of the military personnel, it was very abrupt and sudden.<br/><br/>I give this film only 7 because the ending seemed to have made the rest of the film seem rather disappointing. Also, if you look back at the film afterwards - not a great deal of things happened. I liked the whole flashback idea, it was very effective, but if there was more information about how the virus was set loose etc...it would have made the film much more favourable in my opinion.<br/><br/>7 out of 10, but if my preferred changes were made then this film could possibly be worth all 10 stars - as the acting was brilliant, the concept of the man's relationship with his dog and the surroundings was very well done, only let down by a weak ending."
"xNighthawkzx","7","1","3","29 December 2007"," Less Then Legendary
","The trailer for this show was definitely enticing. It pulled me out of my house to watch this movie, which is rare, considering i rent DVDs. The show, however, was a tad slow in pace. This is to be expected, as there is only one actor. Will Smith's performance in the show was fantastic. He managed to show natural human emotions, and connected with me, the audience. The show was a little short, and the ending was rather abrupt. The appearance of certain characters were a little strange. The storyline, however, appealed to me, and i personally felt that the show was pretty good. If the show was faster paced, and had a better ending, it would have been great. This is much unlike other Will Smith movies, where his shows are normally pretty fast and exciting. The movie doesn't quite stack up in the cinema, as it doesn't require the huge screen and epic sound. Definitely a rent, but not worth watching in the cinema. <br/><br/>7/10"
"oneloveall","7","1","3","29 December 2007"," Thoughtfully implemented popcorn cruncher
","Surprisingly adept action film benefits heavily from Francis Lawrence's keen, at times stunningly fluid direction, powerfully high-concept production, and Will Smith's appealing, improving charisma. The former Fresh Prince and dance-happy, child-friendly rapper continues to buck the norm to further establish and nearly redefine his distinguishable leading man qualities in a performance noteworthy not for it's inherent skill but for the skill inherent inside the actor involving his largest anticipated audience.<br/><br/>Of course it is flawed; whether one wishes to soak in this atmospheric counterpart to 28 Days Later on a completely visceral or metaphorical level, problems within the script halt Zoo York from being fully realized all too often. Without concentrating too hard on some dopey liberties taken and a questionable climax at best, I Am Legend still offers some of the most convincing post-apocalyptic, big budget renderings to date."
"carl170","9","1","3","29 December 2007"," re: Not a bad movie ..indeed
","I feel that Will Smith did a great job here with his character. He looked the part. He made you feel at times what it would like to be alone - supposedly in New York.<br/><br/>I just wish the script writers could have been more bolder. For instance when they introduced Anna and her child to the plot. Maybe the could have written into the story a flash back of how she survived. And how she came to save Robert Neville, when he was about to lose his life.<br/><br/>Maybe, they could have written into the plot things like. The stench of the place. All those dead bodies, bad food going off, etc....<br/><br/>They could have made it even more realistic by showing us eve more New Reels. People fighting for petrol. People fighting each other maybe to be allowed to go into home made bunkers, etc, etc. So don't blame Will Smith for their mistakes on that score. OK? Also I felt that the film could have been made longer. 1 X Hour and 40 minutes is far too short for a film like this. Scriptwriters come on! I still would love to see a Sequel to this film. I still think that we haven't seen the best of this film. A sequel might quench our thirst.<br/><br/>After all that though. The film had breath taking views of New York. Also I loved the ""Fear"" that Will Smith showed when he went after the dog that was chasing the deer into that building.<br/><br/>I like the fact that Will Smith, lost it when he was re-quoting the entire scene of Sherk. ""You not very good with people now are you?"" , says Anna, when she see's Will losing it.<br/><br/>I liked the deer scene at the start of the movie. Looking for fresh meat! Great add to the story. Also the fact that we got shown that he was guzamped by the Lion.He's about to shot the deer himself, and yet the Lion got there first!<br/><br/>I liked this movie. It was a lot better movie then a lot that came out in 2007, I can tell you. Just sit back and think, and I am sure that you will agree with that."

","Hollywood's latest stab at Richard Matheson's classic vampire opus, I Am Legend, is restrained, competent and (at times) thrilling film-making. With that all said, it will not, however, be landing in any cult movie palace near you anytime soon. There are no memorable bits of movie dialogue to savor and repeat. The film's score is pedestrian. The other two survivors--a boy and a young female--are afterthoughts, injected into the movie so Will Smith's character, Robert Neville, can have someone to sound off against. Both late arrivals are tired clichÃ©s. The boy is mute. The woman, although adept with a needle and thread, is lifeless and daffy. I don't believe for a New York Minute they have survived the way she claims they have. And in one of the best examples of our culture being dumbed down that I've ever seen, Neville recites dialog he has memorized from the movie Shrek. Ugh. This is a blatant nod to its predecessor: In The Omega Man, Neville, alone in an abandoned theater, watches and repeats back to the movie screen, relevant thoughts of one of the Woodstock Generation's heavy thinkers. The ""The Dark Seekers"" are present to entertain the teenagers in the audience, who, lately, have been fed a steady diet of CGI terrors and video games. The ending is ludicrous. Robert Neville's death is anything but heroic. He even tries one last time to reason with the rabid, psychotic creatures. It's beneath him. And us. Laughable. A short time later, on the road to Vermont, the final epilogue ventures into familiar territory with little pay off. The woman gets the final word. Typical."

As a rendition of the book, not so much, (but to me it seems they were really going for the Chuck Heston movie more than the book). I slagged it off a lot when i heard who had been cast, but i take it all back now. Will Smith was excellent in the lead and carried off a very difficult role by proving what a good actor he is and not just being Will Smith. I felt it was quite restrained for a big budget movie and built its tension well, without resorting to cheap tricks. It was tense, scary, even moving, its a smaller movie disguised as a blockbuster, but it doesn't disappoint on either front. So i take it all back and highly recommend this one."
"villanwilson87","9","1","3","28 December 2007"," One of the best films of 2007!
","A great film, that has everything. Will Smith is surely one of the finest actors of his generation after this film. I don't understand what the fuss is all about with the film being a disappointment.<br/><br/>It has brilliant action sequences that can also be very frightening. As for the 'Night-Crawlers', they were quite ground-breaking and scary, but could have used less C.G.I. during the film, but whether that could have happened is unlikely seen as though the infected were strong and very fast. Smith's performance reminds me of Castaway, when Tom Hanks was the sole survivor on a remote island, with a Wilson ball. In this film you have Smith, his dog (which by the way is the BEST animal performance in years), and his cleverly constructed house. It also goes back to the year when the infection occurred, and the exploding bridge sequence is spectacular.<br/><br/>The deserted scenes of New York city are breathtaking and very striking (which was reminiscent of 28 days later-who stole the idea first from the novel of this film). The opening sequence depicts the skyscrapers across Manhattan when Smith is hunting, and is truly one of the best opening sequences to a film.<br/><br/>But lets not forget that this film is drama, and it can be upsetting when you realise that Smith is by himself for over 40 months, he starts talking to mannequins and in one particular scene when he comes to a conclusion of his dog Sam, is very sad.<br/><br/>Overall, this film has to be seen because it is simply brilliant and very enjoyable. Not a Oscar-worthy contender, but a very thought provoking, action-horror!"

But this film really makes you believe this sort of thing could happen.<br/><br/>This naturally scary film had one major flaw i think, the CGI wasn't up to modern standard, it was easy to tell the dark-seekers were fake and every one of them was CGI.<br/><br/>I loved Will Smith's acting, i don't know how a man who came from typical black person's soap opera/comedy could become such an amazing and believable actor, will really tries in all his films, i don't think this is his best film but as far acting solo for most of a movie is concerned he has proved like Colin Farrel (phonebooth) that it is possible to carry a film by one's self. Bravo Mr Smith, you will certainly attain an Oscar one day if you get the Right part.<br/><br/>I gather this much about the dark-seekers they are people who have a heightened sense of smell, a heightened metabolism and blood pressure rate which makes them stronger than most humans, and a heightened stamina rate, but there skin can support any form or light."

I didn't go to see the movie until a few days after its release and a few people had said that it was a poor film, but I still went ahead and purchased my ticket, without many expectations. I was really gripped from the outset, really enjoying the realism of the film. Will Smith is one of my favourite actors and I always enjoy his roles even if the film is poor. He really brought the characters loneliness to life, making you feel the fear of living and fighting this virus alone. I enjoyed the realism of the film, at one point I was starting to think ""Could this really happen?"". It gave me a real sense of aloneness and I really felt for Will Smiths character. Overall I extremely enjoy the film, but the one disappointment would be the ending. It didn't give anything away about the survivors or how and what they had been attempting to cruel the virus.<br/><br/>A film I would extremely recommend!!!"
"moviegeek310","7","1","3","28 December 2007"," Enjoyable yet not scary
","I didn't quite know what to think of ""I Am Legend after it ended. I liked it, but at the same time there was just something about it that made me dislike it. In the tradition of ""Cast Away"", Will Smith is alone, and the only thing he can talk to is his dog and some store mannequins. His character Robert Neville is part of the 1% of survivors of a virus that turns everyone into zombie/vampires. He is totally alone in Manhattan, and watching him speed through deserted Times Square is extremely eerie. During the day he hunts and tries to find a cure for the virus, and at night he hides from the ""dark seekers"".<br/><br/>There is one of my problems, the trailer promised a freaky movie, and it is until we see the creatures, then we find out they look almost laughable. Though a scene when Neville is in a pitch black warehouse, before he first sees them, will scare the daylights out of you. Even though the dark seekers are not scary, the director still manages to make you jump at least 8 times. The most I've ever jumped in a movie. The creatures look like poorly done CGI; bald humans with rotting teeth and red eyes. And that's not very scary to me. Also, towards the middle, some scenes start to drag since you have realized that it won't be scary.<br/><br/>That aside, Will Smith is brilliant playing a quiet, dark, brooding character instead of his usual one liner cracking macho men. He literally carries the movie on his own and actually makes otherwise tedious scenes, like giving his dog a bath, interesting, or talking to his mannequin friend, Fred, believable. Director Francis Lawrence did a good job for the most part creating an eerie and dark movie, yet he failed horribly in making a believable, scary vampire hybrid, and with tons of plot holes in an otherwise interesting concept. Also, the ending is sorely lacking, if they would've come up with a better ending the movie would seem even better, but sadly they did not.<br/><br/>This is a very enjoyable movie for the hour and forty minutes that it plays out, but the second it's done it becomes mostly forgettable. ""I Am Legend"" is one of those movies you see once, like it, but then never see it again. Already this film has made 76 million in the first three days, so see it mostly because it'll be the ""thing"" right now, and also see it because of the amazing Will Smith."

We had to talk our way through this thriller so as not to get heart arrythmia. It was an excellent film. The filming, scenery, make-up and plot held me. There are many panoramic views of NYC and Brooklyn.<br/><br/>The contrast between light and dark was great. Will Smith's character let the sun shine in everyday and meticulously shut himself in before dusk--until his last day. When he stopped to engage in conversation with the Brazilian optimist, I know he would slip up.

I took the set up of dummies in the video store, talks with the dog and daily radio broadcasts as needed mental health strategies.

","I am always wary when a message board user posts a thesis. Give me a break. Why would anyone go to a third reincarnation of a well known story expecting an improvement? This was pure entertainment, nothing more, nothing less. As for the previous reviewers assertion that Will Smith's performance is ""predictable"" and that he's ""just a body"", nothing could be further from the truth. Smith has developed into an excellent character actor capable of conveying volumes of emotion with facial expression alone. Very few actors today are capable of bringing viewers to tears without using any words. Moreover, Smith has to carry this movie almost the entire length with no other character to play against save for a German Shepard who also manages to turn in a notable performance for an animal. Rarely have I been in a film in which the end was greeted with enthusiastic applause. Given this film's box office receipts, I would say that translates into a resounding thumbs up!"
"oakey1973","8","1","3","26 December 2007"," Very entertaining, but not more than that
","I found this a really entertaining movie, very much in the style of end-of-the-world movies such as ""Independence Day"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"" or ""War of the Worlds"" (movies that I like very much). However, having read some reviews in the Dutch papers, I expected a thought-provoking ""Hollywood meets art-house"" movie, but these expectations were certainly not fulfilled. The movie's ending is also rather conventional. I have neither read Matheson's novel nor seen the two previous movies based on this book, it may well be that these were less mainstream in nature. Still, ""I Am Legend"" is a highly enjoyable Christmas blockbuster, with excellent direction and good acting by Smith (without the obligatory funny lines that characterize most of his other movies)."
"DICK STEEL","8","1","3","26 December 2007"," A Nutshell Review: I Am Legend
","Out of curiosity I went to look up Will Smith's filmography, and realized that since Michael Bay's Bad Boys in 1995, he had averaged just one movie a year, most of them being box office successes save for blips like Wild Wild West, and in films spanning a wide genre from biopics to romantic comedy to action and drama. Today his name alone on the marquee can open a movie, and I Am Legend is probably a true test of that drawing power, because for the most parts, his Robert Neville is the last man on Earth.<br/><br/>This film is the third to have been produced for the big screen, based on the novel of the same name by Richard Matheson. I haven't watched The Omega Man which starred Charlton Heston, but from what I've read, it's a somewhat wide departure from the source material. The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price, was entertaining (available at the Internet Archive) and given that we're looking at it in retrospect, was told in a rather straightforward and simple manner. Will Smith's vehicle, will no doubt be updated with plenty of special effects, and getting those road closures for down town Manhattan is by no means an easy feat in itself.<br/><br/>I've no idea why the tagline had to say ""the last man on earth is not alone"", and in the poster had Smith slinging a mean rifle over a shoulder, with a German shepherd at his heel. With man's best friend as company, how can any man be alone? Technically yes, but then his pet dog provides an avenue to keep one's sanity - any interaction that provides feedback of sorts, doesn't put you in isolation ala Tom Hanks in Castaway. And being stuck in a big city in Manhattan does have its perks, in terms of food, shelter and of course, entertainment.<br/><br/>Of late, monster movies with the likes of the recent 28 Days/Weeks series, and in 30 Days of Night, point to an interesting observation - that we like our monsters smart, vicious and fast. In The Last Man on Earth, Vincent Price had to do battle with plodding creatures of low IQ, which formed the basis of George A Romero's walking undead. Here, the creatures bring forth a few same-old concepts, from being created by a virus (Resident Evil series, 28 Days/Weeks probably taken a leaf from I Am Legend the book), filled them with crazed rage, move fast and are incredibly smart - they adapt and learn. However they fail to interest in creature designs, having look like leftovers from The Mummy franchise.<br/><br/>Action sequences are few and far between, which ringed back to an earlier Smith movie I, Robot, but credit has got to go to I Am Legend for deftly crafting moments of intense fear and dreadful anticipation, like the sequence in the warehouse. But everything else was a chip off something else, like The Hulk's raging doggies, and with Robert Neville taking a leaf out of Sylvester Stallone's The Specialist in tactical defending, which I liked to believe his character had learned from one of his routine DVD rentals. There's even one more reference that I will choose not to quote, as it's too close to revealing how the ending turned out to be, which I felt was a little of a cop out, as the filmmakers probably had a problem in deciding how best to end this, in an honourable way befitting an A-List Hollywood star.<br/><br/>The backstory to Neville's predicament, as an update to the original movie's explanation on the situation, brings forth a warning to those wanting to play god. Sometimes the intentions are good, but like all potential miracle cures, these have to be tested thoroughly rather than be excited over them, or worse, having those with side effects covered up. Don't expect too much of those flashbacks, like The Last Man on Earth's, they're kept short and succinct, and most of it is unfortunately in the trailer. An added plus into this version, is the lack of a dreadful need to repeat its stuff to remind audiences of Neville's routine of eat-play-send signals-find cure-find food etc, and juxtaposed time quite nicely so that it's not simply just a dawn-to-dusk day-in-the-life-of account.<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Lawrence who brought us the big screen adaptation of Constantine, I Am Legend continues to serve as a staple for that year end big budgeted blockbuster, and in most counts, I Am Legend works, plainly because of Will Smith's charisma, and that German shepherd's company."
"alam-laptop","5","1","3","24 December 2007"," OK in parts
","This movie is OK in parts. The idea (plot) had so much potential, and quite frankly I don't think it lived up to the hype, and I think in the hands of a better director and with a better script it would have been a fantastic movie. At times, the movie was unsure of itself and did not really know what type of movie it wanted to be. It seemed to me that it was trying to please too many people. Under one guise it was aiming for the popcorn eating shoot em up fan and at the same time desperately trying to be an art type film, hoping to evoke emotions. It doesn't pull off either. There are good moments, but they are few and far between. If you've seen the trailers and read some of the reviews then you should already have a broad idea of what its about. If you go in expecting action etc, then there is some, but perhaps just not enough, maybe just enough to whet your appetite, but by that stage the movies winding up. There are one or two tense moments, but they were few and far between despite the fact that there was potential for far more.<br/><br/>The appearance of the woman and the kid at the end could have been better orchestrated, even if it meant deviating far too much from the original story, (what the hell - they have done so in many other parts so that it was supposed to make a better ""movie"")<br/><br/>Will smith turns in a decent performance. Having said that i really think will smith (for me anyway) is too typecast as an action star to be a nerdy scientist and perhaps we would have been better served if they concentrated on that part of the movie, and the Dark Seekers, as it was clear as he began to encounter them, that they were becoming more and more cunning, calculating. It would have been difficult to concentrate on the emotions, when there was no one to bounce dialogue off especially since he is supposed to be all alone. There is only so much you can do with flashback.<br/><br/>All in all, OK, worth watching but nothing spectacular."
"LazySod","7","1","3","24 December 2007"," Remake of a remake, but still OK
","Remakes are always to be watched with a cautious eye. Remakes of remakes even more so. But in this case I haven't read the book the original film was based on, haven't seen the original film and haven't seen the first remake. I have only seen this one.<br/><br/>The story is easy enough: humankind is in a pickle. A virus has wiped out a large part of society. The sole survivor is a scientist who has to survive day after day in a menacing world. But is he really alone? I have always had a weak spot for films that play with the end of mankind. This one doesn't come with an original plot - even in its original time it had been done before. But the way it brings it is quite interesting. As the days pass by and the guy explains his actions and his motives it is hard not to feel for him. The story is interesting enough and even though most of the film is carried on the shoulders of just one actor it comes out pretty well. There's plenty of action, but not too much and there's a good dosage of drama too.<br/><br/>Lovely film, 7 out of 10 lethal viruses"
"helmutty","6","1","3","24 December 2007"," I am not legend!
","When I looked at this movie, it does show you that he is alone but he is not...Enough of this. I am legend proves itself that it can hold the suspense and as to shock people with its fierce vampires/undead ( I don't know what it is). It has some suspense, its suspense is not bad like you will want to the end ( The ending is not what I expected) or whether the undead perish or remain and there are some more. The undead are scary, they are smart ( Not the dumb zombies in horror movies that just walk and walk) and fierce. You would not want them when you are alone.<br/><br/>The story is simple- Will smith's character is alone with his dog, man's best friend. His daily life is boring since there is no one to talk to. He just watch recorded News, go to take CD from CD shop, play golf in the air-force area and more. The point is that there are no people not even in the CD shop, he sets up dolls in street and in the CD shop and pretend that they are real people. But he is lonely, the dolls won't give him a response. After the introduction of his boring life, he discovers undead and takes one of them to be his experiment. Then he runs and shoot undead and that is all. The disappointing part is that the introduction takes up around 30 minutes, that gives little time for the undead to appear. SPOILERS: After he lose his only friend, he becomes depressed and sad. The point is that he is not alone. SPOILERS END. Will smith did a good job in playing his character where he is to be lonely.<br/><br/>Overall: It does seem realistic and asks you the question ""What happen if you are alone in the country/world?"" Those who were expecting an action-packed horror movie and watched this, it could be quite disappointing. It is certainly not really an action-packed movie but it does interest me with its suspense. Those who want an action-packed shooting or exploding movie, I am sorry that it is not. Those who want to watch it for entertainment, this could be worth watching. It is not bad but it could do some improvement for the introduction scenes."

","First, I loved this movie. While it may of had a few sticking points, it still surpassed my wildest dreams. I had figured this movie to be a total bust with Will Smith unable to create a convincing carriage of the lead. I just couldn't fit him into the role. I'm very familiar with the book, having read it several times. He proved me wrong!<br/><br/>Now on to the problem with the summary as given: The first problem is ""vampires"". The turned victims of the supposed cure are eating the flesh of the deer they killed in the building. Vampires suck blood. These creatures are assumed vampires as they don't go out in the light. They are the ultimate cancer victim whose bodies are so weakened by the mutated virus that they can no longer tolerate UV light (as evidenced by his testing of the captured girl with a portable UV lamp). The second point is the input about his family. His family didn't die of the virus. They died while being evacuated in a helicopter crash. The third point is the reference to ""years"" which implies more than the 1000+ days that have transpired since Neville was by himself."

Remembering how good and intense the trailer was for this movie, i had high expectations. I Am Legend started off strong, Will Smith was definitely amazing and held this movie together, yet as the movie continued it started to have downfalls and kinda just fell apart. The set up of a ""deserted"" New York city was definitely one of the strong points along with the acting of Smith (and only Smith alone). The creatures were corny and lame looking like something mixed from The Mummy and Shrek, and definitely not looking like an infected human. I was very disappointed with this movie and had high expectations. Overall i recommend waiting for this movie to come on DVD to see it before you go out to the theaters and waste $8.00."
"fgoworderup","7","1","3","23 December 2007"," Lawrence comes close to creating something totally different...it's just the ending
","Lawrence, considering I had never heard of him before, pulls together the best of the Omega Man and such related movies. Truly, the movie starts off being possibly the best movie of the season. The CGI effects are wonderful in terms of the New York that is beautiful in its lonely state, yet scary and haunting at the same time. Also, Will Smith is wonderful, especially the acting he makes to show the affection between the dog and him. But as the movie drifts further into its story, Lawrence made a decision crucial to this films outcome....the monsters. The monsters are actually not as big apart of this film as they seem, and while they are the cause of this deserted New York, they don't have much importance, until Lawrence brings them on to the screen in CGI form. Nothing is wrong with CGI, and they tried hard, but with such a real seeming situation (considering), the monsters should not have been in full form at all. Rather, like I believe Omega Man, or maybe another related film, they didn't show the faces much, just blue eyes, bony and cold hands. These other monsters add well to the suspense feel and opens up room for the viewer's interpretation of what the beast is really like. BOTTOM LINE: Lawrence almost reaches a turning point in suspense movies with his quiet and well created beginning, but the monsters being CGI ruined much of the effect that this film could have had on its viewers. Go see it, it's good, but not legendary."

"Rob_Taylor","8","1","3","23 December 2007"," A great effort that doesn't quite hit the spot...
","I have to say, I had been looking forward to this film all year, so it is with quite some disappointment that I say that it didn't really work as well as I had hoped.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it is still a good movie, and worth watching, but there are a number of things that don't work about it.<br/><br/>Firstly the good points, though. Will Smith is pretty darned good as Robert Neville, the title character and gives a solid performance as the lonely, slightly ""lost"" last man on Earth. Likewise his sole companion, a German Shepherd dog, is very much a character in its own right which, as it turns out later, is exactly what the writers intended - that, like Neville, you get attached to it. The visuals of an abandoned Manhattan are extremely well done and the sense of emptiness is quite convincingly portrayed. So....all good so far.<br/><br/>But now the less good parts. Firstly, the over-reliance on CGI. I'm not spoiling the film to tell anyone that, in fact, Neville is not alone in Manhattan. But the overuse of CGI to portray the ""creatures"" does spoil things, I'm afraid. Whats more, I don't see why they had to go to such lengths to do this to what are - essentially - humans gone mad. I'm sure a far more convincing effect could be had with simple make-up effects. Of course, the CGI does allow them to show the apparent superhuman abilities of the infected, which is another gripe I'll come back to later.<br/><br/>Although the creatures are the worst part of the film, another element that grates is (and my usual pet hate) the lack of intelligence on the part of the writers. We learn during the film that Neville is hunting the creatures (he has a map on which he crosses out buildings he has searched) and that the creatures have abnormally high body temperatures. Given the apparent military background of Neville wouldn't it make sense for him to employ some sort of thermal tracking in order to locate them? After all the city is completely devoid of any man-made heat sources other than the creatures and Neville himself? Or failing that, since he can apparently catch the creatures without too much trouble, why not simply put some kind of tracking device on (or in) the creature and then release it? Going back to the superhuman creatures - I really don't get where this comes from. Their body temperature, respiration, blood pressure etc. are all off the scale. What maintains this? What is it that allows them to be hit by a speeding car and get and run off unhurt? They climb like monkeys, run like cheetahs and are as strong as bears. All in a human body (albeit coated in CGI). What maintains this? Do they even eat? If so I would ask....what? There are no people apart from Neville, they don't appear to feast on each other and the animal life in the city hardly appears numerous enough to support them. Plus, with those metabolisms, they'd have to eat huge quantities to fuel themselves for each nights rampage.<br/><br/>In 28 Days Later, the infected eventually starved through lack of coherent meal plans. But in I Am Legend, we're three years down the road from when the infection took place. How are they surviving? It's things like these that really annoy me about movies. I know, I shouldn't think that deeply about what is, essentially, a popcorn movie. But these inconsistencies just glare out at me from the screen.<br/><br/>However, the bottom line...<br/><br/>Leaving aside the CGI and the illogical writing I Am Legend is quite a good movie. It was rather short at 90 minutes. I think there's probably quite a good mini-series in this franchise if anyone was brave enough to take up the challenge, but I doubt it will happen.<br/><br/>But...If I was offered a choice between I Am Legend and 28 Days Later, I would choose the latter simply because it doesn't insult my intelligence quite as much.<br/><br/>EDIT: After some time to reflect I think the movie has grown on me some more. I do recommend watching the alternate ending version on the DVD which, to me, completely switches the roles that Neville and the creatures play and is altogether far more satisfying a conclusion than the original."

","I have read the book and seen the two prior versions. What I would say is that without much in the way of surprises, the movie includes details that are quite interesting if not nearly fully explored.<br/><br/>But the strongest aspect of I Am Legend is its achievement of a consistent level of suspense: it literally had me and others I spoke with on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Not a movie for kids, thought it could have been rated R.<br/><br/>Semi-Spoiler: This version was not faithful to the book; The Last Man is close but as another reviewer mentioned, the Vincent Price flick is really cheaply made. But what one who knows the original story suspects is that they were coming close to the central idea of Matheson's work, that maybe the script writers had this in mind and were over-ruled?

I've seen the dodgy I Am Omega which is truly awful.<br/><br/>I'm yet to see Vinnie Price in the original that set all these imitators off but hopefully I will before the year is out.<br/><br/>Will Smith is Robert Neville, an Army Colonel, seemingly the last uninfected human living in New York. Well thats right out of Chuck Heston, isn't it? He travels around with his dog, foraging for provisions.<br/><br/>The fact that the city has reverted back to the wild with deer and lions (from the zoo, I assume) roaming freely is a good idea. the infected have been caused by a Doctor (Emma Thompson) who had discovered a cure for cancer by mutating The Measles virus.<br/><br/>It's side effect is creatures who thirst for blood, hate sunlight or UV and are hairless. Pretty much vampires then. These aren't the organised infected from Omega Man, these are pretty much mindless hunters.<br/><br/>We are given insights into Neville's life and family before the disaster as flashbacks He seemingly find a cure that heals a rat and tries it on an infected woman but it doesn't work. Later in the film he is caught in a trap and his dog is killed.<br/><br/>He descends into madness without his dog for company seeking sympathy from mannequins. Driven seemingly insane he goes out at night and attacks an entire pack of infected in his jeep but is saved from certain death by an uninfected woman.<br/><br/>We also discover (well we infer from information given) that his wife and son died in a helicopter accident on the night of the evacuation. We also meet his female rescuer Anna and her young son Ethan (who Neville thinks are his own wife and son in moment of insanity).<br/><br/>In a conversation with the woman we find out they refer to the infected as ""The Dark Seekers"". The night attack on Neville's home is pretty much right out of Omega Man as well. For an Army Colonel, Neville is an awful shot and very bad under combat stress.<br/><br/>Forced to shelter in his lab they discover his cure is starting to take effect on the female he had injected earlier in the film. Giving a sample of her blood to Anna, he hides her & Ethan in a cupboard in the wall. And then blows himself and a lab full of Dark Stalkers up with a fragmentation grenade. (Which incidentally don't produce fireballs like the one in the film). So our hero dies, exactly like Heston in Omega Man.<br/><br/>Anna & Ethan drive off to the survivors colony in Vermont which turns out to be real and she gives them the vial of blood containing the antibodies. The movie ends weakly for such a strong film.<br/><br/>This is better than ""I Am Omega"" but not as good as ""The Omega Man""."
"madmax007","7","1","3","22 December 2007"," Will Smith Takes On Armageddon
","Will Smith has proved to be one of Hollywood's most influential and intelligent celebrities and can easily be seen as a role model without much hesitation. Using his everyman persona by just being himself and using his ambitions and morals to work for him and asking others to heed his advice. Will Smith projects that persona on most of his screen characters to create influential, lovable protagonist characters and he has carried out the out the same attitude in real life. This film has Smith continuing in the Action Scifi genre, a genre wheres he has been most marketable and commercially successful for over decade while receiving critical praise. With films like Independence Day and Men In Black, Will Smith became the Nineties most marketable and commercially successful Summer Movie star. Its great to have Will Smith continue in this genre because his everyman persona provides great depth for a struggling protagonist in an Action Scifi setting.<br/><br/>The film is based on the 1954 novel of the same name drawing influences from other post-apocalyptic films such as Vincent Prices 1964 film The Last Man on Earth and 1971's The Omega Man. This is a modernized update of the classic Armageddon story plot as it is inevitable that most Hollywood films of any theme or genre are updated to have modernized contemporary film elements. Will Smith's modern day persona blends in with the idea of the film. The Film runs slow for the first hour and is inconsistent with few surprises. The first half of the film is Smith's character and his dog Samantha traveling through the desolate city then when the film is 7/10ths of the way done we meet up with the supporting actress Anna Braga. <br/><br/>The Film starts in the near future Manhattan 2012 three years prior to that a doctor by name of Dr. Alice Krippin (Emma Thompson) is convinced that she has a cure for cancer by genetically bioengineering the measles virus. This cure mutates with absolutely disastrous consequences as the new virus spreads throughout the world killing 98 percent of humanity and causing some survivors to devolve into flesh eating monsters that come out only at night.<br/><br/>Prior to this Armageddon he was a famous well renowned Military virologist who dedicated his life to reversing the infectious virus started by Dr. Krippin which he continues to do after it wiped out nearly all of humanity. By the end of 2009 the disease spreads so quickly that 90% of the world and presumably Dr. Krippin are dead. Dr.Neville is convinced that it is not the end of humanity and attempts to contact anyone in the world by broadcasting on all AM Radio frequencies asking anyone listening to meet him at the city pier during mid day afternoon. For the first half of the film he wanders around the desolate city and hunts down the humans who have been transformed from the disease and studies them to find a cure this includes animals that have been infected as well. He uses traps to capture the infected creatures then putting them through numerous tests to see if he can come to a conclusion and have a cure to reverse this whole disaster. One of his infected test subjects is 18 - 20 year old girl who he attempts to treat without success. <br/><br/>While doing all this there are flashbacks. While he goes to sleep to periodically in three separate dreams infer what actually happened prior to this desolate future putting into detail what has happened during the apocalypse for humanity. Basically Neville's and his families escape from the city during the break out of the infection and how it was spreading and their struggles to leave and how Dr.Neville has started to begin finding a cure. The flashbacks are separated periodically as to when Will Smith is sleeping. The last dream basically shows the military solution by bombing Manhattan and how his family tries to escape in one of the helicopter's and how it collides with one of theirs. The only family he has left is his dog Samantha who is basically killed off as well because she didn't heed Neville's command of running away from the mutated canines and humans when they had the chance. Smith than takes his anger out on the infected humans by using his car to ram over them driving aimlessly onto the pier than crashing into a lamp post, where the mutated humans take this as an advantage. As it looks like the protagonists life draws near he is saved by a group of survivors Anna (Alice Braga) and a kid named Ethan who were waiting at the city pier in response to his radio AM message. <br/><br/>Returning them to his house she explains that there is a human colony in Vermont which Neville doesn't believe it and goes into denial mainly because he was convinced that the infection had wiped out all of humanity and that him and Anna and Ethan where the earths sole survivors. After this the most of the cities infected humans come and attack the homestead realizing that Neville is a threat in response to this Neville and Anna retreat to the basement where Neville finds himself at a dead end letting Anna and Ethan escape through the coal chute. During all of this Neville discovers that his testing on that 18 - 20 year old patient produced a cure that he hands over to Anna and spread to any of the infected humans. During all of this Neville sacrifices himself by killing him and all the other infected humans off with a grenade.<br/><br/>Will Smiths take on the character is original in the way of how he expresses himself take for example how he uses Bob Marley as a distressful way of thinking of positives and at how any dark moment can be changed into a positive. Will Smith continues to be a great role model through films."
"Rockhounds2112","9","1","3","22 December 2007"," Great Film!!
","I Am Legend was amazing. Definitely one of my favorites. Everyone has a reason to love this film. It contains elements of action, drama, horror, sci-fi, even comedy. Will Smith is excellent in the role. He makes the scenario and the film seem very realistic. Smith and his dog's connection were very touching. It is not(!)an average zombie flick!!! The empty shots of New York are great too. Since the film seems so real, it is a true scare. I do not find many""scary"" movies very scary, but this one is very well put together and gave off a good scare factor. This is definitely a must see for anyone.Thanks for listening, good bye."
"jmose-2","6","1","3","22 December 2007"," Despair
","After reading many of the other reviews, it seems that the majority of viewers feel the same way, and I have to agree. The build up of the movie is fantastic, the film paints a beautiful picture of loneliness and despair while giving an excellent glimpse of a man desperately trying to maintain his humanity. Then it flops.<br/><br/>The monsters are comical. With the flood of zombie movies as of late you can tell the director wanted something new and original, and what came out was a cross between the lying figures of silent hill and the mummy, giant vibrating jowls and all. They can leap through the air, scale buildings, and perform ridiculous aerobatic maneuvers. It's cartoonist and converts what was a chilling and somber film into a laugh fest.<br/><br/>Smith makes a quote that all human characteristics are gone, yet one of the zombies show leadership, intelligence, and problem solving abilities, only made worse by one creatures unexplained vendetta against Smith.<br/><br/>A directors cut could still save this movie, and to give them the benefit of the doubt I will assume all the much needed back story and character development was cut for running time and to clear the pg13 rating. But that's just pipe dreams The first half of the movie scores a 9 and the second a 3 which explains the 6."
"suetroth","9","1","3","22 December 2007"," Bears little resemblance to the book that spooked me as a teenager!
","Saw I Am Legend yesterday and thought it to be a very well done film. Will Smith had a tremendous role to carry and carry it well he did. The book scared me spit less as a teenager and was out of print for many years but I did re-read it recently. This film carries the spirit of Richard Matheson's book but bears little resemblance to it. I do realize that the film had to be updated to make it commercially acceptable. What it did not do though is scare me. Richard Matheson is to written horror what George Carlin is to comedy. The best. Few movies can or do conjure fear in the audience. They usually don't let our minds take off and work with the story. Loved the dog but that's no surprise - I love dogs. The Smith child is another adorable. The film stands alone but so does the book from which it came."
"jfparker22","10","1","3","21 December 2007"," Great Movie - Unique and Original
","This movie was extrordinary. I absolutely loved it and to be honest, it has replaced my all time favorite movie 'Saving Private Ryan'. The movie was original for once, although it is not hard to anticipate what is to happen next once you first figure out what is going on, it keeps you guessing and watching with full attention and alertness; the way a movie should be. <br/><br/>I credit Will Smith for being so excellent with his acting skills and abilities, and his ability to make the audience feel how he is, specifically in the emotional parts. He is an amazing actor and i don't think anyone else could have fit this part as well as he did. I also credit the producer/director/etc with all of their imagination and originality in making this film, it truly was a movie i needed to see, i have not been that entertained and enjoyed a movie like this in a very long time, i recommend it to everyone and believe it is an excellent movie not only for entertainment, but to keep people aware of possibilities that no one expects, for one day something such as the plot in this movie is bound to occur, in one way or another.<br/><br/>I Am Legend - i thank you."
"Comic_Book_Guy","4","1","3","21 December 2007"," Another Zombie Movie
","As a big fan of Richard Matheson's work, I went into this movie wanting to like it. Will Smith has the skill to act, so there were many reasons to be optimistic. Unfortunately they just didn't do it right.<br/><br/>The main problem was the ridiculous superpowers that infected humans get from this unexplained, convenient, super-virus. Not only did these creatures resemble demonic bad guys from a video game, they are created by the same technology. And they're just as easily dismissed with their inability to speak or do anything but scream and murder. The probability of an anti-cancer virus genetically re-engineering humans into virtually indestructible beasts with superhuman powers is laughable at best. If they're such perfect killing machines, they would likely have run out of food really fast and ended up cannibalizing each other out of existence. Ignoring that, Will Smith's character would have ever survived for long with these things around is unlikely. The religious zealotry and rationalized insanity of Omega Man's albino bad guys was far more believable and probable despite the cheesiness.<br/><br/>The storyline is equally freshman, yanking on heartstrings with predictably tragic events created to incite sympathy for the main character. The scene where he is rescued from his attempt at suicide is never properly explained. The idea that an ex-Army Colonel with access to hardware wouldn't have the necessary weapons to deter an army of zombie monsters is preposterous. And I have no idea when pleasing red state piety became a Hollywood priority, but the implication of divine grace and intervention in the plot was going way too far.<br/><br/>So why the 4? Because Will Smith did a good job with a bad story. Because the scenes were laid out beautifully. Because Bob Marley is heavily referenced. Because I liked the ending even though it leaves a lot of questions hanging."
"jurassicmarc","9","1","3","21 December 2007"," Honestly a really really good movie.
","Will Smith proves yet again why he is one of the most popular actors working in Hollywood today, his role as Robert Nevile is brilliantly played, he hits every emotion spot on and when the character loses his grip Smith never goes to far, no overacting here the man is just plain likable throughout. His co-star for the main length of the movie is a German Shepherd called Samantha the work between canine and human actor is so well handled scenes later on in the movie are heartbreaking! My only real gripe was the use of Cgi on the zombie characters but to be honest they are menacing enough and the film is really about Robert Neville and although important in terms of plot the real emphasis is on Neville and his search for mankind's redemption as well as his own sanity. That aside the movie looks amazing the deserted/overgrown streets really bring home the desolate existence Neville is leading, haunted on a daily basis by the remnants of a once vibrant city.<br/><br/>I have also read reviews calling this yet another remake and how it wont be as good as Omega man etc etc.I Am Legend is not just another cash in remake the screenwriters and various producers have been trying to make this movie for quite a few years now. It is of course 'based on' Richard Mathesons book of the same name, 'based on' being the key words. The movie also has as many differences as it does similarities to the book it is based on but don't let that put you off if your a fan of the book its a terrific movie. Just because a film isn't 100% faithful to a book doesn't mean its a bad film just a different interpretation, look at The Shining for example Kubrick almost rewrote that and i was still in my opinion as good as the book. I am Legend is a disturbing, moving and exciting piece of movie making if only all blockbuster had this much heart!"
"jon.h.ochiai","9","1","3","21 December 2007"," Great Legend
","In the opening of ""I Am Legend"" Will Smith as Robert Neville along with his dog Sam races through the desolate streets of New York City. We see the striking images of New York City over grown with vegetation, wild deer, and no people. This is Director Francis Lawrence grim post viral infected world of 2012. My bud Ron had told me that ""I Am Legend"" was remake of ""Omega Man"" starring Charlton Heston, based on a novella from the 1950's. Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman wrote the screenplay for ""I Am Legend"" based on the Richard Matheson novel. I have enjoyed ""Omega Man"". ""I Am Legend"" is more science fiction thriller than action movie. The action in ""I Am Legend"" is intense and spectacular. Will Smith is stark and powerful. It is just Smith for virtually the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>In 2009 a doctor played the Emma Thompson announces a breakthrough virus that may be the cure for cancer. However, something goes awry. Soon New York City becomes a military quarantine zone with families desperately scrambling to leave Manhattan. Among those is Col. Neville (Smith), his wife Zoe (Salli Richardson), and daughter Marley (Willow SmithWill's daughter). Neville knows that the virus is now airborne, imposing a deadly threat.<br/><br/>Fast-forward 3 years later. Neville tells fellow survivor Anna (Alice Braga), ""Everyone you know is dead!"" The virus killed 90% of the world's 6 billion people. Less than 5% survived, because of their built in immunity. The remainder of the population mutated into vicious nocturnal creatures. Meanwhile, Neville has so far been unsuccessful in discovering cure for the viral mutation using the DNA of his own blood. This seems to be Neville's mission and curse. He says, ""God didn't do this. We did."" This is Will Smith's action tour de force. The trimmed and chiseled Smith is in amazing shape, and performs the action with skill and pathos. He engages and enrolls us in Neville's plight and curse as a man on the verge of forfeiting his sanity and humanity. Smith has a poignantly heartbreaking scene with his dog Sam. The charismatic Smith embodies hero in Neville. Beautiful Alice Braga is great as the strong and smart Anna.<br/><br/>This does not give away too much. ""I Am Legend"" acknowledges the courage and the possibility of humanity in people. Everyone can be a hero, we all need to discover and reclaim this in ourselves. Director Lawrence and Smith tell a great and timeless story."
"kamal23","5","1","3","21 December 2007"," weird...
","OK, well, I give this 5 points because it has some good basic ideas. But the tendency is giving less points. In the beginning of this movie I was really excited and happy of seeing something kind of ""new"" in this Post-Apocalyptic scenario. I didn't know anything about the movie so I was really looking forward to where it all would lead. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed. The devastation that hit New York is impressive. But throughout the movie it looses the rather good plot and thought behind it and looks like a lame remake of ""28 days later"" meets ""The Descent"". I do not like patriotic heroism in movies and there is certainly a lot of other really stupid things in the story, which I really dislike but wont mention to not spoil the movie for people who might enjoy this flick. I like Will Smith, I think he plays his character pretty good in a couple of scenes, but after half the movie I just couldn't help but loosing interest. Its obvious where the movie ends and dialogs about the greatness of good really suck bad, although one conversation -as can be found in the information to the movie (fun stuff)- would be worth sampling. All in all watchable but yet not more impressing then the first 15 minutes."
"lucasaq-1","7","1","3","21 December 2007"," Emtional, but Flawed Sci-Fi
","Will Smith is a charismatic actor whose career has spanned a lot of sci-fi films from Men in Black a sci-fi action comedy to I, Robot to Independence Day, his breakout film. But this latest film by him is a bit daring with him being a man against the world, or rather alone against the world. It could be compare to being a Cast Away, but in deserted city instead of a island with only a dog and manikins as company. As a drama this film flourishes with Smith taking on all the deep emotional trauma of trying to stay sane in a silent world with only his own voice to keep him sane. But as a science fiction film it is hampered by jumps of logic which do not quite click.<br/><br/>The story is that the world has been infected by a virus. A virus originally designed to cure cancer which it seemingly did to begin with. But everything went wrong. It seems the doctors forgot to read the fine print. The one that reads side effects may include rabid behavior, a lust for blood, aversion to sunlight, etc Well I guess in any good zombie movie they do not see it coming although these zombies seem to be more like a mixture of zombie and vampire. Anyways, this virus not only turned people into these horrid creatures, but also killed a great portion of the world's population and the rest that were not killed by the air born virus died from the being torn up by the dark seekers, as the people in the film call the creatures infected with the virus. Anyways, it is three years after these events rock the world that we find Robert Neville, Will Smith, working tirelessly to find a cure as well as stay alive in a New York City over run with dark seekers.<br/><br/>It is here that the storyline thrives by focusing on Neville and his struggle to hold onto his humanity. He treats his dog, which has not been infected but can be, like his child. In a few touching scenes, he prepares dinner for the dog and tells him to eat the vegetables which of course the dog does not. He also sets up a video store with manikins to simulate a familiar environment for himself. He talks to some of them familiar and others like the female ones with a bit tentativeness as he would to woo a girl.<br/><br/>The film is full of action as well after good deal of development which gives it a strong base before actually meeting these fearsome dark seekers in the pitch blackness of a building. I do not want to reveal too much about the sequence, but it will get you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>I have talked a good deal about the pluses of this film and I am a bit loathed to tear it down, but the effects are split in this film with half being great and half being so-so. The great being the effects for the overgrown city which has been slowly overgrown by vegetation and wild beast with deer flocking through the city and other more fearsome beasts. The so-so effects are on the dark seekers who can easily be distinguished as computer generated.<br/><br/>Other flaws in the storyline also bring down the film on account of the slightly unbelievable turn toward the end and the intelligence of the dark seekers themselves which do not really make all that much sense. Still though, the film is headed by a strong performance from Will Smith which helps bring this film above average and gives it a strong emotional edge."

","I Am Legend is an adaptation of a novel with the same title, written by Richard Mathesen. However, the only similarities between the novel and the movie are the title and the basic story premise. Other than that, this movie is entirely different than the novel. So, in order to truly enjoy this movie, one has to grasp the idea that it has little to do with the novel, and to enjoy the movie without comparing between the two.<br/><br/>Anyway, as long as one can grasp the concept of the movie not being like the novel, the movie is actually pretty good. Although at times it feels like a cross between ""Castaway"" and ""28 Days Later"", it is an engaging watch. This is due to the fact that it has some well-filmed action sequences, a few genuinely scary moments, and awesome acting from Will Smith (and his dog).<br/><br/>Fans of Will Smith would be glad to know the movie is full of Will Smith-y goodness. In fact, his presence is so overwhelming that one reckons that instead of pretending it is an adaptation of I Am Legend, it should be called I Am Will Smith. Now that would have been some legend indeed."
"RedDragonStu","5","1","3","20 December 2007"," I expected a lot more!
","Well, I just finished watching this movie and the first thing I had to say is that although 28 days later copied its ideas from the book 'I am Legend', it was a far better version than this movie. This film lacks any empathy with the characters, the vampires are not scary, there are no shocks and I really didn't feel that Will Smith carried this film. He has been a fine actor in other roles, but I think this one was just a bit too much for him. I have not read the book so cannot comment, but was the end of this movie just tacked on or is that how the book actually ends? Such a pity, I went into this film with high hopes and left just wanting to watch 28 Days Later again instead. Well, you can all go and make your own mind up, but like a lot of blockbusters today, don't believe all of the hype."
"slweal","10","1","3","20 December 2007"," Overall highly recommended
","I saw this title in the IMAX theater. This greatly enhanced the movie and I highly recommend seeing it in this format. Will Smith's acting was top form, as always. The zombies were perfectly scary and gory. The storyline was A+. I did not expect much from this movie, but it delivered way beyond my expectations.<br/><br/>The premises is that Will Smith's character is the last surviving human after a viral cure for cancer turned humans into flesh eating zombies. Luckily the zombies are burned severely by the sun, so day time is safe. Smith's character, over the course of three years from the first outbreak, has developed a secure hideaway where he and his dog Samantha live. He is a scientist and is trying to develop a cure for the virus and is testing it on rats.<br/><br/>Smith hunts through New York for deer, but seems to be very bad at it as he doesn't catch any throughout the movie. You figure three years would have helped him gain skill at hunting. He also transmits a radio broadcast on all AM frequencies telling anyone who hears it to meet him at the pier at noon and he goes there daily.<br/><br/>The ending is less than spectacular, but necessary. It shows some gleam of hope. Although a friend recently commented that it could have done without the very ending, which I agree with.<br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend this movie and think everyone should go and see it if they have not already done so."

","Before I went to see ""I Am Legend"", I had heard from a lot of people that it was a typical zombie movie...wrong. I could not agree more with the review featured on the main page. <br/><br/>The movie portrays an incredibly realistic situation that could definitely happen in today's world. The thing I look for in a movie is not how much it scare you literally, but how it frightens you mentally. The images of New York City, and the abandoned skyscrapers covered in sheets to contain the virus shows the failure to stop the virus. Even when Smith is looking through other peoples homes, you can see flyers from the gov that say ""BEWARE: Dogs come out at night, and are dangerous, yadda yadda"" The whole movie is crazy real, and actually kinda frightening, some parts you won't see coming. I once had a dream that a city near me was attacked by nuke, and gas prices shot up to $6.00. Nevertheless, gas is $6 in ""I am Legend"", pointing out the once again, impeccable detail.<br/><br/>The only complaint I've heard is the ending. I think the ending was totally necessary, it was the only way. If people expected him to live and get the fame for curing the human race, and live happily ever after, then thats not a legend, just a hero. Instead, the sacrifice makes him truly a legend. Only unrealistic part is how the people living would've reproduce the cure...since his lab with all the cures was blown up in the end. But anywhooo...<br/><br/>Great movie, go see it, you will be moved."

All of this lead to a horrific ending that made the entire movie bad.The actual title wont make sense until the end.

","I enjoyed ""I am Legend"" for the fact it rises above many other zombie type films of its genre. Will Smith does an excellent job in his portrayal of the possibility of being the last man on earth. You do feel his loneliness; his isolation and his incredible bond to the only organic companion left with him. It was refreshing to see a movie that highlighted faith in a positive manner. You see characters praying and Christian symbolism. It was happy to see a ""Anna"" who claimed she heard from God, and was NOT portrayed as psychopath, but someone who DID actually hear from God and believed in his plan and purpose. The movies apocalyptic views of New York are something to watch and are a scary view of what would be if something devastating happened to our city. In the end there are clear redemptive qualities for the character and the story. I would recommend this film on many levels and appreciated it lack of excessive profanity and no nudity or sex scenes as well as a good story."
"jewbearjosh","Null","1","3","19 December 2007"," Real scary version of the near future-well made science fiction film
","It goes without saying that Will Smith is one of the most talented actors working in film today. In I am Legend, he proves that fact.<br/><br/>To summarize the plot, Smith plays a scientist named Robert Neville. Neville and his dog, Samantha, spend each day running around Manhattan (the year is 2012) looking for any other survivors. It seems that a man-made virus, originally a solution that cures cancer, has made the country virtually deserted of people and animals. This epidemic quickly wiped out the country. It only took three years. However, Neville is not alone. Hiding in the dark parts of the island are creatures called The Infected. These creatures have only one goal-feed. Every day, Neville risks his life looking for one of these creatures. Once he can bring one of The Infected back to his lab, he can spend time testing potential cures on it. The question is, will Neville-who is immune-finally come up with the cure, or will he make a mistake and become one of The Infected? I was real impressed with Smith's performance. He really does a great job of showing emotion. And, he is not afraid to be vulnerable. I think also that he truly makes this character his own. Smith has no one to act out scenes with here. Its just him, acting for the audience. All by himself, in a deserted city. Trying to outrun creatures that are looking for humans to feed. How does someone perform that? It must not be an easy job. In fact, I bet its real tough, emotionally and physically. But, Smith makes it look effortless.<br/><br/>I am Legend has some awesome camera work-sound effects-cinematography-production design-special effects-digital animation-and creature design. It is a vary well done science fiction film. I will even say that it is a must see. But, do not bring the children. There are scenes in the movie that will frighten them.<br/><br/>josh weinman"
"sir-montag","7","1","3","18 December 2007"," Good, but mildly disappointing
","I actually went out and read the book this is based on (Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"") after seeing the trailer for this movie for the first time. It looked *that* good. The book was interesting and fairly well written, but had quite possibly one of the most depressing endings in the world.<br/><br/>The movie had its good points and its rough ones (CGI for characters isn't quite what it needs to be, though I'm sure it will be there in ten or fifteen years).<br/><br/>Will Smith does an excellent acting job, but he's not quite lost in the role, in the sense that at times, on screen, you realize you're watching Will Smith.<br/><br/>The director didn't quite have the chops to do this movie as well as it could have been done, I fear, as he's only got one other major film under his belt and the rest are music videos.<br/><br/>The film didn't really convey the horror of being the last person on earth as well as it could of. Sure, it hinted at it, but it was hardly pervading like it really should have been. The story's strongest point is it's psychological aspect and that didn't rule the day in this film. Far too many ""It's A Big Budget Major Hollywood Movie!"" moments kind of killed the effectiveness of that feeling. (Massive product placement at the beginning, happy deer hunting scenes, an overall light emotional tone for the first half of the movie).<br/><br/>All that said, it is a fairly solid movie and well worth renting, though paying to see it in theaters is a 50/50 thing."
"pninson","5","1","3","18 December 2007"," CGI: New York
","This is the first of three film versions of Richard Matheson's ""I am Legend"" to use the story's title. However, it's an even bigger departure from the book than THE OMEGA MAN.<br/><br/>That doesn't have to be a problem; the story here is serviceable. It just isn't well told. The CGI rendering of an abandoned New York is the most impressive thing in the movie. Will Smith gives his usual stalwart, likable, performance, but the film never really grabbed me.<br/><br/>There are two significant problems. One is the lack of music. Most scenes have no background score, and this is clearly done to reinforce Smith's isolation. It doesn't really work, though; somehow the film is a bit too quiet, until you finally hit the action sequences at the end.<br/><br/>And there's the other problem. The first two film versions (THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, with Vincent Price, and THE OMEGA MAN, with Charlton Heston), retained Matheson's premise of scientifically created vampires. This film dispenses with this and replaces the vampires with screaming CGI monsters, indistinguishable from the Rage Virus victims in 28 DAYS LATER and its sequel. The atmospherics of the original story, and the haunting of Neville, who has to spend his nights listening to the vampires call his name, and assault his fortress on a nightly basis, are lost in favor of a routine monster-shootfest.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but it's not a particularly effective one. Since Will Smith spends almost the entire movie talking to his dog, the story feels flat and one-dimensional. Even Will Smith's winning personality can't entirely rescue it."
"secretagent_007","7","1","3","18 December 2007"," Could have been legendary!
","Lots of folks been complaining about the CG monsters in this movie and how poorly they've been created. Well, don't let that crap keep you away from the movie. Yes, it is clear that the vampiric ghouls created by a worldwide spread of a man-made virus are computer generated, but that doesn't make them less scary and here's why: when we see the hero of the movie, a trained soldier and scientist, venture inside a dark building where the ghouls reside, he gets scared. So scared he almost abandons his only friend, his dog Sam, to the infected monsters within. Heroes don't typically act this way. They're normally a little too calm and collected in situations like this. So when Will Smith shows genuine fear of going inside that building, we fear for him. The CG is used only to make the creatures something inhuman, which is what the virus made them. Dudes running around with plastic teeth and shaved heads wouldn't have the same effect.<br/><br/>Smith plays Neville, an Army scientist who was in charge of the virology team on Manhattan when the virus, which was originally made to cure diseases, went bad and started turning people into super vampires. The movie opens several years after the outbreak and Neville is still on Manhattan, still researching a way to reverse the virus's effects. I Am Legend uses the ""Lost"" method of employing flashbacks. We jump back and forth between past and present, the scenes giving each other more depth the more we learn about Neville's predicament. He has become an urban survivalist, living off of canned food and whatever animals he can hunt with his 2010 model Mustang. At night, when the extremely UV-sensitive creatures come out to feed, Neville's house becomes a steel-encased fortress and he sometimes sleeps in the tub with a rifle in hand - I guess when hundreds of growling beasts lurk outside your house, the bed just feels a little too open. The first hour is all about how he survives from day to day, how he is trying to cure the disease in a high tech lab in the basement, and how he's beginning to totally crack up from the isolation. This first hour is great.<br/><br/>Every day he exercises to keep himself in top physical form, pampers and scolds his dog like a child, goes down to the video store to ""rent"" a movie from the mannequin he's placed behind the counter, and at midday he goes to a certain pier and waits for someone to answer his constantly broadcasting radio message. The routine is probably what has kept him from going insane up to this point, but he's still slowly slipping away. He tiptoes around a particular female mannequin at the video store, afraid to speak to her like I am to a real live girl. He invents whole conversations with the silent figures out on the street. And when one of his ""friends"" turns up in a place he's not supposed to be, we can't be sure if he's finally going nuts or if someone is playing a trick on him. But he's supposed to be all alone Eventually, the screenwriters do the lame thing and bring a plot into the mix. But not just a plot - a message as well. In the last 10 minutes of the picture, Neville appears to have a crisis of faith which undermines his ability to save the human race. That's all well and good, but up to this point, spirituality has practically no role in the movie at all aside from a short prayer in one of the flashback scenes. I didn't have a problem with that plot point itself, I just wish that point had been inevitably reached like it should be in a well told story. Instead it just pops up suddenly for no other reason than the end of the movie was approaching. Still, that first hour Hot diggity. Now I have to give up my own dreams of making a post-apocalyptic adventure movie because the first two-thirds of this one do it so well.<br/><br/>http://www.movieswithmark.com"
"roflmao02152","10","1","3","18 December 2007"," An amazing Film
","When i first heard news about I Am Legend i was excited and was looking forward to it. The reason I liked it so much was because i was expecting a good movie and thats exactly what i got. Contrary to other movies set in desolate New York, this movie was highly believable. The weeds growing through the street made it seem so real. Along with the scenery came Will Smith as Robert Neville. What really caught my attention is how well he portrayed a human being living alone for 3 years, even when encountering the mutated humans he has tactics (Covering flashlight) and characterizes them as a sub species (Using words like colony when they group.) Its an extraordinary film, Please PLEASE see it."
"Danusha_Goska","6","1","3","18 December 2007"," Not As Scary As Hoped; Best Part - Will Smith
","""I Am Legend"" reminded me of several other movies.<br/><br/>It wasn't as jarring and disturbing as ""Planet of the Apes,"" also about a dystopic future in which one heroic man battles a world driven mad by an evil synergy of human, scientific hubris hand in hand with natural selection, a world whose bizarre features render him a freak.<br/><br/>It wasn't as nightmare scary as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Making the mutants cgi special effects rather than actual human beings rendered them less frightening and disturbing.<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" wasn't as deep or detailed a depiction of a man alone in a hostile environment that he fashions to his own needs as was ""Castaway."" But, it was pretty good. Nice special effects of Manhattan without humans. I wish there had been a scene of Smith entering a candy store and eating all the candy he wanted, and another of Smith entering a clothing store and trying on expensive suits. Haven't we all harbored such fantasies since childhood? The best part of ""I Am Legend"": Will Smith's star power.<br/><br/>Will Smith really is a movie star, in the old fashioned sense. He is larger than life and charismatic. The viewer's eyes go to him. You like him. You trust him. He's on your side, telling your story.<br/><br/>Time to see Will Smith in another straight drama. It's been too long since ""Six Degrees of Separation."""
"etsm92","7","1","3","18 December 2007"," A legend worth remembering...
","I Am Legend/2007/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Robert Neville: Will Smith Anna: Alice Braga<br/><br/>The title is perfect. Basically, the entire film is Robert Neville (Will Smith) and creatures. So he is legend because it says so in the title. When I first heard about this film I seriously didn't have a clue what it was about. And, to tell you the truth, I really didn't know what it was about when I walked into the theater, sat down, and watched. It took practically thirty minutes for me to understand the plot because the majority of the beginning was Will Smith saying perhaps one or two words to his dog and sniping deer. That was about it.<br/><br/>The setting: Manhattan. If you haven't heard anything about the film or read an outline then you most likely wouldn't understand what's going on, just like I didn't. All I knew was that Manhattan had some sort of tragic accident and it resulted in the entire city being evacuated. The special effects were quite convincing in the beginning. Whoever designed what Manhattan would look like without any people occupying it, did an excellent job. Talk about a difficult job. The streets are constantly flooded but not for this.<br/><br/>I liked the beginning because there weren't too many jumping scenes, horrifying images, etc. It was quiet perhaps too quiet. Because then the true action began with unconvincing CGI creatures that were supposed to look like diseased humans but looked more like zombies. What's the difference, though? They had similar features to humans but their mouths were about triple the size of a normal human. They were also paler, uglier, and greasier than humans and that's about it. Triple-sizing their mouths can only mean one thing. These creatures won't speak; they'll just scream for no reason taking up the entire screen with their mouth, which you see a lot of times in horror films with also nasty creatures and gigantic mouths. How else will they be heard?<br/><br/>Do we need to hear them? No. I preferred if they didn't scream at all so they wouldn't disturb the peace. But once I heard the first bellow I knew the movie was gonna last for quite a while.<br/><br/>It didn't. The movie actually ended rather abruptly just like it started.<br/><br/>So how did these once normal humans turn into these annoying, abnormal humans? Well, a virus spread throughout the vicinity, killing way too many. He was the only one left. He sent out radio messages for about three years without an answer, hoping, just hoping there would be someone to answer to him, someone out there he could help or perhaps someone who could help him.<br/><br/>He lived an O.K. life. He and his dog lived in a house he once lived in with his wife and kid. Flashbacks demonstrated it throughout the film. Usually when he was sleeping, it would flip to a flashback to show us what was happening and how it happened, and then later it would all become clearer to us.<br/><br/>Most importantly, though, you must watch the beginning scene. All it shows for about a minute is an interview with a doctor (played by Emma Thompson) on TV. Listen to the interview. We soon see Will Smith and his dog three years later.<br/><br/>The movie did flip around a lot so pay attention.<br/><br/>Now obviously there has to be a human that shows up eventually. Yeah. Anna (Alice Braga) and her son Ethan (Charlie Tahan) show. How did they get there, knowing that all bridges were destroyed, all humans were gone, only manikins were in stores, and objects, animals, and creatures are the only sources of life? Perhaps they swam or took a boat. They obviously cared a lot about Neville and wanted to save him. Why did she show up all of the sudden? Divine intervention, perhaps? Francis Lawrence is a good director. I have to credit him the most because there wasn't much of a screenplay. Instead, Neville just fights these ""superhumans"" and uses his dog as a companion. Lawrence, however, builds the suspense in a way we really like. Smith did a wonderful job. He's a good actor, but maybe this time it wasn't all acting.<br/><br/>Movie directed by Francis Lawrence."
"hilsfavoritefunder","8","1","3","18 December 2007"," Pleasantly surprised.......except
","They obviously ran out of money, or imagination by the time they turned their attention to the mutants. They looked like decent video game characters,completely unbelievable, and were one of the few chinks in the armor. The scene where they overrun Neville's house looks as if they are under the command of the same software program, and they are entirely over the top superhuman in their movements. They should have found a halfway point between what they ended up with, and the hooded albino hippies from The Omega Man. I haven't seen the movie where Will Smith lives in a bathroom with his son, so taking that out of the equation, this is the best acting work of his career. The scene with his dog....putting his wife and daughter on the copter is lump in the throat stuff."

","it seemed like there were two different writers for this movie. there was the writer that came up with the brilliant beginning and then there was the writer that came up with the terrible ending.<br/><br/>i loved this movie. i'm dying to watch it again...but if I did, I know the exact moment when I would walk out. I almost wish the movie would have just cut out and stopped abruptly instead of giving us that awful ending.<br/><br/>not only did this movie start off with an incredible premise, but the story was told in an almost flawless way. they gave this movie the action and suspense of a horror while maintaining the emotions of a drama. i sat at the edge of my seat, totally pulled in, wanting to know more, wanting the hero to succeed....that is, until the end....<br/><br/>deu ex machina. thats all i have to say about the end. i don't know how much i should give away, but i felt like they just used cheat after cheat in the end. things became horribly convenient, to the point where I started to become angry...also, they stopped so suddenly when they could have done so much more. the first thing i said, as soon as the credits started to roll, was ""thats it?""....i just felt like they were scared. they had something special on their hands, but they were scared to go to far off and do something different. instead, they made an ending by numbers and a movie that was slightly above average...this movie isn't bad because anything other than what it could have been."
"jen1023","7","1","3","18 December 2007"," Good at First - Ending that Stinks!
","First of all, I haven't read the book. After seeing the movie, I figured it would have to have been based off of one and discovered that, yes, it's based off of Richard Matheson's novel, I Am Legend -- which I will definitely be buying.<br/><br/>Just like Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds left a lot to be desired - not explaining things - this movie does the same. In WoW - it was like they depended on Cruise's star status instead of plot - and this one did too. They started off GREAT - and gave a lot of anticipation but instead of getting satisfaction as they progressed, you're left with a million questions and a desire for something more.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that as a whole, I liked the movie, and much of what I didn't like about it could have been fixed if it were longer than 101 minutes - they could have added a lot more details.<br/><br/>Will Smith's character is supposed to be a highly intelligent man but in one scene where his mannequin, ""Fred"" appears in a different place from where Smith had placed him, instead of wondering how ""Fred"" got there, Smith instead screams at him and appears to have a nervous breakdown. If I were ""alone"" in a place with unthinking, unfeeling monsters lurking in the dark places, I think I'd be wondering how ""Fred"" got moved. Also, in an earlier scene, the leader of the mutants walks into the sunlight, burning his face and Smith's character comments that the behavior is unlike human behavior. However, the mutants set a trap for Smith that is exactly like the trap he sets for one of them. OK? That isn't like intelligent human behavior? They're obviously thinking and planning schemes.<br/><br/>One other thing that confused me -- when Smith enters his basement lab for the first time, we notice that he is bathed in black light - UV light. However, when Smith, the woman and the boy retreat to the lab to escape the mutants, he doesn't turn on the lights. Also along this same train of thought - why didn't he reinforce his roof? He lives in a brick house and he's put steel shutters on his windows, but the roof he leaves as wood and shingles.<br/><br/>And, at the very end of the movie, the lady gives the blood containing the cure to the people at the survivor colony. Why are we supposed to believe that they would have the resources or the knowledge to do something with that blood? The one person who could have developed it into something to administer to the mutants is gone."
"MrDavidCJohnson","9","1","3","17 December 2007"," Excellent Film
","This is an excellent horror film with chilling characterizations especially from Will Smith himself. Leading the cast and telling the story, Will Smith does an excellent job of taking us on a tour of a devastated New York destroyed by a vision of hope gone bad. The story unfolds in atypical fashion letting us glimpse in parts just how the problem with the 'mutants' manifested. We care about the plight of Dr. Robert Neville in his bid to save his family, his friends, and especially the human species itself. The media of film is one of legal hypnosis, and this film certainly takes advantage of some seriously lifelike visuals, both living and nonliving, in order to convey a sense of nature gone wrong at the hands of well meaning human beings. <br/><br/>As a composition, Legend is a well put together orchestration of acting, setting, and direction that more than entertains the horror story buff. Legend is everything that a horror film is designed to be: nail biting entertainment done well. Typical horror films either fall short in terms of action, acting, story, or special effects/setting. An imbalance in any of these factors typically results in boredom. However the story of Legend Robert Neville is certainly filled to the core with excitement. Excellently done. :D GLEE."
"aimlessrambler","10","1","3","17 December 2007"," I Am Legend
","Having read the book, seen ""The Last Man On Earth"" and ""The Omega Man"" (the other two 'versions' of Matheson's novel), I would have to say that I Am Legend is far and away the best version of all. Not because of the CG effects, or the scripting; it is the best version of all because Will Smith truly makes you believe that he is the lonely, obsessed, and nearly schizoid Robert Neville.<br/><br/>In a scene where he is forced to go into the dark, Smith truly conveys the duality of his nature: on one hand, he is trying to save a loyal friend; on the other, he is in a state of abject terror at what may (or may not) be lurking in the dark.<br/><br/>The original novel's strength lie in its ability to take the reader inside the head of the ""last man on earth"", and share his despair, obsession, and loneliness. This movie, while not letter-perfect when referenced to the book, certainly captures the nuances contained therein.<br/><br/>A must see--and if Will Smith does not at least get an Oscar nomination for his transcendent performance, then the Academy can just take their cute little brass statues and put them in the dark somewhere..."
"jadakiss602","6","1","3","17 December 2007"," 9 out of 10 movie, why?
","OK to give you a very quick summary of the movie without giving away to much i will say this, It's a Post-apocalyptic movie, under the horror/action group, there is more action than horror, Starring Will Smithas DR. Neivell. He is an ex-military personal who is Luckilly also a scientist living in New York city. a lot happens (dont want to spoil it) then a couple years later it seems that he is the only ""human"" alive. along with his only companion a dog named Sue, he must race and find find a cure and survive, its post-apocalyptic war against the ""dark-seekers"". If you read the book, you ca leave it at home, because this movie takes a new twist on the story and i strongly believe is better than the other three adaptations, including the so very wrong blatant attempt to cash in using the I am Legend trend movie called ""I am Omega"" which sucked a lot LOL. Very good movie, powerful, emotional, realistic, action-packed, and very suspenseful. Execellent MOVIE! IMHO: it will scare you (as in make you jump), not as in the bloody zombie scary way, no, but as in it will startled you and surprise you way, lots of people screamed in my theater HAHAHAHAHA. people often like to criticize movies and nit-pick at then and if you do you make any movie look bad, people argue stupid things like, how can he drive the car if gasoline is only stable for 6 months and goes bad after that, Its completely stupid to argue that since its just a movie. But it still doesn't take away of how amazing its story line is, people will always say the book is batter than the adaptation, but i say the movies are just as good, the only reason people say the book is better is because the movie is usually not interpreted how they personally would interpreted thats all, over all its a very powerful movie, some people cried. And its a very realistic movie, its not some mutant zombie flick, the virus is a mutated variant of the measles that scientists made to fight cancer, talk about ironic. So its a "" this could happen"" kind of feeling through out the movie, which makes it so much more interesting. Overall i am 90% sure that you will absolutely LOVE this film or 10% you will like it, a lot. There is really not much wrong with it and definitely have you thinking about your mortality and morals. Will smith puts on an amazing show, his acting is superb! if you like i robot, MIB, or others, this movie is about 50 times better. other characters are not developed as much, but there is no need to, because the the main story is focused on the DR."
"ambrose531","5","1","3","17 December 2007"," Question about ending
","Let me first say I was disappointed in the movie, I guess b/c of all the hype that surrounded it. I saw it in IMAX and actually thought the new BATMAN trailer at the beginning was better than Legend.<br/><br/>The question I have concerns the ending of the movie, you see the woman and kid drive up to this small town surrounded by15 foot concrete walls and inside there is a community of people who have survived. What I don't get is during the movie you witness these mutants climb walls and hop up light poles and pull them down, why wouldn't they just climb this wall? And it's not like they are isolated, you can clearly see that the community is just outside an existing community, if those people died and turned into zombies or whatever wouldn't these people be easy pickings? I also don't understand why Smith had to be heroic and blow himself up instead of just climbing in the safe/chimney with the other two and just throwing the grenade? And why would that one grenade blow up all the zombies when the other HUGE explosions couldn't? To many questions left unanswered. Will Smith does a terrific job of acting but the story left much to be desired."
"Ata-2","8","1","3","17 December 2007"," Could have been great
","I would definitely recommend this movie but I just wish it had not been dummed down to just an action movie. The best things about it were Will Smith's acting, that really carried the whole movie, and the amazing sets. Thats more than enough to make it a good movie. What was missing to make it great was any kind of depth to the story. In the book you start off thinking you know who the bad guys are but when faced with what is actually happening you are not so sure. Kind of like in the Strugatsky brothers' books where the line between good and evil is never quite clear. This whole aspect was skimmed over in the movie. I guess this was to make it more accessible to the general movie-going public or some such idiotic notion. The other real let down was the creatures. You'd think Hollywood with their budget could have improved on what we can produce in games. The creatures looked like standard Maya or Character Studio characters that had been touched up and animated with motion capture. The sets were so amazingly well done that the creatures looked cheap in comparison. Just need to work back from facial recognition, sprinkle in some animated texture-maps, add a pinch of realistic lighting, simplify the physics, convolve the whole lot with the light-scattering functions and voila! pretty close to real. Oh well, another ten years I guess."

The phrase ""I Am Legend"" has a very, VERY specific meaning in the book that would elevate this film far above what ends up being a run-of-the-mill zombie flick.This is VERY disappointing, because by and large, during the first two-thirds, most of the changes make sense in light of what we currently know (scientifically) that Richard Metheson couldn't know 50-plus years ago. But the filmmakers evidently didn't have the fortitude or intelligence to deal with the core themes found in the book and turned what is essentially a story of an everyman who eventually becomes an antihero and even a monster because of the plague and extraordinary events in the novel, into a heroic fantasy featuring a Hollywood superstar that COMPLETELY CHANGED THE ENTIRE MEANING OF THE STORY IN THE LAST BIT OF BULLSHIT V.O.<br/><br/>For a while there it actually looked like they were going to tackle some of the core themes from the novel...but then they took the easy route and allowed the narrative to fall prey to a broad range of horror and sci-fi clichés...Will Smith is a fan...I'm surprised he let them puss-out like this.<br/><br/>This would be a fine movie if they just retitled it...but it's NOT a worthy version of ""I Am Legend""...<br/><br/>...not by a long shot..."

The house and way in which Smith lives is very intelligent and his character is very lovable. The dog even does a good job of acting! Everyone should see this movie, it is a wild ride that REALLY scared me. Im talking, I drove home thinking the night-seekers were after me and slept with a lamp on. And I'm not easily scared! Will Smith is the highest paid actor in Hollywood for a reason, this script is exciting, interesting, and above all bad-a$s.

","Recently i got an opportunity to watch the new Will Smith movie ""I AM LEGEND"". whatever the promos had shown and what the movie in fact had was like tracking two antipodes simultaneously.

Ia happy to say that finally sci-fi has come of age and the director shows this by presenting to us a deserted but not impoverished city.<br/><br/>the theme is brilliant (at least better than aliens or psychopath-organisations bent upon ruling the world) Will Smith is brilliant. H e shuns melodrama.His character is also quite superbly written unlike Kurt Russel's escapes. The hero here has all the natural emotions and fears that govern normal men.<br/><br/>the only thing that seemed lacking in the film was perhaps a hastened ending which in turn was triggered by a serious lack of imagination in the later half of the movie.

"http_dougie","9","1","3","16 December 2007"," The ""Deep Impact"" in a world of ""Armageddon"" in a bio-hazard way...
","I don't know if that makes sense at all, so I'll quickly explain.<br/><br/>Deep Impact and Armageddon came out around the same time, right? Both similar ideas: asteroid, earth, human extinction. Fun times! Anyhoo, both movies took different approaches. I found Armageddon had action in the foreground with drama being used to force a connection so we could relate to something amidst all the action w/getting to the rock and all that jazz. Deep Impact, however, I felt let the action take to the back seat, and the strongest story wasn't the asteroid but how families and people struggled to survive here on earth. Does that make sense? So yes, all preceding comments say the same crap about comparing it to the likes of Resident Evil or any shoot-em-up zombie flick, to which I agree mostly. I Am Legend doesn't fall in the same category. It's not a shoot-em-up zombie flick. It's post-apocalyptic future isn't about fighting the evil to survive. It's not about a band of survivors who are choosing to slaughter the living dead. Get the point? Anyway, I guess that'll be enough of me lecturing people on movie differences.<br/><br/>I thought I Am Legend was a great film. For what was pretty much a one-man show, should've felt like it was dragging on, but it didn't. Smith's co-star, the beautifully talented and charismatic Samantha (uh... the dog), was great for allowing Smith's emotions and ideas to thrive. Smith's ever growing insanity was also charming, and I would assume pretty damn accurate for someone who is isolated. I gasped when I saw the shots of New York and almost wanted to applaud them alone, it was a beautiful stage on which to set this story. I appreciated the flashbacks which helped to understand Smith's background just a bit, but the flashbacks were so few the story remained linear.<br/><br/>I've read how some people wanted to know more about ""how the virus spread"" or ""what else happened."" It's unfortunate that too many people can't just enjoy a story and they want all their questions answered. Not to go off movie, but that's my fear with Cloverfield, which looks to be a great monster movie. I have a feeling Cloverfield, though it's all secured and plot unknown kinda stuff, won't explain much about who or what the creature is. I doubt we'll hear ""it originated from Tokyo nuclear reactor!!"" Okay, going back to I Am Legend...<br/><br/>Just go watch it!! I almost never go to theaters. I prefer DVD (...er BluRay), but occasionally I get dragged to a theater and become pleasantly surprised. I Am Legend is, though not an epic, best seen on a larger screen, and no I don't mean a 52"" HD 1080p. The scale of the city, and emotion from Smith is just so much. There were points where the movie just let you absorb in his frustration and pain. To me, a good movie either takes you on adventure, ala Pirates of the Carribbean, or gets you to connect and you're taken on an emotional roller-coaster in situations you could only imagine. ...but I loved The Sweetest Thing, and that was just plain fun. It's my guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>GO WATCH IT! Oh, and about the ending (since I selected the little ""Spoiler"" warning), it does feel kind of abrupt, but it still makes sense. True there could've been better ways to end it, there are always better ways to end things, but if you really absorb yourself into Smith's character, the outcome of this film does add up pretty accurately.<br/><br/>I'm gonna go look up that animated one someone told me about now, because I don't know what it's about it... and if it's not a prequel, then I seriously look forward to a prequel to this movie in the coming years, because seeing what happened in Smith's 3 years alone on the island would be great!!!"
"VincentNero","8","1","3","16 December 2007"," Could have been better... but wasn't bad.
","Will Smith shines in this Sci-Fi ""Cast Away"" role, playing a noble man whose sanity is wearing in a few spots. He holds this movie on his shoulders with his own brand of charm and empathy. By melding his performances from ""Independence Day"" and ""Pursuit of Happiness"", he creates a character that makes the evacuated NYC seem filled with life.<br/><br/>The script is tight, smart, and engaging knowing when and how to play with the audiences emotions. The script doesn't believe the audience is stupid by aiming low, but instead treats the audience with intellectual respect which results in storytelling that always moving forward without a movement of boredom even in the less action packed scenes. This 2 hour movie is the first blockbuster in awhile that doesn't drag on. Because of all its great aspects, the movie is easily forgiven for its bible pounding pro-Christian themes.<br/><br/>Where the movie fails is in the direction. Coming off of ""Constantine"", Francis Lawrence looked like he could be the next Guillermo del Toro, and very well still could be. (This could also explain why he got the job on the film... see Fun Stuff trivia section) However, he made a few, but very key, poor choices and couldn't pull good performances out of his supporting, albeit unknown, cast. The major complaint about this ""Cast Away"" meets ""30 Days of Night"" blockbuster is that when we finally come across the zombie vampires, we don't see things-that-go-bump-in-the-night. Instead we see a CG representation of the things-that-go-bump-in-the-night. And as advanced computer technology is (and increasing becoming), it still can't replace the ethos and pathos one feels for a flesh and blood actor. The villain(s) never draw us in because of their inorganic quality. This caused the film to simply be a blockbuster spectacle rather than an iconic film.<br/><br/>However, Lawrence's pacing was very good never dragging, and the action sequences were gripping, and many left the theater still unnerved with the fear instilled by his work on the big screen.<br/><br/>It's a must see if you are interested or curious. 8 out of 10."

","Well I saw I am Legend. I have to say that I really like it. Here is my breakdown:<br/><br/>THE GOOD- Will Smith gives a great performance as Robert Neville. His character is a great one and I love how the story shaped him. From losing his family and over the course of the film how he slowly gets even more lonely. Of course it really comes out after the dog dies. <br/><br/>The next thing that was good was the effects. I thought there were some great special effects in the movie. Some people say they don't like how the monsters looked. I liked how they looked. The looked as if they kind of still had that human face to them and not just complete monster. The bridge scene was great. The effects were great. Probably one of the best I have ever seen in a film. That is saying something.<br/><br/>There are many more things I liked about the film, but those two really stood out.<br/><br/>THE NOT SO GOOD(Not bad, but not good either)- The Ending. I could deal with the fact that there was another survivor in the city, but not that there was a whole bunch of survivors still living. It would have been better if there was not. It was just too bland. Also the fact that he dies at the end kind of sucks because I mean nobody wanted him too, but I guess it had to happen. <br/><br/>Well those are just a few of my comments on I am Legend. I think it is a very good film, not quite great, but I will definitely get it when it comes to DVD. I definitely recommend you go and see it. I think you will enjoy it."

I love how I got attached to the The main character and was shocked to find myself experiencing genuine fear for Sam, his dog, in the ware house scene. (which was masterfully done.) Will's performance was stellar, an emotionally trouble man, bordering Insanity, with a dog as the only source of companionship. The suspense this film provides is not disappointing.<br/><br/>The only problem I see with this movie is its controversial main idea (that there is a God)is hard to make out. whether this is intentional or not it seemed that the unobservant viewers left unaware of the message the movie was giving.

You believe, through his interactions with his dog and the ruins that was once New York City (including some mannequins), that he is in fact the only man who walks the Earth. His portrayal of Neville is easy to connect with the audience because of his compassionate drive to save humanity. An interesting thing to note is ""Omega Man"" Charleton Heston's portrayal of Neville was almost the complete opposite, but good nonetheless. Heston's was arrogant, and although he was also working on a cure, he seemed to be comfortable with the isolation.<br/><br/>Regardless, Will Smith actually saved this film. Why? Because once we start to interact with the zombies we realize that they're nothing but a bunch of cartoons ripped straight out of a first person shooter video game. How can the same film have amazing cgi that transformed NYC into a port-apocalyptic nightmare and then have cheap cgi of zombies that look like something out the movie ""Mummy""? I can understand it if they used cgi for background zombies but why not have real human actors with real good make-up and costumes for the foreground, especially for the leader?! I can buy that the cartoonish quality of the zombies helps in Neville's and our disassociation with them. I mean how could we possibly sympathize with them when they're obviously not even real? But had they been real actors there could have been a more interesting interaction between Neville and them (watch Omega Man to see how they pulled that off in that department but please ignore the cheesy afro).<br/><br/>Also take into consideration that these creatures are the result of a virus that has made their skin vulnerable to sunlight, wouldn't it stand to chance that they might also be physically weak as well(the leader smashing the glass with his FACE)? And why are they suddenly so acrobatic or nimble if you will if they weren't that way in normal life? Even if one argues that the zombies have resorted back to the primitive mind why would they be so mindless? Are they dead? I say mindless because for the most part they run about, smacking into one another, killing themselves to kill Neville acting like a pack a wolves and yet they own and I assume feed and train dogs? Are these the same zombies that tricked Neville with the Mannequin trap? Give me a break.<br/><br/>I must first admit that I was looking forward to this film and had high hopes for it so there is no doubt that I hyped it up a bit much. Even though I feel they dropped the ball with the end of the second act and the third (the ending was rushed) I still enjoyed the film. It could have been so much better or at least an improvement on Omega Man, but it is still thrilling and enjoyable and smarter than most of the summer popcorn films. And at the rate these studios are turning out one bad over budgeted film after another it is with a sigh of relief that this film is not one of them."
"bustin_skullz","9","1","3","16 December 2007"," This movie was truly an awesome movie that was moving throughout the entire movie.
","First, my reaction is ""WOW."" This movie was really great. I was disappointed to hear the negative feedback regarding the emotional depth of Will Smith. I think Will Smith did an excellent job playing this role. He really took on a characteristic that could be any one of us that happened to be in that situation.<br/><br/>The Plot of the story was good. It's kind of difficult, however, that you really have to pay attention to the plot because you can easily be lost. The movie begins with a quick summary which you make an assumption of what's going on, and the movie takes you to today of the movie. The movie had great characters and scenarios. This is what made the movie great. Also, the movie is scary. I admit that this movie was scary, and I'm usually never scared of movies. If you happened to be scared of simple scary movies, I recommend you seeing it during the day. I saw it at night and left a little scared. My girl left frightened. haha.<br/><br/>The downfall of the movie is going to be the lack of understanding what's going on. I'm personally one of a viewer who likes to watch a movie and not think to hard on what's going on when the movie is still playing. I get lost, and some pieces of the movie feel left out. I really never got to understand how Robert Neville got there by himself, and the development of everything which he came through to today of the movie. I was disappointed on the transformation of what happens resulting in the movie which was saddening. If you watched the movie, you know exactly what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The movie was really great overall. I was really touched by everything that happened. Someone else wrote a review and basically said the right thing. The ending made the purpose of the title of the movie. Will Smith displayed great emotion again with the entire movie. I thought it was hilarious, and he did normal human emotions, such as talking to his dog Sam. The movie touched great elements of his life and reactions and emotions. I know I keep using the word emotions, but the movie was really emphasized on his feelings. I really encourage many to watch this movie. You will not be disappointed. This movie takes most movies to another level."
"pranakhan","8","1","3","16 December 2007"," Overall excellent film only slightly disappointing
","This film was rather well done. One of the most interesting aspects, to me, was watching the psychological effect of total isolation on Will Smith's Dr. Neville. Two scenes in the film were particularly tear jerking and touching, with Smith demonstrating again that he can clearly be one of the best dramatic actors in modern cinema. Overall, this is an excellent film; it's thrilling, frightening, and touching and pretty much everyone but the most bitterly cynical people will really enjoy it.<br/><br/>I only have one complaint, but to me its a big one...<br/><br/>The infected. Yes, they were extremely frightening until they attacked! I've read that the director originally started filming the infected as live actors with special prosthesis but felt they weren't convincing enough, so he decided on entirely CG characters using live actors only for some motion capture work. I think this was a remarkably dumb choice in his part. Actors with prosthesis can still be incredibly effective at playing convincing, sometimes superhuman, monsters. Reference the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, ""28 Days Later"", ""28 Weeks Later"", and ""The Descent."" The infected in the 28 Days films were absolutely entirely convincing, especially in the sequel, and were played almost entirely with real live actors in makeup utilizing CG for detail and enhancement. The infected in ""I Am Legend"" were clearly CG, which I found to be very disappointing. Also, these are supposed to be humans who have been infected with a virus causing their appearance and behavioral changes. Well, if you are going to base your monsters on humans you should try your best to keep movement as realistic as possible. The first time you see one of the infected scream, its clear that the size of their mouths don't make mechanical sense when compared to the shape of their faces with mouth closed. Its that kind of error that breaks the ""suspension of disbelief"" in audiences. Once the audience gets its first full glimpse of an infected human, they lose much of their ability to frighten. Still, my opinions about the quality of the infected CG doesn't really detract from my opinion of the film as a whole. The infected are only a fraction of the focus on this film, and there is so much else left to love. The lack of reality in the CG is trivial compared to the depth and reality of the psychological isolationist elements in the rest of the film. <br/><br/>I do have a theory regarding the situation with the infected. I think the studio wanted this film to appear to a broad range of people, including families, and possibly they allowed the CG to be a bit obvious to actually reduce the level of fear in younger viewers? *Shrug* I don't know."

","I Am Legend marks the third kick at the film can for Richard Matheson's 1954 novel about the lone survivor of a global pandemic that has transformed humanity into a horde of blood hungry vampires.<br/><br/>Originally brought to the screen in 1964 under the title The Last Man on Earth, with Vincent Price in the lead role, the movie was re-made in 1971 as The Omega Man with Charlton Heston, and now gets another pass as a starring vehicle for Will Smith.<br/><br/>While none of the versions actually get Matheson's apocalyptic fable right, this latest incarnation is probably the best of the bunch, the result in large part to some impressive and atmospheric CGI, decent acting on the part of Smith, and a German Shepard that practically steals the movie.<br/><br/>Directed by relative newcomer Francis Lawrence, whose only significant prior helming credits include the tepid Keanu Reeves demon flick Constantine and a series of Britney Spears and J-Lo videos, Legend manages to ramp up the cringe factor by turning every darkened building, corridor and stairwell into places of unspeakable dread, for while daylight manages to hold the vampirish mutants at bay, there's nothing stopping them from holding court in dark corners.<br/><br/>Set three years after the genetic manipulation of the measles virus into a cure for cancer has run amok  the virus itself mutating in horrific and unforeseen ways  Smith's Robert Neville, a top flight military scientist, remains alone at ""ground zero"", barricaded in a fortified home complete with basement laboratory from which he wiles away his days conducting experiments on rats and captured human mutants in a desperate attempt to find a cure. His only companion in this lonely existence is a dog named Samantha whom he leans on to hold isolation-induced insanity in check.<br/><br/>While increasingly the efforts of computer generated effects are poured into the realization of unworldly creatures and spectacular explosions  of which Legend has its share  it's in the transformation of Manhattan into a moonscape of abandoned vehicles and buildings, slowly succumbing to reclamation by nature, that the computer wizards behind this film really deserve credit.<br/><br/>As tales of the apocalypse go, Legend falls short of filling the ample shoes of such previous entries such as 28 Days Later and even the 2004 re-visioning of Dawn of the Dead, but its capable packaging of creepy dread, coupled with a great performance by Smith as a lonely man struggling to be the lone voice of humanity, all topped off by more than capable effects make this a popcorn film not to be missed."
"jakeamoore","6","1","3","16 December 2007"," Could have been better. About 2/3 of a good movie
","First of all in three years there is a garden growing over times square? where the stags come from (Don't Stags tend to travel alone, hence the connotation)? The zombie/mutants/whatever looked terrible, they must have gotten the CGI guy that did ""The Mummy"" in the late 90's. the mutants look like Imhotep. Consider the fact that ""The Mummy"" came out in 1999 and that leaves them sorely lacking. Will Smith does a fine job as the lonely Dr., running the range of emotions quite well. All in all though I blame poor writing and CGI for sinking this. Watch ""The Last Man on Earth"" or ""28 Days Later"" for a far better doomsday/""everyone else is dead...but not really"" flick."

","Hmm...it's hard to comment on the movie , when the leading role is played by one of my favorite actors. Yes ,Will Smith did a great job, he is a very good actor but the script really disappointed me. I would have really wanted for it not to be so ordinary, a little bit more realistic!I loved the first part, the script was really good, but after that it became devious. It just enter into the ""all the same SF"" movie gender. I mean, he is alone, he broadcasts messages for three years, and just when he is in trouble and followed by the creatures he is saved by a woman who came from Ireland?!?!?!?!WHO TALKED TO GOD?????!!!!!Come on!!!And everybody from that hidden camp weren't aware of his living?????

"kirkintha26","8","1","3","16 December 2007"," Mysterious and enjoyable
","I am so glad this movie was not two and half hours to three hours long (although it was about 15 minutes/4 scenes short IMHO) - this is actually a great watch - albeit a little contrived at the end. Will Smith is one of the few actors who could have pulled off this type of action and drama without seeming too - Will Smith (or insert actor's name here) - at the time. I really enjoyed the camera shots and seamless CGI - most of the time it felt like hand held cameras and natural lighting - very cool. NYC is amazingly transformed into oblivion. Kudos. And in general, the affect on Smith's character of being under constant stress (both physically and mentally) is poignant.<br/><br/>I must admit though, that the story while well told, does not really have the legendary status that it could have had - or rather that the story never seemed to have a start or finish. For a character driven movie, one really needed a few of the characters to have more - scenes. I just saw some missed moments and revelations, hopefully there is a director's cut somewhere that maybe has a few extra scenes? All in all though, I loved this movie - it felt like faithful sci-fi thriller a la old school movies such as ""The Thing"" or any other 1950's 60's sci-fi.<br/><br/>Definitely check this movie out. Although I don't think it would happen - I would love to see a sequel to this. Maybe it should have been 3 hours long!<br/><br/>UPDATED 12/31/2008 - Well, I was right, there is an ""alternate"" version of this on the DVD, and I ask myself - why in the heck did they release the original? The alternate made more sense, brought the characters home - it was really good!"

"xblinkmex90","10","1","3","16 December 2007"," question:
","i love how this movie was made and how chilling and realistic it was. i like how they showed how Neville strived to maintain his sanity by renting movies, talking to the mannequins/his dog as if there's still people around him etc. but one thing i did not understand is the scene where he fell on his pocket knife after cutting himself loose.why did he originally go to that building with ""Fred"" the mannequin outside of it?did he put Fred there himself? and for what purpose? i understand him talking to Fred and the others as if they're real but it just seemed to come out of left field for me. it's a minor detail i'm assuming, but still puzzling to me."
"vector7472000","6","1","3","16 December 2007"," So Much To Do About Nothing............
","After seeing Will Smith in such hits as Independence Day and the Bad Boys movies, you get use to a certain level of action and acting. I have never been so disappointed in one of his movies as much as this one. This title and plot line had so much potential to be so very much more. I felt that certain scenes were just put in at random spots.... It was like the director said ""OK the audience might be getting board here , KILL THE DOG!"" or ""OK lets put some lions in the scene so we can have some really cool effects and make the crowd oooo and awww"" Like I said the plot line was very good, but too much was spent on him really doing nothing, and by the time he starts doing something besides driving around the movie is over. The plot never really developed into anything. Maybe they should have started at the beginning and explained how things spread, show some action or something! It almost seamed like for needed some pub so they had a 2 hour commercial. I was a big fan of 28 days and 28 weeks later because they took the zombie movie a little further in my opinion, but this one hardly broached the subject. Sadly.... Damn, Will go do another Bad Boys movie so you can save some face!"
"steeped","8","1","3","16 December 2007"," Will Smith does it!
","Many have tried to play the role, and many have failed - but not Will Smith as he plays Robert Neville, an immune American Solder and the last person in the world.<br/><br/>Emma Thompson, though uncredited for her role plays a doctor who find the cure for cancer, but like every medicine it has a side affect. When affected, all humans lose their human instincts, soon acting like vicious animals who travel in colonies and kill for survival. Robert Neville, alongside his companion German Sheppard Sam have to hunt during the day to live, and hide during the nights to not die.<br/><br/>This movie would be nothing without Will Smith, probably one of the best actors who finds the best roles throughout the past few years. The first 3/4 of the movie is a one man show, somewhat like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of talking to a volleyball, Robert Neville sets up mannequins and talks to them to keep the little sanity he has left. Will Smith is stunning in this movie - there are about three scenes which I can recall where he put on such a miraculous performance.<br/><br/>I didn't think this was possible, but the last 1/4 of the movie where it wasn't all of Will Smith's show anymore actually ruined the mood of film. I did appreciate the ending though, which revealed to us the reasoning for the title of the movie and that gave me shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, there were stunning flashbacks of Robert Neville's life before the entire population was wiped out. It revealed his wife and daughter, who was actually Will Smith's daughter in real life. In the Pursuit of Happiness, it was his real son who starred alongside him, and now it's his daughter.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie lacked some CGI (you could easily tell that the infected were poorly created), and although the ending ruined the mood, Will Smith's performance made this movie a piece of artwork, and I would recommend everyone to see it. There was no swearing or blood, so the younger audience who loves a good scare would enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend, for those who enjoyed this movie to see the four-part mini series by Stephen King ""The Stand"" - http://imdb.com/title/tt0108941/ 8/10"
"liberalgems","10","1","3","15 December 2007"," What A Powerful Tribute To Bob Marley & A Great Movie To Boot!
","There's lot of Bob Marley in this film. My favorite line was the Bob Marley quote about why he was going to perform TWO days after being shot in an assassination attempt: ""The bad people in the world never take a rest, so neither can I."" Bob Marley believed that music and love could change and heal the world. He was a true visionary, and I'm so very glad his very important message has not been forgotten by Hollywood! Playing various tunes from his Legend album makes Bob Marley's dream for peace all that more poignant! <br/><br/>I'm a fan of the original Omega Man film with Charleston Heston. Over the years I have watched it about a dozen times. I never tire of it! This remake pays homage to the original. But it's a very, very different interpretation. For example in the original film it was a biological warfare agent that got loose in the world. Now it's a genetically engineered virus to cure cancer that caused the destruction of the human race. In other words -biotechnology did us all in! <br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" also made me squirm because other then the occasional Bob Marley tune, so much of this film had zero music or sound effects. After a while you felt the Will Smith character's mind-boggling loneliness. This is first, and foremost, a psychological film. Even the movie theater audience barely made a sound! The filmmakers had tremendous courage not to dumb the story down to the level of adolescent boys. I have been begging Hollywood for years to make a Sci-Fi film suitable for the mature adult mind - so thank you! You've done it! <br/><br/>My favorite scene was the very last one. It showed how civilization can survive in the future - by being self-sufficient. Keep an eye out for the ultra-modern windmills and solar panels. The scene only lasts a few seconds, but it speaks volumes! <br/><br/>This film will be watched a 100 years from now! It's that good!"
"Linkinpark81087","8","1","3","15 December 2007"," It's Castaway meets Signs.
","Let me start off by saying that Will Smith is becoming one of the best actors of our generation. After starting his career doing some sub-par corny movies he has officially made his mark as a fantastic actor. It is a shame that he got jobbed out of an Oscar after a brilliant performance in The Pursuit of Happiness.<br/><br/>Robert Neville is seemingly the last man left on Earth. With the odds completely against him he is determined to find a cure to put the overly-aggressive infected victims at bay.<br/><br/>Robert Neville is in complete solitude; similar to that of Tom Hank's character in Castaway. Being completely alone makes the viewer feel much sympathy for Neville. More parallels could be made with Signs. Signs' aliens and the infected people in I Am Legend are similar in some physical aspects. Also, faith is tested in both movies as well with the main characters.<br/><br/>Spoiler: The acting for the most part was excellent. Will Smith does a great job, however, I wasn't too excited about Anna's character. She didn't have much charisma, especially for someone who has found life with not only Nevelle, but God as well. The boy didn't seem to have a part at all. Was he even necessary? I recommend this movie to just about anybody. It has a good plot with great graphics. It has a nice spiritual twist at the end. This movie provides hope to those who think mankind is finished even when on the brink of extinction."

","This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while.

The ending was really well done considering the rest of the movie and without spoiling anything, I can't imagine it being done any other way while eliciting the same emotional response from the audience.<br/><br/>The other great thing about the movie was that it wasn't all action/suspense like I thought it would be. There was even a scene that nearly made me cry. All in all this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while and I'll definitely be buying the DVD when its released!"
"claudemercure","8","1","3","15 December 2007"," grown-up movie
","It appears that in the last few years, Will Smith has grown up. It's done wonders for his acting. There are a few moments of levity in I Am Legend, but nothing like the non-stop stream of bad jokes that helped make Independence Day so atrocious. Mr. Smith has learned to bring gravity and vulnerability to a role when it is required. He expresses several states of mind here with skill.<br/><br/>But I think big-budget action/science-fiction movies have grown up too. After all, Will didn't write his own quips in his previous blockbuster movies, and his directors likely encouraged him to ham it up. The nineties are rife with movies that don't respect their audience's intelligence. The Fifth Element, Alien Resurrection, The Rock, and Armageddon are a few others which spring to mind, movies that undercut their own suspense by drowning it with idiotic jokes.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is an example of the darker breed of sci-fi film that has emerged since. Most of humanity has been wiped out. All that seems to be left is Will Smith, and some scary humanoid creatures. The post-apocalyptic world is vividly realized (there are weeds growing through cracks in the middle of downtown New York streets), and it truly feels like Smith is the last man on Earth. The scenes of suspense are intense. If you enjoy science fiction tinged with horror, I recommend this."

When the dog enters the dark and the infected was shown for the 1st time, I was thrilled. Cause now it becomes 28 Days Later which is the best zombie movie ever made. Great suspense, horrifying, thrilling yet very sentimental. But I was disappointed about how it ends.

","I liked this film quite a bit. But I have to say that for basic eeriness, the Vincent Price version The Last Man on Earth is the best of the three films. But I Am Legend beats out The Omega Man in my books. I agree that the sets were amazing, especially the emptiness of NYC (almost unbelievable!). Smith did a great job with the script, although I don't think he reflected the dementia that Vincent Price showed, but then Charlton Heston couldn't either (and few actors are capable of that). He did have a range of emotion, though, and that helped considerably in conveying the desolation of the last survivor. What I didn't much care for was the ending. The book and previous films had bleak endings and this one didn't get there. But then it's a new millennium and a new type of ending is fashionable for this era, or so it seems. The inclusion of the dog was nice, and the infected dogs."
"MrGKB","6","1","3","14 December 2007"," An interesting update of ""The Omega Man""...
","...which is to say, ""I Am Legend"" no more hews to the Richard Matheson novel on which it's based than its early 70s predecessor did, beyond the basic premise of the last man on earth trying to survive the aftermath of a catastrophic plague to which he is immune while doggedly attempting to find a cure, but this Will Smith vehicle offers much to satisfy an audience jaded by cinematic visions of apocalypse. Director Francis ""Constantine"" Lawrence presents a fully realized urban wasteland of near-future New York City, thanks to superb art direction, production design & set decoration (much of it provided by the core design talents of ""Constantine"") and flawless camera work by Andrew ""King Kong/LotR"" Lesnie. In that respect, ""I Am Legend"" is a marvel to behold. Likewise, Smith's performance as Robert Neville is a quantum step above his typical characterizations, and an equal pleasure to watch. Who'da thunk this desolate, beleaguered man was once the fresh prince of anything?<br/><br/>Less pleasurable, though, is the story (although changing the dog to a faithful companion and link to the past was a strong plus), which overlooks most of the psychological/philosophical concerns of the novel, in favor of raw survivalism and blockbuster-style action, primarily in the third act. Writers Mark ""Poseidon"" Protosevich and Akiva ""The DaVinci Code"" Goldsman (who also produced) have again removed the vampirism from Neville's antagonists. This time around, the plague survivors are psychotic mutants, incapable of speech, eliminating all subtlety of interplay between Neville and his opposition. Conflict is reduced to kill or be killed, without a hint of negotiation, very much a page torn from the ""28 Days Later..."" playbook. I'll not spoil the ending, other than to mention that Protosevich and Goldsman turn the meaning of the title on its head, a complete reversal from the novel. If purists thought the ending of Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"" was sacrilege, fans of Matheson's novel have it even worse.<br/><br/>As of this writing, ""I Am Legend"" is sporting a ridiculous 70% ""10"" rating here on the IMDb, which will undoubtedly sink like a rock once Joe Sixpack weighs in. It'll be interesting to see just how fast that descent occurs. The opening-day midnight crowd I saw the film with seemed to enjoy themselves, but there was no applause when it ended. ""I Am Legend"" isn't the travesty that ""I, Robot"" was, but I suspect that Will Smith ought to avoid headlining movies that start with ""I..."""

","I Am Legend (2007) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>First there was The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price, then Charlton Heston was The Omega Man and now we have Will Smith as the last man on Earth who soon realizes that he's not alone and something deadly is out there after him. This third version of the story is without question the best and what was most shocking is how dark, bleak and at times depressing this film is. The screenplay is incredibly smart and tries a lot and accomplishes most of what it sets out to do. the film goes down someone during the final act when it turns into an all out action film but everything leading up to that point is rather suspenseful, intelligent and very well made. The opening shots of New York city deserted are haunting and this is something really missing from the earlier versions. This version really gives you the sense that Smith really is the last man on Earth. There's a haunting tone running throughout the movie about being alone in this world and it's quite brilliantly done. A lot of the credit has to go to the screenplay and director Lawrence but the real key here is Will Smith who gives the best performance of his career. I found Smith's performance here a lot better than his two Oscar nominated roles in Ali and The Pursuit of Happiness. Smith is downright terrific in the scenes where he's trying to cope with being alone and his relationship with his dog is very touching. The scenes of him talking to the mannequins are also very well done. I'm not a fan of CGI but I think the effects here are very good and that includes the creatures. I'm sure more human monsters would have had its benefits but I enjoyed what they did with them here none the less. As I said, I think the film runs out of gas in the end when the brains get pushed aside for the muscle but this is still a highly enjoyable film with a lot going for it."

It starts exactly like The Quiet Earth and at first I thought it was a remake. Then the zombies from 28 Days Later decide to mate with the ones in Resident Evil and ruin what could have been a beautiful ending to the human race. But then something horrible happens: the zombies kill Will Smith's dog! It all goes downhill from there and, unfortunately, the human race survives. But would you really want to survive a world without Will Smith?<br/><br/>Bottom line: great special effects, Will Smith plays great, but the story doesn't really say anything. And taking into consideration that a sequel is planned in 2010 and about three video games in between, it all seems more like a money franchise than an honest attempt to make a movie that does say anything.

The story about a man who supposedly is the only survivor of a deadly virus that left a deserted New York City, tries to find a cure for those who survived and are infected and transformed to a strange kind of zombies, is good and interesting, although it left me some doubts. Will Smith's performance is very good, he has a lot of mood changes, he can be funny one moment and immediately he turns serious and then he turns sad, he is a very versatile actor.

At night, though, he locks himself up and listens as the vampires overrun the city.<br/><br/>However, the movie is not about the vampires. The movie is really about Robert Neville, a man desperately hoping for contact with the outside world. Its about his character, the way he copes with everyday, and his strong-willed mission to find a cure for the vampires. But things aren't so easy for Neville; accidents happen, and Robert Neville does encounter them on several occasions, and these encounters are rather intense.<br/><br/>A common criticism of the movie is the look of the vampires. I'll admit, they aren't scary and don't have the best special effects, but the main focus with them is suspense and surprise, which is done really good. Although the surprise is a little overdone; the movie is filled with pop-up moments, which to me, is not real suspense. I don't mind an occasional pop-up, but there are many in this film. However, these are my only complaints for the first and second act, and these are minor. My main problem is the third act.<br/><br/>The third act is where it really strays from the book (I never read the book but already know the ending). The third act includes a lot more humor (which is funny, but a bit out of place), less humanization, and a showdown that isn't very climatic. It culminates in disappointment, and suddenly ends. The entire resolution is done in a 30-second voice over, and this movie deserved a much better ending. It feels like its not supposed to be over yet, and my friend and I both agreed that it was like we were just watching the movie and someone pulled the plug and says ""Ok, the movie is over. Bye."" It was extremely disappointing. I didn't even know it was going to end until the voice over came.<br/><br/>This movie could've been great had the third act stuck to the book (I like the book's ending better), and the ending wouldn't have disappointed. Will Smith does a great job of adding elements of sadness where it is needed and really fleshes out the character, Robert Neville. I even have to say the dog was great; it seemed human because it was really the only other character, and I like their interpretation of Sam rather than the books. But that doesn't excuse the decaying third act. 7.4/10"

","What is it with Hollywood? Why can't you read a great book and think ""This would make a great movie exactly as it is - there's no need to change a thing""? With that in mind I wonder if Francis Lawrence ever bothered to read the book ""I am legend"", and (assuming he did) if he understood the meaning of the words 'I am legend' at the end, because if his film reveals his understanding of this great work of science fiction - and its final few lines - then God help him when he tries to understand something a little more complex, such as the operation of his kettle. He must spend hours in the kitchen waiting for the water to boil, only it never will because he hasn't plugged the thing into the wall.<br/><br/>The one saving grace of this film (and I never thought I would say this) is Will Smith's acting, which - as a portrayal of a man completely and utterly alone and going gradually insane - is actually believable.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything else about this film made me want to weep with frustration and beat the director to within an inch of his life with a paperback copy of the book this film claims to represent."

Even when that was well developed, watching the movie was like reading a newspaper through, from the date at first page to the jokes at the last one. If you expect to watch some action, this movie is not for you. Special effects are OK. Other than that I'm bond to say that performance of every actor and actress is very clean, no flaws on that side. But if you can't restrain a yawning don't worry too much, you are not alone.

I mean it's the usual guy alone, trying to save the world, there is a dog (yeah! at least the dog doesn't make it!), there is a woman and an impossible love, and there is your average useless kid which of course survives. This has so been seen before 100,000 times... And the end, my god... I thought Jesus was going to open the gates of the colony...<br/><br/>2/ an insult to THE BOOK (you know that paper thing that takes more than 5 minutes to read and which sometimes contains words you don't even know). Yes the book... and an insult to the author. The original book is all about the legend of vampires and how the only survivor becomes the legend of men in the eyes of the now dominating vampires. The main character Neville is never afraid of vampires, he fights them but there is no fear, only anger and sadness. It is also a story about betrayal and false hopes.

","I was very taken with this movie, when it first started, i couldn't take my eyes off the screen! Smith's acting is brilliant in this movie and you cant help but feel for him. also Sam (the dog) is just as good and is (strangely) a real asset to the movie. The loneliness is so abundant in the movie, and you can see how this takes its toll on the 'Neville'. This film is possibly one of the most touching films I have seen in a long time, and is original in comparison to other zombie genre films.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as we begin to get nearer to the end of the movie, I was let down. Important aspects of the film seemed to be ignored, and i found myself getting frustrated about how these weren't explained fully. If you are going to watch a 'gore fest' I don't think this is really your thing - it is a much more emotional style of horror. Shame about the zombies in it also, as they are incredibly poorly done - terribly fake lol<br/><br/>oh and on a last note - any real fans of will smith will be pleasantly surprised in the early moments of the film as we see him work out and get all hot and sweaty lol *drool*"

"sadik35","10","1","4","5 January 2008"," i am legend rocks
","This by far was one of the greatest films of 2007. I just loved it. The thrills, the action, the direction and to top it all Will Smith's best performance to date. Here in this film we have a post apocalyptic NYC and Robert Nevill( Will Smith) is the only man accompanied by his pet dog Sam. We have indeed heard most plots like these yet this movie goes far above the likes of 28 days or weeks later and i'm a big fan of those movies yet I like I am legend way better. Of course 28 days or weeks later has better thrills, more gore, better monsters and high octane scenes. Yet ( i can't believe a big fan of gore is saying this) I am legend is deeply emotional and focuses on its main character largely and the authenticity of a post apocalyptic world. But the best thing that I loved about this movie is that Will Smith's performance was pure brilliance. I only wished they could award him with an Oscar. Because he carried this film so well with great emotional performances and give a new definition to the post apocalyptic era. By far THIS IS THE BEST AND I MEAN IT. THE BEST POST APOCALYPT HORROR, DRAMA MOVIE EVER."
"stormlord-2","9","1","4","5 January 2008"," Fantastic
","I went into I Am Legend expecting to like this film. Being a big fan of the 70's version with Charlton Heston The Omega Man I was hoping that this version would hold up as well. I wasn't disappointed. Will Smith does a fantastic job of portraying a man trying to survive in a world gone mad. His performance is even grander when you consider that he has to carry almost the entire film single handed. Almost 90% of this movie is with Smith on his own with no one to talk to but his dog. <br/><br/>OK the zombies looked a bit CGI but CGI creatures never look as real as solid creatures, and OK the ending is a little soppy, a bit like the ending of Blade Runner but overall this is one great film. The scene where Smith has to put his dog down, his only friend left in the world after she is infected with the virus is truly heartbreaking. It;s good to see that Hollywood can still produce fine films when it puts it's mind to it.<br/><br/>I am Legend, 9 out of 10."
"Robert_duder","8","1","4","4 January 2008"," Controversial and intense but no matter what you think of the film...Will Smith delivers a powerhouse performance
","The reason to see this film is very simple...one of the greatest performances this year PERIOD. Will Smith. As always I will go into more detail about his performance but it has to be said right from the top that this film is all about and revolves around the performance of Will Smith and he is absolutely phenomenal. I have seen a lot of films this year (approximately 150 to date) and Will Smith might have the best performance of the year. He should but sadly won't get an Oscar nomination from this performance. The brilliance of I Am Legend is that so much of the first half of the film focuses on subjecting us to his life. This is a man who has been robbed of all human contact and literally is left to feel like he is the last man alive. It's not focused on or suggested in the film directly that he is the last man alive because he isn't and I don't think he or the viewers believe that but his isolation is unlike anything we've ever seen. We get a good hard look at his existence not just in one or two days but every day, day in and out and his survival and instinct, and his entertainment, his family, his life...everything and it just grips you because ultimately at least the first three quarters of the film is literally a one man show and I'm not sure anyone could carry it the way Will Smith does.<br/><br/>Not much of a cast to speak which means I can spend more time on the focus of the film...did I mention him? Will Smith plays survivor Robert Neville and completely draws you into his character. He's tough and ruthless in order to survive but so emotionally distraught, lonely and his performance is just moving and completely enthralling, you can't take your eyes off of him. It might be his best performance and he has had some amazing ones before this. Alice Braga, and Charlie Tahan, make a small performance towards the end but nothing significant. I'm not sure I've ever done this before but I MUST give honorable mention to Abby, the Canine pooch that plays Samantha. Kudos to her trainers and to her because she becomes such a viable character and takes you and Smith through such a range of emotions. It's possibly one of the most important roles by an animal ever. Compare her to Wilson from Castaway...only alive.<br/><br/>It is very fortunate for the makers of this film that Will Smith did the job he did because the package around him is not terrific. It's not bad but it has many flaws and part of the problem might be the lack of experience from director Francis Lawrence, who comes from a music video background. The problem with this is music video directors have this habit of feeling the need to cram all the story into the smallest possible package and use cheap special effects as though they were still working in the eighties with White Snake and I Am Legend is the perfect example. The very first scene where we see the 'monsters' as Neville approaches them and shines the light inadvertently on them is downright creepy and disturbing but from then on the 'monsters' look cheesy and ridiculous. The CGI is poor at best and as scary as they are...they look fake and cartoon-y and it ruins the atmosphere of the film completely. The story is good but just some of the small details like the special effects really make the actual film 'just okay.' However the world they create...the New York City presented after this breakout is breath taking and disturbing and silent and ominous and it's really something to see because it feels so real. No matter what the package presents itself as...and unfortunately it's a very short film...the amazing thing about I Am Legend is that the great is REALLY great and makes it a must see movie and something I want to watch again and again. Please see it and enjoy the great things about it and move past the small errors they made. 8.5/10"
"perttu_hartikainen","7","1","4","2 January 2008"," Exceptional, slightly underrated thriller
","I Am Legend tells the story of a scientist named Robert Neville. He is living in New York City, where a chemical virus, first believed to cure cancer, secondly found causing dangerous mutation and cannibalistic and violent behavior in humans it infects, broke out. After the failed evacuation of New York City, Neville (who is somehow immune to the virus) continues living all alone in New York, probably in the whole world, trying to find a cure at the same time when the infected mutants are stalking him in the shadows waiting for him to make a fatal mistake...<br/><br/>This film has almost everything that most of the modern day horror movies do not have. First of all, REAL suspense. My heart was pounding from the first minute of the movie all the way to the final showdown between Robert Neville and the infected New York citizens. <br/><br/>Secondly, Will Smith gives us here one of his best movie performances. In the scene where his dog, Samantha, runs after a deer into a dark, rotten building where the infected (later called ""Dark Seekers"") are living during the day, the fear on Will's face is incredibly amazing. I was completely shocked and I could barely breath during that scene, and only because of the fantastic performance Will gives us.<br/><br/>Thirdly, director Francis Lawrence (also the director of ""Constantine"") does a very good job with this one. The filming of the deserted locations in the city gives us a shivery feeling about being the last man on earth. It makes us thinking, ""What if it was me who should lock all the doors and windows during the night? What if I should have to listen the growling of those creepy mutants outside?"" Very effective.<br/><br/>The only reason why I didn't give this movie more stars, is the ending, that has been used too many times. ""A man dedicated his life to find a cure, and he gave his life to protect it."" An overused ending, but still better than the alternate ending, which after seeing I was happy with the real one.<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" is really an exceptional horror/thriller film with it's pure scariness which almost reaches the level of the 1978 classic ""Halloween"". It contains amazing direction and acting. It may be slightly cliché, but it has more perfectness than averageness. 8 out of 10 stars."
"rabksaj","8","1","4","2 January 2008"," disappointing
","i found this film disappointing cause its a short film and as soon as you get in to the mood of it it is all over. Neville's hideout is meant to be impregnable and he has metal shutters every where on his building but why he had to use the explosives outside his compound to ward of the creatures i don't understand it. earlier whilst he is sleeping in the bath with his dog the dark seekers can be heard shrieking outside perhaps pounding on the protective shutters. i did not mind the c.g.i. effects only the length of the movie had been about 20 min longer it would of been good if the story was explained more.like i said i wish it had been longer and i did not feel that feeling of loneliness or sorry for the character. the lab basement scene really ruined it cause that glass is meant to be really tough and how did them zombies get in it was meant to be a secure area."
"Aaron1375","9","1","4","1 January 2008"," Good movie, but man I was depressed afterwords.
","Yes, this movie has a bit of ""the Omega Man"" and ""The last man on Earth"" in it, but for the most part it is its own movie. It starts out with the world in ruins, well New York in ruins and you are introduced to Robert Neville who may be the last man on earth. You are also introduced to Sam his faithful German Shepard, which struck a chord with me as I used to own one of those myself and love that particular breed. You get to see how he spends a typical day in his life and you also are introduced to those things that lurk in the darkness and only come out at night. However, at this stage those that come out at night seem to be targeting our hero. So we have some good chase scenes, and some good action, but you also have a couple of scenes that are really depressing especially if you like dogs. Our hero is not alone for the entire picture, however, as he comes across a lady and her son, well they kind of come across him. There are also flashbacks detailing the beginning of the end of civilization. The creatures are different than those in Omega Man and Last Man too as they are more like that infected from 28 days later though they do share the pale traits of the omega ones. All in all a good movie that left me depressed."
"poolandrews","6","1","4","1 January 2008"," Not too bad at all.
","I Am Legend is set in the near future where Lieutenant Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the last man alive in New York City, some years previous a cure for cancer designed by scientist Dr. Krippen (an uncredited Emma Thompson) mutated into a deadly airborne virus that has wiped most of humanity out. The only people left are either those few who are immune like Neville or those who have been transformed into zombie like creatures who feed on flesh & blood, seemingly alone in the world Neville scrapes out an existence as he tries to find an antidote for the virus & save humanity from being wiped out completely...<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Lawrence this was the big Hollywood blockbuster for Christmas 2007, I must admit I liked it more than I thought I was going to but the ending spoiled it for me after an impressive opening two thirds. The script by Mark Protosevich & producer Akvia Goldsman was based on the 1954 novel of the same name by Richard Matheson & is the third time the book has been adapted into a feature film along with The Last Man on Earth (1964) & The Omega Man (1971) neither of which I have seen, anyway back to I Am Legend & there are significant changes to the original source material including the ending which I will get to in good time. I have to say that I enjoyed I Am Legend more than I though I would & it isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination but after a wonderfully atmospheric opening two thirds where Will Smith spends his day wasting time & having fun in a deserted New York & dodging zombies at night. In that respect it felt like a much bigger scale Dawn of the Dead (1978) which is no bad thing at all but then the woman & her kid show's up at which point it goes downhill, ignores the original book by Matheson & ends in a overly sentimental happy ending, the woman & kid are used to further the plot rather than enhance it in my opinion. Most of the story unfolds via Neville's personal blog & a few flashbacks, it gives little bits of information at a time which keeps the plot going. At less than 100 minutes (does anyone actually sit through all the end credits?) it moves along at a nice pace, it's never what you would call boring & it tells a reasonable story well enough. I Am Legend is pretty much a one character film & it lives or dies by the fact if you like Neville or not, luckily Will Smith does a good job of giving him personality & the writing is solid too.<br/><br/>Director Lawrence does a fine job here, some of the shot's of a deserted overgrown New York look spectacular. There's a real sense of atmosphere, isolation & helplessness as Will Smith searches for a cure. The zombies look like those from 28 Days/Weeks Later as they run around like they are on steroids screaming their heads off, the main problem I have with them is that they are all entirely CGI computer effects generated & some of the CGI is really poor. I don't understand why they didn't use real actor's made up as zombies I really don't, it would have looked much better & scarier. Most of the horror film clichés are present & correct, you know like people &/or animals jumping out of shadows from the edge of the screen & that sort of thing. The gore & violence is minimal so don't worry about that.<br/><br/>Technically the film is very well made expect for some really poor CGI computer effects. Shot on location in New York the filmmakers apparently shut down whole streets & sections at a time which probably p*ssed all the native New Yorkers off big time. The acting is good but since there's only really two people in it this is one aspect that should be.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a good solid sci-fi, horror, thriller, action type big budget Hollywood blockbuster film that was better than I expected, I don't know whether to give it a 6 or a 7 out of 10. I think I'll go for a 6 since I'm not keen on the ending at all & spoils much of what happened previously."

She couldn't sleep all night, she cried in the movie theater and everything! I feel that the commercials should've forewarned me that it was a horror movie!! I wouldn't have wasted my money on such a thing. The ending was absolutely horrible. Not so much with the Christianinty, (I think that was a good part), but with Will dying. Why did the hero have to die. IT COULD'VE BEEN A BETTER ENDING. I am currently studying filmaking myself and i am deeply disappointed with the outcome of the movie. I agree with the other commenter, Will shouldve woken up the almost cured zombie and she could've talked to the other zombies. And his family's outcome was also a major disappointment. Why did they have to die!!!! This movie is very disturbing, confusing, and sad. I wouldn't advise my worst enemy to see this movie.

I must say, I wasn't expecting such a tear-jerking drama with this film, I thought it would be much more action orientated, but thrill seekers will be disappointed with this film if thats all they have come for.<br/><br/>The basic story is that of Smith being the last man on earth, as a result of a deadly virus, along with his dog Sam. Smith is striving to find a cure for this, and along the way encounters emotional events. Though I say this is very much a drama, it still contains hints of humour, action and sometimes jumpy moments.<br/><br/>Overall a well above average film, and if superb acting is what you look for in a film then you must see this, and if it isn't, then still go to watch it the emotional story involves the viewer and engrosses them in the film.<br/><br/>8/10"

There is not so much story to tell but the director solved that problem well showing the life of a man that lives alone in a huge desert city.

","Francis Lawrence, the director of Constantine brings us the futuristic, science-fiction thriller I Am Legend starring Academy Award nominee Will Smith. Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville, a scientist living in a dissolute New York City trying to develop the cure to the virus that wiped out the entire world population and left him immune.<br/><br/>There isn't much that can be said about the picture rather than Will Smith gives his most brave portrayal to date and places him as one of the most talented actors working today. As the film will gain much comparisons to Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away starring Tom Hanks, this film holds no measure. As Neville tries to develop this cure by day, at night he must flee and hide from something dark and demented hiding in the shadows. These ""creatures"" are a little cheesy and even more corny as the special effects seem rushed and unrewarding.<br/><br/>The first ¾ of the picture are engaging as we follow Smith around the jungle-like New York City and brought into flash backs of the end of days over three years ago. The ending is very sour in taste and unrealistic in actions. I have an imagination as much as the next person but some things just bother the viewer when we're watching an event unfold that seems witless.<br/><br/>Consequently, it's Will Smith the is the revelation and fantastic to watch.

"Sazaku13","10","1","4","19 December 2007"," I Am Legend
","If you don't cry, you are heartless. If you don't get scared, you are fearless. If you are Will Smith, you are legend. It currently holds a record of ""the best-ever December opening weekend with $76.5 million USD of domestic box-office sales1"" which even topped Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Based on the amazing novel by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend is one of the greatest Sci-Fi Thriller movies to date.<br/><br/>Dr. Alice Crippen (played by Emma Thompson) reveals over a TV interview that she has cured 10,009 cancer patients by engineering a virus to become helpful to humans rather than harmful. The scene cuts off and we are now looking at Manhattan, New York, three years later. A little emptier than it is today, not a person in sight, hardly any cars, only ones parked on the street. A Mustang GT500 speeds through the deserted streets, Dr. Robert Neville (played by Will Smith) and his dog, Sam, drive around Times Square hunting for foodone of his daily routines. We watch Neville pretend he's living in a regular world, cooking dinner for himself in an apron, listening to music, washing his dog in a bathtub, then he closes up, locks all doors and windows with extra protection, and goes to sleep. Then, he suddenly has a flashback. He remembers a piece of the past, back when he and his family had to evacuate Manhattan. Pieces of this flashback occur throughout the movie to help us understand the horrific day that haunts Dr. Neville, and push him forward to finding a cure.<br/><br/>The entire first third of the movie engages the audience into this fictional future, and we learn all about the characters (or character in this case) and atmosphere. The middle is filled with confusion, mystery, and sadness. Robert Neville falls down the pyramid of life's needs, and is struggling to crawl back up in the third half, filled with anger, depression, and fear. During all of this, the audience is riding a roller-coaster that features every emotion: anticipation, comfort, happiness, sadness, laughter, fear, depression, joy, disgust, love, vulnerability, and relief. Out of all the movies based on the original novel, The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man, and I Am Legend, although The Last Man on Earth may be the closest to the plot of the novel, I Am Legend provides us with what a movie should. It has amazing computer graphics without overdoing it, minimal use of background music in the best possible way, and outstanding acting by Will Smith. This movie is legendary."
"BuckminsterFievre","9","1","4","18 December 2007"," Um, the bridges?
","I haven't been a big Will Smith fan  even if I did enjoy his MIB and Independence Day gigs.<br/><br/>I was also a wee bit put out about this shameless efforts to get Will's kids cast in his films. But then, virtually everyone working in film and TV these days is related to someone, someone's college roommate, or something ... aren't they? Maybe Will's up-front approach is just surprisingly honest.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie was far better than I expected. I liked the Omega Man for the sheer schlockiness of it. But Legend took the same source material, cut out the non-sense, added much scarier 'monsters', and imbued it all with actual meaning and sensitivity.<br/><br/>That said, can someone explain how Anna and Ethan drove on, then off, Manhattan? I mean the tunnels were flooded and the bridges were intentionally bombed to quarantine the island. Did she have a private ferry? Big water wings for the product-placed Ford SUV?"

","Before seeing this film I was iffy about if it would be good or whether it would just be another end of the world action movie. It is actually quite the contrary. This movie is full of emotional scenes AND scenes that will have have you on the edge of your seat. From the start of the movie you'll be wondering why will smith is alone and you will find out why in the film. Your heart will pound in your chest as you follow Smith through an eerily quit times square. I'm not about to ruin the film but it does a good job of explaining why Smith is the only person walking around. As you follow Smith through the film you will learn not only about why the city seems so empty but you also get go deeper into his mind and learn about him. This movie is about that person who is alone in this world and just looking for a special friend. Luckily Smith is that person and its a hell of a good time watching Smith deal with his surrounds. In the end I think you'll have gone through enough different emotions to appreciate that person sitting next you in the theater."
"doomgaurd","8","1","4","17 December 2007"," My 2 Cents
","The movie is yet another concept of humans changing into monsters due to some maltreatment. The movie spins around no one else but Will Smith (Dr.Robert Neville) and his Dog (Samantha). Apart from these two you can see some savage ugly and nasty monsters who lurk in the dark and hence the name Dark Seekers.<br/><br/>Though the movie is around Robert Neville, who appears in all the scenes you would not find the movie boring as Will Smith has put all his acting skills and made sure the folks watching it wont get bored. Kudos Will.<br/><br/>The movie wont be much of a surprise and a new story for the dudes who are fans of the Resident Evil series but it is still worth the money.<br/><br/>The point to notice for the Resident Evil fans is that the Monsters in this movie are not as dumb as the T virus struck folks. The Dudes have lost their basic survival instinct but still they work as a clan. They are a pretty scary bunch. They can think,plot and also have a leader. Thats new. These intelligent dumb monsters make the movie more interesting. Can watch the movie twice...but it depends on your views...<br/><br/>If you are a SAW or any other movie where there is a lot of blood..then this movie definitely wont satisfy your primal instincts. The movie is pretty scary though...not frightening.<br/><br/>Let me...see....thats it...go ahead...and watch the movie...Its good...8.0/10"
"VelvetDown27","10","1","4","16 December 2007"," I Am Legend
","I Am Legend takes zombie movies in a great direction. It shows fear, but no so much through horror and gore but with reality. One of the things that really scares me is the fact that something like this could really happen. People could get infected with viruses and they can spread and a lot of things can come out wrong. This movie shows us that side of horror. Almost every scary movie goes for the cheap scare, you're pretty much expecting it but this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. There's emotion, drama, laughter, terror and action, what more could you want. Very well written and Will Smith's acting is great and flawless, by far one of the best this year in any movie. One of the really scary things is seeing NYC empty.... when are you ever gonna see that?<br/><br/>***SPOILER*** The mannequin, Fred, did move. Just looking at that scared me, now imagine the whole film. ***END***<br/><br/>Overall great movie... 10 out of 10"
"uferum","9","1","4","16 December 2007"," Very Entertaining and a Must See
","Probably one of the best Will Smith movies I've seen. Excellent acting and cinematography, and I give Mr. Smith an A+ for his performance, and ability to carry the movie through the first hour or so without another actor being present.<br/><br/>The only thing that kept me from giving it a ""10"" was a couple of plot holes, and the choices the director/writers made during production. For example: SPOILER ALERT: I would rather have seen the ""zombies/mutants"" as more human in the sense they would be capable of dialogue and not just horrific screaming. Also...I hate it when the ""creatures"" in movies like this one get superhuman powers just because they mutated. They shouldn't be able to run 100 mph or scale walls like an insect.<br/><br/>2nd SPOILER ALERT: Will lost his family and then he had to lose his dog too??? The other common thread with these types of movies, is that the poor dog usually gets ""it"" due to some bad decision made by the lead character. My advice...Will Smith's character was too clever to get duped by a stupid zombie and a mannequin. It ended up costing him the best friend he had in the whole world, and I hated that.<br/><br/>Otherwise...an exceptionally well done movie that kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire two hours. Kudos to Will Smith as one of the best actors of our time!!!"

","This movie is just pure gold. Based on the 1950's novel of the same name, it follows the struggle of scientist Robert Neville to develop a cure for a viral infection that spread across the world. The story is very riviting, and will have you jump, sweat and even cry. Will Smith gives an amazing performance. Add flashbacks, suspense, and a subvision of peace and happiness. Spoiler coming- The best scene in this movie is with Robert having to kill his beloved German Shepard after she became infected. This is probably the best film this year, because it has something other big films don't have: a heart and a soul. You are afraid for the characters and are amazed at SPOILER Roberts sacrifice to save the world. Overall, Will Smith deserves a Oscar for his performance."

The number one thing i enjoyed about this movie was seeing what it would be like to have a whole city to yourself. They could have added more scenes of Will Smith's character going around New York exploring buildings and performing other methods of entertainment. But i left the movie satisfied and didn't regret it. However, i work at the theater and do not pay for my tickets. <br/><br/>If you want to spend $10 to see a movie, let it be this one."
"dfranzen70","8","1","4","15 December 2007"," Wonderful Smith, well-directed thriller
","Anyone familiar with Richard Matheson's story about the last man to survive a massive worldwide plague will have very little to complain about regarding this newest adaptation, with Will Smith as the slightly crazed Dr. Robert Neville, the harried former military doctor who's been waiting for signs of other survivors for three long years.<br/><br/>Every day, Neville gather supplies from throughout New York City, and every evening, at dusk, he shutters his abode against the onslaught of zombie creatures that live only in the dark. Well, against those who'd attack if they knew where he lived. Which they don't, really. And Neville has it made, at least in terms of resources. He has generators for electricity, so he can cook his own food (and for his dog, Sam). He has great security. He can watch movies to his heart's content. But after three years, he's more than a little lonely - he's beginning to go crazy. (He's even positioned mannequins in the video store so he can ""converse"" with them each day.) We have a vague idea of what caused 99% of the Earth's population to die, but the movie's more concerned with the aftermath; how Neville survives, and how he lost his family. (Hint: It's not because of the plague.) And this is where the strength of Will Smith comes into play. Until recently, Smith was mostly Action Guy - Independence Day, Bad Boys, I, Robot, and so on - and basically thrived on dopey catch phrases. Good news! There are no catch phrases in this movie. In fact, Smith has to actually emote and act, and damn if he doesn't do an exemplary job. Remember when Tom Hanks chatted up a volleyball? Same sorta thing, only Smith's talking to his German Shepherd; he needs to in order to keep hold of the tenuous gossamer strands of his slippery sanity.<br/><br/>When he's not out gathering provisions and scouting for people, Neville is busy in his basement lab, trying desperately to reverse the virus and cure everyone. I'm not sure about the science angle of this, but since Neville himself is immune, he figures he can inject one of the zombie creatures with his blood, but that doesn't work. So he keeps at it, adding things, taking away things. It's all very scientific.<br/><br/>Smith's beautiful, evocative performance is among the best he's ever given, about on par with the maudlin The Pursuit of Happiness; I Am Legend is an action movie that doesn't smack you over the head every five seconds with, well, more action; it instead builds suspense and then pays off. Multiple times. One reason this works is that director Francis Lawrence employed a hand-held camera during many of the more violent scenes, and it's usually a pretty effective method - it's just that sometimes the zigzagging is a little jarring. Still, not a big problem.<br/><br/>There are some differences between this movie and the original story, but they're not bad differences, exactly; an example of a story being updated while not being demonstrably altered. And here's another plus - although you do get to see the creatures - and they're pretty nasty looking - you don't see them often enough to get used to them, or their hideous screeches, or their no-holds-barred, uninhibited, visceral behavior."
"XrayAtheist","8","1","4","15 December 2007"," Great movie...with a crap Fundie ending.
","I just returned from watching I AM LEGEND with Will Smith.<br/><br/>And although it is only hovering around 60% approval on rottentomatoes.com, I have to say that I was completely engrossed throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>I don't know what some of the critics are complaining about. The movie was frigging creepy, sometimes downright terrifying, and often truly saddening.<br/><br/>Will Smith is better than ever. Gone are the tiresome wise cracks, posturing, and showboating that plague so many of his other films. His character Robert Neville is commandingly portrayed as disaffected, forlorn, scared, persistent, brave, and even borderline insane. And the German Shepherd in the movie is almost as good.<br/><br/>The script, the CGI, and the tempo are almost perfect.<br/><br/>This is a simple story of survival.......ultimate survival, and its costs.<br/><br/>1 hour and 37 minutes out of the 1 hour and 40 minute running time was worthy of inclusion in a Top 25 Films of All Time List.<br/><br/>The ending........the pathetic, religious over toned and fundie acquiesced finale however, is further evidence of Hollywood's total and utter inability to grow some balls and deliver a Big Budget/Blockbuster film that doesn't end.........how can I say it.....""Happily Ever After"".<br/><br/>There were so many other ways a statement could have been made in this film. So many other means by which it could have inflicted deeper impressions. But alas, any grasp or teeth it had is ripped out in the last 3 minutes by a resolution that could only have been test screen approved in Salt Lake City or at the Republican Convention, Go see it......

"barcrab","Null","1","4","15 December 2007"," durable story given good modern treatment here
","This is, as many fans of the Richard Matheson novel should know, the third version of I Am Legend. I suspect it to be the caliber of The Omega Man and a good translation of the novel in the guise of a 2007 society going to waste because of a lethal virus.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence's picture has a great introduction, completely varying every NYC precedent you could imagine. It kicks off the story of Robert Neville, the scientist who believed he could cure a botched cancer antidote that became the ""KV"" virus of the film. Like Price and Heston, he fights off the diseased nocturnally and researches or tries to solve his problem when he has time during the day. <br/><br/>Within the open-ended plot structure are many vignettes, some of which are less interesting than others. I think in terms of character development Neville goes more and more insane trying to find a cure towards the end, which builds the theme of fate because he only really saves every last normal human on Earth in a coincidental moment of realization.<br/><br/>This is rather impressive compared to Constantine, the other Francis Lawrence film but the main weakness is the zombie element--the monsters of the novel appear to have mutated into the creatures of the 28... films and other recent movies with hyperactive night creatures such as these. They don't have any character or anything unique about them, which works for the theme of de-evolution, but the design could have been more bizarre or original.<br/><br/>In terms of cinematic grammar the film is well-shot, but the second unit is kind if blurry due to the CGI used for animals/creatures.<br/><br/>It is enough to say that Will Smith is great and carries the movie like the true movie-star he is, with charisma and conviction in a difficult role that he could not have handled earlier on--it shows how much he has grown as an actor.<br/><br/>Despite all of this the film is most interesting because of its themes and subtle integration of existential or religious complexes within humanity. It is also a generally compelling story of unlikely survival and the element in humans as a whole that lets us surpass the evil we create."
"annoman","7","1","4","15 December 2007"," Smith holds the film together almost single-handedly
","In his sophomore offering, director Francis Lawrence (who debuted with 2005's Constantine) successfully turns Richard Matheson's half-century old sci-fi/horror novel into an enjoyable, truly memorable motion picture. Previously twice undertaken (once in 1964 and again in 1971), and both times ineffectively, Matheson's 1954 classic, I Am Legend, proved to be more than a difficult project. Though I'm sure it was no easier this time around (Warner Bros. has been working on this film for 13 years), Lawrence and his superstar, Will Smith, make strong efforts to hide it.<br/><br/>Smith plays the lead to Matheson's story (a role formerly played by Vincent Price in '64's The Last Man on Earth and Charles Laughton in '71's The Omega Man), a scientist named Robert Neville, perhaps the last human on earth, who roams the desolation that is New York City with his German shepherd three years following the apocalyptic release of a man-made virus.<br/><br/>After losing his family (which includes Smith's real-life daughter, Willow) to the hellish pandemic, Neville sets forth, resilient to find the curehe combines the knowledge and state of his ""immunity"" with slab-top experiments he conducts on its mutated victims. Nevertheless, he's a man tortured by the absence of human life, which is brought to the forefront of his psyche by horrible flashbacks (which are beyond disturbing in their plausibility and wrenching in their effect), and recollections of it. And as the film progresses, we watch as the man's burden takes its toll on him, gradually dragging him into madnessa show that is as saddening as it is well done.<br/><br/>Set in a not-so-distant future world, in which gas prices are nearly $7 per gallon and the ""cure for cancer"" is actually the culprit of the widespread sickness, the film opens with Neville ripping through the Big Apple's vacant streets in his red, white-striped Shelby GT 500, circa 2007, hunting a flock of deer. Subsequently, we learn his strict daily routineexercise, recreation, research, and sleepwhich he maintains for the sake of his sanity and survival.<br/><br/>But what would the last man in the world have to survive from? How about unremitting hordes of veiny, hairless mutantsthe products of the virus that decimated the world's population? Understandably, these villains make for the movie's weakest contribution. They feed into prominent horror-movie zombie clichés (super-human speed and strength) and exhibit abysmal CGI, while thrusting the film into action that undermines its initial intelligence.<br/><br/>But I Am Legend endures its dreadful flaws by staying closer to the original novel than any other cinematic version, by creating an incredible, eerie scene of desertion in the U.S.'s most lively mega-city (perfectly done with grassy, weed-plagued corners and streams of abandoned vehicles), and by casting the inimitable Will Smith to play its focused study Smith delivers an achingly good performance as the lone man, capturing our favor by allowing us into his predicament through delicate expressions of his own fear and yearning for human life. He probably won't be nominated for an Oscar for his role as Neville, but maybe he should. After all, Tom Hanks was for his part in Cast Away, and the only difference between Hanks' Chuck Nolan and Smith's Robert Neville is that Neville is considerably smarter and defies insanity with proactive rituals and physical conditioning (of course, it's to Neville's benefit that he, unlike Nolan, has an abundance of food and spends all of his time with a wonderful pooch, rather than a volleyball). Regardless, Smith does what few actors can: he holds the film together almost single-handedly and manages to keep viewers' attention for close to two hours.<br/><br/>The fact that I Am Legend swings back and forth between two genres is ultimately an advantageous trait, for, though the sci-fi portion is far better, the horror facets instill enough suspense and distribute enough scares to affirm Lawrence's film as one of good quality and massive entertainment."

","As someone who has watched a few stinkers this year I was pleasantly surprised that this move followed through on everything it has promised me from the trailer.<br/><br/>The story and premise were great, the acting from Will Smith was top notch and it didn't drag on for an extra half an hour past it's sell by date like every movie has this year.<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see a little more of the time in between the quarantine of the island and where we picked up with Smith's character - but in terms of story telling I thought it was very well done.<br/><br/>As a very critical person, imagine my wonder when everybody leaving the cinema seemed disappointed with the movie and many of the reviews I have read since have hated it! I can only surmise that it was the non-Hollywood/American ending where Will Smith doesn't kill every bad guy and save the world singlehandedly that lead to this feeling.<br/><br/>I thought the CGI (even the zombies) was out of this world. It has been the only movie this year to catch me, entertain me, tell a story - and the only movie to actually scare me since Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>Go watch it with an open mind, forget the expectation of a high budget movie with a big star and be entertained."
"dmbfan1983","9","1","4","14 December 2007"," A Performance Piece!
","Robert Neville is the last man on earth or is he...? This is the question posed to the viewer throughout the film. Neville(Smith) is left alone in New York City after a virus meant as a cure unleashes a plague on the entire world and pushes the human race to the brink of extinction. The film explores this post apocalyptic world with Neville and his dog Sam as he tries to find a cure to reverse the damage done. A nice mix of genres come together to elevate this beyond the average Christmas time film or blockbuster. Smith's command of the screen shines through and carries us past the monotony that has become Neville's day to day. The only point of real weakness for the film comes in the final act however it avoids typical Hollywood clichés just long enough. By the end the audience welcomes the end as if it were a true story."
"Korrie","9","1","4","14 December 2007"," c'mon people
","Overall, this movie elicited more emotion out of me than I had experienced in a while. The cinematography and set work was stunningly chilling, that aspect alone puts the movie up there on my list. If you are looking for a movie that will make you cry, laugh, jump out of your skin then here is your choice.<br/><br/>A fair warning on all the ""jumpy"" parts thrown in. They are a bit used and abused.<br/><br/>The casting decisions probably couldn't have been matched with any other actor today, or in other words, no one else would have really done it the justice it needed. I was only left wanting more from the CGI work and ""villain"" depiction. It wasn't awful, but I feel that it definitely could have been handled better. Now, if they had taken the villains of 30 Days Of Night, matched them to the plot and background of Legend, then there would be no room for improvement there. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you either way then there aren't many things to pick apart. <br/><br/>The story development carried along and kept me anticipating, although you can see the outlines of how the story might unfold, but certainly not enough to have any reason to pan it. I will say it was the last 30 minutes that really stuck with me, being best topped by the heroic final sequence. I left with chills and tears in my eyes. Yes it is a remake, as were about 4 other versions of the Richard Matheson novel, so that's not enough reason to write this off as the movie scene being dead and unoriginal. Going in there with expectations of seeing a novel directly reincarnated on film is not a realistic and not a good way to go into any movie. I am just beginning the novel now. But, if you don't want to see a movie to see a movie, then stop going to the movies, and hey, maybe you can do it better. I hope all of you who go to see it find it equally as thrilling and thought provoking as I did."

A devastated New York City is the backdrop for the battle of nerves between the sole human survivor and ghoulish cannibalistic zombies. The post-apocalyptic NYC has been brilliantly re-created with an eerie ambiance.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays his character with great intensity and perfection. There are parts in the movie where you will find his idiosyncrasies amusing especially his interaction with inanimate objects.

","I just finished watching I Am Legend, and I gotta say it was pretty damn good. It had it's flaws for sure but the only thing for flaws i could really think of is the fact that there should have been a little bit more story and maybe a slight variation on the ending. I was waiting to see this movie for a long time and it didn't disappoint; it has a very nice blend action, drama, comedy, suspense. I think Will Smith did an amazing acting job in this movie, very conviencing. Will Smith's performance is definitely Oscar worthy (at least a nomination), not the movie itself necessarily but his performance for sure. Definitely worth the movie ticket either way.

"tearjerker08","8","1","4","14 December 2007"," Legend's a Notch Above
","As amusing as Will Smith putzing around an abandoned New York City, doing things that you've daydreamed of like picking any random car and driving it around the city or golfing at skyscrapers, or as frightening the shocks Francis Lawrence shows us at just a pace to keep your nails dug into the seat, what sets this apart from say 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead, is the humanistic quality among the chaos. I loved the two afore mentioned films, because they were scary and a lot of fun, but I Am Legend offers that with genuine moments that will tug and pull on your heart, and make you feel a way that most zombie movies aren't going to make you feel. I'd like to give a large portion of that credit to Will Smith. If you've seen Ali, and Pursuit of Happiness, you know what a magnetic force Will Smith has turned out to be on the screen. The intensity he paints across the screen, showing us his frustration, pain and loneliness all the while being a hero along side an Indiana Jones. Francis Lawrence who previously directed Constantine, shows his affinity for shock shot direction, pacing the action so you never know when somethings going to jump out at you. Sometimes it's just cheap, and sometimes it's genius. He's a very talented director that I think will take up the camera for several more action/horror/blockbluster movies just as I Am Legend and Constantine (side not, I didn't like Constantine although I thought Lawrence's direction was good for it, but he's improved here.) If the zombie's look a little less than authentic after a while you might consider that a flaw in the whole movie. Don't hesitate to see it if you get the chance. I am telling you, I am Legend doesn't disappoint."

Just like The Last Man on Earth (1964), when, of course, with the last man trying to survive the new dreadful earth. That is filled with some kind of monstrous being. I was amazed that the movie took place in 2012. Which is remarkable, because Nostradamous (a famous prophet) wrote that the world will end in 2012. Will Smith is a perfect match to his character, and I even appreciate that this character was given some human effect. I say this because, in these kind of movies the characters are always heroic and fearless. But this character is a normal man who lives with his dog. I special effects were well done and I like the way New York was portrayed. It was a empty ruin, with grass growing tall and objects stable. There are movies were the ""ghost"" city is just (I guess) empty. So, the setting was perfectly matched, along with the actor. I this movie, real life connections were established. The connection with Bob Marley and cancer. Furthermore, I hate when people title this movie a ""zombie movie."" It is a ""zombie"" movie, but the difference is that it uses the ""zombies"" to be more of a mutated 'human.' Anyway, the movie matches drama and horror at the same time. A complete top of your seat thriller."

I personally rated it an 8 out of 10 because it had all the keys to a good film and I think people will enjoy it.<br/><br/>The theater was the most packed I have ever seen since the opening night of ""Superbad"". There were barely any seats left. This movie does live up to its hype and it is worth your time and money if you are looking for a thrill and an interesting look on the world if it were really to end. It makes the average person think a little outside the box."

","I just got out of ""I Am Legend"". It was fantastic, Will Smith made a spectacular performance. However, the overall them of the movie got me thinking. Human race dies out right? Throughout time so many species have died off of ""this"" or ""that"" either infectious disease's, or astronomical event. However, humans have created so many things that are causing our odds of survival to diminish at an alarming rate. Global Warming, Aids, Cancer, etc.... There are so many things that plague the mere existence of the human race. Yet, some how we manage to survive. In closing I believe everyone should listen to the song ""Hide And Seek"" written/produced/performed by Imogean Heap. One will find the relevance of her lyrics, sychronizing the theme of this movie."

","Well, I've never read the book. So,I can't be sure how good the movie is according to the book. However, I was impressed by the acting. As far as I've seen, this is Will Smith's first thriller move. I, Robot was not a thriller. So don't tell me that. I was happy with the movie, however the ending could have been better. Such as, I think... Ana and Ethan crawl out of the fire grate after daybreak, Ana holds out the vial of the female's blood (who I have so fondly dubbed Lisa). And the camera pans over the remnants of the house, and The Infected, the head Infected (fondly dubbed Bob) has is mouth open in a silent scream. His eyes snap open and his so wonderful scream sounds, while the vile is dropped at this sudden sound. The vial shatters."

","major spoilers, so please only for film makers, critics & those who have seen it.<br/><br/>i wonder if this movie won't do so good for this reason... i was pretty disappointed in the zombies, how they moved, what they did, and how many are actually depicted on screen. in new york city, the zombie scenes show no more than 30ish zombies? <br/><br/>i'm a 'christiany' kind of guy so i appreciated the hopeful ending but wonder if critics will pander that. which is not the disappointing aspect. this is: there is this epic setting, NYC! and i was expecting some Return of the King kind of return. but nope.<br/><br/>the small gang of zombies moved like the cg monsters in Van Helsing. too fast, too cg, too spider mannish. so they weren't as biting or gritting as 28 days/weeks or zac's dawn of the dead.<br/><br/>they were rendered with too many layers of soft focus, glistening, vein layers, etc... so they looked more ultra real and lit etc then the hero. when one shows up and a huge awkward skip over was when the 'main' or 'leader' zombie set a trap for the hero. that seemed like a HUGE turning point in story, yet was glossed over.<br/><br/>its a good film. but again, no Return of the King pay off, in a Return of the King setting. so its not a great film."

I wanted more from the story, it was too short, but the plus, it was realistic, as far as mutated monsters are concerned.<br/><br/>I like how Smith's character was realistic, unlike many movies these days, he actually has a gun and uses it! I love the fact that he was hunting for his own food. However, I wish it would have shown more of his survival techniques. The movie was over way too soon, but the resolution was good enough, I don't see a sequel worth making.<br/><br/>I wish he would have went up one of the taller buildings in New York so we could have seen some more views of the wrecked city."
"Jeen","9","1","4","14 December 2007"," A big budget, character-driven movie that WORKS.
","Having read Richard Matheson's original novel I AM LEGEND, I was curious to see how this third film adaptation would fare (the two previous versions were THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and THE OMEGA MAN).<br/><br/>**Spoilers** Does this film work? Yes. Is it good? Yes--quite good in fact, and better than the first two films. No, it is not an exact adaptation of Matheson's novel--don't go in expecting that (for one, the location in the film is New York City, not Los Angeles as in the novel; Neville is a white male in the book. But both Nevilles do end up meeting their Maker, if you know what I mean).**End spoilers**<br/><br/>What you will see is a tense, downbeat, occasionally funny and at times all-out scary character piece. Will Smith puts in an excellent performance as Robert Neville, who is trying to survive, a man who might very well be the last man on Earth following a horrific plague that has wiped out billions and has left many as vampire-like monsters. Neville is immune, but his routine is to stave of something else--the slowly dawning madness of being totally, utterly alone.<br/><br/>There is another more important character in the film--New York itself. The scenes of the deserted, abandoned city are simply stunning. Kudos then, to Smith, Francis Lawrence, and all involved for making one hell of a great movie. And kudos to Richard Matheson for penning the original tale over fifty years ago (has it been that long since the book was first published? Jeez!). Overall, a great film."
"ElijahCSkuggs","7","1","4","14 December 2007"," Better than The Omega Man.
","Before going to see I Am Legend I decided to go back in time to watch The Omega Man, to see exactly what this story is all about, and to then compare the two when I see the new version. I also found out that there's another one entitled The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price. Still haven't seen that one yet. I didn't really enjoy The Omega Man due to a high level of ""cheese"". Though the story is interesting, and there were some cool scenes like sniping the bad guys from the apartment, but overall it's really not that great of a movie. Unfortunately I Am Legend isn't great either, but it is better than The Omega Man. I'm not going to go into the differences between the two films, but let's say they should have shared ideas with each other. Well, I do have to say this, in Omega Man, the mutants known as The Family, talked and communicated. In I Am Legend, they're just screaming maniacs led by a slightly more intelligent screaming maniac. I really do believe this could have been much better if they kept the maniacs as crazy/violent, but also added more depth....at least some talking. Instead we just got a bunch of crazies....which we've all seen before. But I Am Legend still did well with these maniacs. They were ferocious and pretty much unstoppable. The first 3/4 of the film was interesting character development mixed with tension and some pretty emotional scenes. But the last quarter of the film just kinda didn't do anything for me. Maybe because I didn't care for the actress...or the ending for that matter, since it was a little too happy feeling. If you know the story, you should understand what I mean. Anyways, the film wasn't bad at all, it moved at a pretty good pace, Will Smith did a nice job, and there were some truly touching and tense scenes."
"ritasnothome","10","1","4","14 December 2007"," Great movie
","I think this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It seems like Will Smith can do no wrong, his movie Pursuit of Happiness last year was amazing too. He's just an excellent actor all around. Smith did an awesome job in this movie, especially since he was not only the main character, but throughout most of the movie, he was the only character. <br/><br/>I think this movie's only downfall was the development of the characters personalities. It was lacking a lot in that department. But the plot, story, camera shots, everything else was right on. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone!"
"abhis007","7","1","4","14 December 2007"," Will Smith in yet another sci-fi....
","Independence Day, MIB, I Robot..... and now it is I Am Legend. Will Smith's love for sci-fi continues. And does it disappoint? Nope, it doesn't. The movie starts off slowly showing a totally deserted New York City, apart from the wild animals and the lone human being, Will Smith as Dr. Neville. The initial part of the movie tries to convey to the viewer the strangeness on being the last man alive on earth. Will Smith has the entire onus on him of keeping the viewers engrossed as he is not sharing the screen with anyone else. He tries to depict the fight his character goes through in order to maintain his sanity in the lonely world. The pace of the movie is slow in the beginning but then it starts building up and the second half of the movie has more action and thrill in it. The movie gets more gripping as the mutated beings are introduced and events start unfolding that will help Smith to find the cure to stop all this. <br/><br/>Will Smith is cool throughout the movie, be it the lonely scenes which are more emotional or the action-packed gun-slinging ones. The dog Samantha gives good company to Smith. The other characters have small bits and they fit well. The movie lacks at times in building up the intensity to the appropriate levels. There are not enough scenes where the viewer has his heart in his mouth. The special effects are great though (they usually always are). <br/><br/>Overall, a fun film.... and a definite watch if you love Will Smith's work."

","Once again a story about someone fighting off zombie people who are trying to eat him/her and only come out at night. This doesn't mean i don't like it. It means it seems to me that the people that make movies really are in it sheerly for the cash or why don't they think up a more original idea? Although i guess it is more original as it is based on the book that it was based on. How can people make a movie so similar and get away with it? It seems to be the way these days with any kind of movie genre. Anyway! The movie had good tension and good story i felt, until the end. I felt the movie storyline finished too early thy did all the ground work for the story, it comes down to the last scene which is just another Hollywood cheesy ending. It could have been so much more and left me completely satisfied. It always seems to be the same ending these days, and all anyone ever says is - 'it's up to you to decide'. Well, i'm sorry that's just laziness on the writer/producer side. They can't be bothered to finish the story so they just leave it open...unless they are making a second, then thats OK! I recommend it as i found it had plenty of shocks and tension, only I'd rather the didn't use so much CGI! If you liked 28 days later, see it!"

I like how all the zombie vampires were white muscular alpha males.<br/><br/>However I think this movie is about how we should not look for cures of cancer, because that is how the zombie outbreak started is because will smith tried to cure cancer and he messed up and created white zombies running around NYC and he has to kill them all or cure their whiteness.<br/><br/>This movie is also kind of like a allegory for the future race war that will happen in NYC it's a movie created by the weinstein jews and the illuminatti.<br/><br/>Its a shame that will smith took part in a illuminatti movie when his other movie I robot is a movie about going against the illuminatti."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","5","24 October 2009"," Consistently good, but with a bitter aftertaste
","I have not read the novel, though I am growing increasingly interested in doing so. This does a fairly solid job of creating a post-apocalyptic world, as well as building up a convincing atmosphere of isolation. The plot is engaging, and if you ignore the couple of hiccups in it, this has a thing or two(and not terribly much more) to say, and does so well. This is well-paced, and never loses the audience, in spite of twists that changes it all in unexpected ways. It's exciting, scary, and the psychology is credible and this almost dares to have something as rare as an unstable character in the lead of a Hollywood movie. Smith gives one of his best performances to date. So what about this bothers me? The effects that do not at any time cease to look fake? Not really. Taking what I understand is an excellent and smart book and, to an extent, turning it into a somewhat simplistic Summer blockbuster? Well, we're getting closer. No, the reason is that they discarded the brilliant and poignant moral of the author, Richard Matheson's original text. They replaced it with a bland, clichÃ©d ending of the sort we've seen since the concept of storytelling was first thought up by our species. Yes, I know. Test audience reaction holds part of the blame. Here's the thing; this didn't have to take that title. They could have called this any number of things, and people would, perhaps rightly so, accuse it of being a rip-off, as opposed to, as we are now, saying how poor an ""adaptation"" it is. If the ideas are not communicated properly in a version of a previously released work, isn't it merely ""inspired by""? Shouldn't it be? I have not watched either of the other two films based on it, however, it is entirely possible that I will do so. There is a little moderate language. This also has bloody, if not overly graphic, violence. The DVD contains four animated comics that I will review on their individual pages here on the site. I recommend this to fans of the genres of science fiction and thriller, and/or fiction involving dystopian settings. And I suggest making the choice if you want to enjoy this for what it is, or find out what the writer meant for it to be. 7/10"

"FilmFlaneur","7","1","5","24 May 2008"," Worthy sucessor to previous versions
","Any film which holds nice Emma Thompson (here playing a 'Dr Crippen', crime buffs please note) responsible for the death of 5 billion people can't be all bad - and I AM LEGEND, fourth version of the famous work by Richard Matheson, is almost all good. Despite those who harp on about the changes from the source novel and the undeniable weaknesses in the CGI department LEGEND, like Smith's earlier I ROBOT, proves an above average, pleasurable surprise. Smith plays Robert Neville, ostensibly the last man on earth, fighting the zombies of the dark while struggling to isolate an antidote to a virus which has destroyed humanity. Swopping THE OMEGA MAN's over talkative, white haired soul brother brethren who menace Charlton Heston for more fearsome, inarticulate brutes is a real improvement, while Smith's sensitive portrayal of Neville brings to the surface a humanity and sadness streets away from Heston's chess playing, machine-gunning white autocrat.<br/><br/>In one scene Smith tearfully asks a shop mannequin to talk back to him. To his credit the actor walks away from this moment with his dramatic integrity intact, and introduces a pathos missing from the franchise before. Whether or not one sees the enhanced Christian subtext as successful or not will be a matter or taste (I gave it the benefit of the doubt), but the film retains the central irony of an atheistic hero proving the salvation on mankind. In any case it is no more subtle - and arguably less blasphemous, should one care - than Heston's carefully staged 'crucifixion' death scene in OMEGA.<br/><br/>Interestingly the new script has Neville refer to his perilous existence as ""ground zero"" - a phrase particularly pregnant in the context of mass death, aptly recalling the apocalyptic mood of 9/11. Like the contemporary American mood, Neville too thinks he can ""fix it"" (i.e. put the status quo back together again) a view reinforced by the final image of LEGEND: a fortress community, a ideally harmonious USA in miniature perhaps, and one presumably besieged by hostile attackers.<br/><br/>Criticism of LEGEND has largely been levelled at the last third which has been taken as inferior to the first two - an opinion no doubt started by the American market which saw a feel-good ending. For the UK DVD release this has been replaced by something more downbeat and is more powerful even if there is a sensation of rush in the wrap up. The most memorable parts of the film remain those which evolve around the lonely Neville in a deserted city, which is convincingly realised.<br/><br/>Smith's portrayal of a haunted hero, broken by the death of his dog, is a fine one, and lifts the film well above average. It's a sign of the changing cultural times that Neville's solitary trip and mouthing of the words from the anti-establishment WOODSTOCK in THE OMEGA MAN is here replaced by an equivalent moment before the family-friendly SHREK, enjoyed amongst sympathetic company at that, an altogether less powerful moment. And if perhaps the closing 20 minutes do seem a little breathless, then this is a minor miscalculation in a genre piece which I think will bear revisiting"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","5","12 May 2008"," Good but it's missing something.
","This is simply a good quality movie to watch but it nevertheless leaves you hungry for more, since the movie its potential and concept screamed for a better and more exciting execution. After all, this movie is about the last man living in New York City, battling a whole bunch of mutant zombie, while trying to find a cure to the virus that almost entirely wiped out mankind. It's basically its potential that still makes this such a fine movie to watch but the movie however is just not as action packed or tense/scary as you would expect beforehand. It does make the movie perhaps a bit of a missed opportunity and it does has some wasted potential in it, which does give you the feeling that the movie is missing something but it fortunately doesn't make this movie any less pleasant to watch.<br/><br/>First of it all, it's absolutely something great to see New York City entirely being overgrown by plants and wild life. It's above all very good and convincing looking and basically this alone is already enough to make ""I Am Legend"" a real recommendable movie. They did a real good job with it, although this effort apparently went at the expense of some of the movie its other effects. It's a mixed bag really. The one moment the effects are great looking, while the other its totally apparently too fake looking, especially for 2007 standards really.<br/><br/>It's also really a tough movie for Will Smith, since well basically he has no one to play against, except for a dog. Still he knows to carry the movie brilliantly. Leave it up to Will Smith to make a successful blockbuster, which ""I Am Legend"" really was at its time of release.<br/><br/>It's story gets obviously a bit restrained because, well how much stuff can you come up with for a movie that is being completely set in a large deserted city. They tried to give the story something extra by putting in an occasional flashback sequence but I don't think they were really in the right places and completely necessary for the movie. It probably would had worked out better if there were more and constant flashback sequences in the movie, completely explaining and showing how mankind got almost completely exterminated and everything involving around that. It still sort of gives you the feeling that they could had worked out the script better, also since the movie its ending really isn't completely satisfying (and yes, if seen both different versions of the ending.)<br/><br/>It's one fine big budget quality movie. It's just missing this tiny bit of extra to make this movie a true tense, action packed or completely memorable movie to watch you'll talk about for years to come. Appereantly a sequel is currently in the making, lets hope it will include this extra elements required to make it a real great movie to watch.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Will Smith Carries this movie with a stunning Oscar-worthy performance. As is his character, Will Smith is famed for putting 100% into the things he does. In this case, he put in 110%. The Entire movie from the acting to the music to the message was enjoyable and worth while.<br/><br/>I think the critics are over hyping the ""fact"" that the movie adaptation strayed too far from the book. I found it the opposite. The movie and book had the same basic themes, the movie contained direct quotes, and the only main difference was that the endings were different, which then made the book convey one message while the movie conveyed a different message. However, both messages are powerful and worth conveying, I think so who cares? Anyway, the things the movie did change from the book were only devices used to strengthen the message of the movie, so I think that Hollywood did a good job taking a good story and turning it into something people in present day can get a good message out of."
"Exeron","8","1","5","22 January 2008"," The movie of 2007?
","First i just want to say that Will Smith did an amazing acting in this one, perhaps the best i've ever seen.<br/><br/>Review You probably already know that the movie is about a man who survived an Virus that infected the whole world. The reason why he survived (which i never understood at first) is that he was immune to the virus.<br/><br/>Anyway more to the movie, the movie was very tense in the first parts of the movies, i was really scared at some points and it did have some REALLY good shocking moments, so if you are seeing this on the big screen, you'll probably going to crawl down to the floor. Because believe me the first part is really, really tense.<br/><br/>Yes that was the first part of the movie, the later parts you are getting more used to everything (i'm not going to spoil). And many things aren't that scary anymore since you've seen it a lot. You'll probably get it.<br/><br/>It felt like this movie had two volumes, the first volume is more the slow and thrilling part. While the second volume got more bang bang and all of a sudden it's ZOMBIE CITY!!! There is a major twist in the plot later in the movie which i never thought would happen, of course i won't tell.<br/><br/>Anyway is this the best picture of 2007, i don't know. For me the movie year has been kinda weak, i didn't see a GREAT!!! movie though. The movie of the year 2007 for me was American Gangster, which i didn't think was fantastic but it was a good movie. Not that I am Legend is bad, but i now understand why the ratings decreased from 8.0 to 7.4 to fast.<br/><br/>I just didn't feel it just as the line say "" I just didn't feel it"". There was some really beautiful parts, with beautiful music that really fitted, and music is the most important point in a movie i think.<br/><br/>Anyway this movie gets 75/100 from me, that would be 7.5/10. Well since you can't vote in decimals i will just give it a strong seven, or a weak eight if you like.<br/><br/>""A very well made film that will make you jump certain times"""

","The film presents well, and Will Smith is superb. But I feel that the film's writers copped out to the human happy ending. In the original story, Neville was legend to the infected humans (a missing parallel to this movie's ""dark seekers""). Neville was their bogeyman, since he had single-handedly killed thousands of them. Here, the dark seekers are nothing more than screaming CGI fiends. And though their intelligence and social structure are alluded to throughout the film, they are never developed as parts of the storyline. The complexity and irony of the original story are sadly missing.<br/><br/>The film was well-made and, as mentioned above, it's a joy to watch Will Smith grow into a dramatic actor of the first magnitude."

I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a movie, especially a Will Smith movie. I kept hoping it was going to get better and make more sense at the end, but it never did. Too many things were too random and went unexplained: the evolution of the virus and how long it took for it to spread, why was he immune, his credentials as a scientist, etc. Action scenes were choppy and predictable, effects of the infected people were poor quality. Save your money, go see something else. See this movie really is giving me serious doubts about seeing Smith's next movie, the one where he is some kind of superhero or something."

This version of the tale is properly constructed and executed. It is beautiful, witty, clever, and artfully suspenseful, with a most excellent execution of a much older story.<br/><br/>Neville's descent into insanity is nothing graceful, and there is no attempt made to make it appear candy-coated.

Taken in and of itself, though, I Am Legend is basically what any horror film should be. First, this film isn't strictly horror, it has elements of drama, sci-fi, and thriller among other things. Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, and the amount of zombie-like creatures definitely puts it into the horror category as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Now, this movie could have quickly been ruined by the kinds of gratuitous chase scenes and excessive violence that usually plagues horror films. It doesn't do that. It could have used the usual technique of ""the audience is too stupid to figure out what happened unless we tell them every piece of the puzzle explicitly"". It doesn't do that, either. It is much more subtle and much more interesting. The story is very psychologically based rather than action based and is a much more interesting movie because of it. Top it off with Will Smith in one of his best performances to date and you end up with something much more than your average sci-fi/horror flick."
"evilandy72","9","1","5","22 December 2007"," More ""Omega Man"" than ""I am Legend""
","Richard Matheson's classic scifi/horror novel ""I am Legend"" has always been one of my favorites. I read it first when I was about 12 after my dad gave it to me (himself a big fan of classic science fiction) and couldn't put it down until I had finished the last page. Since then I must have read it a dozen times, still being fascinated like the first time. I had some really high expectation in this movies as both prior versions, ""Last Man on Earth"" (Vincent Price) and ""Omega Man"" disappointed me quite a lot. Well, to get to the point, ""I am Legend"" is not Richard Matheson's ""I am Legend"", it's sort of a ""Omega Man"" remake ... nevertheless an exceptionally good one and it contains much more of the novel's spirit than anything else before. The infected now are really bloodthirsty creatures (not pale, religious weirdos like in ""Omega Man"") and 80% percent of the movie shows Robert Neville in his loneliness and desperation while searching for other survivors and a possible cure. Will Smith really does a great good job. Graphic violence and action sequences are pleasantly kept on a low level. Don't get me wrong, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is one of my favorite movies, but it wouldn't fit this one. There are only 2 things I dislike. First of all there is no Ben Cortman, the Neville's former neighbor, who is now infected and terrorizes him every night. Those night attacks and especially Cortman are vital parts of the novel. Second, in Richard Mathesons's novel the titel ""I am Legend"" becomes the clear, logical and inevitable conclusion in the end while the movie's ending is just pathetic. Nevertheless I really enjoyed this movie!"

","no denying, the film was spectacular, in its cinematography and storyline. will smith however did not seem to be the right man to be the only homo sapien left on earth. his credentials in the movie was weakly established. the events that took place when the virus became airborne was imperfectly unfolded to the audience. flashbacks were good as story tool but there wasn't much that was fed to the audience's mindset in order to completely appreciate the demise of mankind. the focus of the catastrophe was too scoped in at NYC. and we are to believe that the entire world has been wiped out? his radio message, illogically didn't reach the colony, which was portrayed to be military-guarded. how so? less was explained on the survival of Anna and Ethan. If the darkseekers were dangerous and have roamed the entire world, it was not effectively translated in the movie. Again, too scoped in with NYC. his argument abt NYC being his Ground Zero was basically unacceptable. perhaps i am taking the stride literally, too literal in fact. But it is in fact possible to reach on literal basis to the audience."

","At first I thought this movie was going to bring out the best of Sci-fi, but I was terribly mistaken, it really crosses the line between being interesting and original to becoming a bunch of dead ends with no real explanation, and then having to listen to the argument of God being the reason to all of the unexpected crap that happened during the movie is disappointing. Also a new character is introduced out of nothing and almost at the end of the movie.... If you don't have an interesting plot please leave God out of the equation in trying to make your movie sound realistic or credible. Thanks"
"gravityfalls-28195","1","1","6","7 January 2018"," Why????
","All I have to say is that I watched the movie yesterday and I was very upset.
Why kill Sam? Seriously, why? Even if it was in the book or something, just why???????<br/><br/>Sam stands by Neville's side the entire time she is alive. She's loyal, keeps you watching, and then you try scaring me by saying 'oh nononooooo she went into the darkkk!'<br/><br/>Sam fights for Neville and her life until the very end. Sam's death is the ONLY scene in the entire movie that made me cry, because I can't understand why.<br/><br/>How did Anna even get to New York City? And why couldn't have Neville threw the grenade and jumped in with Anna and Ethan? (and, if they DIDN'T KILL THE DOG, Samantha.) <br/><br/>And how would bleach help cover up the tracks?? Also, this might have also been in the book as I haven't seen it, but why start trying to tug at heartstrings desperately by killing off the wife and daughter? You could've just let them leave, and that'd be just as fine.<br/><br/>Also, how did the scan be wrong at first? This means they could have brought in infected people to the helicopters and stuff because the scanning device was stupid. Good ol mother Zoe (I believe that's her name) could've been actually infected!<br/><br/>Why can't you keep Sam? Imagine Sam fighting to the death or something, but then they find out Sam also has immune blood? And then Neville could've tried running over the Darkseekers with Sam, because he's literally becoming insane.
Then, they could wake up together with Anna and Ethan, and maybe then Neville would be kinder at first, and it would be much better. As I said above, they could've just gotten multiple vials of the butterfly lady and then threw the grenade, and hopped in with the dog.<br/><br/>No matter what you say, Sam should have survived.<br/><br/>

"ExpendableMan","8","1","6","31 December 2007"," Smithy the Vampire Slayer
","It goes without saying that if you're not a fan of Will Smith, this probably isn't the movie for you. For about ninety percent of the running time, he is the only character to be seen, the sole survivor of a virulent plague that has wiped out the entire human race and left him to spend his days wandering around New York city listening to reggae music and talking to shop window dummies. Doesn't exactly sound like the most entertaining movie in the world does it, I mean how interesting can a two hour film be when all it revolves around is one man and his dog? Actually, it's really enjoyable. In fact it's one of the best post-apocalyptic movies out there. Principally, this is down to Smith's powerful performance, the former Fresh Prince bringing a hopeless sense of loss to his character that makes him a very sympathetic leading man. That and the vampires.<br/><br/>Like 28 Days Later before it, I Am Legend is a film where the fall of man brings with it some incredibly beautiful cinematography. The numerous shots of an empty, dilapidated New York where herds of deer race around abandoned cars and thick grass has grown through the cracks in the pavement lend an eerie, sombre nature to the film. As Smith's Robert Neville moves round this landscape, he is surrounded on all sides by towering skyscrapers that have turned into extravagant bird's nests. It's a disturbing setting and the sight of our protagonist dwarfed by the empty metropolis does wonders for the atmosphere. The special effects team deserve a hearty pat on the back for the first ten minutes alone.<br/><br/>Pity then that the vampires look so rubbish as they had the chance to be truly threatening. The scene where they are first introduced is terrifying, Neville's search for his lost dog through a darkened building ending in a nailbiting chase back to the light. All the tension is dissipated though when you finally get a good look at his foes, badly rendered CGI clichés who look like Gollum on a protein rich diet. The lacklustre villains aren't enough to sink the movie, it's just frustrating to think that make-up and prosthetics would have yielded far more satisfying results.<br/><br/>That aside, I Am Legend is still an incredibly entertaining experience and makes for a worthy last trip to the cinema in 2007. Smith gives one of the best performances of his career and it's worth seeing for the depiction of New York alone. Like all things in life though, it's the little things that make it, a fact made perfectly clear in the opening sequence where an overly confident female scientist appears in a television interview about the miracle cure. She's all smiles and self-satisfaction until the reporter asks if they have found a genuine cure for cancer. For a split second a flicker of doubt appears on her face before the smile returns and she confirms it. The next shot is of an abandoned Times Square that reeks of death."
"scar-face-099","10","1","6","21 December 2007"," I AM LEGEND is 2007's best film!
","First of all, to the IMDb public, this film is the number 1 movie of 2007. Will Smith has no other big star along side him in this movie. This movie has a running time of 100 minutes (pretty short for a Smith film). But by the end of the film, you just can't believe! First of all (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!) the lady comes to a safe zone in Vermont!! Why didn't these people listen to Smith's character Neville's outcry on FM transmissions!! Second, how can they just end the movie like that! It was such an excellent movie, how could you just end it with the line ""light the darkness!!"" But this film is great after all. Smith does an excellent job as the ""last man"" on earth. This is the reason the movie is this good! The direction by Francis Lawrence is amazing! He's showing signs of Spielberg and Jackson special effects wizardry! He makes the New York City look so empty, and that is really hard to do, because I have been to NYC and it ain't empty! Akiva Goldsman should of made a better ending, but otherwise great story. This would of been a horrible film if Arnold Schwarzzeneger and Ridley Scott had actually to the film seriously.<br/><br/>10/10 best film of 2007!"
"sg2790","10","1","6","21 December 2007"," Will Smith is a LEGEND!
","This film was absolutely brilliant. I haven't seen a blockbuster movie this good in a verrry verrrry long time. It doesn't bombard you with loads of action but with enough to keep you satisfied. Also its a deeply moving story.<br/><br/>It was really thought provoking watching this as it made you think what would you be like in this situation... There was a sense of realism to the story, even if Nevillie does talk to dummies but wouldn't you if there was no one else around? Also the bond with his dog was a brilliant part of the story, reminded me off Cast Away and Tom Hank's ball Wilson.<br/><br/>Even though at times i did feel that maybe CGI didn't need to be used as much it was it didn't dampend the film at all, it was just a bit too obviously done and at times i did feel maybe they were showing off a bit that they managed to close busy New York streets to film some scenes...<br/><br/>Anyway, I really must say this is a brilliant film, thought-provoking and moving - yes i teared up at various points because Will Smith is such a versatile actor who can make you cry with laughter or cry with sadness but also make you feel on the edge of your seat because he has such stamina.<br/><br/>10/10 if anyone doesn't like this movie they are just being too critical and picky! i should know im usually one of them!<br/><br/>BRILLLIANNT FILM WATCH IT!"
"rodneyb388","7","1","6","18 December 2007"," Less like a vampire movie more like the living dead
","Very interesting movie based on the premise that something that is supposed to help mankind actually causes harm beyond belief. The ""monsters"" in this movie do not turn into other animals, gaze into your eyes to put you into some kind of hypnotic trance, nor do they fly around. But when they do come after you, you can't run fast enough (unless you are Will Smith). Some scenes reminded me of the Tom Hanks movie Castaway. Will Smith pulls it off like Tom Hanks did in making me care what happens to him and his trusted dog. While the monsters appeared to act brain dead, they were still smart enough to give Will's character a run for his money, or car, or house, or gun. Overall it is a movie worth watching."
"Chris Knipp","7","1","6","17 December 2007"," Will Smith saves the world
","Will Smith and the special effects are the two main reasons for watching I Am Legend. It might also help to be a fan of Bob Marley. This is another adaptation of sci-fi and ""Twilight Zone"" writer Richard Mathieson's 1954 novel of the same name. There have been two previous film variations, with Vincent Price ('64) and Charlton Heston ('71). The basic story is about a military scientist who believes himself to be the last surviving healthy human after a virus has depopulated the planet leaving only (in this version) hordes of raging nocturnal mutants. Neville (this time Smith) has injected himself with an experimental vaccine that makes him immune. He's still trying to find one that will work on others and cure the infected. He insists (this time) on remaining at what he calls ""Ground Zero""Manhattanto do his work.<br/><br/>The movie has done well with some NYC film critics. Apparently they like seeing a post-apocalyptic version of their home town free, if at a horrible cost, of tourists or holiday crowds.<br/><br/>Speaking of costs, Lawrence's movie has gotten another kind of injection: lots of money, $200 million, by reports. Money does not bring sophistication and indeed may banish it. But it means the filmmakers can afford Smith, a charismatic movie star who makes a convincing superhero. Already extremely buff in I, Robot (which this role somewhat reprises), Smith's now not only in even better physical shape (we see him working out, with his trusty female German Shepherd, Sam), but also a mercurial actor, able to register every conceivable human emotion. Unfortunately for most of the two hours he has nobody to share his emotions with but Sam.<br/><br/>The most notable ones are desperation, loneliness, and despair. This is, as has been pointed out, not only the most expensive Rin Tin Tin movie of all time, but also a vision of the ultimate urban alienation. I Am Legend is at its strongest when it evokes the sadness of a world without people in it. Other than Sam, Neville has nobody to talk to but manikins he seems to have arranged himself in a video shop, and at home nobody to watch but Shrek and old recordings of TV news shows before disaster struck, some time around Christmas. It's not easy being the last man in New York. Occasionally Neville sees flashbacks of the departure of his wife and son during a tumultuous and unsuccessful evacuation that recalls both Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Cuaron's Children of Men. Then he knows he is alone. Roaring about the city in a Mustang 5000 feebly trying to shoot wild deer (which he's surprisingly inept at), talking to Sam, and doing his workouts are not distractions for long from the angst of isolation. For us, it's fun looking at the CGI images of a deserted Manhattan that is already, after three years, overgrown with weeds and overrun with deer being preyed upon by lions.<br/><br/>This high-budget Neville lives appropriately, in a big house on Washington Square fitted with heavy steel doors to shut him in at night, when the infected ones, who're light sensitive like vampires, go on the rampage. In the basement is a full laboratory where he pursues his research on animals and captured infected humans, recording his findings in streaming video. The bridges may have split in two, but he's still got power. He also has an AM radio message on all stations setting up a meeting with any healthy survivors down by the docks at noon every day. Like the father and son in Cormac McCarthy's The Road, he sometimes breaks fearfully into houses to scavenge canned goods and other preserved eatables.<br/><br/>In Mathieson's Cold War era novel, it was biological warfare between Russian and China that depopulated the planet; this time it's the fault of science. Three years ago a doctor (Emma Thompson) engineered a virus capable of preventing cancer. Unfortunately it horribly mutated, turning the the inoculated into raging vampire killers. The resulting creatures are bald hyper-muscled creatures very like the infected of 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later only more expensive, though they lack variety, since 90% of them look like Woody Harrelson on steroids.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a carryover from the book, Neville has an uneasy hold on his sanity, and despite his air of logic in the lab (and his denial of the existence of Godthough he fervently believes in the humanism of Bob Marley) he can occasionally lose it, fly into a rage, and do really stupid things. Handling a dire situation unwisely, he gets himself injured and brings grief to Sam. Despairing later, he randomly attacks a pack of the infected, apparently welcoming death at their hands (or teeth). And then somehow he's rescued by a mother and her young son, Anna (Alice Braga of City of God) and Ethan (Charlie Tahan). By then the movie is past its prime and the finale is neither convincing nor satisfying, and visions of half a dozen other zombie/vampire sci-fi movies, all of them made on a lower budget with more interesting results, are left dancing in our headsas well as some other big budget ones that weren't any better than this momentarily exciting and energetic, but not imaginatively very stimulating effort."
"jharringtonparks","10","1","6","17 December 2007"," Nailed It!
","This movie was everything I expected and more. Will Smith nailed the character and was completely believable as a person in that circumstance. If you like this particular niche of science fiction (virus causing end of world) you will LOVE this movie. The special effects are perfect and NYC looked empty. There was a bit of humor amidst the gloom, pulled off well by Smith. The time line of the story was not what I expected but I felt it worked. The spiritual tie in with Bob Marley was a really nice touch. The very end was the only part of the film I thought was unnecessary. I think they should have ended the visuals in the lab and just had her voice over to tie it up. But that is just being nit-picky, because over all it was a tour-De-force for Matheson's story and for the genre."

Not too much gore, but still enough to make it sickening pertaining to the subject matter. <br/><br/>Will's acting is superb and he makes you feel like you're with him. Something about him is just down to earth,...like his acting has become so much apart of him that the lines become blurred yet still within his control. Hard to explain, but he acts as if he's really in the particular situation of the Movie. <br/><br/>I don't know why at the end he didn't just throw the grenade at the ""zombies"" then ran for cover. And, why did he have just one grenade ? Well, in the end, it all fit the storyline, and the significance of the film is definitely in the spirit of faith and good will. I gave this a 10 cause all the parts fit well; Story, Actor, Plot, music, etc,.. one solid movie."

"dadogmanever","10","1","6","16 December 2007"," You are an idiot
","Obviously you (whoever commented before me) did not watch the movie. First of all we do know why the epidemic started... there was a cure for cancer and it backfired causing this ""mutilation."" You even mentioned that yourself. Also, why would we need to know why he was chosen? My guess would be because he was a general in the army and a the scientist who helped make the ""cure,"" but i don't know, but the point is, it would make things more complicated and the movie longer and would probably make it worse because, most likely, it would take a turn and not know how to get back on track. And did you stay for the entire movie? Near the end when he is talking to Anna he explains everything to her. He gives her a bunch of statistics that explain what happened. So what he doesn't say why some people were immune, but how would he know? He doesn't even know what the cure is. And for the acting... you must obviously not like Will Smith, or at least love Tom Hanks, but i can tell you now he gives a much stronger performance than Tom Hanks in castaway. The entire film i related to Will and he did such a good job of making you feel what it would be like to be alone and sad, especially after his dog dies. (And by the way the dog dieing was much more sad than the Wilson scene in Casaway.) And for the special effects... sure they weren't the best, but not every movie is going to be like transformers. Plus, I'm sure budget had to do a lot about it, making New York empty and destroying the bridge cost 50 million dollars. So what i have to say is this: Will Smith's acting is very very good, the plot is awesome (i know there are a lot of ""end of the world"" plots but this one is the best of all those types of movies i've seen because curing cancer and having it backfire could actually happen, probably not the zombie part, but that type of movie needs suspense.) This movie is very good and all of you readers out there don't listen to this review or any other's like it (which are many and that boggles the hell out of my mind) and go see the movie if you haven't already, i know i will go see it again, especially in the imax! i say 10/10"
"BackInDaDay00","8","1","6","14 December 2007"," An Outstanding Performance by Smith
","I Am Legend is a movie that many will walk into thinking that they are about to see a thriller/action movie. This is not the case. The movie definitely has some moments that could classify it as a post apocalyptic thriller, but that only happens to be the outer shell of what the movie is about. Will Smith shows how great an actor he is in I am Legend. With very few scenes with other actors, Will Smith does a tremendous job putting the audience into the world his character is living in. There is especially one scene that will make a lot of the audience tear up just by seeing his facial expressions. I recommend most go into this movie with an open mind because there are a lot of metaphorical elements that I won't get into. The ending may upset or surprise some people, but the movie is definitely as original as they could have made it. It has its own unique elements that most movies of this genre don't have. Once again, go in to this movie with an open mind or else it may surprise or disappoint the fans looking for an action packed thriller."

","Every now and then there comes a movie that compels your attention from start to finish. One that is sometimes so intense that although you grab your popcorn, it gets cold before it reaches your mouth. I guess you have pretty much understood what I mean. Special mention to what they have made New York look like is a pretty amazing feat. An aftermath of a huge tragedy. One of the many mess that we have witnessed the city get into over the years of cinema in Hollywood. Aliens, Godzillas, tornadoes, storm, terrorist attacks and now a ghastly epidemic. Having said all that, some parts of the movie reminded me of a recently released flick ""30 days of night"". That feeling of deja vu actually took away some of the build up that it initially had. Besides that I do not see why it would fail to cash in this festive season in the box office. Will Smith is in full form and plays the lone ranger pretty much the way his director must have wanted him to. It would go down as one of his better performances along with ""In Pursuit of Happiness"". On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it an 8 for the pure fun factor to it. If you plan to spare 2 hours of your holiday on it, the chances are you will not be disappointed."

This film was so amazing, Will Smith gave an outstanding performance of a man trying to survive in what is truly a ""living hell."" All alone except for his Dog, Sam. His conversation with the ""dummies"" at the video store just to have interaction or at least pretend to was quite moving. When Sam passed, I was reminded of Tom Hanks and Wilson from Castaway. The only soul you could connect with is gone. After you've already lost so much. The effects/CGI were amazing. To see Manhattan so desolate and in ruins is breath taking. They were very detailed in location, I saw Duane Reade Pharmacy in one scene. I also loved the Promotion in Times Square of the Superman vs. Batman movie ""coming soon"". The dark seekers were horrifying, especially when they came in so many numbers and could scale walls. These types of movies rarely have a happy ending, but it shows the dedication, faith and sacrifice of someone for a cause on a grander scale. Truly a masterpiece- scary but meaningful."
"jjcremin-1","8","1","6","13 December 2007"," Almost solo Will Smith performance
","I just saw an advanced screening last night. Will Smith is a name that can pull crowds as evidenced by the huge turnout. Generally the audience's response is positive and even Smith's pull ups on a handlebar got applause.<br/><br/>With only a dog as his real companion for most of this movie, Smith walks around the ruins of New York. Deer are the only real traffic now. Smith almost shoots one but stands awed as he allows a lion to kill it and take it away. A video show a glorious doctor, whose cure for cancer has backfired and billions of people have died. Many who haven't have become stark raving lunatics who are afraid of the light, with ravenous appetites to devour anything on site.<br/><br/>When not hunting down this vermin, he checks out DVD's out at a video store that has standing mannequins in it. Was Smith losing it when working up the courage to talk to one of them? Or was he just so lonely that he's playing a game with himself. Meanwhile, he records notes as a medical researcher, working with laboratory rats to find a cure. Most are dead or crazy but one, though weak, shows positive response.<br/><br/>He captures a human to try the serum on but the baddies are not going to let him get away with it. About this time, a woman and boy show up, eventually giving the movie the bittersweet ending it has.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" like I did, Smith does have the charisma to root for him even when his logic is at times suspect. Very entertaining."

One gains an understanding with the movie's sub-story. A surprise ending. I like the theme about faith, and God's plan. 8 out of 10. Sometimes all we have is faith.

Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood.

It's different because there are so few action scenes and too much slow moments in the film (of course, with one person in the majority of the film).<br/><br/>In The Host, you expect a monster movie, yet most of it is filled with character development and not enough monster attacking, which makes it underwhelming. In this film, you expect more zombie violence, yet there's only like three scenes of that in the whole film, which makes this film underwhelming. Is that a good thing? Sure, but we need more action.<br/><br/>Now, I may sound like an idiot by saying more action will make this film good, but no. I just thought it would've been more interesting if there were a few more zombie violence and less quietness. Still, I can't help the fact that this film manages to be disturbing and eerie with the limited scenes of zombies.<br/><br/>This is not your usual big budget movie. Yes, it has explosions (many, in fact) and some action sequences but not enough to satisfy an audience looking for something to happen. Still, Will Smith is great and the silence in the movie will get deadly. Overall, this is an underwhelming yet satisfying film."

","I immediately realized, just by seeing the trailer, that this was more of a post-apocalyptic film where an individual, somehow, survives or tries to fight a disease that almost completely exterminated the human race. I am not a fan of this type of films, as they are usually stopped and make me sleepy. Even so, I decided to see it to confirm the preconceived idea I had.<br/><br/>The film is essentially Will Smith moving around an abandoned New York while talking to a friendly dog. The way the film starts has an impact and holds us back, but what holds us still more is seeing the way Smith lives and emotionally connects with his canine companion, who is totally adorable. The actor is good, and does a satisfying job. The threat he tries to contain has always seemed a little unrealistic, within the line of the ""zombie apocalypse"" that is common to many films and has been in fashion, but which has nothing new and, frankly, has become tiring. The movie is better when Smith and the dog roam alone than when all the zombies enter the scene, willing to eat their brains. As the film develops, it gets worse. The arrival of more characters from Brazil is even stranger than everything else.<br/><br/>Technically, I really liked the big plans of the deserted and abandoned city, and the scenarios and props well elaborated and made in a convincing way. The soundtrack is somewhat sinister and works well, taking into account the environment and the theme."

The ending of the theatrical version of this movie was OK and as it should be. A little saccharine but pretty reasonable.
The ending of the alternative version had a ""Hollywood ending"" with a male Darkseeker showing his affectionate side to the female Darkseeker that Neville has been working on and miraculously cured in his lab. It was just sickening; honestly, I almost hurled.

"Uriah43","8","0","1","13 June 2017"," A Superior Remake of ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man""
","This movie begins with a scientist announcing a cure for cancer on television for all the world to see. Unfortunately, three years later the cure mutates into a deadly plague and kills almost everyone left on earth. And those who aren't killed are turned into creatures similar to zombies-only very fast and agile. However, as luck would have it, an Army doctor named ""Robert Neville"" (Will Smith) finds that he is one of the few people who is immune and as a result drives through the desolated city of New York with a dog named ""Sam"" as his only companion. Naturally, being a doctor he keeps himself busy trying to find a cure for those who have become infected while at the same time looking for others who might have escaped the plague all together. Then one day events soon begin to overtake him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film is the second remake of ""The Last Man on Earth"" which was filmed in 1964 and remade as ""The Omega Man"" in 1971. Although these two films were pretty good in their own right, I have to say that this particular movie was definitely the best of them all. For starters, as might be expected for a motion picture in this day and age, the CGI was clearly far superior. More importantly however was the acting of Will Smith which carried the day and subsequently resulted in his winning a Saturn Award for ""Best Actor"". Likewise, the movie itself was nominated by that same awards committee for ""Best Science Fiction Film"" as well. In short, this was an extremely good movie and I have rated it accordingly."

His performance manages to be funny and dramatic at the same time, and he does a great job carrying this fictional world all on his won. It's okay as far as modern horror films go, and it has some great dramatic scenes. The post-apocalyptic New York City looks really neat, and immerses the viewer in the world of the movie. As for the ending, I have a very unpopular opinion. I prefer the ending where Neville dies. It worked better. The other ending was kind of boring and anti-climatic in a way. For the most part it's a good movie, but it probably wouldn't be if they had picked just about anyone else to lead the film."

"Tweekums","8","0","1","15 December 2015"," A bleak but enjoyable post-apocalyptic horror
","As the film opens Dr Alice Krippin is being interviewed on television; she explains that she has developed a way of curing cancer using a modified version of the measles virus three years later New York is almost empty of humanity; the miracle cure has turned out to be anything but it has mutated killing most of humanity and the vast majority who haven't been killed have turned into mindless rabid killers, so-called Darkseekers the few who are immune are soon eaten! We see a lone man driving through the empty streets with his dog Sam. He is Col. Robert Neville, a military doctor, and he is trying to survive while trying to find a cure. With no other people the loneliness is clearly getting to him but he hasn't entirely given up on finding other people; each day he broadcasts a message and waits forlornly for somebody to come.<br/><br/>This got off to a fun start; I didn't expect Emma Thompson to be the one responsible for the end of human civilisation but as soon as he heard that her character was called Dr Krippin, clearly named after the infamous Dr Crippen, we knew what she was doing would end badly! The way we are introduced to protagonist Robert Neville is effective; the empty streets of New York look great. I liked how we only slowly learn about the Darkseekers; for quite some time we just knew that Neville was alone he carries a rifle but the reason isn't obvious; we do know there are wild animals roaming the streets but presumably they escaped from the zoo. Once we do see the Darkseekers they are pretty scary but not excessively so. Will Smith does a good job; effectively carrying the film alone for most of its run time. He makes us believe in his character even when he is talking to manikins that he has presumably placed in a video store. Things are bleaker than expected with flashbacks gradually revealing his attempts to get his family out of the city only to reveal that they didn't make it. As the story reaches its conclusion tensions rise dramatically and lead to a surprising ending. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of Will Smith or of the zombie genre (even though the Darkseekers aren't technically zombies) I can't say how it compared to other film versions of the story as I've not seen them."

"plymouthgtx","6","0","1","9 October 2015"," A good movie with potential
","I Am Legend is a science fiction/drama movie directed by Francis Lawrence that tells the story of Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) surviving in a post-apocalyptic world and struggling to find a cure after a lethal genetically modified measles virus infects and kills 90% of the human population. The virus was originally designed to be a cure for cancer, but instead turns the remaining 10% of humans alive into mutant, zombie-like creatures that buckle under the presence of any kind of UV light. He does not believe that any normal humans exist anymore, and the only company Neville has are a bunch of mannequins and his pet German Shepherd, Sam.<br/><br/>This film starts off at a pretty good standpoint, establishing the apocalyptic setting of Manhattan, with wild deer being hunted by lions in the streets and overgrown greenery of Time Square. Showing Neville and Sam hunting down the deer in a Shelby Cobra added for a nice sort of ""chase scene"" of predators hunting their prey. You can tell very quickly that the infected creatures they dealt with throughout the film were no joke as Neville locks himself and Sam in his fortified house at sundown. It becomes apparent how much Neville misses human interaction as he goes to the store and interacts with the mannequins. He becomes easily likable because of how stressed his character is in the whole situation, making you sympathize with him. Even Sam is likable as a dog, showing loyalty and companionship for Neville. A particularly heartbreaking moment in the film is when Neville had to strangle Sam due to her being infected by infected dogs. She was truly brave and was protecting her master to the very end, and you could feel the despair as Neville mourned over the death of his only companion. Two other characters later introduced due to Neville sending out radio broadcasts for anybody to find him and coincidentally saving his life were not so interesting at first, but did give a feeling of hope for both Neville and the audience. The film had great cinematography, however, with the work on the streets of New York City being rundown and destroyed. The effects were good for 2007 as well. It didn't have a spectacular soundtrack or anything like that, but it did emphasize the importance of lighting, in particular sunlight. The movie stayed consistent with the plot, not straying too far from the main theme. It had some subplots here and there, but they tied in with the main plot line of the film. How the story started was a rather ironic way for the world to end, but it didn't seem impossible. The movie did not overstay its welcome and was well paced. The ending could have taken a different direction, where he didn't have to sacrifice himself in a fiery explosive fashion, but certainly was better than the alternative ending because it made more sense and had more impact. Overall this film was well directed and put together. It follows a good storyline that expresses the dire need for the survival of the human race, the actors made you believe in their roles, and the production was well put together. I Am Legend is a film needed in one's collection."

So this is the second time that this masterwork has been completely butchered. The first iteration being the ridiculous ""Omega Man"" starring Charlton Heston. Only the barest aspects of the book made it into that movie which was a disgrace in every sense. So, why is it that filmmakers recognize the greatness of the book but feel the need to completely change it? It is not about action and it is not about an African American. Why not just make a good version that is true to the book? The story deals with the boredom of survival, loneliness,alienation and the objectivity of right or wrong. This new version reduces it to a cheesy vehicle for the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Yeah, don't forget that's what Willl Smith is. Read the book, it deserves a more serious film than the 2 cheese feasts that are very loosely based upon it. I overlooked the good movie based on the book "" the last man on earth' which can be seen for free on YouTube.

"orourkec-292-269155","7","0","1","6 February 2015"," An unforgettable film, but why is it flawed the way it is?
","I really liked I am Legend. I'm Legend is a film which has plenty of exhilarating atmosphere and a striking direction. Not only that but I was also highly and particularly glad (and also proud) to have experienced in a few scenes of the film a strong sense of fear, anxiety and hopelessness and anxiety, hopelessness and fear combined into a single feel and which made me feel 100% as if I was really inside the movie with Will Smith's character! Oh man that was a truly funny and unfamiliar kind of feel to me and I don't recall having ever lived that kind of feel ever before with movies! This is something I probably never get from my experience with movies and all of this is why the experience made me feel highly and particularly glad (and also proud) of the experience! The film also benefits from its post-apocalyptic New York town which looks quite effective, believable, convincing and very much probable to what it could look like in the real world when abandoned for a few years plus Smith's character's dog which added a strong and subtle sense of humanity to the film. However, despite these strong points I am Legend is plagued by a few bizarre flaws which I'm going to start talking about right now. The first one is its CGI effects! Now, I wonder what on earth the people that made these effects had in mind while putting these effects into place (or else what simply and accidentally went wrong with the CGI effects processing) because they were so, so bad looking and absolutely unconvincing and they harmed the movie a bit. They didn't give a strong sense of menace as I wished they would and it's a real disappointment. I'm afraid I will have to add them on my list of the Top 10 Worst CGI Effects of all Time! The other flaw is the scene where Robert Neville drives his car like a mad man in order to smash the Infected. Again what on earth went in the director's head when he was making that scene because that scene completely lacked any grip to it! That scene was completely stripped of any breathlessness and originality (also I'm sure we've all seen a scene like this one before and therefore we don't need and want to see the same thing again) and it also felt routine action scene rather than a solid action scene! I expected to have this and then at the end of that scene be impressed to the point of feeling like saying WAOUW and/or WOUF! But instead it felt like the scene was there just for the sake of having action, even if that means sacrificing its thrills. That was such a pity all of this and it ruined the movie's potential regarding all of the other good stuff I've mentioned which the movie already managed to offer us! Furthermore it is a bit unclear as to why Will Smith's character decided to stay outside at night to kill off the Infected in the first place when he always stays at his barricaded house at night like he's been doing for the first three years when he was alone! Was he trying to seek vengeance for his dog's death? Or is it something else? And if it is what is it? Still despite somewhat having these flaws I'm Legend is a movie that has its share of thrills and what I said at the very beginning of my review was enough to keep me fully entertained and satisfied nevertheless! I also wanted to say to you in my review that after watching this movie I dreamed and still do of being the sole survivor or just only living human being in my town, just to get this irresistible feeling of freedom of doing whatever I want to do around the huge town I'm in and go wherever I want to go and as far as it pleases me! I dream so badly of having this and I'm not kidding and it isn't out of nastiness in case you thought the other way around! As you can see, thanks to I am Legend it not only gave me thrills but also gave me something to imagine for myself in the reality world and I love imagining myself things in the real world in general. My rating for I am Legend is 7.6/10"

No two options on that! He delivers a performance that has the potential to haunt as well as to astonish. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'I Am Legend' proves what a true Legend Will Smith is.

I have seen many sci-fi thrillers including the masterpiece (Alien),but this is quite brilliantly made and I personally believe its underrated,because movie of this class should fetch nearly 8 at least.<br/><br/>Could not expect anything better than this.Highly Recommended from my side!!"
"gmoneymcdaniel66","1","0","2","27 April 2014"," Huge fan of the novella, Can't stand the movie.
","**Warning, spoilers off the port bow!**<br/><br/>Let's be clear, the only reason I gave this movie a 1-star rating is because there was not option to give it zero. <br/><br/>First off, although the film shares many plot elements from the book, it misses the entire point of the story. The Novella is titled ""I Am Legend"" because Neville discovers that the ""monsters"" he'd been killing all this time were actually sentient creatures who had set up their own society, and, from their perspective, he was the monster. He was the bogeyman that they told their children about at night. He was their legend or myth.<br/><br/>In the film, however, that interesting twist on the classic zombie/vampire story just gets tossed out the window in favor of a lot of ""Rawrs"" and a big BOOM! Because that's what audiences want, right? They can't possibly have sympathy for the creatures, or maybe have their prejudices challenged, lets just keep the creatures (who turn out to be intelligent in the novella) as mindless raging zombies.<br/><br/>One more thing that grinds my gears about this movie is that they even hint at the creatures being intelligent, only to completely drop it and have them get blown up. When Neville holds one of their females hostage, the creatures look at him as though they're scared, and even step back. But then, it cuts to them just rushing him, back to being the mindless zombies.<br/><br/>My recommendation? If you want a decent adaptation of the novella, watch ""The Omega Man"", but steer clear of this one."

","One of the best movies I watched. Great story, cast, and ending. But at the ending, I was hundred percent sure their was going to be the second movie. Because (In the original ending) Robert Neville jumped with the bomb and then the screen was covered with fire. And the film left that part like that (didn't show Robert again), and jumped to Anna. So I thought that Robert Neville was going to be saved and movie would go on and finish with the second film, while Robert Neville has finished his mission with saving his sight ""New York"". The film had very pathetic parts, like Sam getting killed by Robert (Because of Sam getting the virus). And the tragic life about Robert Neville how he lost his family. The film had exciting part like Robert Neville running behind Sam into the dark building while Sam was chasing the deer. And especially Robert Neville jumping from the building while the mutant people grabbing him. Congratulations to the director, screenwriter and the crew for making a great organization and as a result of a great movie."
"ggcorazondeoro","4","0","1","23 September 2013"," A movie that could have been good.
","The theatrical version of this movie sucks, but there was an unusual moral for a zombie flick in the original finale, allowing viewers to draw a reflection upon the usefulness of putting things in perspective by seeing a situation from another point of view -- meanwhile giving the movie's title its meaning. Sadly, this ending has been edited out by its director (most likely forced by lobbying groups pushing shady agendas through Hollywood -- perhaps aiming to encourage mind numbness so that people keep consuming thoughtlessly more useless stuff, or, more likely, to make room for a potential sequel about a guy shooting zombies in order to save them, so basically the same thing), when we find out Will Smith's character is the titled Legend scarring the Jesus out of still sentient infected human beings; hence showing these guys still had a consciousness (before being killed in cold blood in the name of science), albeit rudimentary, that was proving they retained the ability to communicate enough to create their own cultural folk tales and perhaps even art forms (with blood and flesh scattered in shape, much like modern art?). <br/><br/>Anyhow, it sucks this was edited out, since it might have triggered some ""rudimentarily conscious"" people to snap back to reality and feel the need to consider empathy through every action they do on a daily basis, having potential to impact others' lives as well and maybe stop acting so damn selfishly."

"Bob-45","6","0","1","23 July 2012"," ""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.""
","Lavishly produced and beautifully acted by Will Smith, ""I am Legend"" is but a shadow of the seminal novel by classic fantasy/science fiction writer Richard Matheson (""What Dreams May Come,"" ""A Stir of Echos,"" ""The (Incredible) Shrinking Man"" and ""Bid Time Return (""Somewhere in Time)"". ""...Legend,"" unfortunately more closely follows ""The Omega Man"" than ""The Last Man on Earth,"" the first film based upon Matheson's novel. Matheson conceived of a world-wide plague which not only killed EVERYONE but Dr. Robert Neville, it turned the undead into vampires. Thus, Neville's dual mission was to rid the world of vampires AND find a cure for the plague of which he was the only one immune. Since Neville was ""bringing peace"" to the undead, his actions were far more ""justifiable"" than Heston's (""The Omega Man) or Smith's (""I am Legend""). However, Neville learns many of the ""vampires"" he was killing were actually plague sufferers; and, among those who survived, Neville was a horrific ""legend,"" not a saintly one.<br/><br/>While ""I am Legend"" is much superior to ""Omega Man"" in dramatic terms, the plot holes are nearly as horrific as the plot. WHO set the ""booby trap"" for Neville? WHY did Anna or anyone else NOT respond to Neville's short wave transmission? WHY did the ""head ghoul"" take so much interest in Neville's latest human experiment? While I understand the last question is answered in the deleted scenes, movies must stand on their own narrative or be rightly criticized. I would love to see a ""Director's cut"" in order to ascertain whether or not these plot holes were closed. However, my primary criticism of the film (i.e., that Matheson's original theme has been turned on its head) would still apply. <br/><br/>""I am Legend"" is impressive to look at and to savor Will Smith's fine performance; but, it is otherwise shallow. In this exercise of Matheson's classic, life really is but ""...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing.""<br/><br/>I give ""I am Legend"" a weak ""6""."

","who is trying to find a cure...what are the odds? Let's examine the other head-scratchers: 1) Mother and son, as clean and well-scrubbed as models in a Macy's advertisement, appear out of nowhere, in the dead of night, to rescue the protagonist in the middle of a nighttime post-apocalyptic war zone that basically belongs to the zombies who have ten times the energy of the acrobats in a Cirque du Soleil show.<br/><br/>2) re: #1 above, Macy's model mother and her Macy's model son manage to rescue the unconscious protagonist and take him to his house, when they would have no idea where he lives.<br/><br/>3) Bacon bacon where's the bacon (I was saving that bacon) 4) Creepy mannequin social networking 5) Hunting deer from your car, we had a word for people like that where I grew up and it's not polite to repeat it here. Seriously, that's not how you hunt deer...who wrote the script? Everyone knows you stalk them silently while they're grazing, you don't chase after them while they're running, that's just lame.<br/><br/>6) Dr. Neville has the ability, in his rinky-dink basement lab, to reverse a condition that has probably taken a huge corporation years, millions of dollars, and hundreds of research scientists to unleash upon the world. Oh, and he still has plenty of time left over to hit golf balls, browse for dvds, and putter around NYC, because somehow devoting every minute you have to curing a disease that has rendered you the last man on earth takes a back seat to flirting with a mannequin with a bob haircut.<br/><br/>7) Worst CGI lions in film history, even worse than the CGI wolves in The Day After Tomorrow. They look like cartoon lions. I half expected to see Hanna Barbera credited for the lions in the credits.<br/><br/>8) What have the zombies lived on for the last three years? Nothing on earth can survive that long without eating.<br/><br/>9) Dr. Neville didn't see the cable attached to Fred? 10) I heard that Tom Cruise was considered for the role; in terms of acting ability, is Smith simply not Cruise's tepid contemporary? They could be used interchangeably in any role. Try to convince me that if they had used Smith for the War of the Worlds, complete with Smithlet (Willow), that most audience members could not have told the difference.<br/><br/>11) Lest you think I'm being hard on his acting ability, would an accomplished actor desperately resort to shirtless chin-ups and that exaggerated swagger in his walk in order to add depth to his character? As ""the last man on earth"", he isn't convincing; he should be ten times stranger than what we're seeing on the screen. Quoting Shrek doesn't make him strange, but if the Macy's model kid put in several dvds one after the other and he could quote them all, that would have made him strange, and we would have had a sense of what he was going through.<br/><br/>12) He hasn't seen a single living person in three years, and yet reacts to blithely to the Macy's model people, who pop up out of nowhere. Would he not be in shock from seeing them? Boy am I glad to see you, where did you come from, how did you get here, etc. The woman and her kid are similarly lukewarm. This just isn't how people would act under these circumstances, they look bored with each other."

","First, I'd like to say that if this movie was titled something else, and the story wasn't supposedly borrowed from Richard Matheson's book, this review might be different. However, it *is* titled I am Legend, and it is SUPPOSEDLY an adaptation of said novel, and is a terrible one at that. The story after his solitude diverges completely from the book, so if you are looking for a great post-apocalyptic story of a man's struggle for his own humanity, look elsewhere. Or, even better, buy the book. Or the audio-book. But DO NOT watch this movie. It loses the entire meaning of the book and should not even have the same title, considering the last line of the novel lends the book (and, ironically, the movie) it's title. I give this movie a 3 for the sheer fact that Will Smith's acting was great, and, as I said before, it would be somewhere in the ""5"" range if it was not a massacre of the story so artfully constructed by Matheson."

I would never have expected that to be the case for a Will Smith vehicle but he has tackle the other generic monster fare in previous outings...mostly in the form of Aliens.<br/><br/>The length is a great cue for the set up of a prequel which is reportedly already in development.

","Will Smith at the moment is the world only superstar which could ensure a studio can make big profit in any film he stars in. Since 2002 he has not had a flop film, Men in Black II, Boy Boys II, I, Robot, Hitch, The Pursuit of Happiness and Hancock: some of them are actually pretty good. He is a unique position to do what ever he wants and now produces many of his films. But even with I Am Legend it demands a lot from an actor, because he has the carry the film all by himself. But luckily he does in a film that works.<br/><br/>In the 2012 most of the world has be whipped out or turned in a vampire-zombie hybrid (the Darkseekers). They act like zombie, surviving just to eat flesh of any animal, but can not go out in sunlight. They seem to lack any humanity. Also animals like rats and dogs can be inflected by the virus. In New York there is only one man left, Robert Neville (Will Smith), with his dog Sam, his only companion. He is a army officer and a virologist, who spends his days researching for a cure, hunting and growing food, exercising, sending out radio messages, and waiting for possible survivors at South Street Seaport. He does try to keep active just keep his mind from frying, like watching DVDs, old TV boardcasts and playing golf off an aircraft carrier. At night he stays in his home, staying alert in case there is an attack by the Darkseekers. Robert Neville at night suffer from flashbacks when the virus gets out and when he takes his wife and young daughter Marley (Salli Richardson and Willow Smith) to Brooklyn Bridge to fled the city. There is renewed hope for humanity when one of his formulas starts to work on a inflected rat. He needs a Darkseeker to ensure that the cure would work on humans.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a good film, but it's also a film of two halves. There is the really good half showing Robert Neville as a man by himself and a fascinating look of the effects of isolation from humanity, showing signs that his mental facilities are starting to slip. Will Smith gives an excellent performance of a man on the edge who had to life at every turn, and on a desperate mission to save the world by himself. There is a good emotional drive, particularly involving his Sam (I don't want to give the game away). As a psychological film it works. What lets the film down is the action side. They are some decent action scenes, and they are some moments that are really good like the beam of sunlight dividing Sam and the infected dogs. But the director Francis Lawrence was too reliant on CGI. It was pretty obvious when he used to for animals like deers and lions, and especially on the Darkseekers. It would have looked more realistic, effective and scary (and properly cheaper) to cast actors and get a good make-up team to put prosthetic on them.<br/><br/>Besides from the CGI, Francis Lawrence does offer a steady hand behind the camera and he does have potential as a director. He does have some problems and I think he needs to direct a smaller project just to prove what he can do. Ridley Scott and Guillermo del Toro were linked to the film and I think though two could have made a good film even better. Del Toro would have been really suited to the material. But Michael Bay also at one point was going to direct and we all know that would have been a CGI porn explosion fest.<br/><br/>A little note, this was the film that got me in Bob Marley, having his song played throughout it, which is never a bad thing.<br/><br/>If you enjoy post-apocalyptic fiction like 28 Days Later or Stephen King's the Stand then you should enjoy I Am Legend."

","About 40 years ago, my parents and younger siblings went camping. I opted out mainly because I was developing into a surly teenager. One night, I stayed up all night for the first time in my life and happened to catch on the late late show, Vincent Price's film ""The Last Man on Earth"". I was all alone in the house and that movie scared the willies out of me. I've seen it since as an adult and it wasn't quite as frightening. It was based on the book ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson, as was the picture of 2007. I was of the impression that Will Smith did an excellent job of portraying the driven and lonely scientist who believed he and his dog, Samantha, were the only non-infected creatures left in the world. Of course, he is trying without any success to find a cure to the man-made disease that has turned the city into a haven for ravenous creatures that fear of the daylight. Smith for the most of the picture has only his dog and their environs to react to and I believe he does a credible job. The vampire angle of the novel and the first movie is less-prominent; the infected people behave as if they have rabies and cannot stand ultraviolet light, so every night Smith's character has to lock himself inside his fortress of a home and wait for the dawn.<br/><br/>The scene where Smith has to kill his dog because she's infected is the most moving in the whole film. It's ironic that the trap he catches himself in, ending in his friend Samantha being bitten by an infected dog, was probably one of his that he had forgot setting. Of course, there's another possibility: the hemocytes may be more intelligent than Smith's character believes.<br/><br/>Definitely not a ""feelgood"" movie...

Immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and perhaps the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague,the infected,lurk in the shadows... watching Neville's every move... waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered and quickly running out of time...The novel ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson, which I haven't read, must be a hell of a book because this is the third adaptation to film that has been made so far.I didn't watch The Last Man On Earth(1964) neither The Omega Man(1971) and therefor I really can't make comparisons. As a stand-alone piece of work (which is probably how this film should be seen),I think I Am Legend is a very solid film and a great addiction to its genre.The film is highly entertaining although I'm sure,many will complain about the slow pace,which is nonsense because,the story unveils very nicely and watching Robert Neville,played by Will Smith, wandering around trough the streets of a deserted yet beautiful New York City with his faithful companion, a German shepherd called Samantha, is a pleasure and quite frankly, doesn't get boring. Even watching Neville's daily routine is interesting.And even more satisfying is watching Neville dealing with extreme loneliness and how he desperately attempts not to go insane. Trough brief flashbacks were also shown what happen to Neville's family and how the chaos in the city started.Many people have complained about the infected aka Dark Seekers's look (they were computer-generated), but honestly,even if you don't like it, it is a minor flaw that doesn't detract from the quality of the film. Will Smith delivers one of the best performances of his career, and the more dramatic the scene, the more he shines.Very impressive.

","Will Smith plays the last man on Earth in the 3 or so adaptation of I am legend. It's a film that is good but not great. It's got good visuals and scares but I can't quite say that it's one of the best films of the decade. I bring that up for one reason mostly. Ben Lyons, Roger Ebert's original replacement on At the movies, said that it was one of the best films ever. That guy is mentally challenged or something. He didn't really like Doubt. I can assure you that I am legend is not better than Doubt, but it is still an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>There isn't all that much to the plot. Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist who is the last man on Earth. He is immune to the disease that occurred years ago. This disease was the cure for cancer, and everyone was actually infected by it. So Neville tries to survive nowaday from the infected zombies. He soon finds a way to cure the zombie like people. But he can't quite help at the moment. Zombie-like things aren't that understanding.<br/><br/>Smith is really the only famous person in this movie. Though Emma Thompson makes an appearance in the beginning. I will repeat myself once more. and hopefully I won't have to do it again. I am legend ain't art. It doesn't really come close. It scared me a few times and you know I actually think Will Smith can act. I know he likes to do ""Oh hell no!"" throughout everyone of his films, but I like him.

","In my eyes this movie is probably one of Will Smith's best roles ever with The Pursuit of Happiness being the other. The scale of this movie is unbelievable, when he is driving around New York in the opening scene it really shows the scale of it, the emptiness of it.New York is a very big place and so far this is one of the few movies that has managed to show that on screen. It starts with a very nice scene of him and his dog Sam going around New York during the day. It moves on to where they are at home eating dinner and washing up, but soon it turns to night and the whole hose is put on Lockdown, the shutters are closed, all the doors are closed and will and Sam get to the safest place they can........the bathtub. As they sleep you can hear the noise of the infected outside the house they're in and the terrified look in will's eyes is very believable. This just really gets the movie going, it shows exactly what happens every day for them. As the story progresses we lose a beloved member of the cast.......Sam. Sam gets bitten by an infected dog and will brings her back to his lab and tries to inject her with the cure, but as he holds her he finds out that the cure he picked doesn't work on dogs and we lose Sam as a character. This scene had me in tears the whole way through and has me in tears every time i watch this film. As it continues will goes crazy from the depression and nearly gets himself killed until a fellow survivor saves him. They returned to the house and tried to get away from it by hiding in the lab but the infected got in, will gets the fellow survivor and her daughter to hide in a safe and will cocks a grenade and blows himself and the infected up. The woman and daughter get out the next day and find a safe zone free of infected and full of other survivors.

Unfortunately, once the pathogen was released into the general population, scientists discovered to their horror that people rapidly started to exhibit rabies like symptoms (aggression, photo-sensitivity) and it wasn't long before civilisation crumbled.<br/><br/>Smith's character, Dr. Robert Neville, is one of the few who have a natural immunity to the infection and, having survived alone in an abandoned New York City for three years he is still desperately searching for a cure. Problem is, he can only go out during the day, as at night the infected roam the streets, and for his research he must lure infectees into traps to work on as live subjects in his lab. It can only be a matter of time until his luck runs out....<br/><br/>Coming over as a cross between Twelve Monkeys (the virus) and 28 Days Later (the infected), this is a cautionary apocalyptic tale, based on Richard Matheson's book of the same name.<br/><br/>The first hour is superb, detailing the life of a man driven by a will to succeed in his seemingly futile attempts to find a cure, as well as showing us that, as time progresses and, having been alone for so long, he is starting to become slightly unbalanced.<br/><br/>The set pieces here are glorious and, though it does become a CGI-fest at times towards the climax, I can forgive it as it is so very well executed.

"ShootingShark","7","0","1","25 September 2009"," Exciting, Intelligent, Visually Charged Story Of Last Man On Earth
","After a lethal virus decimates Earth's population by ninety percent, Robert Neville is the sole survivor living in the remnants of New York City. His existence is perilous though; he shares the city with hordes of rabid subhuman vampires who come out at night <br/><br/>This excellent adaptation of the brilliant Richard Matheson's seminal 1954 pulp horror novel is a fantastic looking, scary, touching, spectacular fright flick, with a particularly fine performance from Smith in the lead. Lawrence's direction is exemplary, effortlessly creating the empty, overgrown, forgotten NYC so crucial to the atmosphere. This is not just effective use of visual effects - such as the strangely beautiful shots of the shattered Brooklyn Bridge - but everything; music, editing, and most of all, acting. Actors often play dumb in fantasy stories like this, but Smith really goes for a fearless depth in his exasperation, dogged pursuit of a solution, aching loneliness and borderline insanity. In the scene where he is forced to kill his beloved dog Sam, Lawrence holds a big long closeup of his agonised face - this is bravura acting. The whole of the first hour is full of this evocative drama and eye-popping visuals. I must confess I think the movie goes a little downhill in the last act, with a couple of improbable plot twists and a relatively happy conclusion which deviates completely from Matheson's much more logical and satisfactory original ending. This is a minor complaint however - it's still nail-biting stuff throughout; a refreshingly grown-up big budget horror film without unnecessary gore, smartass dialogue, profanity or stupid comic relief. Featuring great music by the prolific James Newton Howard and stylish photography by Andrew Lesnie (The Lord Of The Rings), as well as a bunch of nice old Bob Marley songs. Trivia - Smith's daughter in the flashback sequences is played by his real life daughter Willow, and Emma Thompson appears unbilled at the start as the amusingly named Dr Krippin, the unwitting architect of mankind's destruction. Filmed twice before, as The Last Man On Earth (with Vincent Price) in 1964, and The Omega Man (with Charlton Heston) in 1971, both of which are good, but this is the best of the three. Top-notch horror/science-fiction fare."

","This movie is good in that it takes many of the concepts discussed in Alan Weisman's book, ""The World Without Us"" with regards to how the city infrastructure degrades over time. Also, the basic plot line is very similar to that in the movie ""The Last Man on Earth"" which is available on Cult of UHF on iTunes. <br/><br/>Some of the major differences between I am Legend and The Last Man on Earth is that in I Am Legend, the infected individuals lose their hair and become quite athletic. There are several scenes in which the infected are seen running and seem to possess great strength. Conversely, in The Last Man on Earth, the infected humans have reduced mental capacity and are also quite weak. In The Last Man on Earth, the infected humans are found on a normal basis by the lone survivor during his daily trips and he disposes of them in a large burning inferno."

","Thought this was a turkey from the arrogant title (oh, it's from the original book), and I'm really not a big fan of Will Smith, who I long thought cruised to great fame with a modicum of talent. But, this is a dandy, terrifying, sci-fri, zombie-vampire last man on earth movie.. and Will Smith turns out a tremendous nuanced performance. The shot of him cringing in the bathtub as night falls is an indication of how good he is in this virtual nonstop monologue, on screen almost every second, but he cycles through every emotion: hysteria, desperation, longing, madness, resolution, denial, disbelief, terror, agony all told it's an Oscar nomination worthy performance.<br/><br/>The creatures are fearsome hairless mutant humans, able to run 40 mph, climb walls, take 5 shots and keep coming.. and of course with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. The hiding from light of course is vampire behavior and zombies are supposed to be slow and dull witted, but who says genres are fixed in stone. This movie looks good- the scenes of an abandoned derelict New York are magnificent, the music is moving and ominous and the whole premise is deeply terrifying. Smith makes this movie work, and it really is a tremendous piece of work."

","When I was first told the premise of this film, I was interested. The whole world (read, everyone in the USA) has been turned into vampires except this one guy, who goes around hunting them. (He doesn't, necessarily - his interests are wider than that.) Unfortunately, the guy is Will Smith. Oh well, once you are comfortable and intrigued by the New York city landscape turning to wilderness, what you going to do? Will Smith (or a long list of stunt people, who were nominated for an award) rips around NYC in a 4WD/SUV with an intelligent dog and music blaring, ready to fire at anything that moves (bar some kind of antelope).<br/><br/>Robert Neville, this survivor, is so *methodical*. And his methods work. Also, he has so many personas. There is Colonel Robert Neville, doing his duty and saving his city. The flippant Robert Neville, flirting with mannequins. Scientist Robert Neville. Fit and careful Robert Neville, who makes sure he and his dog survive by following his own rules. There is scared Robert Neville, who I very much identify with. And of course, vulnerable Robert Neville.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is that it is so SCARY. I seriously thought of not watching it, or at least lining my stomach with a glass of milk to prevent an ulcer.<br/><br/>Edit: I was told the novel was written 50 years ago, and I loved the concept, so I read it. I think the film is a fair if not superior adaptation. For example, I don't find the vampires in the book very scary. Robert Neville fist-fights a few of them at once, which he would not be able to do with the fast, strong vampires of the movie. Similarly, the vampires of the book know where he lives from the start, and can't get in the house. The technology in the book is old (eg a watch that needs winding, projectors instead of DVD players); if you had to be true to that technology, you'd end up making a period film."

","After reading numerous reviews (Ebert, in particular) that belittle this movie's repetition of the Zombie/Terror/Monster aesthetic, I am flabbergasted in the lack of recognition for the talent in Will Smith, and how he can make a 1 character movie so powerful.<br/><br/>Whether or not this is politically correct, Will Smith is the African American Tom Hanks. Or maybe vice versa. And the comparison is no more clear than with ""I Am Legend"" and ""Cast Away."" Both characters are fighting to survive in a hopeless, solitary state, wherein they exhibit amazing epiphanies about human psychology, and how we need to be social creatures, even if the creatures we confide in are not ""real."" For Tom Hanks (Cast Away), that personified character is Wilson, an inanimate volleyball of whom all of Hanks's fears, hopes, and determinations fall upon. For Smith, this need for an ""illogical"" socialization is profoundly (and disturbingly) addressed in his cordial conversations that he conducts in an abandoned record store with mannequins that stare blankly ahead despite his charming, yet fragile persona.<br/><br/>This review is intended for those that have seen the movie, and are willing to accept that this movie tackles starkly serious human issues regarding the human need to preserve life, and the contrasting battle for an individual who is reeling from the loss of his family, and is battling from the subsequent, pervasive loneliness.<br/><br/>This is NOT a Zombie movie. Rather, this is a passionate and powerfully executed glimpse into how a human may react in an incredibly inhuman situation.<br/><br/>This is a movie about determination, hope, and heroism. And Will Smith is the ONLY actor alive, besides Tom Hanks, that can make a 1 Man Movie so powerful.<br/><br/>Michael Oliveri moliveri80@gmail.com"

","The religious content of this movie hints that even when things are going real bad, there might still be a God, and he/she might help us get out of it. Dogmas like that ruins peoples critical sense, and is very irrespective of the actual children that die of hunger each day. For instance the recent plane crash where everybody survived and people thanked God for the seemingly miraculous landing, but where was God when all the other fatal plane crashes in history occurred?<br/><br/>1) The existence of God is a theory that cannot be falsified. This makes it useless as a scientific theory. Why? Because that's how science works. Propose a falsifiable theory. Make a prediction based on the theory. See if experimental evidence matches the theory, or if the theory is falsified.<br/><br/>This does not make the belief in the existence of God pointless as a motivating or inspirational factor for scientists. It just makes it pointless as an explanatory mechanism.<br/><br/>2) No, engineers study nature to see how to better manufacture things. Scientists study nature to determine the nature of things, and to provide explanatory reasons as to why things are the way they are. The minute you allow the existence of God as an explanatory mechanism, all other science goes out the window.<br/><br/>e.g. Why do things fall? Cause God wants them to.<br/><br/>3) Religious centers like churches and mosques specializes in arguments from their side of the discussion, but I assure you, for every religious argument there is an equal counter-argument. The goal of Science is to become as sure as we can about things, the goal of religion is to confuse people into a mist of claims with no real criticism. Religion can easily turn into fanaticism, but it's just as easy to teach people that not many things are very definite. For instance, I can claim I am the reborn Jesus, and you can't easily counter that. It's something I learned at school, which helped me develop some healthy skepticism."
"jayson_firestorm","6","0","1","13 January 2009"," Some good ideas, but ultimately doesn't quite work
","This is the third movie version of Richard Matheson's 1954 book 'I Am Legend', coming after 1964's 'The Last Man on Earth' and 1971's 'The Omega Man'. (There are several other versions also, such as 2007's poorly received 'I Am Omega'(!), but these are the two of note). Although I hadn't seen 'The Last Man on Earth' until very recently, after 'I Am Legend' was released, I was a fan of 'The Omega Man', although felt that parts of it let the film down, and was keen to see what a modern remake would do with the concept. <br/><br/>Will Smith gives a very good and likable performance as the lead, Robert Neville. I never used to be overly keen on Smith  I found him rather bigheaded in 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air', but he has emerged as one of the better actors of the era. <br/><br/>Naturally, being a modern movie, the director and producers are obliged to bombard us with a lot of CGI. In fairness, they don't go completely over the top, as some movies of the era have, but even so, there is a fair bit of it. And I wasn't totally keen  the 'monsters' of the movie look too animalistic and too fake; I couldn't really believe in them within the context of the movie, and are one of the things that ultimately lets the film down. We never fully get a 'grip' on the infected beings  it lacks the vampire background of 'The Last Man on Earth' or the hooded beings against science of 'The Omega Man', and this key area of the movie winds up feeling slightly hollow as a result. <br/><br/>There are some good moments  the opening sections of the film are very good, and interestingly filmed. Likewise, Robert Neville is presented to the audience as a likable and intelligent hero. I did feel, though, that it didn't unfold quite as well as 'The Omega Man'. <br/><br/>Aside from being based upon the same novel, 'The Omega Man' and this movie also have something else in common  they both have very promising starts, but the second half of both movies really fall flat. There is the section where Neville gets caught in the trap, which I never really understood, and from there, where he meets survivors Anna and her son Ethan, proceedings rather take a nosedive. <br/><br/>The one big problem with the film is that it can't really decide what it wants to be. The premise of a man being able to go anywhere in the city he pleases by day, but trapped inside his home at night if full of possibilities, and  in both this movie and 'The Omega Man'  begins with this in mind. The early sequences of both films are great, but both ultimately lose their way. In particular, 'I Am Legend' can never really decide what to do with itself. It should be darker and scarier. <br/><br/>The ending is as shocking as it is surprising. I'm mostly glad they went with this and not the alternate ending, which didn't really work for me. <br/><br/>Although I haven't read the original novel, reading up on it online reveals that there are a number of things that haven't made it into the movie. Some have appeared in previous versions, but as yet no version has been completely true to the original book. It appears that in many ways the novel is the best version  I think I might try and track down a copy."

","Welcome to the Wil Smith movie. We catch up with Col. Robert Neville and his family trying to get off Manhattan after some deadly type of virus as seemed to be released. They have a heck of a time but the real story is Robert Neville living on a desolate Manhattan and how he gets along. Smith's performance as Col. Dr. Robert Neville is wonderful. Seeing so much of him living in the ruble and the home he creates for himself is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away. There is no volleyball unless you want to count the German Shepard dog. The problem in the movie is by way of the script which at times has more holes than my ganma's undies. There are scenes which are almost unbearable and then there are instances that just defy logic. <br/><br/>Does the movie look good? Well, yeah. The film is full of rich, sweeping cinematography and more CG than I shake a stick at. I Am Legend is a spectacular film that you can see again and a again which is a lot to say of a 2007 film. On a side note here: the movie you see at the theater or on HBO is not the movie the Wil and the director wanted you to see. The original adaptation of the movie can be downloaded and I think seen on the limited edition DVD. And, as usual, the movie is not the book the material is based on. The script adaptation gets a bad c- but the film is just too cool to pass by just for that. **/****."
"mollidew","10","0","2","20 October 2008"," I Am Legend
","The most recent version of I Am Legend had a lot of problems with budget. It was suggested for remake a number of times but shelved due to soaring costs. This is what they came up with that worked and fit into budget. I hope people understand this. Will Smith did an excellent job in the part of Neville. He really showed the isolation of the character and how he held it in because he had the dog. I have the original book and it is somewhat different but this is an adaptation. All of them have been but the first movie, ""Last Man On Earth"" showed the beings to be what Matheson wrote, ""vampires."" They were not zombies but his vision of a type of vampire-like state that developed. In the first movie Neville (Vincent Price) went out by day staking them. As they made more adaptations screenwriters brought out the more zombie like nature of his vampires. They were not patterned after the Eastern European vampires most identify with. Matheson wrote some of the screenplay for the first movie with Vincent Price but he didn't like how it turned out. One has to keep within a budget and so what one can do in a book cannot always be translated onto the big screen the same way.<br/><br/>This version was very good and they were the Dark Seekers and Hemocytes. They were vampires too that many are calling zombies. If you see the cover of the book first released again to publication prior to the Will Smith's cover they have fangs more or less. I don't know what the producers are saying but the book is about people transforming into vampires and that is why they didn't come out into the sun except for the adaptation,Night of the Comet which was very loosely based on the story and only inspired by it.<br/><br/>All in all I really liked it and felt it could have had a better ending for the viewing audience than the predictable killing him off, martyr. It would have been nice for once if the man got away and was awestruck by the surprise that there really was a colony in the end. Sort of the beat up man living in isolation finally finding others and a new life. His character was never suppose to be a doctor anyway. Each group that takes this on makes their own changes very similarly to the things Spielberg does when he ruined War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>I have to say though standing on its own merits I thought the movie was a 10."
"ARTaylor","7","0","1","18 October 2008"," Forget the Theatrical Version, Watch the Alternate Ending
","Simply put, the theatrical ending is the happy, Hollywood ending. The alternate (note that it's also the original) ending makes the movie make sense, better captures the spirit of the book, and is just better.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie in theaters. Perhaps because I never read the book nor seen the other versions so I had absolutely no expectations. Since then I have read the book (a must read) and at least seen Last Man on Earth (no masterpiece either). Though I realize what the movie did wrong I still like it.<br/><br/>From an adaptation standpoint, it's really lousy. Except for the name, a dog, and creatures that come out at night there's very little in common. That's not necessarily bad. It's an updated version of an old book written in a different time with a different mode of thinking. This does bring it to modern times. As a movie, it's good. Not great, just good. The first half is a great movie, it's the rest that falls apart.<br/><br/>Neville is enjoyable, though the dog seems to be the best character. You can tell that his quest to stay sane may actually be driving him insane. The scenes of isolation are fun. The scene in the building is definitely scary. Sam's death is sad. I think if they had actually shown what happened to his wife it would have ruined the scene(s). The CGI used to make NYC empty looks fantastic. If the movie had kept up the first half it would have been great.<br/><br/>The movie starts to descend when Neville attacks the Darkseekers on the seaport. First, the CGI for the creatures is terrible. Why is it that CGI looks worse 14 YEARS after Jurassic Park? I heard that they actually did go with make-up and prosthetics but it didn't look convincing so they went to CGI. Could it really have looked that much worse? The creatures are fine in the dark when you hardly see them. But they're simply not scary to see especially so clearly. It's not scary when it's clearly not real. And why are they suddenly superhuman? Why are they jumping and climbing like Spider-Man? Adding Anna and Ethan makes it weird(er), not simply because of the plot holes it brings up. Showing up at just the right moment seemed like deus ex machina, not that the scene really was going anywhere. It's almost like they didn't know how to end it so they added those two and this Vermont colony to give it some semblance of an end destination.<br/><br/>Then there's the big climax. Where do I begin?<br/><br/>It needs to be put into context. Originally, Neville realized that the creatures had made their own society (much like the book) and gave back the female. He apologized, they all left, and he realized he had been the monster. That version humanized them, proved Neville wrong about human behavior being completely absent, and explained a great deal of their behavior. But the studio didn't like that so they came up with the feel- good ending the theaters saw. Then they really were just monsters, mindless, uncompromising, wanted only destruction, and Neville is the undoubted good guy. The Hollywood ending. The lousy attempt to copy the ending to Smith's earlier movie Independence Day.<br/><br/>But it doesn't make sense. It needlessly created more plot holes. How could they remake his own trap? How can the Alpha-Male control the others or the dogs? How can they plan an attack? Why are they so against him suddenly? Even by Hollywood standards, having Neville blow himself up to save humanity is too narcissistic. And going to Vermont is like the theatrical ending to Blade Runner. It's completely out of sync with the dystopian world seen before that.<br/><br/>The reason it was changed: the Iraq War. The movie is a response to it, but the different endings give different responses (think the minor change in the ending to the '78 Body Snatchers remake versus the original). The original ending brings into question our (USA's) true role there. That maybe, the US could be the monsters just as Neville is and our enemies may have some motive beyond total destruction. The theatrical ending is pure patrioticness. ""We will fight and we WILL win."" We are undoubtedly good and they are undoubtedly bad. Yes, because Heaven forbid that humanity (specifically America) isn't absolutely perfect and our enemies aren't simply monsters. How dare the line between good and evil isn't clear cut and (shockingly enough) blurred. Notice how the colony is so over the top Americana with the perfect little white church and the large US flag in the background. It's completely designed to pump you up and make you feel good. This undermines the theme of the book and the fact that humanity did this to itself.<br/><br/>The alternate ending doesn't fix all the movie's mistakes, but it makes it far better. If it had ended as originally intended it probably would be seen in a better light. I recommend to anyone to see the alternate ending. Even if you didn't like the theatrical version it's worth a look. It gives the movie an entirely different tone and at least touches on the book's themes. Theatrically, it's a 5 out of 10. Half is good, half is bad. The original ending kicks it up a few notches so the ending has some saving grace."

I felt that the movie was too short and could have shown more flash backs of how it all happen and also more scenes of the every day life of ""Robert Neville's"" desperate search for a cure to rid the world of blood thirsty vampires to bring back the human race from the brink of destruction. This film is a lot deeper then what meets eye.

","From director Francis Lawrence (Constantine), this is quite a good remake of classics The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man, but just like Signs, it could have been perfect without flashbacks and slowing scenes. The film begins with an interview from Dr. Alice Krippin ( Emma Thompson) who has apparently found the cure for cancer, it then cute to three years later, 2012, in deserted New York City, grass breaking through pavement, cars rusting and buildings covered in plastic. Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) and his dog Sam are the only ones living there, and Neville is not only surviving and keeping out of the dark away from the vampire-like zombie creatures, affected by the virus, but he is still trying to find the cure for the virus, testing it on rats, and then humans. The flashbacks by the way sees he saying goodbye to his wife Zoe (Salli Richardson) and son Marley (Willow Smith) as the city is being evacuated. After Sam is killed, Neville attempts suicide or revenge (maybe a bit of both), he finds survivors Anna (Alice Braga) and Ethan (Charlie Tahan), and it seems they might be more danger than they think when he takes them back to his place. But it turns out he has found a cure, and he thought it had failed, but predictably, he is not the one to give the authorities the cure, and he sacrifices himself. It isn't as scary or as inventive as I'd hoped it could have been, but Smith is quite engaging as the one survivor, if only the ending wasn't so predictable. Worth watching!"

He is always delivering strong performances whether in romantic comedies such as Hitch or dramas like The Pursuit of Happiness. In I am Legend, Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist who happens to be the only survivor in New York city to a deadly epidemic because of his immunity to the virus that's causing the epidemic.The epidemic has killed several and transformed others into vampire-like zombies who are sensitive to UV rays. With that in mind Neville(smith) roams the day wandering around the abandoned New York city looking for 'infected' zombies to trap and possibly find a cure for the epidemic. The film has superb acting and a good chemistry...between Smith and his dog. The two shine in this PG-13 remake that surpasses the original.<br/><br/>I was reading some of the user comments on this film, and one user complained about the film's CGI. I agree 100%. The zombies in this film didn't look nothing as good as zombies from other movies in the same genre such as 28 Days Later and Dawn of The Dead. And the zombies did look like they walked straight out of a video game. But I think the makers might have decided to create CGI zombies instead of real people with prosthetics for a reason. I think the reason is that they wanted to keep it as PG-13 as possible. Still though, I believe they could have done better with the special effects and make up.<br/><br/>Other than that minor problem, I am Legend is another masterpiece coming from the fresh prince. The film caught my attention from beginning to end and the film ended with a predictable but very touching and powerful ending. Spectacular film."

","I have often visited IMDb to search reviews and comments about movies I might like to see and have never been compelled to write a review as I am right now about this movie. I keep seeing over and over again how this movie is not up to par with the original novel or how the effects were the only redeemable part of the movie, but I believe that often times what may not be so easy to catch with the eye might have been more easily observed written on paper.<br/><br/>When I walked into the theater I was excited, because I know Will Smith is a great actor, both an ingenious comedian, and can bring heart-wrenching emotion to the big (and small) screen. From the start the movie is set in an apocalyptic scene with an underlying ""cure for cancer gone mad"" sort of thing. For most of the movie we watch as Smith (who plays Neville, some sort of scientist/doctor)struggle with the absolute isolation and silence, his only companion a dog, and his mentality on the verge of insanity. Smith portrays his character in such a way that we pity him and become attached to his dog as much as his character is. The movie unfolds into his struggle with these ""undead"", more like people mutated by the cure and who can find their prey by the scent of their blood. It might seem like this is clichéd, but for only one detail that seems oddly at of place and that underlies the story.<br/><br/>Sending radio messages every day, with a stroke of luck one woman and her child found Smith almost killed by the what-you-would-call zombies. It is odd that story seems to take a religious twist, and seems out of place in the plot. It was not until the final closing words that details that seemed so insignificant finally pull the story together. Of course I never read the book, and don't know what the intention of the scriptwriter was, but when the woman at the end met with other survivors saying that Smith's character, Neville, had been their savior, it all made sense.<br/><br/>It seems that the producers had taken a very grown up, and modern twist to the likes of how C.S. Lewis put his rendition of the story of Jesus. I'm not saying that in every aspect Smith's character represents Jesus, but the odd details, especially if one played close attention to the barren New York City. Here are some clues, for one the main plot is set about 1000 days after the incident. That almost 3 years. Around New York City there are signs of Christmas, signifying what event? Near the end what does Smith discover that will save the life of the woman, child, and people that escaped to Vermont. Why is it that there is a single ""zombie"" that seems to lead the pack? What does Smith have to do to destroy the ""zombies""? What is the name of the city in Vermont where the woman and child escape? Answer these questions and you'll start to see a pattern. Probably watching the movie again will give more clues, but do not throw away this movie for what you think might be faults. I believe that all the information you needed was there in front of you, those other details, like back-story, might not be all that necessary.<br/><br/>I give this movie a solid 10, for the great acting, unbelievable special affects, and a solid plot that might need a second look, and some thought, to truly understand its depth.<br/><br/>p.s. Think about the title ""I Am..... Legend"", where have we heard (part) of that before...."
"dfle3","7","0","1","3 July 2008"," A good evocation of a catastrophe and derelict major city
","Having posted up some reviews of ""old school"" zombie movies here (by George A. Romero), I thought I'd post up one for this Hollywood blockbuster variation (Romero was not mainstream and worked on shoe-string budgets).<br/><br/>Will Smith, playing military scientist Robert Neville, finds himself in a world which has imploded after a medical virus which seemed to cure cancer goes feral, creating 'zombie' humans and seems to leave him as the sole, unaffected survivor-at least in New York, but perhaps the world too.<br/><br/>Smith manages to hold our attention despite being the sole human character for much of the movie (there are flashbacks where his character is seen with his wife etc). One of the strengths of the movie is the relationship Smith shares with his pet dog-sort of like the relationship Max has with his mutt in Mad Max 2 (I posted up a review of that here earlier today).<br/><br/>Perhaps the best reason to see this movie is for it's depiction of a derelict New York. These are the most effective evocations of a world gone wrong.<br/><br/>One gripe about this movie is the representation of the 'zombies' in this movie. In the latter scenes, these affected humans cease to be plausible representations of victims of a mutant virus (um, I don't want to get into a debate about 'realistic' depictions of zombies though!).<br/><br/>In fact, one of the most effective scenes is when we see these things up close for the first time. It's really unnerving and scary. That was a bit of an opportunity lost, I thought, in not going down that road. In trying to be novel about the zombies, it goes in a less satisfying direction than it could have. Even with a budget, Romero didn't overdo the zombies in his movie.<br/><br/>Given the subject nature of this movie and the fact that it is an American movie, it's not really surprising that you get religious references in this movie-from posters, to theological discussions. Not a huge downer, but it does get tiresome having many American movies behaving like God botherers.<br/><br/>Watch this movie for its evocation of a derelict New York. It looks REALLY cool."
"bilborough64","8","0","1","11 June 2008"," Wonderful movie, but a remake
","I thought this was a well done movie, but like a lot of things in Hollywood it's been done before. <br/><br/>This might be insulting to those who don't like Charleton Heston's work or they may not like Charleton Heston period, but this was all done in the movie ""The Omega Man"", down to the last vial of blood that the hero gives to the woman and child in order to save mankind. Wil Smith does an excellent job as the chemist who is obsessed with finding a cure for the virus he possible created. I thought his character was on the edge of going mad.<br/><br/>I won't tell you the ending in ""The Omega Man"". You should make up your minds yourself."
"Siloty","10","0","3","3 June 2008"," absolutely stunning
","I've seen this movie twice at the theatres and own the book so i am easily a fan of I Am Legend.<br/><br/>there are quite a lot of differences between the movie and the book. but the movie pulled it off quite well, it was great.<br/><br/>the emptiness of New York has a pure eeriness about it which is an awesome feel for the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Will Smith is a great actor but his performance in this movie as Robert Neville is just a masterpiece. Having to entertain the audience on screen being the only human for over an hour. Showing us what his day to day life consists of, and showing us a semi-madness that his character has developed after being isolated for so long.<br/><br/>like the book the movie uses flashbacks and in the movie they are well placed and give us those bits of information we need to put the pieces of the plot together.<br/><br/>the disappointment with this movie is i reckon it actually could have gone on a bit longer to explore into the character of Robert Neville, exactly what he is doing and the stuff he is going through and what is happening to him. and the quick change for the last 30-40 mins of the movie, needed a longer transition but other than these this movie is definitely worth it and great."
"dsd1","9","0","3","29 May 2008"," One of the most entertaining movies
","This is just a movie filled with a lot of heart shown by Will Smith. He is excellent delivering a movie well done by special effects and also being the last man alive. The part of the film that was truly heartwrenching was when he survived the attack with the infected creatures and rescued by a son and mother. Overall at first he has a lot of rage with them but later saved them by killing himself. The outburst he had where he threw the bowl was one of the best parts. It is full of violence and heart. Who ever played the little boy also did a good job. This is one of the best done by Will Smith. He really does know how to act. I know this is a remake but is well acted out for that. After his dog died in this film he was full of rage and cried this was also good. You are good Will Smith rock on."

","I must say I loved this movie, go WILL! He really did shine as Dr. Robert Neville. I loved how rather then having a human sidekick he had his dog, Sam. Amazing how he is immunise to the virus while others have all died from it. Every night he sleeps with a gun hiding from the mutants.<br/><br/>SPOILER** While this certainly was a drawback, it is nothing compared to the non-events that surrounded the relationship between Smith's character and what seemed to be the head of the vampire/zombie/dark stalkers. Just as the plot was beginning to develop between them, the film took an epic dive right around the time Smith's dog died. SPOILER END**<br/><br/>I really loved the movie and found he really did put in a great effort and although the ending was sad I really liked the movie. Thanks! I thought I would put a little treat in too, you can watch the whole movie here www.moviestatus.com/i-am-legend/i-am-legend.html"

","Wow. Just finished watching it! I must say that after reading the previous comments their is a lot of skepticism. The main thing that puts the CGI to shame is the scene where he is hunting the deer(just before he runs into the lions) It shows a large amount of NYC which looks *dodgy*. But when the CGI of NYC is used in small proportions it is out standing!<br/><br/>As for the plot. Yes very cliché'd. But meh a zombie movie is very cliché anyways. When you think of zombie you straight away think oooo. FRANKEINSTIEN scary ooo boogie boogie(ghost sounds). But for the people saying it is a 28 days later wanna be. It was based on a book written well before 28 days later. As for the ending....The feeling achieved is if I'm going I'm taking you B^%$%##$'s with me! Which is well achieved. Cliché yes but cliché isn't always BAD!<br/><br/>Overall a 7.Not great but not bad either. (Please excuse any English errors)"
"jamlfceva","8","0","5","23 May 2008"," Will Smith underestimated by so many
","I will start off by pointing out i loved this film. True it may not be as good as the book and the CGI may be used where it does not need to be (the bad guys are human so use actors not CGI!) but i still loved every second of it. Now the main reason for this is... Will Smith. He has now got to be one of the best actors in the world. Forget films like bad boys (which i loved) which he can do in his sleep this is acting at the highest level. Much like in the film Ali you totally forget who Will Smith (the person) is during the film and he becomes the character as much as any man playing another can. In Ali thats who i thought i was watching, Ali. In this i felt Dr. Robert Nevilles pain, his loneliness and i was so lost in Smiths acting that all thought of the fresh prince etc, were totally forgotten. I will concede that not everyone will love this film as much as i did but if after watching you still feel Will Smith is a pop star actor and not of the standard of the top names then you really are not switched on. He is totally different but he is now at the same level as a Mr Denzel Washington in totally becoming the character he plays. Think i am mad? Watch this and Ali, Mr Smith will make my point for me."

","Robert Neville is the last man alive in NY city. A cure to cancer turns out to be a disease that turns people into 'Vampires' (Vampires however is never mentioned in the movie) The film shows Nevilles daily routine and how he tries to keep sane in a world were there is no one else. I loved the scene with Sam the dog.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays the role to a satisfactory quality and this is coming from one of his fans.<br/><br/>Certain times of the movie you will find yourself at the edge of your seat and the first time the audience sees the Vampires is very scary.<br/><br/>Warning! Spoilers Below.<br/><br/>Especially when Will goes looking for his dog and sees a nest of Vampires with their backs turned to the audience.<br/><br/>The opening scene is amazing you get a feel what the world would look like if humans disappeared, the idea of silence in a busy city is frightening.<br/><br/>The special effects overall are amazing.<br/><br/>I understand as to why people don't like this film, but it is mainly about the characters daily routine."
"jgonot","9","0","2","20 May 2008"," Beautiful, human bound....Dark, but beautiful nonetheless.
","I don't know why it took me so long to see this film. There was a lot of hoopla about the subject matter, but the film stifles those critics. Film was beautiful in a different more sadistic, and dark way. The film makes us realize how important people are to one and other and the relationships that are bound amongst us. Not only a film that looks at human relationships, but a film that intertwines that with the likes of ""monsters"". The ending was only fitting. Lose knots were made up with Will Smith's acting and his best friend Sam. The idea of an apocalyptic event in stories and in movies have long been the subject of the day, but this film I believe trumps many. One film not yet released with similar subject matter, is ""The Road""! Cormac McCarthy, enough said."

","This film is the best English movie i have ever seen.If you can apply it to the lives of people who live alone,or who don't have anyone to turn to,you will surely understand the pain of loneliness will smith is seen suffering from sometimes in the film.The way in which he tackles day-to-day life,his only companion-the dog and the music pieces are really touching.Though some people say there are problems in the plot,will smith's performance surely overrides everything else and makes the movie definitely worth-watching.The redemption song featured at the end of the movie is really a rare kind of soundtrack that we will ever get to hear these days of illogical and stupid music.Will smith's fascination with Bob Marley is noteworthy."
"johnnymacbest","7","0","5","17 May 2008"," Will Smith is incredible!!!
","I have never read Richard Matheson's groundbreaking novel of the same name but I still like the film despite not knowing of its existence and never having the chance of reading the original source material on which the film (and its countless variations) is based. Will Smith is incredible. A fine actor that he is in bringing genuine anxiety and bleak outlooks in this post-apocalyptic tale of being the last man on earth. The scenes of a deserted NYC is so shocking and disturbing that after seeing the film, I deeply pondered if such an event was to happen suddenly without warning; really intense stuff. But I gotta say the best supporting ""actor"" in Legend is Sam, soul mate of the weary (and somewhat crazy) protagonist in a desperate race to save humanity from extinction. Their scenes together form a lovingly heartwarming bond that is the emotional center of Legend.<br/><br/>Will Smith is a joy to watch, especially when he's going through his ""daily routines"" while trying to find a sense of normalcy of the world that once was and you really emphasize with his struggle against loneliness, insanity and despair. I don't think they couldn't have gotten a better actor for this role but thankfully I'm glad that they took him aboard this film as a bankable and talented actor.<br/><br/>However the film does have its faults. Many complained about the special effects being to ""video-gamey"" and it's length. Unlike most, I'm willing to overlook the special effects though I find them exceptional at best. It's a real shame that the film's length wasn't longer. It would've been great if the film had an extra hour of story and giving a much more satisfying experience; sadly it doesn't and the ending does feel like a cop-out. Still it is a good movie. It should be interesting to see what the special edition has to offer for the added scenes and bonus content.<br/><br/>I rate it 8 out of 10."
"ThatsGoodInnit","8","0","2","11 May 2008"," Willy's first ever nasty film hits a nerve..
","This is the first film i have seen Will Smith do that is truly a nasty sci-fi style horror flick, i was very surprised how mean and nasty this film is! especially for the style of film we've come to expect from Will Smith, happy go lucky sci-fi action flicks. This sure raises the roof for him and opens up his career to all new levels he did really well. Some great action, tension, and special effects that can blow you away. It's very dark and very moody. Sometimes a little humorous but then again sometimes quite haunting, creepy, moving, and scary! i just think you have to give this a go, you might feel very depressed afterwards and want to watch something more happy but i would definitely watch it all, stick with it if you find the beginning slow because it's worth it, it's meant to be slow at first to build up the tension but then BANG! it's one messed up creepy ass flick, soon as the film gets into it's stride it's over too quick and they could've made it longer, but hell there was some awesome explosions! the trailers don't give a lot away and i don't either, so enjoy it! and enjoy the not-knowing feel to it. i could say a lot more about this film but it would give to much away and spoil it so just watch it. i love his dog, excellent chemistry, great dog actor! rest assure the film does explain itself as it goes along it does leave you wondering in the beginning like what the hell is going on, whats happening? but it does reveal all. enjoy it guys! don't watch alone at first tho."
"AdderCowley","7","0","1","9 May 2008"," Too short
","This film has many good points, however what it lacks is decent screen time...I was surprised that it lasted little over 90 minutes which really cut out a lot of the tension and drama. When the credits role you think...OH...that's it? It was pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>This meant what was a pretty decent film became little more than a quick suspenseful flick.<br/><br/>However this does not mean it was a bad film, Will Smith was effective and held up well on his own for the majority of the screen time, albeit that time being short. Furthermore the scenes of a deserted Manhattan were amazing. Most of all this film was decently scary. The use of darkness obviously emphasised the fear and suspense which is rife in the film. The CGI isn't brilliant but does work, while there are some seriously scary moments.<br/><br/>All in all I am legend does have its shortcomings- its far too short and therefore seems rushed and ill-conceived. However it still does create a certain amount of suspense and Smith is reasonably good in this thrilling film."
"gummo_rabbit","8","0","1","8 May 2008"," View it on its own terms
","I know this movie has gotten some criticism, concerning plot holes, the use of CGI, differences with the book, etc. So I felt compelled to write a short comment explaining why I was so struck by this film when I watched it last night. In short, I couldn't help but admire the intensity of it all. And it's a very careful intensity.<br/><br/>The pace of the film, the lighting, the emotions, it all came across as entirely in the right place, and very deliberate. Here we have a film maker who knows what he's doing. Everything in this film has some purpose, sometimes only noticed after viewing it. Like some of the scenes are almost entirely in the dark, you can't see what's happening which adds to the frenzy. The part where I felt that they could've cut an entire scene (the battle at the end with the darkseekers where there's just plain shooting and violence going on), in retrospect served to add to the despair in the lab later on. By then it has become clear that those creatures are pure danger, no discussion.<br/><br/>And to be honest, I have never wanted so bad for a film to end differently then when the final attack in the lab takes place. I felt desperation, after already having gone through fear, excitement, a broken heart and what not.<br/><br/>The scenes of the evacuation of New York City were perhaps the scariest. The threat of something similar happening (because of climate change, that is) on such a scale to my hometown (Utrecht, the Netherlands) is very real. This film is not just a story, not just some action, not just some film. It tells us something about the life we lead today, our world now. That is why the small, but important message repeated at the end, is: Light up the darkness.<br/><br/>Not everything in this movie is drama, of course, and here once again, the pacing and dosages of action and emotions is very deliberate and carefully maintained. The scene with Robert lip-syncing to Shrek with Anna and Ethan in the room, is alive with eerie tension. Robert's interaction with the dummies is both comic relief and tender psychology.<br/><br/>Sure, the CGI could have been better - or perhaps done away with entirely. (Since I haven't read the book, I can't comment on that.) As for the plot holes: parts of me started wondering about stuff now and then, but I just couldn't finish those thoughts as every time I was again drawn in by the story. Perhaps because I watched this film on its own terms, instead of expecting a ""thriller"", ""action movie"", ""zombie flick"" ""sci fi movie"", etc...?"

Will Smith once again proves himself in this movie as one of the best, talented,and focused actors of his generation. He basically pulls off a one man show! The visuals are amazing and breathtaking at some shots in the movie. The camera shots are well developed and varied so we can get the full effect. All in all, this movie has to be a must see.

"miller_ray","Null","0","1","1 May 2008"," Underrated performance
","I really think Will Smith's performance is underrated in this film. For 3/4 of the movie he is acting on his own; it reminds me a lot of Tom Hanks in Castaway. This film hinged on his ability. The scenery of the desolate NYC and the IGN zombies really were just costars in a Will Smith film. You felt his pain when he had to leave his wife and daughter; you hurt when he had to put down his only friend. You could understand his initial struggles to deal with human contact after spending 3 years alone. I know this movie will be overlooked because of the subject matter and because it features a major Hollywood star, but I am Legend affected me far more than an Oscar recognized film such as No Country for Old Men did."
"JoeB131","10","0","1","30 April 2008"," Third Adaptation of Matheson's Novel
","This is an awesome movie.<br/><br/>The story comes from the 1954 Richard Matheson novel of the same title, and has been twice adapted officially, in 1964 as ""The Last Man on Earth"" with Vincent Price and in 1975 as ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston. The novel's lesser prodigy is just about every zombie movie you've ever seen, from George Romero's Dead series to movies like 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>In short, there is really nothing original in the story, but what it lacks in that, it more than makes up in suspense, action and execution.<br/><br/>This film is true to Matheson's vision in that it shows the hero's attempt to stay alive under difficult circumstances, not only fighting to find food and fight off the monsters, but to maintain what little is left of his sanity. In Matheson's novel, the monsters were more classical vampires (Matheson even came up with logic as to why they would be repelled by crosses and garlic). Here they are more a cross between vampires, zombies and orcs.<br/><br/>What sells this movie more than the standard zombie flick that Hollywood seems to churn out with tedious regularity is Wil Smith. He carries this movie as a man who has endured unbelievable horrors but never gives up.<br/><br/>There are deviations. In Matheson's book, Neville hunts the vampires with the intent of staying alive. Attempting to cure them is an afterthought later in the book. IN this film, he is trying to cure the disease all along. If you want to see a closer adaptation of the book, you should probably watch the 1964 version."
"smest20","10","0","1","26 April 2008"," Best Movie i've ever seen
","I thought that this movie was the best movie i have ever seen. I would say this is because from the beginning you are deeply interested in the story and the emotional ties are deeply rooted in you as well. I cried so hard when his dog died and was seriously moved by Will Smiths sacrifice in the end. As far as the ending goes i don't understand those of you who have left comments questioning why he sacrificed himself. He even says in the movie that the monsters will never stop and they would stay outside of the vent until the humans were forced to come out so i don't see what is not to get. I think it was logical and brave, with the future of the human race in mind he actually was able to make the right choice and was the legend that all will speak of. This is seriously an ingenious plot and whatever crap movie was made originally back in the 50's or whatever was officially copyrighted and the rights were bought by the studio who made this movie. The CG left a little to be desired but if you cant see past that into a great movie then you will never find a movie you like."
"Aidonian","8","0","2","26 April 2008"," great movie
","I love this movie. I love the apocalyptic movies as the next guy, but this one rocks. Like George Romero's movies, this one shows what happens to a man in time of great crisis. In this case, being the sole survivor of the human race. The Krispin virus, originally used to cure cancer has severe dangerous side-effects that spread from animals to humans. When it became airborne, mankind was in danger of becoming extinct. I think anyone who spends three years in solitude would end up crazy or kill himself, like the animated comic shows on the DVD for the girl in Hong Kong. But Neville has a companion, a dog. This movie brings a terrific message that humans should treat animals beter, because they can do wonderful things for us, especially our psyche. They can help us keep us sane. This is clearly demonstrated by Neville after he loses his dog to the Krispin virus. He forgets the cure and goes out to seek revenge. One thing I don't get is, the animals; the deers, the lions. How come they can survive, while they are most likely to be eaten by these dark seekers? When Neville and Sam where chasing this one young deer, how come the animal didn't know to stay away from the dark. If for the last three years, these things were killing them, wouldn't they instinctively know to stay away from the dark? Even when they are chased? Anyway, Will Smith gives yet another superb performance here and really shows his acting skills. I for one, hope they make a sequel starring Alice Braga's character and her son, trying to make a new life for themselves and at the same time, trying to cure as many dark seekers as possible."

"TxMike","Null","0","1","24 April 2008"," Interesting movie about man-made plague that sweeps the world.
","During this film we see clips of an interview with a doctor who explains how they have used genetic engineering to cure cancer. A 100% success rate. However, a few years later this turns into a man-made plague that kills virtually everyone on Earth.<br/><br/>Will Smith is Robert Neville, who apparently has developed an immunity to both air-borne and contact-borne microbes responsible for the plague. He is virtually alone in NYC, living in his home turned fortress, and with a lab in the basement. His mission is to develop a serum that will cure this curse. He experiments with rats.<br/><br/>As in many other movies of this genre, there is a large group of infected who did not die, but developed a rabid manifestation of the illness, and who could not stand the light so only came out at night, as Vampires might. We see Neville capture one of them, a female that he bound in his lab to experiment on.<br/><br/>Much of the middle of the movie shows Neville as he goes about on his daily hunts for food and other supplies that may be left over in the various buildings. At night he barricades himself into his home for protection.<br/><br/>He also broadcasts a repeating message daily, if anyone hears him he will meet them at a certain place at high noon. As the Castaway in 'Cast Away' had ""Wilson"" to keep him sane, Neville has his dog, Sam, short for Sanamtha. But he seems to be going crazy anyway. <br/><br/>Alice Braga as Anna and her young son eventually do turn up, and Neville doesn't trust it, he doesn't believe anyone is alive. But she knows of a safe place in the Vermont countryside where survivors are going. She wants him and his dog to go with them. <br/><br/>While this isn't a great movie, it certainly IS entertaining, and sometimes a bit scary. Will Smith does a fine job.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The zombies aren't entirely stupid, and figure out where Neville lives. At night they break in, and corner Neville and Anna in the lab. He tells Anna and her son to hide in a safe corner, and to wait until daylight to travel. When the zombies finally break in, he sets off a high-power grenade which kills him but all the zombies also. But not before he draws a vial of blood from the captured zombie woman who finally was showing signs of reversing the illness.

","Right, my second ever review I have made on a film on IMDb (first being Cloverfield), and it's a positive one :] Lets start with a plot synopsis.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a film centred around an army scientist, Dr. Robert Neville, who is the last man on earth after a virus spreads across the world, killing 90% its population and leaving the others as either flesh eating, Vampire-like creatures (mainly due to their extreme reactions to sun/UV light) or people who are immune to the effects. However, the creatures kill the remaining population, leaving Robert Neville as the last surviving human, desperately trying to find a cure to the virus and survive the nights.<br/><br/>Now, I have heard a lot of negative reviews on this film, most of which are unjustified. Though I can respect that each reviewer on here has the right to his/her opinions and I don't wish to change them, it's the critics I'm most surprised about. Mainly due to the fact that one reviewer criticised the film for not having enough action...the action supplied within the film is ample enough, all of them exciting ad gripping, but the critic must o missed the point that the film is in fact not about the action and the monsters, it's about Neville.<br/><br/>Robert Neville is played by Will Smith, who gives the performance of his career. Giving excellent depth and feeling to an incredibly lonely man, who has suffered traumatic events and whose sanity is slowly slipping away. Smith's portrayal of the loneliest man on earth is the driving point to the film, showing he is a very versatile actor who can switch from great comedy actor to a convincing and moving drama actor (though this has happened in only a few of his films).<br/><br/>The narrative of the film is simple, with a few flashbacks to detail what has happened to Neville's family, with its day-night structure easy to follow. However, while the day scenes are fantastic thanks to Smith's performances, many people believe the night-time is when the film fails.<br/><br/>This is largely due to the CGI effects used to create the creatures. Critics and cinema goers alike believed that the CGI for the film was terrible and unnecessary, when they could of used real people to portray the creatures, such as in 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>I disagree, while CGI could o been better, it really isn't that bad! The creatures move and behave inhuman enough to make us believe that they could exist, while the stunts that would of been required if they used people for the roles may have been too extreme, meaning that the action scenes would not have been as exciting.<br/><br/>While I personally dislike the 2 endings available to the film (the alternative ending available on the 2nd disc of the DVD release is probably an un-improvement), and the 2 survivors that save Neville at the end are pretty annoying, I generally very much enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>It offered a far more deep and interesting Blockbuster in contrast to brainless movies like Transformers (even if I did kinda enjoy it) and Rush Hour 3 (big disappointment), with tense and often very creepy atmosphere and action that grips, with Will Smith on amazing form.<br/><br/>Recommended viewing :]"

","With Will Smith playing the last human survivor of a virus in New York City (and possibly the world), one might wonder how exciting could this film really get. But do not despair, he might be the last human, but he's definitely not alone. He soon finds that the virus has transformed everyone else into nocturnal zombie-like creatures. And this is where the fun begins.<br/><br/>Will Smith is the most likable actor in Hollywood, and he really shines here. Being able to act on your own with only a dog as a companion requires tremendous acting skill, and he pulls it off. And once the action begins, he is more than capable of holding his own. The tone of the movie manages a delicate balancing act, from a creepily tense few scares it will take you to a heartbreakingly poignant moment, and then it manages to pull the rug out from under you and take you back to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>A thrill ride that's definitely worth watching again."

","I absolutely loved this film. Will Smith is excellent. He spends most of the film accompanied only by a dog, yet he still manages to keep you hooked on the action.<br/><br/>Despite what some people say, I thought the computer animation was excellent. The mutated humans were very realistic.<br/><br/>The best scenes are where Robert Neville is in the DVD store and talks to the mannequins as if they are people. This is where Will Smiths acting quality really shines through.<br/><br/>I also like the relationship between Robert Neville and his dog Samantha. The way Neville relies on Samantha for companionship is wonderfully poignant. When Samantha succumbs to the disease that is a heart wrenching scene."

","The movie begins when Dr. Kripper (Emma Thompson), briefly appears to announce her discovery, a scientific breakthrough and cure for cancer. She explains her discovery to the television audience and the television screen suddenly goes black. Three years later, Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith), is the lone survivor of a plague that was released upon the world. Neville lives alone in New York City with his only companion, Sam, a German Sheperd Dog. Each day Neville and Sam go out on the streets of the city to hunt wild deer that have infested the streets and to scavenge for necessities. Each day Neville announces to the world, ""I am a survivor, if there is anyone out there, I can provide food, I can provide shelter, I can provide security."" At night, Neville boards up his windows from the outside world. You do not want to be on the streets of New York City alone at night. There are what appears to be mutant survivors. Their appearance is less than human. The only way that I know to describe their actions is that they behave as if they are infected with rabies. They are as wild and dangerous as a rabid animal.<br/><br/>Neville is attacked by the mutant human species after discovering their hideaway. At this point, the movie becomes very scary. Somehow, he is rescued by what appears to be another survivor, Anna (Alice Braga) and her young son. The next night, the mutants come out again. They only come out at night. They have followed Anna to Neville's home. They attack with a fierceness that I cannot describe. The mutants are literally climbing the walls of Neville's home. Hanging from the ceiling and ripping the boards from the foundation in a wild frenzy. Neville, Anna and the boy escape to the basement of the doctor's laboratory. ""They are not going to stop,"" Neville tells Anna as the mutants beat the laboratory door in. Neville puts Anna in what appears to be some sort of oven safe door and hands a vile of his blood which he has drawn. ""Take this with you to New Hampshire. It is the cure."" Anna believes there to be a community of survivors in New Hampshire. Neville closes Anna and the boy up in the protective enclosure, the mutant leader, continues to bombard the laboratory door. Neville pulls the plug on a grenade that causes an inferno killing them all.<br/><br/>Anna and the boy go on to New Hampshire where they are lead in to the compound through protective doors surrounding the community. She hands the vile to her new protectors. Anna's last words were. ""In 2009, a deadly virus burned through our civilization, pushing humankind to the edge of extinction. Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life to the discovery of a cure and the restoration of humanity. On September 9th, 2012, he gave his life to defend it. We are his legacy. This is his legend."""
"TheUnknown837-1","9","0","1","14 April 2008"," extravagant, dramatic, brilliantly-acted, frightening, fantastic film
","""I Am Legend"" is a nearly perfect, nearly flawless third adaptation of the famous Richard Matheson novel telling the story of a sole survivor three years after a devastating plague has wiped out most of humankind into extinction and transformed the rest into vampire-like monsters. In my opinion, this is the best out of all three. It's not the most faithful version to the novel (see ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) with Vincent Price for that) but the changes seemed necessary and although the final half-hour of the movie is somewhat disappointing and weak, the movie still plays itself very well and is at times genuinely frightening.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays the iconic Matheson character Robert Neville, who has been changed this time to be a virologist in New York City trying to cure the disease and restore humankind. He has a companion this time, his dog Sam, the only other living thing that for three years he has not been hiding from or trying to kill. The bonding between these two characters is quite effective, starting from the beginning to show a true level of companionship and how these two will do anything to protect the other in this dangerous transformed world. Will Smith plays his character with true brilliance. His performance was simply put: golden. It's films like ""I Am Legend"" that show that Will Smith is capable of effectively playing characters outside of the comedy genre that got his career started.<br/><br/>One of the scary things in ""I Am Legend"" is how it creates a realistic feeling of this man feeling like he may really be the last healthy human on the planet. All the others hide in the dark and would be more than happy to tear him to pieces if they caught him after sunset or in their lair. The transformed set of New York looks great with all the weeds in the streets, the animals roaming free, cars parked everywhere, buildings deserted and falling. And of course, this city can be even more frightening when life-threatening situations arise for our two primary characters. There is a truly heart-jamming and terrifying sequence in the movie that goes without music, is claustrophobic, and keeps the audience almost as frightened as Robert Neville is.<br/><br/>One problem I have with ""I Am Legend"" is the same problem I also associate with what I've seen of the two previous adaptations. I felt the infected were not treated right. They are certainly more compelling and scary than the stumbling, low-voiced zombies from ""The Last Man on Earth"" and more terrifying than the Gothic ""family"" from ""The Omega Man"" (which I have yet to finish seeing). But the main problem is that the CGI used for portray the infected was not particularly convincing. It's good enough to pull itself through, but certainly with room for improvement. It would have been better to use actors in prosthetics and use CGI for longer shots. Nonetheless, they do play their part fairly well and since we don't see TOO much of them, they are compelling enough to be accepted.<br/><br/>If there is a big problem with the film, then it's the last half-hour, which is the reason why I give this film a 9 instead of a 10. The first hour was hands-down brilliant and amazing. The final third of the film was rather weak and at many times, slow and uninteresting. It's merciful that it is only a half-hour long and that it doesn't waste too much time to ultimately ruin the movie. It does end off the wrong way, but whenever I finish viewing the film, I still relate to the first two-thirds which I loved and enjoyed. The hair-raising tension, the brilliant performance by Will Smith, the great directing job by Francis Lawrence, it all worked so wonderfully. I only wished it could have been so flawless all the way through.<br/><br/>But in the end, ""I Am Legend"" is a great film and one I highly recommend. Some people will not like being frightened so many times during the first hour, but I admire the film for being able to scare me. And I also admire it for Smith's golden performance and the overall compelling atmosphere and high entertainment value."

","Well, I watched it on a visible computer and I really enjoyed it. WIll smith gives a tremendous performance and makes the viewers feel depressed after all the things he's been through. He does make it feel quite empty as there is not to much dialouge in all of it together. The creatures I thought could do with a bit more thought. Burnt bald people with only rags on was a bit stupid. They could have made them look a bit more like dead people instead of weird bald creatures.<br/><br/>Now for the ending (Spoiler: WARNING) It was all good until the last 3 minutes. If you have'nt seen it but WOULD like to know read on. He blows the creature surrounding the house including himself up! Why couldn't he have chucked the grenade and got into the safe or something! Also it would have been better if they had shown the killing of the dog in a better way. Not in a sick way but just show it better, I had to re-watch that scene to understand. Still, great film, espicically for people who enjoyed 28 days later."

","Let's make one thing clear. ""I am Legend"" is a broken film.<br/><br/>Somewhere towards the end it got severely injured by a unfortunate cut. Now, this is fixed with an abomination of an tacked on ending. There are oodles of hints towards what I consider the real ending throughout the whole movie. The version seen in cinemas makes no sense what so ever, but the ""why-oh-why-lord-didn't-they-pick-this-ending?"" version is accessible here on the internet or on DVD.<br/><br/>Do you all hear that? There is an ending to ""I am Legend"" that actually makes sense.

","I watched this movie with some doubts, as I had heard mixed reviews. My doubts faded as the movie progressed though, and I find many criticisms of this movie to be lacking in credibility, the one that bothers me most is ""HOW ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE IMMUNE TO THIS VIRUS AND HOW DOES IT TURN PEOPLE IN TO BLOODTHIRSTY LUNATICS?"", and at first I thought that was a good question, but near the end of the movie I found myself wondering, why explain it? One of the great things about this film is the mystery surrounding the story and characters. It furthers the idea that this man, this survivor, really doesn't have all the answers. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't have felt better about the movie if they had spent five minutes explaining the virus in a bunch of medical jargon that the majority of us wouldn't understand anyways, but I digress. The imagery in this movie is absolutely beautiful, and the writing provides dialog ranging from disturbing to comical, and unfortunately near the end, rather preachy and cheesy. Will Smith is magnetic and the character development is easily the strongest part of this film (amazing how someone can still hold such interesting conversations without another human being around :D). While there are some shortcomings at the end of the film, overall it is powerful and a must see."
"thetrueisyo","6","0","2","6 April 2008"," A good try
","It took me a few days and a few viewings to decide that I didn't like this movie. The first act is very intriguing and certainly had my attention very quickly, though it was hard to accept Will Smith as being a scientist who's trying to be man's savior at first, it grew on me and he really does a good job at convincing us that he's a versatile enough actor. It's when the zombie/vampire things start showing up that questions began to arise about the intention of the filmmakers. Why were they CGI? I think this is a very good example of a studio that might recognize it's errors in script, and therefore try and make up for it with lots of unnecessary CGI, like the new star wars movies. The only things that have a reason for being CGI were the rats and the dogs, ie; actors in the film which need to act differently than normal but can't just be told to do so. And why were the zombies' lower jaws like those of snakes? They would detach and extend far beyond what the human bone structure can do, and they did it all the time! Along with that, they could somehow climb up walls and things. With what? Their suction-pad finger tips? And how did they organize and make language and such in the 2 years since they took over? There were far too many things that just didn't make sense for this movie to earn a good rating."

","I was a bit skeptical to sit down and watch this movie. The past few movies i've watched with zombies have been considerably poor. 28 Days Later and Land of the Dead were both very dull, so i was a bit burnt out on zombie movies.<br/><br/>Being a decently big Will Smith fan, i thought he did a pretty good job of acting in the film (especially since he was one of 3 characters in the whole thing, being on screen 99% of the time) The story was a bit slow, but kept you informed just enough to keep you watching, revealing bits and pieces of his past. Though i wouldn't label it ""action packed"", it had enough shooting and exploding to keep you honest.<br/><br/>The only criticism i had was that it was a bit too short. It begins to show one of the zombies gaining intelligence and such, but never really develops that subplot at all. I would have also liked to have seen Will Smith fight zombies for a few more days.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a surprising film. The overall message of the story is pretty interesting.

","Francis Lawrence's adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel of the same name may not be the most faithful representation of the book, but it certainly makes for a great film, and one that I'm proud to add to my collection. I've just viewed the film for the third time now, and after having seen the ""alternate theatrical version,"" I must say I prefer the original ending.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance has received a lot of praise, and none of it is undeserved. His portrayal brings Robert Neville to life, and there are several times (""Please say hello to me"") when I was almost brought to tears by the strength of his performance. He, along with the script writers, have managed to lift the film above being a ""genre film"" and to something closer to art.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, however. ""I Am Legend"" is unabashedly a zombie flick, but by the end its strong character development and commentary about God help to avoid the feeling that we as an audience have been here before. As a Christian, I also appreciate that the film doesn't shy away from issues of belief and faith, which figure prominently in the climax (I personally feel like the movie strongly endorses a belief in God).<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is somewhat of a mixed bag. The cinematography and set pieces are both nothing short of stellar, and come together to make the ""nature takes back the town"" idea really come to life. However, the CG characters created for those infected with KV are lackluster at best. The director tries to compensate for this by having them move quickly, but it still falls flat, and the biggest scare we really get from the infected comes early on, when they're half hidden in shadows.<br/><br/>James Newton Howard's score is subtle, understated, and beautiful, which is pretty much what we've come to expect from him by now. I'd be looking to buy the score, but I honestly don't think there's enough music here to fill an album, which is a shame. The music is used quite sparingly (but like I said, it makes a positive impression).<br/><br/>Poor CG aside, ""I Am Legend"" is one of those movies I would recommend to just about anyone. I have vivid memories of going to see it at the local cinema, and nearly all of my expectations were met or exceeded."

This treatment of the story reminded me a lot of 28 Days Later with a dash of The Postman and just a whiff of I, Robot.

I Am Legen is not a great movie but it is an entertaining one and most certainly is worth anyone's time. Some complained about the ending but one has to remember that the character was overwhelmed and new that the end was inevitable. I had no problem with it.

","What is the deal with Will Smith? Every movie he comes out with is almost invariably going to be the best thing in theaters. I don't think he has come out with anything less than a hit since Wild Wild West, which itself was a hit but wasn't good. I've read that it's Smith's one regret, that the movie did so well despite being bad. I Am Legend, on the other hand, has all the ingredients of being a smash hit, and in most ways it is. There are more shortcomings in movie than we have come to expect from the latest Will Smith summer blockbuster (or winter blockbuster, as it were), but I have to say that the portrayal of post-apocalyptic New York City is so good that most people will be more than willing to overlook a lot of these things.<br/><br/>It's a zombie movie, to be sure, but a science fiction zombie movie, like only a few others, I think. Smith plays Robert Neville, the sole survivor of a man-made virus that has killed everyone in the world, it seems, except for the ones that have turned into astonishingly angry zombie-like creatures that only roam the streets at night. Neville has his trusty dog as his only companion as he desperately seeks a cure for the virus, spending his nights barricaded into a makeshift laboratory with steel shutters. As soon as we see him close those steel shutters for the first time, it's reasonable to assume that later there will be a problem with them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie opens as a Ford Mustang commercial, with Smith racing down the empty, weeded-over streets of what was once New York City, his engine revving angrily as he guns is through the streets, hunting the occasional deer that are now roaming the streets. Sadly, he loses his dinner to a lion, who is a better hunter than he is. Yeah, there are lions there, too. <br/><br/>Although I was a little put off by this at first, in retrospect I really appreciate the way they have presented the city's entropic regression into wilderness, with wild animals wandering and hunting where pedestrians once crowded. <br/><br/>The first half of the film introduces us to the empty city and Neville's struggle to find a cure, as well as explaining the rules of the zombies, you might say, which are really not much different than your standard zombie movie, except that these ones are faster, stronger, and angrier. Oh and they can't stand sunlight, maybe because the creatures in Richard Matheson's novel, on which the movie is based (after two other previous film adaptations) are vampires.<br/><br/>Neville spends his free time walking his dog around in certain stores, around which he has placed mannequins as though they are browsing shoppers, and with whom he exchanges greetings and small talk. This is a lonely man. It is the mannequins, however, that introduce the first major, major loose end. At one point Neville sees one of his mannequins placed somewhere other than where he left him, and he panics, screaming at the mannequin (calling him by name, by the way) and demanding to know what he's doing there. As he approaches, he is suddenly yanked off his feet by the rope that has been devised to trap him. He passes out hanging upside down but eventually escapes, barely making it back to his truck (another Ford, of course) before being eaten by CGI zombie dogs. <br/><br/>He escapes relatively clean, although his own dog doesn't fare so well. It's a heart wrenching scene, and Neville is understandably devastated. This event causes something to snap in him and he goes on a nighttime rampage against the zombies, killing as many as possible with his car and forgetting to wonder who set that trap in the first place. <br/><br/>It can be assumed that it was the zombies who set it, since during Neville's revenge campaign we can see that they have organized themselves into a stratified army, with foot soldiers and generals and everything. There is at least one shot that clearly shows one zombie general ordering forward a company of soldiers, who attack on command. This is a surprising development that sadly goes nowhere. <br/><br/>Before long a woman and her young son come into the story at a crucial moment for Neville and explain to him that there's a colony of survivors in Vermont, leaving Neville to wonder whether this is true or not and leaving the audience to wonder what she's doing on Manhattan Island, all bridges to which have been destroyed during a military quarantine to isolate the virus. At any rate, such is introduced the film's major weakness, as Neville ultimately makes it to the colony while the narrator carefully spoon-feeds us the film's message and meaning. I love that.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is definitely a fun movie. Like most of Smith's films, it's great popcorn fun, as they say. It is packed full of vacuous logic and plot holes, but that's part of the nature of this kind of film. The post-apocalyptic future is the thing that is going to be most remembered about the movie, and while there are an unfortunate number of other cheap weaknesses, it's still a fun ride!"

","Think of it this way: ""I Am Legend"" is what ""28 Days Later"" was supposed to be. Almost the same premise and the same idea of having a deserted city, except that ""Legend"" has a higher budget, bigger and better scenes and superb acting.<br/><br/>Will Smith carries the whole emotional weight of the story, and he's great. He doesn't use his ""funny kid-friendly rapper"" act, but a genuine and realistic performance, almost Oscar worthy (Daniel Day Lewis already had his statue, and Smith really deserves his).<br/><br/>As for the rest of the characters, they were OK. The dog was a good companion for Neville, and I did almost cry when he had to be sacrificed, although I would have shot him before he could turn into a night seeker. The girl and the boy were good characters, but we see little of them, ant not enough to feel really connected with them. But it's not their story, it's Neville, so it's not really that bad.<br/><br/>James Newton Howard's score was good, although it was wise to not use too much of it, as the danger and suspense is more visceral without any music. Still, the percussion and lyrical moments were quite good.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence has potential. Coming from directing music videos and the ghastly ""Constantine"", he has proved to handle an emotional story with a huge budget and not screw it up. The empty New York shots were beautiful, although, as it happens with modern CGI, the effects look fake.<br/><br/>Akiva Goldsman writes an excellent script. Although I don't understand why would he write a script with such a Christian undertone while writing the screenplay for ""Da Vinci Code"". But still, the Christian message is great. Not like ""Left Behind: The Movie"", where the script actually sucks and the message is so in your face but very badly handled. In ""Legend"", the Christian statements and biblical references are perfectly blended in with the action and drama. ""It's God's plan"" is a forward and bold statement, and it's carried very well. My favorite quote is ""God didn't do this. We did"", a nice and swift punch against all those people who say they're ""angry with God"". And of course, the references to Jesus (his blood and his death at the end saves the rest of the world) are great.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest movies of the past year. I see almost no flaws, or at least, no real flaws (goofs or continuity errors don't count). And Francis Lawrence has proved to be quite good. It would be wise of him if he directs a low budget more domestic film, but still, he's on the good way. He's not a generic director."

","A major scientist (Emma Thompson) goes on television to announce that a cure for cancer has been discovered. Although it involves fighting the virus with a designer virus, it is working magnificently. Flash forward three years. Dr. Robert (Will Smith) and his most loyal dog, Samantha are out on the streets of New York City. It soon becomes clear that they are the only ones walking the by-ways, as their sole encounters are with a herd of deer and, surprisingly, a lion and her cubs. Wait, in New York City, home to 8 million people? That is correct. It seems that the designer virus mutated and caused the death of nearly every human being on the planet. Only Dr. Robert is alive and immune in the Big Apple. When he makes his way back home, however, he does two surprising things. One, he heads for his lab, where there are some extremely agitated rats in cages. Looking them over, Robert makes note of the fact that one of the rats appears calmer and more like a typical rodent. This please the doctor, as he has been struggling to find a vaccine that would bring all of the rats back to normalcy from their present, rabid-like state. The second noteworthy action of the doctor is that, at sunset, he pulls steel curtains in front of all of the glass windows, and sleeps with a loaded gun in his hands, with Sam resting nearby. Strange. Even stranger noises, like bat voices, emanate from the outside. Yet, the next day, Dr. Robert is back on the streets, communicating via radio that he is alive and hoping to contact any other survivors out in the world. Unfortunately, an accident renders him out on the streets as the sun starts to disappear over the horizon. The strange, horrific voices return. Are Dr. Robert and Sam really alone in the city? Maybe not! This is another entry into the glorious repertoire of apocalyptic cinema. In the tradition of The Road Warrior, Strange Days, The Terminator and company, Legend is a fine, but not exceptional, film. It has an interesting story, although one that is not without its flaws. For example, how is it that a noted doctor and scientist happens to be the one survivor in Manhattan, instead of, let's say, a member of the garbage crew? Even so, the tale has some merit, as the man-playing-God strategy in the world of science is bound to cause problems from time to time. Also, as evidenced by the bird flu, viruses are the bane of human existence, as fighting them is a huge problem. As the main character, Smith is great, for he exhibits courage and intelligence in a big way. Other actors appear in the film, in flashback, mostly, and most worthily, too, although they are primarily a group of unknown thespians. The sets are amazing, for here is a New York City, with all of its buildings, but without a human being in sight. The settings, along with the remarkable cinematography, contribute heavily to the film's success. As for the direction, it is a bit uneven, as there are moments when the film lags into brief interludes of boredom for the viewer. However, when the action heats up, it is powerful. All in all, after a showing, most viewers will leave the theater a bit spent, emotionally. Do you adore futuristic films where civilization has degenerated into chaos and despair, only to have a hero or heroine emerge to ""save the world""? Then, don't miss I Am Legend, as you will be enthralled with its take on the fall of humankind."

","I was lucky enough to see this movie in ""THE IMAX EXPERIENCE"". I knew it would be exciting and phenomenal, but I didn't expect the scary. Between the people with the virus and the eerie setting of New York City, I was freaked out. I also didn't expect to cry as much as I did - though I was warned by my roommate.<br/><br/>It's basically the life of one doctor after a virus was discovered that was thought to cure everyone who had cancer, which mutated, backfired and killed almost the whole world's population. Those who didn't die were turned into monstrous creatures. Everyday, Dr. Robert Neville tries to find the true cure to the virus - everyday gets even more dangerous than the last.<br/><br/>This was a riveting and intense movie that I enjoyed from the beginning to the end.

","I Am Legend is different than other movies that share the same concept, it has more action than other post apocalyptic movies like for example 28 days later. The movie is fast paced and I don't remember any dull moment and Smith pulls this one out on his own brilliantly of course with the help of Max his lawful dog. All in all this movie is great when it comes to action and sound effects. The concept is probably the same as other zombie post apocalyptic movies where one person or a group tries to save humanity from extinction. There are stuff in this movie that were not explained, for example how did he get electricity for over three years, that really bugged me throughout the whole movie and I just kept wondering and wondering and hoping that smith or the director will come up with some explanation. of course there are other issues like gas, food and clean water but if you don't mind those things and just wants to enjoy a great movie this is the one for you. 7/10"
"ehickman-2","8","0","1","7 March 2008"," Good and Disappointing
","I went to see I Am Legend with much excitement having read the book and loved it. I loved the beginning. We get a good idea as to what caused this virus to take over humanity, and we see Smith's character Robert Neville in his day to day activities, which are mundane (as are most day to day activities). The Neville of the book is no super hero, but a moderately insane and understandably so, man who loses everyone he cares about in a plague that virtually destroys humanity. He finds himself to be the actual last man alive. What I loved most about the book was that it portrayed with some accuracy how one would react to being the only human alive. There is still the drive to keep on living and give yourself something to live for. We see the movie that Smith does this as well, in talking to the mannequins and giving himself a daily routine of shopping and hunting and disease curing to keep himself busy.<br/><br/>*Spoiler*Now beyond the mental state of Neville and the desolation of the city in which he lives, the movie strays very far, far from the book on which it is based. Theses creatures which are not defined to be the vampires that they are, have no interaction with the audience aside from being ""monsters"". The vampires of the book talked to Neville and called to him at night. Not these creatures though, they just live to eat. And why the crap are they awake during the day? That's when the Neville of the book would hunt and kill him, making him the antihero who dies in the end and gives you a sense that it could not have ended any other way! I was hopeful when the girl showed up that she would be a vampire like the Ruth of the book, but no, apparently she is some inexplicably superhuman chick who managed to save herself and this kid from the creatures for three years. She saves Smith and drives him home in the middle of the night managing to avoid these bloodthirsty inhuman machines and yet when there in the basement all her courage fades away and she is cowering on the ground with the boy?! If your going to stray beyond recognition from the book, at least make it believable! <br/><br/>I liked the movie as a Hollywood feel good action flick, but I loved the book as an introspective look at how someone would really react to being the last man alive. It's possible to like both but still disappointing to see such an unbelievable rendition of such an amazing book."

"Will52","9","0","1","3 March 2008"," Enjoyable movie with substance
","It is a well thought out movie, with some good special and visual effects, but the significance of it rests with the fact that it makes you think about the underling story that is being told, which is very clear and tells us all that with every new discovery comes a danger and with more and more advancing technology the human race is more than ever before coming closer to its own demise if it's not prudent and careful in managing its lust for discovery; just as the story told in I am Legend (although some factors are clearly fictional) it begs the question would the same mistake be repeated if someone in the future came up with a cure for cancer or aids and tried to implement it before considering all the possible consequences. Just as before in the human history in the past few years we have come increasingly closer to world pandemics with viruses such as sars and more recently the H5N1, if it became airborne and capable of infecting humans we would be on the brink of a major disaster. At the moment disaster movies such as I am Legend, I robot, The day after Tomorrow and others might seem completely fictional but the question remains; will we one day look back and realise that they were not so fictional after all?"

","I Am Legend leaves me with the feeling that I've seen something which could have been great, but which turned out to be rather disappointingly shallow.<br/><br/>But hey, no sci-fi junkie worth their warp drive would want to miss this one. The ""last man on earth"" theme coupled with the spectacular visuals of an empty NY are a flame to moths for such individuals.<br/><br/>Can't help comparing ""Legend"" to ""The Quiet Earth"", another ""last man on earth"" movie but having considerably more depth and intelligence on less than 1 % of Legend's budget, and with excellent cinematography and special effects nonetheless plus a nice segment on Alison Rutledge topless. Legend's hero (Smith) only touches lightly on those themes which arise if you really ARE the last man on the planet, so thoroughly explored by TQE's Zac Hobson.<br/><br/>I was going to complain about Legend's zombies (hasn't this market been exhausted lately?), but the movie's 1954 book source used these. The ones in the film have been considerably ""modernised"" though and with blatant disregard for the laws of physics.<br/><br/>Quite OK, but not particularly memorable.<br/><br/>As to the cynical title of this comment: It should be obvious to any sane, informed individual that the world is in for a pretty rough trot in future decades - wars could well break out over oil, water and land. Maybe humankind will be decimated by some sort of ""limited nuclear exchange"". A global biological disaster masquerading as a panacea probably won't occur (though who knows?), but global pandemics of various kinds might, as world population pushes inexorably upwards at a billion every 15 years or so (mainly developing nations, developed nations are in serious decline) and human greed and myopic self-interest run rampant."

","Iv just finish reading the book and well I must admit the ending made me feel sick. I mean maybe it's just the fact iv been brought up with moral background but to be honest I like the fact that in the film he dies to protect a cure not because of the cure. The film is also more realistic in our current world, a cure for cancer that goes wrong could happen (sure it's a long shot but think about it). Will Smith is at his best in this film and it's awhile since there's been a film with so few characters which you really get to know them. James Newton Howard made the perfect music for the film. But in the book he knows that there is one guy after him but in the film his miss calculation thinking that these mutants don't have any human left in them is wrong and turns out to be his down fall.

","I wasn't originally planning to watch this film, but I promised my brother I would and couldn't get out of it. And I am so glad he got me to watch it, because it was just incredible.<br/><br/>***WARNING: CONTAINS LOTS OF SPOILERS*** Will Smith gives a stellar performance as Robert Neville, the only survivor in New York City after a viral cure for cancer gone wrong turns almost the entire world population into bloodthirsty creatures. With his loyal German Shepherd, Sam, as his only companion, we truly feel for Neville as he struggles to survive alone, while at the same time searching for a cure to this virus. Smith's portrayal of Neville's desperate attempts to hang on to his sanity despite the gut-wrenching fear and loneliness he's had to deal with for three years since the tragedy occurred is simply flawless. One scene in particular, when he's begging a mannequin in a video store to say ""hello"" to him, had me choking back tears.<br/><br/>All in all an amazing performance on Smith's part.<br/><br/>However, I think the ending of the movie has been underestimated. In most of the reviews I've read, the writers have expressed their extreme disappointment, saying that the ending was terrible and did not do the rest of the movie justice. Well, I must say I absolutely loved the ending. I found it to be incredibly thought-provoking, and is in my opinion what sets this film apart from all the other zombie movies out there.<br/><br/>When Neville is telling Anna about Bob Marley's idea that one can cure racism and hatred by injecting music and love into people's lives, and then later tells her that God didn't cause the problem, we did, it made me realize that maybe this movie isn't supposed to be centered on bloody battles between Neville and the creatures. It has a much deeper message.<br/><br/>While I couldn't quite figure out the symbolic meaning of the butterfly (when Marley says, ""Look, daddy, it's a butterfly!"", when the leader of the creatures is standing with the cracks in the glass spreading out on either side of him like butterfly wings, and the butterfly tattoo on Anna's neck), it really got to me when Neville was screaming at the creatures, telling them that he had a cure and that he could help them, but he simply couldn't get through to them. That's so much like people today, isn't it? All wrapped up in hate and hell-bent on causing suffering and destruction, and there are so many other people yelling out, loud and clear, that it needs to stop, but they just don't listen. There's that, and also people shaking off the blame for the problems we all deal with today, praying for solutions instead of working towards them.<br/><br/>While it had all the makings of an action-packed blood and gore thriller, it's this deeper message that truly makes it stand out from all the other virus-spreads-and-turns-everyone-into-monsters thrillers I've seen. Even though it had a hopeful ending, it was still realistic, and it gives us a perspective on what's going to happen if we continue to let the ""virus"" of hate spread.<br/><br/>My only complaint? The CGI was awful. I managed to ignore its poor quality during most of the film, but it was terribly distracting, especially at the beginning of the movie. But all in all, this was an amazing film, a definite must-see."

","... and this is one of those times. I should think ""I Am Legend"" holds itself up pretty well given the genre that it was working in. This judgment is made in comparison to various other zombie flicks of its kind, and I found it to be more engaging and almost unique. I reckon one could never get away from the stereotypical scenario of ""genetic mutation breeds zombies who later decide to take over the world"". But the focus on the human emotions/psychology in this one is refreshing and that is a pulling factor in my opinion.<br/><br/>For that alone, the movie deserves extra points. This is by no means Oscar winning material, but like I mentioned, it does well in the genre that it represents.<br/><br/>Will Smith should be proud of himself. If not for him, the movie wouldn't have been believable nor would I enjoy myself as much as I did with this one. For that alone, I shall give it 8 stars."

","A lonely man with his German Shepherd drives around Manhattan as the last survivor of a man-made virus-attack. The virus has killed most of the Earth's population, turned a lot into zombie/vampire-like creatures and left around 1% of Earth's population unaffected as they are immune to that virus.<br/><br/>That man is Robert Neville, a Colonel in the American army and also a scientist who is trying to find a cure.<br/><br/>The story that is told the best here is the story of being lonely and how that affects our protagonist as well as showing us show he try to deal with it. The relationship with the dog becomes very essential and is portrayed with great skill without ever becoming sentimental. But that relationship of course isn't enough. In a very fundamental way Robert also needs the companionship of other humans and therefore he goes into the same store each day where he engages in light and everyday conversation with mannequins. We can both identify with his need and still it is very unsettling to watch him have these conversations. Again this works very well in the movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion the weak part is from the point where the confrontation with the affected becomes more direct. From that point on it's more like an action-movie and the suspense and eeriness, that works so great in this movie, is therefore absent.<br/><br/>I think that it is often easier to build-up an atmosphere but just as difficult to honor that in the climax. Also because, that what is unknown to our mind often has greater potential to scare us than what we know, no matter how horrifying the truth might be (it is rarely ""stranger than you dreamt it""). In this particular movie ""the truth"" is, as stated in other reviews, CGI-made zombies/vampires and because you notice the illusion right away you calm down very much. The open fight in no way matches the paranoia and loneliness as far as scariness goes.<br/><br/>The ending is very weak and feels very ""rushed"" and I don't think that this sort of movie in the first place appeals to people who wants a happy end.<br/><br/>Still I would recommend this to all who likes to explore, through empathy with Robert, the feelings of loneliness, paranoia and despair.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps.

","I saw the movie in the movies last night, it was a joyful sensational experience, and I loved it. The movie is brilliant, the story is gripping and the locations are overwhelmingly captivating, Will Smith's performance is incredible, mature and spontaneous, through his performance I felt Robert Neville's lonesomeness and solitude, his extraordinary devotion to fight and make things better, all in a simple realistic approach, no over-acting or exaggeration, the real way a true legend should be like. The directing is good, though it could've been better; in some parts it is focused and skillful, while in other parts it is loose and depthless, I guess a movie of such halo should have been given to a veteran director, while director Francis Lawrence is still developing and has never worked on a movie with such scale, even Constantine back in 2005. One thing I loved about the movie is the moral of the entire film; though it's been mentioned before in other movies, but for this case with Will's outstanding performance it had a different taste, it's something about Will's familiar face, it makes me sympathize with him as if I had known him for real. I also think the scene when Will talks about Bob Marley was emotionally provoking. All in all, the movie was a success, and Will Smith, what an actor! You'll enjoy this movie by only being human, you don't need to be a critic, a die-hard cinema fan or anything, you'll only need to be human."

"pyrocitor","8","0","1","12 February 2008"," Sombre, chillingly effective sci-fi
","With a chaotic history (originally bandied about as a Ridley Scott/Arnold Schwarzenegger collaboration and later a Michael Bay film) and itself another incarnation of author Richard Matheson's classic science-fiction novel, one would hardly have been surprised to see I am Legend join the ranks of once promising but ultimately diluted science-fiction melded into vomit-inducing video game spin-offs. Thankfully, director Francis Lawrence and his film-making team attacked their subject matter with a mature and distinguished outlook, taking what could have easily become routine horror tripe and instead crafting a haunting, disconcerting portrait of a heroic man's steadily fracturing psyche whilst living in the shadow of a crumbling city. <br/><br/>Director Lawrence demonstrates a superlative grasp on generating tension and suspense, making disconcertingly good use out of darkness and silence to craft a genuinely frightening atmosphere almost unseen in the majority of the film's hyper-kinetic video game spin-off contemporaries. The consistently palpable sense of tension and unease throughout is particularly gripping, as Lawrence resists the temptation to fall back upon typical, contrived scares and instead opts for a quieter, more unnerving tone, and the film is all the more effective as consequence. Unfortunately, the source of such fear proves to be disappointingly weak, as the computer generated ""infected"" creatures prove to be far too poorly animated to be taken seriously. Where the use of actual live action actors with makeup would likely have been far more satisfying, instead the film presents its audience with computer generated howling monsters which would hardly look out of place in any early 2000s console game. Lawrence makes far more frightening use out of the unseen than the seen, as most blisteringly tense sequences end on a sour note with such poorly conceived antagonists. <br/><br/>The script overall is a deceptively clever one, rising above the ranks of mindless monster horror gorefests the film will inevitably draw comparisons to. But I am Legend proves to be far too reflective and clever to fall prey to such trappings, and instead the action sequences are far and between (though blisteringly intense, making them all the more effective in their sparsity), while the film for the most part is content to focus on protagonist Robert Neville, steadily losing his mind and his purpose. And while the concept of Neville staying sane in complete isolation for so long may strain credulity, such complaints are scarcely enough to dampen the perverse fascination and enjoyment provoked by his situation, as the monotony, loneliness, hopelessness and constant sense of threat of Neville's life are believably conveyed, as his precariously designed life gradually unwinds around him. <br/><br/>The expansive shots of vacant New York are tremendously powerful and moving, and the film practically drips with fatalism and hopelessness (flashback sequences detailing a chaotic mass evacuation of New York are particularly poignant and chilling when intercut with the bleak future). As such, it is all the more disappointing when near its latter half the film descends into more conventional and familiar horror action ground, as its conventional culmination feels like a letdown in a film which begins in such fresh, uncommonly clever and captivating territory. <br/><br/>The concept of a film being carried by essentially a single actor would normally prove a daunting prospect, but the tremendously charismatic Will Smith proves easily up to the challenge. Deprived of the opportunity for his typical ""Will Smith"" humour (though certain sly comedic moments do make their way in), Smith delivers an enormously engaging and often tragic and poignant performance as Robert Neville, sole survivor of the virus desperately attempting to find a cure. With only a dog, several mannequins and the occasional mutated creature sharing the screen with him, Smith's performance is easily worth a viewing in itself, providing sufficient emotional heart to keep the film aloft. The supporting cast are less laudable, as Alice Braga delivers a disappointingly flat performance as a fellow survivor, and Salli Richardson fails to make much of a mark as Smith's former wife, shown in frenzied flashback sequences, which also feature an adorable role from Smith's daughter Willow. Emma Thompson however makes a memorable impact in a cameo role as the creator of the seemingly miraculous virus, and one can only wish that her character was developed further throughout the narrative. <br/><br/>Unusually reflective and subdued, yet with sufficient horror action to entertain its demographic, I am Legend surpasses the vast majority of its predecessors for refusing to dumb down its subject matter, and deliver a thoughtful, affecting portrait of a man in isolation as well as a gripping horror romp. While it may delve into cliché as the narrative develops, Lawrence's sturdy, unsettling directing and Smith's blistering performance are enough to raise the film's quality far above what it could have far too easily become in the hands of less talented craftsmen. <br/><br/>-8/10"

","This was spectacular. It's based on Richard Matheson's novel (Matheson wrote many classic ""Twilight Zone"" episodes in the early 1960s). It's a novel which has been adapted in film before, most famously with THE OMEGA MAN starring Charlton Heston as the last man alive. Will Smith is in this new one, as the last man alive, after a huge viral pandemic breaks out everywhere on the planet, arising from what was supposed to be a new state-of-the-art cancer vaccine. Will Smith has been Oscar nominated twice; he's a much better actor than Heston. Heston has more screen presence, has a louder voice, and such. But, as evidenced here and in other films such as ""THE PURSUIT OF HAPPY..."", Smith is subdued and articulate.<br/><br/>A very high recommendation here."

","Will Smith lands the title role of a character involved in some type of supernatural crisis as usual. Though I liked the movie I felt it wasn't as twisted as it should've been. That's what I expected from his older movies such as Independence Day and Men In Black and I got just that. But this one ended a little too abruptly just before we got a chance to digest what we were viewing just previously before that woman and her daughter traveled to the city of survivors.<br/><br/>I did like the cinematography and the scene where the dead suddenly travel to Smith's house. Pretty spooky. I guess the director knew something about how to rock the audience with slime oozing from their seats in the theater."

"andrewmcnewman","1","0","1","1 February 2008"," Matheson gets the Tom Wolfe treatment  again
","The Bonfire of the Vanities will forever occupy a special place in my heart as the worst adaptation of a novel to the big screen. From the moment Peter Guber decided Tom Hanks would play Sherman McCoy, the die was cast. Albeit for different reasons, I Am Legend is the latest big budget release to earn a place in the pantheon of adaptation disasters.<br/><br/>Using a mutating virus-as-cancer-cure vector to set the scene, while interesting, is the first indication that staying true to Richard Matheson's vision will not be Warner Bros. chief concern. The casting of a major box office draw-card like Will Smith also strongly suggests a Hollywood ending. But the real killer is the decision to present Robert Neville as a scientist / soldier which dispels any lingering doubts that this will be anything other than a 'hero sacrifices himself for the good of humanity' flick. And therein lies the nub of the problem  the novel's bleak conclusion is one of the story's great strengths but it is clear from very early on that this interpretation will not go down that path. The path it does choose is well-worn and entirely predictable; we've seen it all countless times before.<br/><br/>The film valiantly attempts, within the confines of a 101 minute running time, to portray the monotony and routine of everyday life interspersed with moments of terror (and this Smith does admirably) but that's about it. Frustratingly, what a young George Romero or John Carpenter could have done with Matheson's story and Francis Lawrence's budget we may never know.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a tepid thriller shot full of plot holes (how Neville could broadcast on all AM stations at midday every day for three years but the survivor compound in Vermont never managed to get the message is but one example) with a sell-out ending, I Am Legend will give you what you came for. But if you are after a genuinely thought-provoking movie experience based on a magnificent 'horror' story, this is the worst kind of disappointment."
"lloyd-constable-1","7","0","2","31 January 2008"," I am 28 weeks later
","This film is good. I have given my comment a bit of a cheeky title as it is very very similar to 28 weeks later. Although it is pale in comparison. It still is good. Will Smith did a good job but I am getting a little bored of his 'save the day' characters as they are getting all a bit samey. It was great seeing New York empty and Will got his characters isolation across quite well ""please speak to me"". It was quite creepy but and there are some good suspense moments but the zombies were all a bit odd looking. Very CGI which was a bit disappointing, the same as the lions.<br/><br/>I loved the bond between the dog and Will and how we discovered how the army evacuated New York. Very scary.<br/><br/>The ending was very typically American, giving the glimmer of hope in the 'Village' type community in Vermont, where the little Irish woman has the cure.

","The idea behind I Am Legend is great, and is a well deserved asset to the 'end of humanity genre' despite covering a plot similar to the 28 days/weeks later series. Interestingly, the movie is based on a previously written book; which redeems the movie from being seen as Hollywood spin off from a cult movie (29 days later). The film has some thought provoking issues that relate to the real world, such as the morals behind genetic modification and playing with nature. The filming is spectacular, most notably the shots of a deserted New York taken over by wild animals. Will Smith does a great job of being a solo actor throughout most of the movie and the script works well to keep you interested preventing long periods of silence. Overall, a great movie; despite covering plots similar to (better?) movies."
"louiepatti","9","0","1","30 January 2008"," Third Time's A Charm
","This is the third incarnation of the original novel ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson and undoubtedly the best in terms of entertainment and production values. The first filmed in 1964 starred Vincent Price and was titled ""The Last Man On Earth"". It was very faithful to the novel and very pessimistic, with a grim ending in which the last human being dies and humanity is now a race of vampires. The second adaptation, 1971's ""The Omega Man"", starred Charlton Heston. It was more freely adapted from the source material and the main character was changed into a medical military researcher capable of developing a cure for the virus. The ending, in which the main character dies, was altered so that he lived long enough to donate his blood to those who were uninfected so they could treat others and reverse the disease.<br/><br/>This version, starring Will Smith as the lone survivor Dr. Robert Neville, is essentially the second version lifted straight from the screenplay, which is why ""I Am Legend"" credits John and Joyce Corrington, the screenwriters from ""The Omega Man"". There are updates and changes, of course, but the essential story remains the same: Man meddles with nature and the meddling produces a super-virus that kills ninety percent of the population and turns all but one percent of the survivors into rabid light-sensitive vampires. There's one uninfected person left who's learned to adapt to the situation in such a way as to stay safe and conduct experiments in an effort to find a cure for the virus. He does so having no clue whether or not his efforts are worthwhile; for all he knows, he's the last uninfected person on earth. Still, he keeps trying.<br/><br/>In the novel, there isn't really a chief villain to fight against nor a female to whom the soldier gets attached. The 1971 adaptation did try for both but that diluted the storyline too much. This version changed the villain to a more general one and kept the female presence to a bare minimum, so that the main actor had to carry the story essentially alone. Price was good, and Heston was better, but Smith is the best so far. He projects a vulnerability that makes his character more sympathetic than in the previous versions. His talking to the mannequins adds a nice touch of pathos; he's lonely almost to the point of insanity, yet he keeps going, working on trying to develop a cure. His only companion is his dog, Sam, that he takes hunting with him for the plentiful deer that have overrun New York City.<br/><br/>Flashbacks reveal the background to his current situation and how he lost his wife and daughter. Between excursions out to seek fresh meat---a hard to find commodity---and survivors that are even harder to find, he's working in a lab to develop a cure using rats. Eventually, Neville captures an infected female human to try things out, but it's slow going. In the interim, his dog gets infected trying to save him from a trap, and he has to kill her, then gets badly injured seeking revenge for her death. Just when things look bleakest, he's found by two uninfected people, a woman and a child, who help him but don't know enough to cover their scent. The infected track them to Neville's hideout and, even as Neville realizes his efforts to develop a cure on his infected lab subject have worked, the vampires start breaking in and he's out of time.<br/><br/>Giving the cure to the two people who found him, Neville shuts them inside a safe place and waits as a group of infected humans finish breaking into his lab. He runs at them with a live hand grenade, in effect sacrificing himself for the cure. The woman and child make it to Vermont, where the cold has kept the virus in check, and deliver the cure to medical personnel who will know how to replicate and use it. The ending, like in the 1971 version, gives a small glimmer of hope that does not exist in either the novel or its 1964 film adaptation.<br/><br/>The pacing is good and the special effects very well done. The effects of sunlight on the infected people's skin are instantaneous burning, like being in a supercharged tanning bed. The vampires, though CGI, are creepy and well-crafted, and the dark seeker dogs are very scary. All of the acting is solid and Will Smith really shines in his role. Like Heston before him, he seems to have found a niche doing science fiction, but his acting is more natural and he's better at projecting emotional vulnerability. Of the three times ""I Am Legend"" has been brought to film, this is the best incarnation yet."

You might want to ask that of anyone who hunts in the US. Most do it for sport and considering his situation (only taped TV shows, no human contact, etc.) it's easy to believe he was just bored and wanted something different to eat. There were a few plot holes and things that were unexplained but that's life. As with all movies based on books, they have to leave something out.

"teresaband","7","0","3","27 January 2008"," I Am Almost A Great Movie But Due To Some Bad Decisions Am Ultimately Disappointing
","Will Smith has come a hell of a long way since ""Fresh Prince"", and after some great turns over the last few years he's become a pretty well respected actor, but as the last man on earth can he carry a movie solely on the shoulders of him and his dog? Luckily, for the most part he can. He's certainly got the charisma to fill a big screen on his own, and considering the majority of the movie is him wandering around empty streets, it's surprisingly absorbing. Where the movie falls down though is with it's effects. It's not that the CG here looks terrible, it's just completely unnecessary. The empty New York streets aside there's nothing being done here digitally that wasn't being done ten years ago with make-up and stuntmen, and there's plenty of movies which have done this kind of thing far cheaper and more effectively.<br/><br/>In comparison to the terrifying infected in ""28 Days Later"" the rabid nasties in ""Legend"" just don't cut the mustard. They also stick out like a big sore CG thumb, ruining the impressive shaky-cam realism that the movie has worked pretty hard to achieve. It's a shame, because the jarring effects aside there's a lot of atmosphere on show, and if the effects geezers had gone down a more sensible route this could have been something special."

"batuucan","7","0","2","27 January 2008"," Good influence and a good show of a legendary man, but...
","But I gave it a ""7"". Why is that? It is really a good influence, and it really shows us a legendary man.<br/><br/>The reason I gave it a ""7"" is -3 points for visual effects. It could be a remarkable movie if visual effects would be more realistic. After I have seen the first mutant, I felt like I was watching a computer game. Even the new generation computer games have much more realistic graphics than those mutants.<br/><br/>It was a very beautiful starting that we see an alone man after a little information and a show of TV news. There is a man with his dog, and walking in a world became natural. It is a very good influence.<br/><br/>Making people curious is one of the most important things in a movie's screenplay. We feel that curiosity in first scenes of the movie. This is another good influence.<br/><br/>We see a very lonely man talking to mannequins. His loneliness gave him a need for people, and to satisfy this need, he makes mannequins and talks to them, even falls in love with them. This gives a very good influence of loneliness in movie.<br/><br/>We really see a legendary man, who gives everything for humanity to live. He is the one and only man working to fix this cure in the heart of these events, actually, we end watching this movie feeling a respect for a movie character.<br/><br/>Francis Lawrence directed an original post-apocalyptic movie; but the importance of post-apocalyptic movies, the reason people like these kind of movies is its closeness to the reality. ""The Day after Tomorrow"" was a very good example of this reality. We have seen very realistic effects and a very good reason for this apocalypse. In this movie, we see a very good reason, but very unrealistic visual effects.<br/><br/>In an action or fantasy movie, visual effects can be computer-like as ""Constantine"" directed by the same director was a very good movie. In this movie, demons were computer-like, it was good; but in that movie, it is a mistake to show computer-like creatures; because there is a very important difference: These creatures are mutated humans. Men cannot mutate to a computer-like creatures. It is very unreasonable.<br/><br/>Apart from unrealistic visual effects, this is a very good movie. Watching this movie as a very good movie is possible. Just ignore the visual effects, consider mutants as realistic, then you will see a very original post-apocalyptic movie, and you are going to meet a new hero, then you will not forget the movie."
"johnny-08","6","0","3","26 January 2008"," ""I Am Legend"" is working because of Will Smith
","Yesterday I watched ""I Am Legend"" and I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised with few things. It's very hard to make apocalyptic movie, that is mostly based on one character, who fights with some nasty creatures. You have to make good special effects, you have to hire good actor and you have to make a good story so people could enjoy themselves. ""I Am Legend"" succeeds on every single level because it's made on great book by Richard Matheson. Of course this is Hollywood blockbuster so the movie isn't completely true to the book, which bothers me the most. The genius story of the book is not totally transfered to the big screen and that can easily be seen in the ending (there is no happy ending for humanity as known) and in the little things that are very important (dog came to Neville on a different way). But if you put aside all those things, you have a story that is not boring for a minute, excellent shots of empty streets of New York and what's most important: Will Smith is brilliant. His role is very demanding and Smith takes it all on his back. Smith is emotional and strong at the same time, his role is believable and he again proved that he became top class actor. What to say then ""I Am Legend"" is working because of Smith."
"daydreamer1","7","0","3","26 January 2008"," Good start and good plot but miscast
","Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>I really looked forward to seeing this movie and for the best part enjoyed it wholeheartedly. I particularly enjoyed the empty street scenes and the attention that was paid to detail....grass growing through the cracks in the road.....cars with tyres deflated..... absolutely beautiful and really portraying the scene more than any words could say. The storyline was interesting from the outset and didn't need too much explanation and Will played a really good part as a silent actor. Meaningful expressions and mutely carrying the story along - loads of action too and well played. The German shepherd I thought was particularly impressive, dotingly paying attention to her handler just off camera and doing all that was required of her. Then, it happened, about half way through the movie, Will started talking, the dog died and a woman was introduced to the plot. There's no way that the Will character would have lost the ability to communicate with other people. Even with zombies walking the streets would he be drawn to pull a firearm on an apparently sane woman and her child especially as she had just saved his life. This is where it lost it for me, tough girl, survived for 3 years plus in this particularly cruel world supporting her son suddenly (a little later) resorts to hiding under the bed waiting for knight in shining armour. For me it went down hill from here on in, it seemed that the ending was rushed and I suspect that there are a few alternatives in the can. I doubt that Mr Smith would have been happy with that one. To sum up I loved the plot and storyline but I really think Will was miscast, he just isn't a tough intellectual scientist character. No disrespect Will but maybe you know what I mean too. Hey, but you must see it yourselves and form your own opinion - mine is, a good start but lost momentum along the way. I think casting could have been better too but we get what we are given."
"j-lacerra","8","0","3","25 January 2008"," Recurring Legend
","Here we have Will Smith in a role previously played by Vincent Price, and Charlton Heston. Heston's turn in Omega Man is the one I remember well and must compare to. He was a swaggering macho techie Great White Hunter type; a scientist who apparently had discovered the cure and inoculated himself prior to the world's population either succumbing to the virus or mutating to leprous light-sensitive zombies.<br/><br/>So, if we haven't seen Omega Man we really don't know why Smith's character is immune. This movie has several omissions of that nature, which is why I give it only 8 stars. I thought Smith carried the role extremely well. His acting is believable and provoking. He is macho, astute, and possibly going mad. In the scene where he is lured by a mannequin into a complex trap, we are left to wonder if the seemingly mindless mutants could have set it, or perhaps Neville (Smith) set it and they are simply using it to ambush him, or perhaps they merely mimic his techniques. It's an open question.<br/><br/>Now, much has been said of the poor CG. But I must wonder if it is the CG that is poor or the filmmakers are just trying to tell us that the mutation endows its victims with superhuman strength and agility. What is their nutritional source. One might think it blood, or even wood. The movie is not specific, or cannot seem to decide. But these mutants are quite menacing.<br/><br/>All in all, this was an enjoyable film. Smith's performance was great. Alice Braga is a mere shadow of her more famous aunt, but was adequate. And I give it second place honors in this franchise, after Omega Man. This is possibly because of Heston's several scenes mourning the loss of humanity in a darkened theater, watching Woodstock while sobbing for them and himself."

I found the special effects, not even the animals, but the threatening creatures to look the most obviously fake. Yet the story, acting, directing and photography were all great. I was nervous at the time when I went to see the film because of people saying Will Smith's performance was terrible, but I didn't see a problem with it, he is a terrific actor considering the fact that he came from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, which was a great show. <br/><br/>The storyline is great, about the last man on Earth. The movie explains why he is the last man on Earth and how he survives from animals etc. He only has one companion, his dog Sam. A great character who you will grow to be close to. It explains how lonely he is, how he copes with his loneliness and how he feeds himself and keeps himself safe.<br/><br/>The movie sets are extremely realistic and the intensity in some of the scenes (especially one in particular) is unbelievable and the emotions flowing through the movie are very strong and captured well.

","Read the book. Despite its age it is much better. In the book Neville turns out to be the misguided villain in the end - man who didn't see how the world kept changing.<br/><br/>But Will Smith chickened out on playing the unwitting bad guy. Or maybe he didn't read the whole book (several hours) in favor of just watching the Heston movie with the director. The director was a terrible choice since by his own admission he loves classic (i.e. bad) zombie movies and the Heston ""Omega Man"" -- and wanted to make a zombie movie (""red flags"" Will ""red flags"").<br/><br/>This film is instead a remake of the Charleton Heston movie which was really just zombie movie and wasn't not very good. This movie is much better but pretty much totally lacks originality. Since the book was written 40+ years ago the general viral Apocalypse theme has been ridden into the ground. Then add the restrictions of the standard Hollywood hero formula and you don't have anything that exciting.<br/><br/>You can actually see that they started to film this way for the movie in a couple scenes that they forgot to delete when they wimped out and made Neville a hero instead. Ask yourself who set the trap that caught Neville? Yes his mind is deteriorating some but not that much. Yup it is the infected people who are obviously not all mindless. (ooops! need clarify that Neville is really crazy or cut it for the ending of this movie) Why did the infected guy chase Neville into the daylight street? In the book this sort of stuff is the infected defending family and society from Neville though Neville doesn't figure that out. And I am pretty sure that was the original thinking for the scene when shot.<br/><br/>In the book Neville isn't a doctor able to search for a cure but a simple guy trying to find survivors with similar immunity or good luck. After society collapses he makes it his mission to kill off the infected during the day. But the infection mutates during the first year for the majority of infected to allow a night bound society to start to reform. They have just start to research ways medicines to shield themselves from the sun so that they can track down Neville who is sort of a daylight Dracula to them."

","Few films ever live up to their literary counterparts. I Am Legend directed by Francis Lawrence starring Will Smith is no exception and in this case the chasm between book and film is copious to say the absolute least. However, I was not displeased at all by the film that I thoroughly expected to abhor, in fact I loved it and after much contemplation of the plot-theme I begin to not only forgive the screenwriters the almost complete discard of most of the original story's finer elements in favor of more popular elements but admire the adherence to what is, I believe, Matheson's own requirement to allow Robert Neville to finally leave earth as a bona fide hero rather than the de facto explicit in the book. Hollywood and those kept by her celluloid er, now digitalcharms prefer action to introspection anyway and for the forty years filmmakers have been trying to figure out a way to tell this story on film that reflected the greatness of its original form and make it work for wider audiences (i.e, those who have never read the book), I have to applaud Lawrence's film, and Will Smith. I confess, I was more than disturbed at the prospect of Smith portraying a character as tragic and as profound as Robert Neville, but given the character changes for the film, the de jure hero status and Will Smith's graceful advance into maturity the film worked, for me at least."

","Comparisons with this movie to Omega Man are inevitable considering the drastic similarities in plot, even though the plots of all post-apocalyptic films are quite similar. I very much enjoyed this film, but considering it was a remake my thoughts kept turning to whether this film was necessary.<br/><br/>Firstly, the best thing about this film is the acting. Will Smith does a fantastic job, showing a wide range of emotions. Much more so than the original movie, we feel his isolation, particularly in his insanity in risking his life for his only companion, and the heartbreak in their eventual parting. Unfortunately the other character, the mother-son duo and even the main enemy zombie, had potential to be more fleshed out characters, but this ultimately failed to eventuate. What I enjoyed particularly, though, was how human Will Smith was. Even though he was a Colonel, he is scared in legitimately scary occasions, and he isn't an unstoppable hero. Unlike in recent action films, like Die Hard 4, he can't take a serious beating for two hours (a day in their time). A simple knock on the head almost kills him.<br/><br/>The action scenes were very well done, and the CG was very good in portraying the city and the explosions. I felt that they were not quite up to standard in the scene with the lions, and I felt the total CG effect of the vampires detracted from how scary they were; I think actors + makeup with CG editing would have been much more effective. But it was very well paced, and incredibly gripping at most points. What I enjoyed was the move away from jump cuts to scary images accompanied with loud noise which is so common in modern cinema. Such cheap tricks make you jump, but that's different to being nervous and scared, which this film makes you feel.<br/><br/>What I most disliked about this film was the anti-humanist religious ""sub-text"". I use scare marks because it was hardly sub. It was done in a very hack-kneed way, with obvious lines such as ""We didn't do this, God did"", with the very conservative moralistic view that people shouldn't tamper with genes, even to do something as benevolant as to cure cancer. The ending of Omega Man also has obvious religious imagery. Charleton Heston suspended, Christ-like, in the fountain of his life-giving blood is one of the most powerful images in all of cinema because of its subtlety. The end of I am Legend, with the continuous references to ""listening to God', and particularly the final panning shot above the village whose only large structure is a church unnecessarily promotes quite unwelcome ideas about the ultimate moral triumph of parochialism, Christian virtue, and the evils of science (I don't even remember seeing street lights or telegraph poles).<br/><br/>Ultimately though, if people love a good (ultimately) horror film, that is well-acted, clever, and with an excellent script, and also one that makes you think (whether you agree with the writers or not), then this movie is definitely a must-see."
"hjyguy","8","0","5","20 January 2008"," One of the Scariest movies I've seen
","I saw the trailers so I knew it was about Will Smith roaming New York looking for other survivors of some epic disaster. Wow, but I didn't know it was going to be scarier than any horror movie. I got immersed in the story, following Will and his dog around deserted New York City, you know, wondering what was going on with the deer and the lions and all, thinking the deer were faster than I thought. It was when Will went home and opened the drape covering the rabid rats that I realized what this movie was all about. And from then on, I was pretty much bracing myself for the scary thing to come out. To me, what made it scarier was the fact that they let you hear the things before you see them. That kind of keeps you picturing what they would look like once they made the appearance. I guess this is a tactic employed by all horror films but 'I am Legend' just blows away its peers in the way they first present them. I mean the scene with the things all huddled together in the dark just waiting to explode into a scream of terror is one of the most horrifying movies scenes I've ever seen. And that is some feat to do that with zombie type creatures which are more comic than scary most of the times. All in all, superb acting by Will Smith, well thought out plot (based on a novel, so i hear), magnificent directing all combine to make this movie one of the best Sci-fi/Horror/Thriller movies I've seen in the recent years. Good job!"

This movie could have been better had they followed the book more closely. <br/><br/>Will Smith's acting is very good but I think there are several other actors that could have done this part.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is engrossing and interesting. The 2nd half bothers me. A woman seeking refuge in Vermont finds Will Smith and is able to pull him from his overturned vehicle even though she weighs in at half of his weight. The acting in the 2nd half becomes strained. But worse, the nightseekers are suddenly able to figure out where Will Smith lives and break into his house throwing him through furniture, staircase rails, down the stairs and of course, he can still get up and function with minimal injury. I found myself loosing interest at this point. You can tell they were trying to cater to the very young demographic instead of going for something gritty & mysterious. In other words, they sold out in parts of the film.<br/><br/>I asked my friend what he thought of the film after it ended in the theater and he threw up his hands & said, ""it's a movie-what do you want?"""

"michael-mcalister","7","0","2","19 January 2008"," A lost opportunity to make Matheson's story great again
","Not many know that of all three versions made of ""I am legend"" the one that more closely captures the spirit of Matheson's original novel is actually the one with Vincent Price, ""The Last man on Earth"", dating back to 1964 and that pales in comparison to the latest for its total lack of special effects. However, Vincent Price alone is intense enough to convey so effectively the utmost terror of human isolation, and the atmosphere in this relatively forgotten movie, shot in a suburb of Rome built up by none other than Mussolini, is at times far scarier than the CGI - ridden blockbuster. This is I think is what makes ""I am legend"" today some kind of lost opportunity to resurrect the Matheson masterpiece, as halfway through the beautifully photographed movie it ends up slipping in the cliché of computer graphics zombies - themselves not even overly original or particularly scary in concept. While Will Smith is fantastic in his portrayal of Dr. Neville, his wonderful performance gets pitifully overridden by a showcase of digital effects that was not only unnecessary, but redundant, confusing and more than anything else at the antithesis of what Matheson had imagined his metropolitan vampires to be."

","I thought the movie was good and the acting was great, but thought it was not very realistic. The zombies that the infection created were supposed to be affected by ultraviolet rays, not artificial light. If they are smart enough to set a trap for Neville, they should be smart enough to carry sunglasses in case they are exposed to bright headlights. Why didn't Neville ever tune in a short-band radio and here the survivor broadcast from Vermont? Why didn't the survivors ever hear Neville, did he really think the AM band was the only way to reach people? How could he install all the heavy duty window coverings in his house without ever being heard by the zombies? Why didn't he just find a more secure place to live and do his experiments? After three years of storage, most gasoline will have some water in it from condensation, but Neville's autos all ran fine. If the zombies ever did get Neville, there wouldn't be much meat to go around, so why are they all under the command of one zombie? Oh well, it is a fun movie to watch and creepy to think about."

","Robert Neville is almost literally the last man left on Earth. Through some bizarre trick of fate, he's one of only a handful of people with a natural immunity to a virus that, in less than three years time, has denuded the world of most of its human population. Now, Neville, a renowned virologist himself, spends his days cruising the streets of a deserted Manhattan, and his nights hiding out from the infected cannibalistic mutants who venture forth only after dark (shades of ""The Time Machine,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" and dozens of other similar films).<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" is just the latest film version of the 1954 Richard Matheson novel that also served as the basis for 1971's ""The Omega Man,"" with Charlton Heston in the lead role. Despite its occasional feeling of over-familiarity, ""I Am Legend,"" is a generally more subtle and thoughtful work than the average sci-fi film, one that, in addition to its more conventional action sequences and flesh-eating monsters, explores themes like survivors' guilt and the effect of prolonged isolation on the human psyche. The movie, however, is clearly most notable for its remarkably convincing vision of a desolate, post-apocalyptic New York City, where weeds grow promiscuously through holes in the pavement and uninhabited buildings and idle cars serve as ghostly reminders of a civilization now gone from the scene (though one questions whether the place would really look quite this shoddy a mere three years after its abandonment). Kudos to director Francis Lawrence and his crack team of visual and special effects artists for so successfully bringing this concept to life on screen. For the most part, the thrills are nicely balanced with moments of tender sentiment, as Neville reflects back on the time he had with his late wife and daughter.<br/><br/>In a role reminiscent of Tom Hanks' in ""Cast Away,"" Will Smith, largely bereft of any human companionship, spends most of the movie talking either to himself or to Sam, his loyal German Shepherd. In this setup, Smith once again demonstrates that he is definitely a commanding presence on screen, keeping us interested even in those moments when not much is actually happening in the story. For, there is, admittedly, a trifle more downtime in the movie than many of the more hardcore action fans would probably like. That objection aside, however, ""I Am Legend"" provides enough food for thought and a sufficient number of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills to make it worth watching."
"rbruckner","7","0","3","16 January 2008"," Good Movie, but way too short
","I really enjoyed this movie, but somehow it ended way too early The movie is told by switching between flashbacks, that explain why everyones beside Will Smiths character is dead, and Will Smith in an empty world, three years later. There is nothing to complain about the acting, everyone involved does a good job, and everything else was technically perfect and i was entertained the whole time. So the only thing i have to complain about is the length.<br/><br/>As i mentioned before, the movie starts three years after the events that lead to the extinction of mankind. And all these three years the life of Wills character must have been really boring, frustrating, desolate and repetitive. And the first maybe twenty to thirty minutes give a short peak at what he did all the time. But right after, several events seem to rush on him, and the viewer doesn't even get time to breath. And that's the point that really annoyed me after the movie ended. You didn't get a chance to put yourself in the situation of being the last man on earth, cause the story is pushed forward with an immense speed.<br/><br/>This could have been a really haunting movie, but it seems the studio didn't want to risk to bore the audience, and made a fast paced Hollywood movie instead.<br/><br/>That's why I (beside of being good entertained through the whole movie) give this flick only 7/10 stars"

","I don't think there are too many actors out there that can spend the first two thirds of a movie talking only to a dog and still be believable. Will Smith is an excellent actor and he does a pretty good job here as well. I doubt his performance is Oscar worthy though. (I will admit I was nearly in tears when the dog died). Too many people want to compare this movie to the book written in the 50's and the movie ""The Omega Man"" made in '71. I don't believe a proper comparison can be made to three works of art produced over three generations. While I haven't seen ""The Omega Man"" and won't draw any conclusions on that, I have read the book. Which is a rather grand adjective for 160 pages. Personally, I'm conflicted on whether I like the book. The premise for the story is original, (a disease causing vampirism wipes out man), but the rest was pretty predictable. A regular guy forced into an extraordinary situation learns to survive in a hostile environment. And sadly, that premise wasn't expanded on in ""I Am Legend"". I would have liked to see the vampirism angle in this movie and I think that would have made the movie better. Overall, a fairly good movie that could have been great but just fell short."
"macpiej","Null","0","2","15 January 2008"," I Am Legend Review
","This is one hell of a movie! Creepy and gory and shocking, yet intelligent and futuristic and... legendary! It is an edgy film of our time, a story of the future and its assumptive prediction. Will Smith's most breath-taking role.<br/><br/>Can you imagine a world without any other human species (besides you)? Only you and your pet dog in a mouse trap which is as big as, well, Manhattan island? And everything you were used to is gone. The busy streets (that have turned into a ghost town), the people you love (who either died or have turned into monsters), and the lively place that was once New York City (now infested with unexplainable creatures). Very creepy and disturbing.<br/><br/>In the movie, the over-all feel of isolation and alienation was conveyed from the beginning. The movie started with a deer chase on broad day light, the search for other survivors. The whole place was still, no other movement except that of the hero's and the deer's. Not a soul in the streets. And you will wonder how it feels to be the only living animal on earth. But you might be wrong, because more mystery uncovers as the movie continues. Why does he have to head home when his watch alarms, why does he shut metal shields inside his windows at sunset, and what are those horrible noises he hears when darkness comes? And then during a fateful day in the story, when he conscienscously probed a dark, abandoned building, the defaced charactersappeared for the first time in a close encounter with him and his dog. This scene uncovers what lurks inside the seemingly lifeless and empty towers of New York, when they come out, and what they are. It was chilling suspense! Along the plot, more mysteries were uncovered. But there are similarly a few loop holes that kill the admiration of the complexity of the story. First, why are the cars parked primly, when it should be a picture of haywire and everything topsy-turvy if it has been a cat-and-mouse chase or a survival-in-the-jungle way of life in that city for the past 3 years. Also, why did Neville ""lost it"" when he recognized the same mannequin somewhere else? Why did he irrationally got out of the car and started shooting it and even stepped near it, when he should have thought that it was a booby trap waiting for him. Even the audience knew it the first time they saw it, that the dark side is up to something. And the natural tendency is to think, act weary, put his gun near him, and drive out of that corner immediately! He should have thought to never go back to that DVD store again, or even confining himself in the safety of his house for a while. Think of his enemies' plot, of his own counter plan, and a change in his routine if he has become predictable to his enemies. It was a flaw, an error on trying to end his character. His character didn't have to die, but if it does, it shouldn't have to be that way. If Will's character was supposed to die, or if the infected people were supposed to be eradicated, what could be the best climax where the protagonist and the antagonist will clash? It could be for a better cause, not mere getting out of his mind or going crazy. <br/><br/>All-in-all, this movie is one of its kind, it deserves no less than praises from movie critics."

","You have to hand it to the British people for discovering a cure for cancer which involves turning ninety-nine percent of the world's population into either corpses or bloodthirsty zombies who prey on the one percent that remain immune. That's earned us a cup of tea for sure. I Am Legend follows the life of Robert Neville (Will Smith), a Lieutenant Colonel/scientist stationed in New York city in the wake of this global disaster, attempting to develop a cure for over three years while living with his only companion, a dog named Samantha.<br/><br/>Though many elements of the storyline stray dangerously close to ripping off 2002's 28 Days Later (in which the rage-infected zombies were also courtesy of British scientists; congratulations us), 'Legend's execution is so stylish it hardly seems to matter. We are treated to panoramic shots of a crumbling New York, its streets populated with a multitude of rusting cars, fauna sprouting uncontrollably from every crack in the ground. All bridges in and out of the city are destroyed, their skeletal frames still visible in some places. Wildlife from the Central Park Zoo runs freely through the city, unchecked by human hand. And living amongst all this is the Fresh Prince, wearing his cap sideways and shouting ""Aww, hell no!"" at every opportunity. Not really. Once again, Will Smith delivers in spades. Throughout the film he accurately balances the dramatic with the humorous, with neither (until the final third) overshadowing the other. His conversations with his co-star, Abbey the Dog, are the source of the humour, though they also serve to highlight Neville's fragile hold on his sanity, as is shown further in the movie when he does temporarily lose his grip on reality. Smith portrays all this with veritable aplomb and makes you feel sincerely relieved that you were one of the 99% who were not immune, and thus able to sleep all day and dance all night. The zombies themselves are very similar to the perpetually vomiting cavemen from 2005's The Descent (perhaps director Francis Lawrence really likes British cinema), but for some reason much less terrifying. Perhaps because they've crossed the line from looking scary to looking ridiculous. Yes, that's it. However, the film isn't really about them, it's about one man and his dog. And assault rifle.<br/><br/>Problems in 'Legend begin with the arrival of Anna, a refugee with a ten year old child in tow who heard the message Neville was broadcasting on the radio (Gettin' Jiggy With It I believe), urging survivors to find him. They are rather unnecessary to the plot and seem as if they were included only due to the film's hashed ending sequence. In fact, they are responsible for all the annoying points in the movie. Here's a list: 1) They ate Neville's bacon; he was saving it, 2) The child is responsible for allowing Shrek to take up half the running time of the film as it can be heard in the background, 3) Anna keeps referring to God and His plan for her which just seems out of place and awkward, 4) Anna does not know who Bob Marley is, 5) Neville has to tell her Bob Marley's Legend is the greatest album ever; he's wrong, and 6) Anna is directly responsible for leading the zombies to Neville's safe house, ushering in a watered down, cloying ending. Overall though, this does not affect the entertainment factor in any major sense.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is also full of little extras which make you smile and generally enhance the viewing experience. Sure, the main one comes in the form of a Superman logo/Batman logo cinema poster, kind of like the alien skull in Predator 2, but there are others such as playing golf off a Blackbird jet, a two minute Emma Thompson cameo and the horrific waking deaths of billions of people. Splendid.<br/><br/>To conclude, while some parts may seem a retread of the superior-in-every-way 28 Days Later, 'Legend is still definitely worth watching and Will Smith remains on top of his game, though with gold such as ""It's just... I was saving that bacon!"", how could he not?"

Also, despite being a Christan, I found Anna's ""God told me that there were people in the mountains"" speech to be one of the dumbest things ever put in film. It slightly irritated me that the monsters couldn't talk and were CGI as well, but didn't really detract from the experience.

","I am Legend, starring Will Smith, is a feature film adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name. And the movie is quite a good one, successfully portraying the feeling of isolation, post-apocalyptic dread, sufficient acting, and a tight storyline for the most part, it suffers from a cliché-ridden finale that weakens the experience a bit.<br/><br/>The movie is about virologist Robert Neville, who thinks he may be Earth's only human not affected by a man-made virus. He works to create a cure while living in a city inhabited by mutant victims of the plague.<br/><br/>The film starts off great, with a little flashback to how the infection began, and then moving towards the present when Will Smith is the only man on Earth. Throughout the movie, the movie goes back in time and tells what really happened and led to the current state of humankind. This was a great way to start off, and the idea of how the infection spread is unique from other zombie movies, and makes you think too.<br/><br/>Talking about the vampires in the movie, they do not look most convincing as they would have if they would have been human, but thankfully, that doesn't detract from the experience so much. Will Smith gives a good performance as an isolated scientist looking for a cure, so does the rest of the cast (a few to speak of) It is after the first act that the experience starts to be marred. Midway, the movie adds a few drawn-out Castaway inspired sequences which we all have seen, not to mention the one with the dog. You will know it when you see it. They are well-shot, but we have seen them before done better.<br/><br/>As a few other characters are introduced, the movie falls for a very cliché-ridden ending, which is the weakest point for the movie. Not spoiling anything, I can just say that we have seen the very ending in countless zombie movies like 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Shaun of the Dead' etc.<br/><br/>Overall, I am Legend is a fun ride for the most part, and though the clichéd ending is a letdown, the movie never fails to entertain. Worthy of the ticket price."

","For a start i am aware that this will be the third incarnation of Richard Matheson's book I Am Legend but the only one with the same title.<br/><br/>The first being ""The Last Man On Earth"" with Vincent Price and the second being ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>I did have high expectations this time around and for the first hour i wasn't disappointed. Will Smith is excellent as Robert Neville and you genuinely feel how alone he is as he talks daily to mannequins he has placed across a barren new york, as well as his trusty side kick Sam (his dog) The director did a good job with certain scenes by making the viewer feel almost as isolated as Neville.<br/><br/>Where it falls down is basically everything Akiva Goldsman wrote into the script. Fortunately i was able to read the original draft done by Mark Protosevich and it was superb. It had all the elements of Mathesons book, namely that Neville hunted the creatures during the day. They could talk and showed signs of intelligence and saw Neville as the cause of the demise of humanity and therefor their sworn enemy. He became ""legend"" However Goldsman has a lot of sway in Hollywood and stamped his mark on the script by completely changing the ending, and the middle, and the creatures etc etc.<br/><br/>The ending of this film felt rushed. It is over in 20 minutes and you really do feel robbed because the first 2 acts build you up for something good.<br/><br/>The creature design is awful. The CGI doesn't work in this. It is meant to be scary and it isn't. The darkness is meant to bring with it a heightened sense of dread. It doesn't.<br/><br/>I have watched this twice and still feel the same way. The ending lets it down immensely.<br/><br/>It's not the worse movie i saw in 2007 and it's definitely not the worse re-make i've seen but i was hugely disappointed by this film.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Mathesons book then you probably won't like this film at all. If you are a fan of any of the earlier films then again you prob wont like it.<br/><br/>If however you like your isolated, alone, apocalypse, end of the world films then it is worth a watch.

","Two-Thirds good. The set up and flashback sequences are intriguing and interesting. Will Smith is as engaging as ever, and some of the shots of him walking around a desolate New York are nothing short of breath taking. But then the darkness comes, and the creatures come out. And unfortunately it's in these scenes, when this film switches from engaging dark science fiction into schlock horror. Those fantastic earlier moments are totally let down by a very poor final third, featuring underdeveloped characters and a rushed ending.

And the tacked-on happy ending seems out of place.<br/><br/>If you've seen The Omega Man, this movie will feel very familiar, with scene after scene essentially replicated. (If you stay through the screen credits, you'll see that the 1971 script by the Corringtons is credited as a source for the movie, along with Richard Matheson's 1954 novel.) I wish they had not made the Dark Seekers so primitive and savage in this version; the dialog and adversarial relationship between Neville and Mathis in Omega Man gave that movie more depth and substance than the horde of CGI monsters in this new version.<br/><br/>Still, I Am Legend is a pretty good movie, better than about 80% of the stuff they're turning out these days."

","Basically, I think I agree with a lot of people on this. I loved most of the movie. I reminded me of 28 Days Later without riding its back. From the beginning to the dog's death (which wrenched a few tears from my mother and me), the movie was taut, raw, and believable. It was when Anna came into the scene and started talking about God and his plan that I felt the movie lost its impetus. The entire movie was going down a pretty straight road (no, I'm not trying to emulate Emma Thompson's explanation of her 'vaccine,' although I suppose it's apt that my metaphor resembles it), and then suddenly near the end it twists to the side and you wonder where the ending came from because that didn't seem to be the direction you were originally going.<br/><br/>I'm not talking about predictability and I'm not talking about convention. I'm talking about a story arc that reaches a satisfying conclusion. Movies (and other forms of literature) resemble real life, but we all know that movies can't completely mirror real life. Whereas life is a series of overlapping waves, movies need to have a connected arc. There was no theme through the greater part of the movie that lead to the end, and in my opinion (although I may be biased), Robert made a pretty compelling argument against Anna's God. Anna's sole purpose seemed to be to bring God into the situation without any other precedent in the movie. Suddenly, all these butterflies come along when the only connection that I could remember was from his daughter. And that's all. It was not significant enough to draw upon for a climax. I am Legend wasn't Signs. At the end, I only had the sensation of being force-fed a theme that the rest of the movie did not support. The butterflies at the end struck me as a fantastic coincidence and not the Fate Given By God that the director intended. I walked away unsatisfied."

","Let me get this straight: the reason I watched this movie was because I wanted to ""see"" the original novel. No, I didn't read the novel completely; I just got it's synopsis and I found it extremely interesting. Now I love vampires. I think they're one of the most amazing mythological monsters there is. Too bad the movie diverted itself from the concept. But still, if they used the ""vampire"" concept rather than the ""infected"" concept, then we'd have no problems with the CGI now would we? Plus, it would leave more room for the script (I can just imagine Neville roaming the streets and then one of the vampires peeks into the window and taunts him).<br/><br/>Of course, being a movie enthusiast, I do understand why they made a different adaptation. For one thing, it would be much scarier if the infected looked like Grendel from Beowulf (no sarcasm intended) rather than physically normal human beings with vampire characteristics.<br/><br/>One thing I really hated about the movie was the ending. It wasn't as powerful as I thought it was going to be. The title of the movie was ""I AM LEGEND"". That implies that Robert Neville was the one who will say or have said it; not someone else. Why did he become a legend? You can either watch the movie or read the book. Personally though, I prefer the book ending (because my friends told me that the book has a really great ending). But still, this was a great movie. Watch it and be entertained."

","Yeah I said good, not great, but for 10 bucks and using a movie ticket I was pleased.<br/><br/>I had few problems with this movie, I've never seen ""The Omega Man"" but from what I heard about it, it represented the legend aspect of the original novel the best out of the three adaptations.<br/><br/>However I felt this book represented the germ or in the movie the virus rather well. I was sadden by the fact they didn't keep any of the original traits of the virus. The fact that they weren't vampires annoyed me a little too. We were presented with a man essentially fighting an virus which was present in the book (however short lived that phase was.) Lets not forget about the Hollywood happy ending they decided to tack on as well.<br/><br/>Other then that I felt the movie was good, clearly was worth the watch. I felt they did a good job presenting Roberts psychological struggles that were present in the book. At least his struggles in the beginning in the book matched the struggles he shared when Sam died.<br/><br/>To sum up, did the movie do the film justice? not really but it could have been worse, was it a good adaptation of the book? yes. it provides entertainment if you're willing to look past the differences.<br/><br/>If not you're doomed to call this another Hollywood failure."
"gortx","Null","0","1","7 January 2008"," The Last Omega Legend On Earth
","*** Some mild spoilers *** First, we had the Richard Matheson novel with the same title, which has become itself, the stuff of ""Legend"".<br/><br/>Next, Matheson contributed to (under a pseudonym) a script for a Vincent Price-starring version shot in Italy as THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. For years, the film suffered a poor reputation for its low budget, Price's performance and the unfaithfulness to its source material. In recent years, a 35mm print (and some decent quality DVDs) has begun showing in Festivals and in revival houses has emerged and the film's rep has been rehabbed to a certain extent. I am quite fond of it, despite some major problems.<br/><br/>Then, it was Charleton Heston as THE OMEGA MAN in a tres 70's version. This one strays further from the novel, but Heston was on quite an SF run with PLANET OF THE APES, SOYLENT GREEN and this film and it's still enjoyable. And, the Oop CD soundtrack is groovy, man! Now, it's Will Smith in a version that actually uses the book's title. With a budget who's craft service account alone probably cost more than the combined budgets of the previous 2 films (even adjusted for inflation), the film unquestionably has the largest scope of the trio.<br/><br/>While not quite as faithful to Matheson's story as LAST MAN, it hues close enough. Smith is a fine actor, but this isn't his best performance. Mock Heston (and Price) all you want, but the part seems to need an actor with a bit more gravitas than Smith can provide. The prior two versions had a greater sense of despair and gloom. The Architectural Digest look of his apartment gives the film an uncomfortably 'homey' feel that seems all wrong for the tale. The scene where the Brazilian woman and the kid show up and watch SHREK has a cheery domesticality that seems from another picture. Similarly, the Flashbacks seem imposed in order to beef up Smith's character's emotion, rather than allowing the performance to do so (the flashbacks don't really add anything to the ""plot""; but, at least, they don't resort to the hoary 'Home Movies' cliché!).<br/><br/>Still, I think the film works. Largely, it's Matheson's bleak vision that prevails, despite an all too predictable Hollywood Ending that is totally at odds with the prior two films and Matheson's tale. I didn't see the CGI in the film as negatively as others have, and the Art Direction is truly superior with a, for once, totally believable empty city. The Big Studio nature of the film seems to have required pumping up the action a bit, and the whole CGI ""Fast Zombie"" thing has become old hat following the 28 DAYS/WEEKS LATER films, the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake etc.. This version was in the works for well over a decade and, in a way, may have come too late to seem as fresh as it might have if it had been made several years ago.<br/><br/>Still, this is one of the better SF films made in recent years. The direction and script show intelligence, and, minor contrivances aside, doesn't condescend to audience expectations."

","If this movie's aim was to get people to jump out of their seats then it succeeded tremendously. The movie's tension scenes are perfect and even though the zombie scenes where they jump out of nowhere can be predicted at times you still jump when it happens. The plot is pretty basic. Virus spreads out and one man is immune to it. Zombies try and kill him and we all know that he will find a cure and save the world. Bla, bla, bla. If you forget the simple plot and relax it is a good enjoyable movie. Will Smith is great and is able to cast many jokes around the fact that he is the last man on earth. I don't know why people complain that the zombies are animated because it is brilliant that way with the zombies looking more scary that anything make up could do. See it but don't sit down."
"BA_Harrison","8","0","2","7 January 2008"," I Am Impressed.
","I'm a huge fan of The Omega Man, the 70s film adaptation of Richard Matheson's book I Am Legend, and so when I heard that a new version was on the horizon, starring crowd-pleaser Will Smith and directed by Francis Lawrence (who made the so-so Constantine), I feared the worst.<br/><br/>However, I am glad to report that I Am Legend is a hugely entertaining post-apocalyptic chiller, despite featuring that scourge of many contemporary fantasy/horror films: poorly conceived CGI monsters. Lawrence delivers a tight, effective, and very enjoyable movie, and Smith does a commendable job in a role that, for the most part, requires him to interact with just a dog, some mannequins, and a bunch of digital effects.<br/><br/>The film opens in a deserted and derelict New York, as Robert Neville (Smith), survivor of a worldwide plague, travels the lonely streets of The Big Apple hunting for food and searching for other humans. Then, as the sun begins to sink, he nervously heads for home (taking special care to cover his trail) where he barricades himself in until dawn, because, when night falls on Manhattan, the infected crawl from their hiding places to feedon blood!<br/><br/>Much of the film follows Neville as he goes about his daily routine: hunting, foraging for food, searching for other survivors, talking to shop dummies, driving golf balls off the end of an aircraft carrier, and desperately searching for a cure to the disease that has ravaged the planet. The mundanity and repetitiveness of his life is brilliantly conveyed and the fragility of his sanity is easy to understand.<br/><br/>Of course, occasionally, our protagonist's familiar schedule is interrupted by something a little different, such as when (in the film's tensest moment) his trusty canine friend Sam chases a deer into a very dark building, leaving Neville no choice but to follow. And sometimes his experiments require him to capture a live infected specimen. Which is interesting.<br/><br/>Eventually, however, Neville's lonely life takes a completely unexpected turn, when, late one afternoon, he falls into a trap set by the infected, and the sun slowly begins to set...<br/><br/>Often exciting, sometimes scary, and even occasionally quite sad, I Am Legend is a blockbuster film that actually deliversquite a rarity these days.<br/><br/>Shame about those CGI monsters, though."

A film with some heart and some thought other than action sequences and CGI displays.<br/><br/>In a time when man is heading towards self-destruction, this is quite an interesting film. It perhaps tells us that there are boundaries on what we can and can't do. I shall not hail this as a perplexing masterpiece, but it is no average blockbuster.<br/><br/>Will Smith, once again provides a solid and powerful performance; he carries out a similar task to Tom Hanks in 'Castaway', another film acted alone by a brilliant actor.<br/><br/>After a cure for cancer turns nasty and infects a lot of people, who become violent, uncontrollable creatures and the whole world is infected or killed by the infected, Dr. Robert Neville is left alone at 'Ground Zero'. Stuck in Manhattan, the virologist tries to find a cure to treat the infected. That is the basic story.<br/><br/>The first hour is wildly interesting, then the film slows down, perhaps losing the plot slightly in the middle, and then ends satisfyingly at the end.<br/><br/>The film has been questioned about certain of its scientific aspects, which I noticed as well: How can Robert have running water and electricity, when there are no factories or reservoirs operating for 3 years? Is it reasonable that deer, lions and tigers would inhabit Times Square three years after isolation? How come at the beginning of the film, Neville drives a sparkling, shiny, new supercar, when it has been lying there for 3 years? There are possible answers for all the above questions, but those are not the main focus points. It's a film at the end of the day and a very entertaining one as well.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

Solitude and anxiety haunt the whole film, New York city locations are an indelible portrait of this catastrophic world, that is a bit similar to the one depicted in other movies of the same genre lately released (""28 Days"" and ""Children of Men""). The story is propelled to a climax that is really explosive, the agoraphobia is impressive but every single moment of the film is worth seeing"

"tnrcooper","7","0","2","6 January 2008"," Smith, resolution of film are good
","I gotta say, I was all ready to sneer at this movie for mythologizing the last man on Earth (like, would you really be most upset that someone ate your bacon when you haven't seen another human for three years? Would you really be that upbeat and have your wits about you to that degree after three years without human contact? Would you be so hard-headed as to separate yourself from your young family and solve a probably intractable problem as Smith's character does?) but in the end, I found that the resolution of the film made it worthwhile. If you can accept that someone could survive as they do in New York in that state for three years, I think you can appreciate the manner in which the film is resolved, in a positive, but realistic tone. Smith is very good although not much is asked of him. That is no diminution of him though and he as charismatic and compelling as ever. However, the director structures the action and plot well, identifying the manner in which Smith's character lives when he is supposedly the last man on earth, then introducing some challenging elements to his way of life. Smith's character looks into the threat posed by some disturbing creatures and finds out how the human race might continue. An enjoyable diversion."

","Excellent acting from Will Smith. There is a real sense of dread and claustrophobia throughout , built through the handycam 'documentary' style camera-work.The tight closeups with accompanying atmospheric soundtrack and not having a wide field of vision make the viewer wonder what's there....waiting. A realistic depiction of desolation and loneliness , NOT an action film but a slow burn tension builder with bursts of adrenaline. The CGI isn't the best but I'd rather have a well conceived and executed film with slightly below par cgi than a vacuous one with state of the art 'graphics'. As for people moaning about the script - there isn't much - he's on his own for heavens sake - and at no point did what was said jar.

Yes Omega Man 1971 is probably the most similar movie, even because of the name of the protagonist, but I relate the movie more to The Last Man On Earth with the great Vincent Price. Of course this movie has many more special effects than the previous ones, times have changed..., and different monsters. We go from the 50s and 60s style zombies of Last Man On Earth to these night sort of vampires, very similar by the way to monsters already seen somewhere else. So, not an original movie and not an original idea, but I like Will Smith and generally I like the story. Some mistakes and stupid things around to make the movie more exciting, but ridiculous: I was expecting more to go around on bicycle (after 3 years of world's end...) than with a new Ford Mustang crashing on goats or wild jungle animals... but it's OK... hey, it's Hollywood!!

","In the last few days since watching I am Legend, not only did I gain a deep respect for Will Smith as an actor, I found myself more able to immerse myself into a character. Since movies like The Matrix, Serenity, the Pirates of the Carribbean series, etc.. I think movie watchers have become spoiled by the use of computer graphics. Not only do they expect dazzling effects, they have a huge tendency to compare movie to movie. It's my opinion that movie watchers of the present typically are not capable of transcending beyond the eye-candy, and don't allow themselves to put themselves in the character's shoes.<br/><br/>I was deeply moved the FIRST time I saw I am Legend.. after all, what would YOU do in a situation like that? 3 years after an apocalyptic event with no human contact, and the very serious prospect of being the last man alive? Consider the mental and emotional consequences of not only knowing that everyone is dead, but also losing your immediate family. ..Think of the routines you might develop... after all you're the only one you have to hang out with 24 hours a day.... ..I felt, in a way, close to Robert Neville. During the course of my lifetime I've found myself, in a sense, completely alone. Of course, the good doctor did have a canine friend.. ..so did I. ..and like the doctor, I've lost friends like that. I hated that part of the movie, and for the first time in a very long time, I had to wipe tears from my face.<br/><br/>Yes, I've had arguments with other people that watched this movie and picked it apart because for ridiculous reasons like the ""overuse of CG"". It makes me wonder why people even watch movies.. Albeit it's all ""entertainment"", if you're able to, try putting yourself into that situation and consider everything that might happen in a 24 hour period. ..hell.. consider everything that could possibly happen in 24 minutes. This movie deserves recognition, and Will Smith has impressed me more than most actors ever have. Not only was his character completely believable, he displayed a strength that is nothing but rare these days. In reality, I think that too many people have taken the stance that it's ""better to not get involved"".. ..or when they see someone in trouble they prefer to stand back and watch rather than try to help or do something to prevent bad things from happening. In general, too many people disgust me with their apathy towards others.. Lottery mentality and disgraceful gestures by the you-tube generation.. ""it's not my problem man.."" ""not my job man.."" ..self serving degenerates... ""why work when you can sue somebody"" hasn't anyone considered the simple parts of this film? ..returning DVDs to the store.. not pillaging the entire town of items like after the Katrina disaster? Has that not been taken into consideration while analyzing Will's character? Didn't anyone see the crowds of people hauling TVs and stacks of DVD players from stores? Did they really NEED those things to survive? I think we all know the answer to that question.<br/><br/>I commend the makers of this film, and my hat is off to Mr. Smith for a BRILLIANT, POWERFUL, and EMOTIONALLY STIMULATING Performance. If I had the chance to personally thank him, I would. I found this character to be inspiring on many levels. Thank you Will, and Thank you Mr Lawrence for producing this wonderful story."

It seemed to be tagged on to give it the action that all big Hollywood blockbusters need.<br/><br/>However I Am Legend is above your average blockbuster and Will Smith gives one of his best performances. the special effects in recreating New York like you've never seen before are truly amazing. Although must of the films budget must have been spent on this as the CGI effects for the Death-Seekers is pretty poor.<br/><br/>A slower pace and an extra 20min and you have benefited this movie as the last 30 seemed rushed."

This man has created something that wiped out the most of earths population and now he's left alone to fix it. In that loneliness is all the tragic.Just put yourself in his shoes and think what you would have done.How pointless everything is without anyone around you.He was even going to the video store to return his movie and take another one,when he could have the whole store.It just make you think,doesn't it?"
"mdett1776","8","0","2","4 January 2008"," A good movie and a great performance
","This movie was really very good and not at all your typical post-apocalyptic zombie horror film. Rather than everything being all dark and dreary, there is the feel as though the planet is going back to nature. All in all not a bad future to look forward to if you can get past the whole man eating monster, genocidal virus thing. Will Smith gives an extremely memorable performance in this movie and really brings audiences along with him as he struggles to make it through daily life. All the more credible is his performance given the fact that he is, for all intents and purposes, the only actor of the movie. Viewers will sympathize with his mannequin interaction and his television reruns as he attempts to ward off the loneliness. And they will feel his relationship with his faithful German Shepard, Sam as well as the anguish when Sam dies. Although we don't really see him kill the dog, the pain he is going through is written all over his face and the audience will be almost as grief stricken as Neville himself is. That said, there were some problems with the movie. For example, the monsters movement and the overall way they looked at times seemed improbable. I felt that there was too much CGI and not enough real actors in makeup playing the part. Also there could have been more of a back story and more of an explanation of how things went on during the three years from the evacuation scene to the new world. Also, if these 'dark seekers' are supposed to be all instinct and no higher brain function, then who moved the mannequin and who set the snare trap that Neville got caught in. Pretty sophisticated for a bunch of mindless zombies. Also the ending and the survivor's colony, I thought was kind of a weak ending given the strength of the movie up till then. <br/><br/>That being said this is a very good film and a great way to spend an hour and a half. Will this movie scare you? Yes. Will this movie move you? Yes. Will this film win any Oscars? Probably not but who cares. Good job Will Smith, good job Francis Lawrence."

","I was happy to hear that there would be a new film adaptation of this book until I heard Will Smith was staring and then I assumed it would be rubbish. Thankfully that wasn't the case.<br/><br/>Will Smith is excellent in the lead, which is good since he is the only real character in the film, he manages to deliver an great performance as a desperate man who is refusing to give in and unlike in other films he's been in he never compromises the performance by showing his own personality.<br/><br/>The film is dark and atmospheric at times with a little running and screaming. The creatures are probably the worst part of the film, they are obvious CGI and look fake and silly, their behaviour isn't consistent either, sometimes they display high levels of intelligence but not when the are actually on screen and are shown as dumb zombie style creatures for simplicity.<br/><br/>The film does have two of my least favourite types of direction; the first is jerky camera work, we can see that he is running making the screen jump up and down doesn't heighten tension it is just annoying; the second is things jumping in to shot suddenly to startle you, yes people jump when it happens but it's no smarter than jumping out from behind a door and shouting boo!<br/><br/>The ending is OK, it's a little convenient and not especially smart but this is an action film after all.<br/><br/>This does lack the intelligence and sophistication of the book, the creatures and the ending are much smarter in the book, but it is a reasonably faithful adaptation. <br/><br/>It's a good action film which works better in the quiet scenes than in the action ones but it hangs together well enough and Smith's performance is good enough to hold your interest. <br/><br/>Entertaining but not really special."

","I am Legend is a movie that questions the old cliché ""Hell is other people."" In the 2009, a female doctor ( Emma Thompson, in a star cameo ) creates what is thought is a cure for cancer. However, this 'cure' begins to show dark after effects as it mutates to become a massive epidemic that wipes out almost all the population. A small number are immune to the virus, but they are hunted by the Darkseekers- infected humans not dissimilar to vampires.<br/><br/>Robert Neville ( Will Smith ) is one such human who is immune to the virus- perhaps the last one on Earth. He has set up New York City as a sort of massive farm for himself and his dog, which is his only living companion. Three years of solitude are beginning to take their toll on Robert and despite his relentless search for a cure, it's looking bleak. That is, until perhaps a new revelation will give him the strength to continue.<br/><br/>Will Smith really grabs hold of this, and has you believing he is the last man on Earth. You wonder how much longer he can hold out with hope. Manhattan, too is transformed beautifully into a post-apocalyptic 'farm' of sorts and it's backdrops enhance the story tenfold. My only real gripe with the movie is the Darkstalkers themselves as they look fairly...boring. All of them seem very generic and bland, and while having fangs, never seem to have them out.<br/><br/>However, I am Legend is a good film with some great acting and backgrounds to go with it. Although the villains are disappointing, the first 45 minutes is a truly amazing set up."
"gallae","8","0","2","4 January 2008"," Good version of a favourite book
","I rather liked the previous films based on Richard Matheson's novel ""I am Legend"", but for different reasons. The first - Last Man on Earth - is a more or less faithful adaptation of the book, the second - The Omega Man - is such a ""mod"" update of it and very particular for the 70s. This adaptation is certainly influenced by the second but seems much more ""realistic"".<br/><br/>The main thrust of this film isn't the ""vampires"" as such (they're not really Zombies) but the immense sense of isolation felt by the main character, whose only friend seems to be his only link with sanity.<br/><br/>Won't go too much into the plot much, but what impressed me the most was the convincing depiction of a derelict, overgrown New York. I know it involved some form of 3D modelling but I just couldn't see the seems. I noticed all the credits for the Coast Guard - just what did they do? But the thing is, this is a truly great ""Warehouse Earth"" film. Others include 'The Quiet Earth', and 'The World, the Flesh and the Devil'. In such films we see a stark contrast between between the world we know, and what happens when all of sudden we're no longer sharing it like we used to. That accent is on what's missing, rather than what it.<br/><br/>What's missing is a lot of dialogue. Most of what we here is in flashbacks and on recorded videos and news casts. Neville (the main character) talks to his dog Samantha a lot, and her fate disturbed me a great deal.<br/><br/>A film well done."
"saiyanhajime","7","0","1","4 January 2008"," It just... lacked something?
","It's easy to push this film off as a bad version of what we've already seen before, but it really did lack something special... At the same time though, it gave something I wasn't expecting.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the emotional depth of the film, but left cringing at the appalling (and cheesy) CGI. The way the zombies move, act and look is laughable. They are not scary, visually or emotionally. The other disappointment is that nothing really happens throughout. There is only one scene that I thoroughly enjoyed and I think that was a personal thing anyway.<br/><br/>It just isn't what you expect from zombie movie, I guess. But saying that when was it ever marketed as one? It lacked the excitement expected of it and I can't work out what made it a 15. And the majority of the audience, at least at the little cinema in London I work at, seems to feel the same. Older viewers with broader taste seem to enjoy it, but the younger one's are confused.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance is always good, but I think his partner deserves just as much credit in this movie. You will fall in love with Samantha and be disappointed with her human replacement towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>I think people who don't usually like monster horror films will be pleasantly surprised to see a film with such emotional depth. People keep harping on about the religious undertone and whilst even for an atheist it was touching, there is far more to this film to appreciate on that same level. But if you're expecting an exciting movie, you might be a lit- really disappointed."

The storyline is definitely not something that interests me, and I would not have even thought of seeing this movie if not for the star. I did really enjoy the film though. It is tear-jerking in two particular moments, makes you jump out of your seat and while throughout the film you may feel a little bit lost, don't despair as by the end of the movie you will completely understand everything that happened.

","Those that are going to see ""I Am Legend"" expecting it to be yet another big blockbuster about zombies will be in for a surprise. Yes, there are typical blockbuster elements. However, they are actually pretty few and far between.<br/><br/>Rest assured that the action, although not that plentiful, is fairly good. It's nothing you haven't seen before, but it's competently done. Some have complained about crappy CGI but I had no problem with that. What is a bit bothersome was the fact that the sound effects were awfully loud, but this is probably more to blame on the poor cinema were I watched this movie.<br/><br/>For the most part however, ""I Am Legend"" is a fairly serious character study into loneliness and loss. A significant part of the movie is just Will Smith doing his daily chores and trying to survive in a deserted New York and for the most part this is done pretty well. Smith gets plenty of time to develop his character and there are some truly touching scenes. Moreover, the depiction of his post-apocalyptic life is for the most part rather convincing (he doesn't become raving mad, but's he's not 100% sane either any more).<br/><br/>On the other hand, the flashbacks that depict what happened before New York became deserted are the standard Hollywood happy family routine, and are definitely a bit too sappy, let alone predictable. Also, Smith is not a real character actor and that shows at times.<br/><br/>The biggest problem comes at the end however. For the first hour or so, ""I Am Legend"" is a fairly suspenseful and touching tale, but then the movie suddenly goes into overdrive and before you know it, it's finished. Not only that, but the ending once again feels like a cop-out to keep the audience happy and will likely upset those that have read the book.<br/><br/>In the end though, ""I Am Legend"" is a fairly successful mix between ""Cast Away"" and ""28 Days Later"" that combines character study and Hollywood blockbuster reasonably well, at least until it all falls together a bit in the end"

","Saw the movie last night. Visually the movie is very strong. The flash back scenes are well done with a rushed pace that contrasts well to present day pace. Will Smith does do a comparable performance to that of Tom Hanks in Cast Away. Hats off to Will Smith again for proving that he is a talented actor and not just capable of playing the same likable character over and over again (Bad Boys I and II, MIB, ID4, etc,) The computer generated elements of the movie were outstanding, including the deer and lions, but most notably the dark seekers and their frantic and terrifying movement. Will Smith does a great job with Robert Neville's character, especially in depicting the emotional strain of being alone for 1001 days and from keeping himself motivated to ""fixing things"" and remaining at his post at ground zero. His relationship with Sam (Samantha, his German Shepard) was very moving and lovable. I believe that Francis Lawrence was able to make one of the most compelling apocalypse films in years. A must see!"

","I recently went to see ""I Am Legend"". I am a fan of the story and of the 1964 film version called ""The Last Man on Earth "", starring Vincent Price. The film was also remade in the 1970's starring Charlton Heston and called ""The Omega Man"". I must also say that I enjoy Will Smith. He is always WAY above average and fun to watch.<br/><br/>I think fun is the best way to describe this film. Though it deals with a serious subject; world plague, I must admit I never took it seriously. I went in expecting a two-hour diversion from reality and I got it.<br/><br/>The story is simple. Will Smith is instantly likable in the character of a scientist trying to save mankind while loosing what matters most to him in the process. The movie quickly becomes a good guy verses bad guy struggle and we love it.<br/><br/>The special effects are outstanding. In fact, the special effects become another character in the film. They enrich the story and the viewers experience to a point that draws you into the film.<br/><br/>One word of caution: The film maybe too intense for young children.

","This movie falls short of being the definitive post-apocalyptic movie I have been waiting to see since I first saw Romero's Dawn of the Dead (DOTD). Although Will Smith was an excellent choice for this movie the CGI zombies were appalling. You have to ask why they did not use real actors like in 28 Days/Weeks Later which were horrifying. The bloodshot eyes of the infected in Days/Weeks truly hit the mark. The only time IAL came close was the scene with the mother trying to get her daughter past the checkpoint in one of the flashback sequences. Her bloodied eyes and tears of blood lifted that sequence considerably.<br/><br/>However, CGI aside, what really failed in this movie was the lack of any screen time covering the end of civilization. Sure we get to see the streets of New York 3 years later and sure we get a look at someone's abandoned apartment. However, I wanted to see more during the time the virus began to spread and panic began to break out. I wanted to see how people survived and barricaded themselves in at night  living in fear and terror with the noises going on outside. What would you do in a similar situation? How well could you fortify your abode? How long could you last before you had to make excursions to find supplies? What if you were trying to hide out in an industrial area where supplies would be scarce? Referring back to 28 Weeks Later (again), the best sequence in that movie was the first 5 minutes with the group of survivors living in a farmhouse. The tension in that first 5 minutes was second to none and when he left his wife behindsublime moment in horror movie making. What would you have done?<br/><br/>What I would have done to improve IAL: 1. Use real actors over the abysmal CGI. 2. Add 30 minutes to the beginning of the movie show casing the decline of civilization. 3. Show Will Smith fortifying and stocking his home to protect his family from not only the infected but also other survivors. Imaging having to fear both during the day and night! 4. The last 2 hours could have been all about Will Smith surviving and trying to find a cure for his Wife and or Child who had become infected. This could have made the story a more selfish mission of just trying to save his family and not the world. Think of how he might have hunted down his wife/daughter without killing them. Think of how it would have been if it had been his Wife/Daughter on that operating table at the end when the infected were trying to break through. 5. Remove any notion that the infected were intelligent. They should have been nothing more than pack hunters. This is what ruined 28 Weeks Later for me as well. That is, having the father act with intelligence and seemingly recognizing his children after he had become infected.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall I give IAL 7/10."

","Don't listen to anyone who tells you not to see this movie. It is engaging and very interesting unless you have a.d.d. like many of the IMDb reviewers. With so many horrible films getting too much attention during 2007 like Grindhouse, Shoot'em Up and Ghost Rider, many of us didn't hear about or see No Country For Old Men, Death Sentence or Gone Baby Gone. I Am Legend is a great film made for intelligent people who don't want everything thrown in their face in a zillion edited frames. Will Smith gives a brilliant performance and the sets are mind-numbing to say the least. It's a shame that movie goers don't want more for their $12 and are so willing to sit back an have scene literally spit at them.

"Monotreme02","7","0","2","3 January 2008"," Exceeded my expectations; well-made and well-acted entertainment with some flaws
","Shots of the film's main character (and, for the most part, the only character), Dr. Robert Neville, going through his daily routine in an abandoned Manhattan in a sequence looking like the opening scenes in 28 Days Later tenfold featured in the trailer and seemed quite nice, but later shots of Neville's encounters with the ""Dark Seekers"", the film's half-vampire half-zombie creatures made me think that most of the movie would depict his action-filled fight against them. I was most pleasantly surprised to find that most of the film is devoted to depicting precisely the former: a day-in-the-life portrayal of Neville's routine. What is surprising in these sequences is the immense amount of detail director Francis Lawrence and his team go into in order to make the experience as believable and real as possible. The portrayal of the mundane routines Neville goes through every day being pretty much the last man on earth, such as keeping a daily video diary, or his daily radio broadcast announcing his existence to any other survivors in the world.<br/><br/>So how does Lawrence keep the audience interested enough to invest in a film that for the most part depicts the daily routine of the last man on earth? With three simple steps. The first being total immersion of the audience in the reality of the world. We are captured by the film's opening shots of an abandoned Manhattan, which put the opening sequence of Vanilly Sky to shame. Lawrence has us totally convinced to the authenticity of this situation, which makes us able to invest into even the smallest commotions. Second, he fills Neville's life with such small, local dramas that, due to the urgency of his existence and the harsh reality of the world, create a strong emotional impact with us: Neville's developing relationship with his dog, for example, or his occasional forays into the realm of the Dark Seekers, in particular one specific sequence which Lawrence directs with a surprisingly effective sense of dread and true, sincere tension and terror. One can easily compare these dramatic tools to those featured in Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away, another film that features one character carrying almost the entire film on his shoulders alone. In that film, we are quickly accustomed to Chuck's sudden and urgent change in reality, and the smallest occurrences in the mundane, routine-based life he has accustomed for himself become big and dramatically significant events, things such as his discovering fire, a piece of scrap metal washing on shore, and his developing relationship with a volleyball, which to the film's credit is a little more difficult to serve as an emotional investment than a dog is, although I Am Legend handles the field nicely as well. Finally, Lawrence injects these sequences with occasional flashbacks to a time immediately before the outbreak of the disaster alluding to the events pertaining to Neville's own personal family, his wife and daughter, and the fate in store for them. These sequences unfold as their own dramatic arc, which keeps us invested, but is not enough to finish off the story.<br/><br/>The film also has one major element working to its advantage that keeps it going, and that is the immensely talented Will Smith who, similar to Tom Hanks in Cast Away, carries almost the whole movie entirely on his own. Smith delivers a very fine performance with far more depth and intensity than one would expect from the genre, and manages not only to carry the film on his shoulders but also manages to keep the audience emotionally invested in his ventures. Smith's portrayal of Neville is not one of the brave, devoted soul persistent in saving the world, although at first it may seem so. No, it is the portrayal of a broken and deeply scarred individual who has conversations with mannequins in order to fill his life with at least a symbolic dose of human relation; an individual who has lost all possible hope for salvation; an individual who determinedly continues his life's work from before the apocalyptic event not in order to save humanity but in order to give himself a reason to keep on living. Three major events that occur around the end of the second act and the beginning of the third act carry an immense emotional weight on Smith's character, who is used to routine and enters a state of manic shock triggered any external events, and Smith plays these scenes to utmost tragic perfection.<br/><br/>Lawrence, having no other choice, introduces a very major turn of events occurring in the final third of the film that is not only necessary for the dramatic development and closure of the film but is also handled surprisingly well. Naturally I will avoid going into details, but I will say that although I had anticipated the eventual inclusion of such an event, I was most pleasantly surprised at the way Lawrence chose to handle it. That said, the film backs itself into a corner in the final ten minutes or so, and rushes into a rather disappointing ending which, naturally, I will not divulge here and which brings inevitable closure to the dramatic arc, though I would have much preferred an ending more on par with the film's previous levels of poignancy. Also, while the CGI-induced creation of a post-apocalyptic New York City devoid of any other human life is a spectacle to behold, I must admit that the CGI-created zombie creatures are somewhat of a disappointment, and don't always sell perfect believability to the audience. Still, I admit that the film exceeded my expectations, was a lot smarter and better handled than I thought it would be, and of course serves as a solid piece of entertainment, well acted and well made."

","I Am Legend is a post-apocalyptic science fiction horror film, which is loosely based on the 1954 Richard Matheson novel of the same name.

His performances are getting consistently better and more mature with every film that he makes. The deserted look of New York City is also very believable and well shot. Also there's an outstanding performance by Sam the German Shepherd.<br/><br/>Now the bad........the CGI on everything life like or non static is sub standard to terrible. By this I mean everything from the Deer, Lions and more importantly the infected/vampire/night seeker creature things. This is inexcusable for a film to have reportedly cost in excess of $150 million US to make.<br/><br/>**** WARNING SPOILERS **** The film is told with flashbacks which work quite well, but more character development for the Anna and Ethan characters would have aided the story more. In my opinion the film is also way to short at only 100 minutes, it really could of done with being at least 120 minutes. While not being quite what I expected, I did enjoy moments and really hope that a longer running directors cut is released with more polished / improved CGI.<br/><br/>6.5/10<br/><br/>The UnderCoverCritic"

Will portray's the character 'Robert Neville', a man who has managed to survive for three years in New York city along with his companion 'Sam' his faithful dog. Will does not play your average Steven Seagal bursting through doors shooting anything that moves, instead he display's a man desperate to find a cure for the terrible virus that has spread whilst living in fear from the bloodthirsty mutants that hunt him. The film has spectacular scenes of CGI such as the empty streets of New York and even the mutants. The film also has its fair share of jumping moments as well as up setting moments that I can guarantee will bring a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>Do not go to see the film and constantly look for plot holes throughout, instead enjoy the film for its tear jerking drama and its intense action sequences. I strongly recommend I am Legend to anyone as it was an absolute thrill to watch and I hope to go and see it a second time."

","This movie is just wonderful. I really enjoyed it. Even though I got emotionally involved and almost made me tear up a little, it also made me care about Will Smith's character and his dog, Sam. Before I watched this movie, I was wondering what all the hype was about, everybody was talking about how great it is, and how I should see it, and i'm glad I did. It was well worth watching, but i feel like it could've been better somehow, it felt like something was missing, maybe some details were needed. Overall, I wish it wasn't so short, it would've been better if the director added a little more to detail towards the end because the beginning to the middle was GREAT. The last minute was GOOD. I'm not going to complain about CGI, point is, we know what they're trying to show us, and its relatively well done CGI. Which is why I give it a 8/10."

","Despite all appearances, this isn't a shoot-em-up zombie movie, or even a dark horror survival film. Many people watch it expecting it to be, and end up disappointed. In reality the film uses the survival-horror premise as a venue to discuss deep-seated human emotions. There is a beautifully tragic quality to the film, elegantly fleshed out by the performances of Will Smith and Alice Braga. <br/><br/>The infected humans might not be 100% photo-realistic, but the feral determination they convey is much more complex than you normally see in regular Zombie/Horror films. If you don't believe this, watch the eyes of the more prominent 'zombies.' Director Francis Lawrence, and the screenplay writers have taken the mindlessly violent 'Zombie Movie' and turned it into an emotionally sophisticated cinematic experience worth watching."
"neil-685","7","0","2","2 January 2008"," I am impressed
","There are many parts of the film which stand out of me. The incredible way they turned New York into a ""ghost town"" and the detail they put into it. The long shots and wide angles they used to show us that there is nobody left, that New York is dead, was really impressive. But the performance of Will Smith is what captured me throughout the film. It takes a lot for a single actor to hold the audience all by himself and in my mind, he pulled it off. From the solider like persona to the scientist to the man talking to his dog and joking with the mannequins, he grasped them all. I kept thinking to myself that guy who played in The Fresh Prince and Men In Black has grown up into an incredible actor, with a performance I cannot find a match for this year. Well Done Will Smith.<br/><br/>I do however feel the movie would have been more effective had the zombie like creatures been played by actual people rather than magically CGI effects. I think it would have brought a more terrifying understanding of what had happened if we could see raw emotion in the monsters rather than another Alien type creature we are all so use to in scary movies which cause ourselves to say ""it's just a computer animation"". I do understand that the idea was that Will Smith was suppose to be ""The last man on earth"", so I can see why they did what they did.<br/><br/>That being said, it is a movie I am glad I watched and felt that it was more of a sad story than a scary one. It broke my heart twice and when you see it, you will know when."
"garys_ss","7","0","1","2 January 2008"," Will Smith was Fantastic but the film fell short ****Possible Spoilers****
","I've got to be honest I am pretty stunned that Will Smith pulled off this character so well. Long gone it seems are the days of Mike Lowrey in Bad Boys. He played the part so well his dedication to simply continue trying to save the world in an almost impossible situation.<br/><br/>The way he played the character very well gone was what I expected to be the gun ho type character we often see from Smith, Even though he was a Doctor in the Army these guys tend to have amazing weapons skills, The first scene where we are introduced to the Hive showed this rather than his usual character Smith was racked with fear and self doubt but also determined to hang onto his one and only friend in the world.<br/><br/>Later when he finally makes contact with Humans you can see his social behaviour is out the Window and once again this is done to a tee as are his interactions with the dummies in the Video Store.<br/><br/>However the Film has be done before, time and time again and it has been done better, so much so that Smith and the dog Sam are it's only saving grace. The opening scene in New York although dramatic and haunting has been done already in 28 days later but this was the real London shown in this movie where as huge parts of Legend are CGI. The only part of the film where the Zombies are remotely scary is that first scene with the Hive and this is more down to the empathy we feel for Smiths Character rather than the Zombies them selves. Once again see 28 days later rather than totally mutating the humans it gave them a similar virus and similar symptoms but they remained more human and much scarier where as the CGI rendered Zombies looked so fake that I just didn't care after the second scene when Smith captures one of them. As soon as the film turned to an action sequence in the end we lost the thoughtful part of the film. I thin kthe average score for this film on the site is probably about fair, but at the same time I think a lot of the high ratings are more down to Smiths performance which as I said I am genuinely shocked with rather than the actual story line or the rest of the film itself."

","This movie was OK. When i first saw the queues and lines outside the cinema for I am Legend i thought this film must be amazing or something. Later after watching the film i was sadly disappointed and thought after all that hype it was just ordinary. I'm sorry to other people who liked this film but my comment is personal and how I felt about the movie. It was OK. Began a bit strangely and the flashbacks were very effective and the relationship between Will Smith and his dog was sweet and definitely the better part of the movie. I was well upset when the dog became bad...that was evil. May i ask one question? I know we all love Shrek and stuff and that is one amazing film but the point of it in I am Legend was a bit hazy. I mean i know the Will Smith is like proper lonely and that which is why he quotes the lines of Shrek but they went a bit overboard did they not? And the end is something i didn't understand because his blood was the cure and stuff but who would they have cured after blowing them all up in that explosion. Another thing i must mention. Where the hell did the woman and son come from? They just randomly appeared in the movie and stuff and how did they get there? And another thing who powers the electricity in New York? Because whoever they were they should have either been dead or one of those strange monster alien things. Anyway overall was OK...but didn't live up to expectations"

","I am Legend is one of the best films I have ever seen. Many people want more character development and just more information on what happened. But that is what makes this film great. It leaves us wanting more and wanting more information, but all the information we needed was in the film. We don't need character development because you have to pay attention to what Will Smith does to really understand.<br/><br/>Will Smith gave one of his best performances. No one knows how a person would react in such a situation. I felt that Will Smith did it perfect. Still had all the brains but just didn't have the social skills, obviously for good reason.<br/><br/>There are so many words to describe the feelings I felt watching this movie. Excitement, sadness, pain, love, hate. The list can go one. Out of the many films that depicted bubonic plagues or viruses we created, this one was the best. This will be one if not my all time favorite movie for the rest of my life. Who knows, may be it could actually happen."

","First I want to say that I truly liked the film. Always liked Will Smith's acting, and he plays a good role in this movie. But the main reason I write this comment is that I saw a pretty big fault in a scene. At the point, where all the mutated humans are at the other side of the glass, when they're attacking the house. And when the kind of 'leader' of the man attacks the glass, the butterfly starts to commence, and he sees the another butterfly on the neck of Anna, you can see that he has the bite mark on his left shoulder in that scene, but actually, he was bitten in his right shoulders as you can see in all the other scenes, and at the part where he was bitten. I saw this the second time I was watching the film. So I think it's a pretty bad mistake here. Very fast noticed. If you have the film, go to about 1:24:15 or 1:24:00, here You'll see he has the bite mark on the wrong shoulder. In any case, I do like the film. But this glitch had to be seen in my opinion."

","(Not sure if the content of this can be counted as containing spoilers, so thought that I would play it safe) This is the first ever film review that I have written which says something about what I thought about this film, it has compelled me to right this. I would also like to note that a lot of people may disagree with what I say in this review but it is simply my opinion and I wanted to share it with everyone.<br/><br/>Overall, the film I thought was very, very good. Will Smith's acting was superb and did what a lot of films aim to achieve, but fail. It made me become entirely involved in the world it had created, without any question of realism or accuracy. I thought that the relationship which was created between him and his dog was truly fantastic. Being a dog owner, it made the whole situation with Sam feel so much closer to home and genuinely very emotional. It was tragic and the trauma which Robert Neville felt was, to me, very powerful. Furthermore, I thought the part when they had just been attacked by dogs, when I saw Sam limp and fall over, it was heart-breaking as it was innocent and simply his only friend. Obviously, me being a dog owner would mean that this was far more powerful to me, but this was a tragic and moving part of the film which I don't think I am going to forgot any time soon.<br/><br/>The general plot of the film was obviously not truly innovative as I am sure a lot of people will compare it to 28 days/weeks later but I personally think that Will Smith really made this stand out from the rest. Also, the parts of this when he is going into a combat situation/is in one against the Darkseekers, I had a slight feeling of claustrophobia and nervousness as the atmosphere really was that rich. I am glad therefore that this wasn't the only part of the film (which I find to often be a shortcoming of horrors), which meant that other and more subtle parts were not forgotten. The talking with the mannequins and his memorisation of Shrek (on that particular scene), these little parts really did add depth to the plot and film as a whole.<br/><br/>The ending was also very well done. It wasn't drawn out like it easily could have been and the tragedy at the end was quickly followed by a ray of sunshine which the film ended on. This helped keep the film shorter than it could have been (around 1 3/4 hrs) so that it kept your attention for longer and you were immersed in the story even more.<br/><br/>This is, in my opinion, a wonderful film with emotional highs and lows, a compelling plot and action, which is tied up very nicely at the end to make it one of my favourite films of all time. I highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already."

","Doesn't matter how the movie is presented in the trailers, I Am Legend is a horror flick A-movie.

For the people who expected more action en for the people who expected less action maybe yes. But the scary moments as well as the psychological are in balance, and with the acting, scene and timing this is a luxe zombie film.

I have been a fan of Smith for a long time but up until now, he hasn't really fit the bill for me as an actor.<br/><br/>Upon asking one of the ushers in the cinema what she thought of Smith's performance, she said: ""Look at his eyes"".<br/><br/>This was mostly prominent in the scene where his dog gets infected and he has to kill her. <br/><br/>I did, and he broke my heart.

"jaddison383","6","0","2","1 January 2008"," Interesting social commentary...
","Will Smith gives a killer of a performance in I Am Legend; the man definitely has acting chops. You have to give credit to a man who can keep a one-man show interesting. In fact, he almost had me in tears at one point.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a film to be savored for it's more thoughtful moments. It's set in a New York City that has been wiped out by a deadly virus. If the virus doesn't kill you, you turn into a monster/zombie/vampire that can only exist in the dark. Dr. Robert Neville (Smith) is the lone survivor, a famous scientist who is still desperately trying to save mankind.<br/><br/>Despite breathtaking shots of deserted and overgrown New York, the effects are rather lacking here. The monsters are one of the main disappointments of the film. Without giving anything away, I will say that several of their behaviors in the film seem, as strange as it sounds, ridiculous and over-the-top. What is good, though, is really pretty good: The film's message of fate and purpose go over well and are indeed rather hope-inducing. The film also makes a clear point of how mankind will eventually destroy itself. It's no random thing that a cure for cancer is what causes the outbreak. Humans are never satisfied to stop pushing things further, trying harder and harder to rule every aspect of our lives. When we try to play God, there will be consequences.<br/><br/>I Am Legend is a fine film- it just didn't achieve greatness. 7/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

Every day is a struggle to survive and things are getting worst.<br/><br/>The movie hinges on the central character and Will Smith was a great choice for the role. The character, even with some flaws, is pretty interesting to watch. He has to battle with the terrors of the current environment and the painful memories of the past.<br/><br/>Although there are things I can squabble with, the movie was good enough to make those problems seem relatively minor.

I think some people are getting to critical about films nowadays (including myself) and just need to open up their minds a little, its a half decent film to see at the cinema, i don't think it will have any profound effects on anyone, but it will be entertainment none the less.

","I saw this movie last night in Imax and I was very scared. Zombie movies always scare me but I was told that this movie was more sad than scary. There were sad moments, but there were a lot more scary moments. I felt that it was a lot like 28 Day Later. Why do zombies only come out at night in any zombie movie? Wouldn't it be scarier if zombies had no schedule? The twisted humans in Cormac McCartney's ""The Road"" were scarier to me because they were regular human beings gone bad. They thought, they planned, they could travel day or night. <br/><br/>*spoiler* I can't stop thinking about how that woman and her son got to Manhattan if the island was cut off from the rest of the state. I wonder if I missed something. This also leads me to wonder how they got off of Manhattan when they drove away in the end. I can imagine that they drove to NY and rowed a boat to Manhattan. And at the end they drove to the water and took another boat off of Manhattan back to their car. I think it should have some how been mentioned or implied. <br/><br/>Also, why did the virus infect dogs, humans and rats but not lions, antelope, cats, birds and squirrels? Why were the zombies only after humans? *end spoiler* <br/><br/>Over all I would simply say that as zombie movies go, this one was just as suspenseful as the rest.

"isabelle1955","Null","0","2","31 December 2007"," Pretty Good but not Great.
","I'm not usually a fan of the megaplex blockbuster type movie but I have to admit I thought this was pretty good - leaving aside the dubious religious message at the end which nearly spoils it.<br/><br/>The movie is totally dependent on an excellent performance by Will Smith, who I think is now truly one of the world's great superstars, appealing across the boundaries of age, gender and nationality. (I watched I, Robot on TV the night before going to see I am Legend, and he was pretty good in that too, but it's easy to see how much he has gained in experience since.) He is one of those rare actors who can star in an effects driven movie, and still make a real human being, that you actually care about, the pivot point.<br/><br/>Smith plays the last 'normal' person left alive in New York after a virus, engineered to cure cancer, runs amok as a rabies variant, and destroys humanity. By day he drives around the city with his trusty dog Sam, stalking deer, and talking to store mannequins. By night he and Sam cuddle up together in their dark, shuttered apartment, gun at the ready, while Dark Seekers take over the streets looking for food. The Dark Seekers are victims of the virus who have not yet died, but who have been driven mad. He is a scientist still seeking the cure. But is he really the last unaffected person alive? It's all hokum of course, but I admit I enjoyed it. A Saturday Night movie which had me occasionally on the edge of my seat but never struggling to follow the plot. I've been a Sci Fi fan since I was 14 and first discovered Asimov but I've often felt that when Sci Fi is transferred to the big screen, the effects are allowed to overshadow the human interest. Without characters you care about, a Sci Fi movie can just become an exercise in gadgetry and computer graphics, with about as much interest for me as a video game. This movie avoids that. The special effects are good and often scary, but they never overwhelm the central character or the writing.<br/><br/>The last few minutes nearly let it down however. The sudden appearance of God in the equation really jars, and the heavy handed symbolism of the church appearing in the closing shots made me sigh. Man created this mess. Why not let man sort it out?

","(Karthik Narayan)<br/><br/>One man against an army of zombies on a deserted New York city (What am I saying! Which part of ""deserted"" did you not understand?)  That is the storyline of this movie which shows mankind in its last stages. <br/><br/>Based on the book by Richard Matheson, this movie brings us Will Smith as Col/ Dr. Neville, the last man standing (if you don't consider the zombies) and Samantha, his loving dear dog. (For dog lovers like me, this movie was great as Samantha appeared in a lot of frames). <br/><br/>For action lovers, this isn't quite the movie; the first half of the movie is a crawl, but with great acting by Smith. It's never easy playing a lonely man in the middle of a big city  you do get the hallucinations, the delirium  Smith plays that with the finest of ease  his facial expressions tell you that this seasoned actor has come a long way since his days as the Prince of Bel Air. Apart from Smith and the dog, there isn't much at all in the first half (literally)  unless you consider his talking to mannequins in the DVD rental store. <br/><br/>But once the zombies smell human blood, the action begins. In the movie theatre we were all actually rooting for the zombies because they brought in all the action to an otherwise silent movie. <br/><br/>The second half promised a lot and I should say, it was more of a comedy movie in the first half and a horror movie partly in the remaining part. Smith found out he wasn't the only human being left on earth, he found the cure for cancer, but didn't live long enough to collect his first Nobel (No chances for Oscar either), the humans managed to survive and beat the virus with his miracle and life moved on after his legend. <br/><br/>Overall, a good movie to watch  if you want to test your patience for at least 40 minutes, then test your adrenaline with 50 minutes of zombies, gory blood and good music. One of the good sci-fi movies I have seen this year (if this wasn't the only movie, that is) <br/><br/>The graphics were spectacular  just imagining NYC to be vacant, cars smashed, deserted with cobwebs lying around the big skyscrapers  simply mind-boggling. Out of this world, really! Sony Pictures, take a bow. And Brooklyn Bridge was a sight to see, really. Worth watching, for each of the $5 million spent to film that scene. <br/><br/>For pure cinema and great graphics, I rate this movie a 7/10."

","Will Smith simply cannot make a bad movie. No matter how crappy the script could be, he would make it a blockbuster because he has the appeal. I bought the book a couple of days after I saw the movie, not intentionally. I wanted to read it first before seeing it, but from what I've read so far to the movie is a big difference. 2007's release is more present, the Robert Neville character is quite ""Will Smith"", and there's no dog. I thought the dog was in the book, and for the movie it made a great touch. He let him have interaction, it really felt like a person.<br/><br/>This takes in 2012, Neville and his dog are last survivors of a virus attack that spread all over the world. Everyday he does his routine, tries to help the infected because he is a scientist, tries to hunt, sits at the park waiting on any survivors, and at night keeping himself and his dog safe from infected vampire-zombies. This film is very well made, it progresses wonderfully and it seems so realistic at times until you see more of the zombies because you can tell they're CGI. Definitely a money maker without having my opinion. Go see it."

","This is not my usual genre; had it been a choice on HBO I would probably have passed it up. But this was my first IMAX experience, and you just can't help but be drawn into a film with a great actor whose emotions measure 25 feet on the screen. Smith's acting is brilliant, a heartbreaking interpretation of solitude and menace, his beloved (and beautiful) dog his only light in a nightmare. The flashbacks which outline the events leading up to this condition are lean and well-placed. However, I felt an extreme lack of balance once the woman and her son were introduced. After Smith spent most of the film drawing us into his lonely world, there is a surprising lack of character development in the two survivors he finally finds. The viewer is champing at the bit for their story but all we get is a quick narrative from the mother and nothing at all from her son as far as his perspective when suddenly we are mid mega-crisis and on our way onto the end of the movie. It was the IMAX that did it for me, and the eerie set."

One of many examples would be the ending, - I will not be including any spoilers - which is drastically different to the point where they feel like two different stories. <br/><br/>Another deviation is Neville's dog ""Sam"" who although an endearing character and one you will find yourself getting attached to, was not included in the book. <br/><br/>The dependency on CGI made the film look a little bit too much like iRobot to me and completely shattered my expectation of the film. <br/><br/>The inclusion of the dog was a bad choice in my opinion as one of the main focuses within the book was Neville's painful solace and seclusion from society, which swiftly drives him mad. Although they capture this to some extent, the arrival of other characters and the presence of the dog leaves this feeling a little marred. <br/><br/>Those who have read the book will notice characters from the book performing actions that simply are not there. This makes it very confusing for someone who has read the book and is expecting one ending, to then see another ending using the same characters in completely different ways. <br/><br/>With all that said, it's still a highly entertaining film, and Will Smith does a very convincing and moving performance as Neville. It's very feel good at the end, and that's my problem! I am Legend was never meant to be feel good, it was meant to be tragic, a struggle, and one we have to watch the hero lose. The film, although extremely entertaining and a good rendition of action/sci-fi horror, is still in no way true to the book.<br/><br/>Great fun to watch, but not what I was expecting."
"stefevr","7","0","2","30 December 2007"," A great film
","When i first went to see this movie, I expected it to be more based on the fact that he was alone, but it turned out to be more of a zombie/ suspenseful film. It was still great, but people who hate stressful films that make you jump ( 4 times for me )shouldn't see this film. Will Smith's acting was incredible, as always, really showing his emotions. New York really looked strange, in a good way. It really looked like no one has been there for years. But the bad points of this film was the ending (which I will not spoil), because it just didn't really fit the whole story, but it's not really important. I really enjoyed this film, even if it wasn't what I expected. I'd recommend it to people who enjoyed ""28 days later""."
"Neenee-b","7","0","1","30 December 2007"," A Legend In The Making?
","I had been looking forward to this movie since the trailer and the more I heard about it the more I wanted to see it.<br/><br/>The movie starts of with Robert Neville (Will Smith) hunting dear in a deserted, desolate New York (a sight that is always unnerving to see). It was a fantastic opening to the movie as we get to see New York, the city that doesn't sleep, in such a scary state and from thereon we learn that Emma Thompson found a cure for cancer some years earlier which caused the outbreak of a deadly disease almost wiping out mankind - with the exception of Will Smith.<br/><br/>There are few actors who can literally carry a film on their own so whether you like or loath him you have to admit that Will Smith is one of those actors who can achieve this (can you imagine if Tom Cruise played Robert Neville??) <br/><br/>There are some very tense scenes such as when Sam runs into the building and one very sad death scene which will take you by surprise about how much you care for this little character but overall the anticipation and build up was all for nothing when you actually get to see the ""vampires"".<br/><br/>They all looked like Imhotep from The Mummy Returns before he became fully human. It is a fine example of CGI ruining a film - I honestly think that if the ""vampires"" were played by real people they would have been scarier and much more believable.<br/><br/>There were a few parts of the film that really annoyed me - Will Smith must have it written into his contract that he must have the coolest car known to man in all of his movies. Driving full throttle down deserted New York in a Ford GT looked cool but completely out of place. <br/><br/>Why did Anna and Ethan swing by New York on their way to Vermont? I'm not a geography expert but did they swim across the river to New York on the way? <br/><br/>Neville claimed that the ""Vampires"" had now lost all recognisable signs of human behaviour yet they were clearly following a leader (Imhotep), and were capable of mimicking Neville's own trap and capturing him. I actually thought at one stage that the leader was P'd of that Neville was testing the cure out on his girlfriend and had come to rescue her! <br/><br/>Overall though it was an entertaining film and I would give it a 7/10. I loses a point for being a remake, a point of the Ford GT in New York and a point for the disappointing look of the ""vampires"".<br/><br/>Go and see the movie and allow yourself to get caught up in it but if you are like me you will spend the whole movie waiting for one of those mannequins to move their heads - now that would make for a scary film!"
"seawalker","7","0","2","30 December 2007"," Two thirds of it are absolutely brilliant
","It's quite interesting how the UK reviews of ""I Am Legend"" have panned out. The general gist seems to be that most reviewers really liked the first two thirds, but felt that all of the good work was undone by a rushed and unbalanced final third. Broadly I think I would agree with that. The first two thirds of ""I Am Legend"" are absolute genius, not only because of the brilliant realisation of an abandoned and devastatingly empty New York City, but because of a truly fine performance by Will Smith as Robert Neville.<br/><br/>3 years after a man made disease devastated the human race, Robert Neville is the last man left alive in New York City. He is haunted by dreams of his family, the way the crisis escalated out of control and the responsibility to find a 'fix'. Neville's isolation, depression and slowly building psychosis are a real thing. When night comes, Neville hides away. There is terror and there is dread, because there are things in the dark...<br/><br/>""I Am Legend"" is a mostly great film, with a consistently great performance by Will Smith. Head and shoulders above what is the norm for a Christmas blockbuster. It is true that the ending dips into pretty predictable, CGI heavy, action heroics, but if you like that kind of thing, you will enjoy it. I just think that the ending somewhat dissipated the paranoid atmosphere built up earlier in the film. I think that the film deserved a better ending. The ending of the book would have been good. A new world born from the old.<br/><br/>Who am I kidding? No Hollywood studio would have gone for that ending. Way too bleak."

"Jane-Smith5995","7","0","1","29 December 2007"," Expecting more out of the film
","I just came back from watching I Am Legend and overall I thought it was all right, decent, not a terrible movie. However I felt that many scenes dragged on and didn't seem to get to the point. By the time the credits started rolling, I just had the feeling of empitness of the story. I just felt that they could have added more story to it, maybe develop will smith's character more. My recommendation is to wait to rent the movie. I think its a waste to see it in theaters, especially since now the prices to see movies have gotten expensive. On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be many other good movies out so i guess seeing this one would not be so bad"
"rabrenner","7","0","1","29 December 2007"," Good, But CHILDREN OF MEN Was Better
","Third and best adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic science fiction novel. Special kudos to Will Smith, who manages to hold the screen with nothing more to interact with than a German Shepherd. Unfortunately, the ending is marred by pseudo-philosophical babble about God and Bob Marley (!), not to mention a lengthy plug for SHREK. (Do Will Smith and Eddie Murphy run in the same posse?) They should have stuck with the original ending from the novel: the vampires form their own society, and Will Smith's character realizes that now HE is the monster (hence the title). Last year's under-appreciated CHILDREN OF MEN did a much better job of balancing hope and despair, without tipping over into sentimentality."
"freaky_dave","7","0","2","29 December 2007"," Strong film that falls a little short near the end
","I Am Legend, based on the Richard Matheson novelette of the same name, is quite good. I loved the pacing and never felt bored with the film even though almost the entire film focuses on just one character and his dog. It falls a little short at the end, but is still a worthwhile experience.<br/><br/>In a world where most of humanity has been transformed into zombies or killed off by a man made plaque that was suppose to cure cancer, one man, the lone survivor of New York City, struggles to find a cure and somehow save humanity. His name is Robert Neville, and as played by Will Smith, he gives the character depth. That is something that not all actors can do, and with a film which follows just one character and his dog for about ninety percent of the film's length, I'd have to say Will Smith does a splendid job. We sense his fear, his anger, and his struggles with loneliness since his only companion is an animal that is unable to carry on a conversation.<br/><br/>There were some things in the film which made me feel a little leery. One would have to be Neville's confrontations with mannequins. I'm not sure what would happen in real life if someone was left alone for such a long time, but would they actually do what Neville does? And I'm not talking sexual either. If anybody saw Castaway with Tom Hanks which involved a soccer ball, you might know what I mean. Tom Hanks had a character that was alone for a long period as well, but he made it feel a little more convincing then Will Smith does. With Smith, it just felt a little awkward, with Tom Hanks it was a little more natural I guess.<br/><br/>Now onto the CGI and the sets and special effects. The director Francis Lawrence did great things with all the New York scenes. New York felt quite desolate, and it had to be hard to get and effect like that in the city that never sleeps. It makes you wonder how long it took to get those scenes to work so well. The creature effects were okay but could've been better, and it was the CGI that weakened the last third or so of the movie. A creature here and there was okay, but then you have a bunch all at once and it was just not as effective.<br/><br/>The finale was different from the novel, but it still left and impression after it was over. It gave us more hope for humankind. Overall I liked the movie and would recommend it to anybody who's a fan of such movies."
"sugar_daddyo","7","0","2","29 December 2007"," Poses some interesting questions, but does little to answer them
","From the opening scene with Emma Thompson (uncredited), the intelligent moviegoer knows what's next. What's not to so obvious is why Will Smith is the last one on Manhattan island. Manhattan is a crown jewel and to think that all the uninfected/immune people would simply flee the island as fast as their feet would take them versus introducing the subhuman infected to Smith & Wesson is not clear. Now granted, just Will Smith versus all those humanoids is a losing prospect from the beginning. But given a small, immune, heavily armed contingent with floodlights, I am sure Manhattan would be infection free in a matter of weeks, not years.<br/><br/>Now 1.5 million people live on Manhattan. If 90% are killed by the virus that leaves 150,000. Supposedly 90% of those not killed become infected. That leaves 15,000 immune versus 135,000 ravenous, belligerent infected. Now you may think the odds are overwhelming, but if you study the Spanish conquest of the Mayan civilization you will understand why gunpowder was invented and why numbers are irrelevant when your foe is unarmed.<br/><br/>Now granted, I Am Legend is not about how Will Smith ended up all alone three years after the outbreak, but one does wonder how he managed to survive all those years on his own. The movie does posit the potential of the infected somehow becoming smart, devious, cunning or what have you, as is the question of isolation a la Castaway. But while interesting, they are subplots to the larger theme of Will's quest for a anti-virus.<br/><br/>Now I am not going to criticize the Will Smith's of the world who rather find a cure versus kill 'em all. But my gut tells me that if such a scenario ever truly played out, the real conflict would be in the politics of those who wanted to extend compassion versus those who had another agenda and I doubt that they would wait for an election."

"phillipps79","Null","0","2","29 December 2007"," Too scary for me
","There's one thing that must be perfectly clear: if you need more scares than this movie contains, it can't be had within the walls of a movie theater. This film takes a familiar zombie movie subject matter and rehashes it into something much more frightening. A virus of unimaginable potency turns virtually everyone in the world into a flesh-eating, inhuman, sickly, rabid animal. Psychological horror is the game here; Will Smith convinces you of his solitude and of his nightmarish everyday realities. Alone in a deserted New York City, Smith must survive in his barricaded apartment long enough to try to find the cure for the supervirus which has already taken away everything and everyone he loved. This movie proves that presentation is ten times more important than subject matter. Flashbacks to the virus outbreak give everything in the film a tragic undertone. As Smith loses his family and his sanity and eventually his life, you go with him every step of the way. Zombies have never ever been scarier, and nobody has ever taken you on a journey this frightening."
"silent_phantasm","8","0","5","28 December 2007"," An ""I Am Legend..."" Not THE ""I Am Legend""
","I finished watching this movie at about midnight and was neither pleasantly surprised or disappointed. My overall verdict on the movie: 8/10.<br/><br/>From the get-go, the viewer has to get past the stigma of the ""I Am Legend"" novel written by Robert Matheson back in the 1950s. While the movie borrows on the apocalyptic idea, the movie was not created to be a recreation of the original novel. Once that is understood and accepted, then the movie can be enjoyed.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie was unveiled in a very choppy fashion; as if the movie was pushed to the market before all of the movie elements were completed. While the back-story is touched upon briefly, I would have liked to see how things developed to where they developed and why it is Smith's character came to be alone. Naturally, I expected the plot to disclose why Smith's character kept exclaiming, ""Nothing went as planned."" It didn't. Honestly, it didn't quite matter. Everything else was relatively believable.<br/><br/>I have heard the ending was terrible; to me it's interpretation. I feel the ending was made that way to encompass a key theme of the movie, light in the dark.<br/><br/>The acting, the cinematography, the lighting and the portrayal of all characters made the movie entertaining and enjoyable. I rated the movie with 8 stars and not 10 for multiple reasons, but two primary reasons follow: For the non-human characters, there was too much personification. Albeit entertaining, but seemingly unnecessary. I guess that was the only way to wrap up the movie.<br/><br/>About the dog's death, it seemed that idea was forcibly written as if the writers said, ""Oh, we have to have the dog die, we just have to. Let's see if anybody can come up with a good enough reason that the public can bite into. You, intern? Give me an idea."" You can tell I was unhappy with that bit.<br/><br/>Overall, I hope you enjoy it for its interpreted (perhaps intended) purpose. Thanks for reading!"
"Pavel-8","7","0","1","28 December 2007"," You are not alone.
","""I Am Legend"" debuted with a monstrous $77 million weekend, but is an atypical Will Smith blockbuster, largely bereft of the slam-bang action and/or comedy common to his big movies like ""Men in Black"" or ""Enemy of the State"".<br/><br/>As learned from the tagline and excellent first trailer, the premise is simple: Smith is Dr. Robert Neville, the last man left in a desolate New York City, but he is not alone. Someone or something lingers, a mystery that drives the first hour, which is absolutely fantastic. With the exception of a few flashbacks that gradually answer the hows and whys generated by the plot progression, Smith interacts with no one except Sam, his loyal German Shepherd.<br/><br/>In this regard, ""I Am Legend"" is a cousin to the amazing ""Cast Away"". While their respective tones are drastically different, both are set on islands void of humanity. Instead of a volleyball, Smith anthropormorphizes a dog. Hanks wrestled with inner demons on his deserted island, Smith confronts outer demons of some sort. The difference in supplies is noteworthy, and the two main characters are driven by widely disparate motivations, but the isolated survival instinct is similar, and watching Smith stretch himself as an actor is extremely enjoyable. Smith's character still possesses elements of the cocky, wise-cracking nature that moviegoers know well, but with merely a glance or a twitch, his confident veneer often cracks to reveal the effects of his time spent alone. Seeing that uncharacteristic vulnerability is initially disorienting, because we're not used to seeing a hero crack like this, but the awkwardness soon yields to awe at the powerhouse solo performance.<br/><br/>Aside from Smith's turn, the highlights of the movie are the breathtaking shots of a desolate New York City. We've seen the empty streets of a booming metropolis before, in movies like ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""28 Days Later"", but this is different. Not only is everything deserted, but also overgrown and eroded by nature and time. The minimal music and slow-moving cameras allow for an eerie and appropriate quiet within the movie, creating a game of I Spy in which one's eyes dart about, searching for familiar landmarks like Jumbotrons or Broadway signs.<br/><br/>The only downside to all this quality is that it doesn't last throughout the entire movie. Without giving too much away, I can say that following a key plot development, the third and final act transforms into a more familiar, action-type of movie, leading to a finale that satisfies, but doesn't quite match the preceding hour-plus. This dissonance is very reminiscent of 2004's ""Collateral"", which similarly enthralled throughout before wimping out at the end, like a color scheme that matches at first glance but clashes upon closer inspection.<br/><br/>If you know what you are in for, you will enjoy the movie more thoroughly. ""I Am Legend"" is much more ""Cast Away"" than ""Independence Day"", more ""Signs"" than ""Bad Boys"". In his best performance yet, Will Smith proves that he has the acting chops to match his pretty face and ripped physique, deepening his own cinematic legend as he frequently carries this movie to great heights.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Two-thirds of a great movie plus one-third of an average movie equals a good movie. 7 of 10."

","Francis Lawrence's second movie feature, his first major being the excellent supernatural Constantine (2005), is the contemporary version of the Richard Matheson 1956 sci-fi book ""I am Legend"". Eight years later it was the great Vincent Price that stared in the Ubaldo Ragona movie of The Last Man on Earth (1964), then came The Omega Man (1971) with Charlton Heston, it is this 1971 movie that has deeper aspects of the way in which the Human Race see's itself as demigods and megalomaniacs' that pay the price of their vanity. It is here, in the 2007 version that we see a cure for cancer that sadly alters the DNA and within three years of the first cured, the human race has been wiped-out by what seems a reversal of a cure and mutating into a rabies like virus, turning the unlucky carriers into flesh eating tribes of the night. <br/><br/>We also see the virologist Robert Neville painfully adjusting to his isolation and with this his struggle to remain sane, we see no ringing of phones here, but his possible belief that there must be, and there has to be, someone somewhere, and if there were to be, then there must be some hope, but it is his reality that overcomes this delusion of faith and it is this reality that is slowly eroding his sanity, when all he has for company are the mannequins that act as constant reminder of a past life and his trusty German Sheppard, Sam. This this done in a moderate and with at least two single shots of delicate style, Francis Lawrence has our loner more action hero, with guns-a-blazing, than deep thinker of philosophical prowess. We know his plight and see his plight, but there is no need to delve into the abyss of understanding, this is a mistake of gigantic human proportions, we see that with all good intentions something went amiss. There are no wider consequence to articulate, and with this single vision in mind, it does not. But no matter what his forte, he is still very much aware of his alienation, his freedom of daylight in a world where he is trapped in the night. This is adequately done, but again, not too deep and focused on the plight of his destiny, just everyday survival and the monotony of existence that brings home his frustrations and desolation. <br/><br/>The sets are grand and the torn and neglected city of New York is the colossus in which our tiny and insignificant hero must reside, waiting for the day that his voice will one day be heard, waiting for that one day of hope of the human spirit to be reunited once more, and that he too shall find the cure to save his race, his mutated race, his nemesis; the dark-seekers. To once again atone for mans misadventure.<br/><br/>All well and good I hear you cry, but, this is now where I Am Legend stagnates into weak over indulgence that has our saviour fighting shadows of CGI imagery, the irony here is so transparent. We have the good Robert Neville supposedly the last man on earth, the Omega man, fighting his soulless, mindless enemies' , who, by a technicality, are not there in the physical being, but are computer generated foes that come to haunt him in his every waking hour. This is really a poor show, to being the, literally, only human on screen when he fights for his life with these mutants is this movies weakest link. It's too obvious, it's too tasteless, it's too inconsistent, it's too easy, it's CGI. <br/><br/>We have, once more, the grandiose actor Will Smith chosen as the leading man, and we have to admire his ability to transcend movie legend status. For his achievement and contribution to the Blockbuster genre is duly noted, but, I feel that it shall be the movie here and not his repertoire that shall make I Am Legend what it is; a simple thriller, weakly disguised as a sci-fi disaster movie of everyday survival, albeit in the empty streets of New York, that holds a sub-plot of human extinction. <br/><br/>For a more intriguing look into this concept there is the more enlightening Russian born Boris Sagal's (1917 - 1981) interpretation of Richard Matheson's cult classic novel; The Omega Man. A darker and socially conscience take on the demise of the human race and its trappings. If you like it big, bold and beautiful then it is the 2007 version that just might be what you're looking for. The choice is yours."

","I just saw this movie and not like it at all. I am still thinking that I spent my 1,5 hours for nothing. The movie is just a suspense movie without much of a story, not much detail about the characters, well nothing actually. Will Smith though is an actor, i like very much, is playing on his own the whole movie. If he wanted to make something on his own, he should have done a stand-up. Its similar to the ""shoot'em up"" and the ""children of men"". Really a shame for Will Smith. He is acting good and that is the only good thing.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry Will but we should be fair to your previous movies, especially the "" I, Robot"" Guys, please, when do you think its enough for NOT making any more virus related, Resident Evil type movies? I mean, cant you find any other subject? To tell you the truth, the subject already is not a good one. 2 movies are enough only if you make them both good and ""Resident Evil"" with ""28 days later"" are already done OR were you locked down to a safe house while these got out?"

","i think this movie could have had more content as one other member said in their comment. It left out many things that could have made the movie great. first off it did not explain where the cancer cure turned into a virus and i don't like how they explained the spread. It also would have been nice for them to have explained the cure in the end. Yes the cure is in his blood but it couldn't have been that simple for the great Dr. Neville not to have found. I thought he was testing his blood the entire movie and then at the end he just takes a vile of his regular old blood and says it is the cure. Also the stronghold at the end in Vermont or wherever didn't make much sense because the vampire creatures can climb walls and the wall at the safe place wasn't very large. Overall still very entertaining but missing many things that could have risen it to greatness."
