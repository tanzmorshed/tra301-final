","I hated this movie almost as soon as it started. Everything was just off. It tried way too hard to be funny forcing Rebel Wilson to have to act extra weird and quirky as opposed to just naturally weird and quirky. Becca's working at a lame recording studio while trying to tell the Bellas she's going to quit. There's like two or three new girls that I can't remember because they're not memorable.<br/><br/>Then they go on this lame camping expedition where Audrey now works having graduated. The group of German singers they're going up against really suck and wouldn't even be hard to beat except that the Bellas suck too. Their end performance was crap especially compared to the first movie. Pitch Perfect was hilarious, charming, original, and had great performances. Pitch Perfect 2 was strained and pointless."
"cikamikiriki","10","117","203","29 May 2015"," I loved all of these women.
","Pitch perfect 2 is a hilarious comedy and musical movie with lovely women.amazing music and fantastic acting. <br/><br/>It's been three years since the Barden Bellas (Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson) became the first all-female group to win a national title. All seems well until a botched Lincoln Center performance for the president leads to a scandal that strips them of their performing duties, causing internal tension and strife. With the world championships on the horizon in Copenhagen, Denmark, the women must get their act together for their one and only shot at redemption.<br/><br/>Lesbians and feminists must see this excellent movie."

","Pitch Perfect 2 is a 2015 American musical comedy film directed by Elizabeth Banks and written by Kay Cannon. It is a sequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect, which was loosely adapted from Mickey Rapkin's non- fiction book, titled Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory. The film centers on the fictional Barden University and The Bellas, an-all female a capella singing group. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, and Alexis Knapp. It was released on May 15, 2015 by Universal Pictures.<br/><br/>Plot Of The Movie: Following an incident involving Fat Amy having a wardrobe malfunction at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Barden Bellas are suspended from the circuit of a capella performing. In order to regain their status, the Bellas enter the international competitionâ€”a colossal task since no American team has ever won.<br/><br/>I loved these sexy women and this perfect number 1 movie."
"Chris0184","8","26","41","9 September 2015"," Misunderstood and actually brilliant!
","Let me lay my cards out there straightaway. I'm a 31 year old bloke, married with two kids, who loves films and music.<br/><br/>And I love this film.<br/><br/>I Ioved the first film, and this one builds on it. But you have to appreciate that the film is based around college. For anyone that's actually been to college they should have experienced parties/people/incidents replicated in this film. I don't really understand why people show so much disdain for the 'childish' humour!<br/><br/>That aside...<br/><br/>Hats off to Elizabeth Banks for her directorial debut, you'd never know there was any change from the first film. And her inserts with John Michael Higgins are excellent, if you take them at face value for exactly what they are intended to be; humour! And pretty sexist, misogynistic humour!<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is, as always, stunning (yes, the wife knows!) and simply brilliant. Shows just how much of an actress she is having improvised almost half her lines and proves once again that she can actually sing (albeit that the singing is not on set and pre-recorded).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is brilliant and it's nice to see a little more of Esther Dean actually singing/rapping rather than her usual producing.<br/><br/>Hailee Steinfeld has stepped in seamlessly. I don't think we saw enough of Rebel Wilson though, reckon there'll be a few deleted scenes that didn't make it.<br/><br/>Good to see a lot of humour applied to the Ashley/Jessica situation (unless you know the film you won't get this).<br/><br/>The final song was actually very good. Maybe not as unexpected as the first film but brilliant with an original start and an excellent surprise at the end that I think added a very personal and moving touch.<br/><br/>It will be a shame if the franchise is over!"
"abouhelier-r","10","88","159","10 May 2015"," Pitch Perfect 2
","After a humiliating command performance at Lincoln Center, the Barden Bellas enter an international competition that no American group has ever won in order to regain their status and right to perform.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect comes back with a sequel, directed by Elizabeth Banks. Everyone is familiar with these characters by now and we all wanted to see what could happen to them after the first movie. So the good things in this acapella world aside, now we are witnessing those characters growing older and becoming real people. This film allows us to spend more time on characters that people love, to tell more of their stories and to see where these women be at three years later. While in the first one it was more about coming together, bonding and being freshmen; this film mainly deals with the notion of graduation as their in majority in their last year of college, companionship they have in college that will last forever as Bellas will always be Bellas, moving on, breaking apart, leaving the nest, staring life right in the face and going their separate ways. However they find themselves right back where they started: as underdogs of acapella. There are a lot going on this time, plot- and character -wise. Some endearing elements were taken back from the first film such as the romance between Beca and Jesse, that keep all the component in harmony as they are settled characters. Indeed they are a nice balance to the melodramatic aspect of the movie, grounded to the real stakes of this world. Yet once again Fat Amy, starring Rebel Wilson, is very charismatic. She embodies a confident woman that never thinks about her size at all. Proving that your body type doesn't determine your fate in life. Giving her a real love story with Bumper is such a good idea as she really deserves it and both actors have a great chemistry together. John Michael Higgins' character smoothly delivers his misogynic lines such as ""Let's hear it from the girls too ugly to be cheerleaders!"", and casual racism throughout the movie is even funnier this time around!<br/><br/>Moreover, new girls fit right into the dynamic of the group. They're all the same characters but pushed a little bit further, they're a little bit bigger, crazier and global. Hailee Steinfeld's character represents what Pitch Perfect has become which is that kind of bonding enthusiasm and likability. People will identify with the movie for different reasons but ultimately for the joy and happiness it spreads. Obviously men are not the targeted demographic of this movie - or basically people who don't watch Glee. Nonetheless, if you just enjoy music this film will get points with you. Musically, the songbook is far hipper with a younger song selection. Executive music producers J.Jordan and J.Michels have ensured that every performances are note-perfect and soundtrack album ready; which I have to admit rather detracts any sense of realism: it's not humanly possible to sing so in-sync spontaneously. Plus, jokes are all amazing, not one falls flat. You clearly know where the movie goes from the beginning but this film is not here for an Oscar, it's just here to be fun and show some good acapella. Finally, Banks has crafted a sequel that's edgier, sexier and best of all more female centered than the first one. Showing that women can be as funny as men, even funnier. So get over it, picthes! <br/><br/>Overall Pitch Perfect 2 proved once again that acapella is not lame at all, with a nerdy and inspirational movie and with much more sophisticated layered music."
"alfiecase","7","35","58","16 May 2015"," Brilliant! Better than the Original
","I have ticked spoilers in case I accidentally include any. Overall, this film was amazing and in my opinion is worth seeing. There are plenty of jokes for all ages to get and laugh at. Some are a bit racist but nothing worse than you hear daily. <br/><br/>Rebel Wilson shines throughout the film with her cleverly done lines and jokes that are memorable and hilarious. Elizabeth Banks did an amazing job is directing this whole film and I hope in the future, she does more films that are just as good.<br/><br/>The songs that are sung are popular songs so you will recognise all of them and if your not tempted, you will probably sing along with them as well as the rest of the people that you are viewing it with.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is great and is worth more than 10 but sadly it stops there."
"peterchapman-76310","9","22","35","30 July 2015"," Funny perfect follow up to the original
","Pitch Perfect 2 is just as much fun as the first one. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks for her first directing role. This time our favourite Capella band are performing in front of the president and his wife. A wardrobe malfunction see's them banned from competing in the US there only hope a competition taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark.<br/><br/>What can I say about this film? I thought it was just as much fun as the original, the story plays out at just the right pace, all our favourite characters return for another outing, including Elizabeth Banks herself as the TV Presenter Gail.<br/><br/>If you liked the first film you will like this one also."
"jtindahouse","9","16","25","9 January 2016"," Keeps all the charm and fun of the original
","'Pitch Perfect' was a bit of a sleeper hit. I hadn't even heard of it when two people I knew told me it was their new favourite film in quick succession. It didn't sound like my kind of a movie but I thought I'd give it a go nevertheless. To my surprise I found myself really enjoying it and so was quite pleased to see they were making a sequel. Sequels are notorious for losing the magic of the original, particularly comedies which seem on a hiding to nothing most of the time. However, I found myself enjoying this one just as much as I had the original. <br/><br/>Nearly the full cast had returned (always a good sign) and there were a few adjustments to the amount of lines particular characters were getting, determined by how popular they were in the first. The character 'Fat Amy' who was a real fan-favourite in the original had a very noticeable increase in lines. Elizabeth Banks took over the directing role for this one, in her first full feature film at the helm. I think she did a pretty good job for the most part. One thing I'd suggest she got wrong though was the final performance by the 'Bellas'. It simply wasn't good enough to justify winning the World Championship. In fact one of the few other performances we actually see in full by 'Das Sound Machine' was noticeably better. We were supposed to be swayed by the crowd simply cheering louder for the 'Bellas' but that wasn't fooling any intelligent audience member.<br/><br/>This was one of the only real flaws though. Most of the jokes landed very well, the singing performances were very entertaining and the choice of songs throughout was spot-on and really got the audience into a jovial mood. There's also a charm about these movies that can be rare to come across these days. I really like this series and eagerly look forward to the third installment."
"carol-pr-41985","10","26","45","30 May 2015"," Excellent sequel with a touching message
","Summary: Bellas Barden made an huge opening mistake that cost them their reputation as professional Capella group. In order to regain their status as a group and friend they need to win World Championship of Acapella.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I loved 100% this sequel due the excellent choices of songs, hilarious scenes, goosebumps reaction of the final performance that actually made me cried because I felt what they felt of the fear of the tomorrow after graduation. Loved the voice of Emily Junk wow speechless. The song Flashlight wow, i cried a lot, beautiful cover song by Anna Kendrick. For me, I believe they need to leave this sequel as the final closure of Pitch Pecfect. I recommend it without a 2nd thought."
"thealphakeno","10","31","55","20 May 2015"," Pure Perfection
","Pitch Perfect 2 was a pure perfection that will entertain you til the end of the film. I rate it 10/10 for its funny humour and jokes. I laugh at the jokes and didn't find it boring. It has full of life and it gives a new texture to a musical film. Like High School Musical meets Step Up movie. The mix of music and conversation was just equal and there are no dead scenes at all. They blow us away with their opening performance and the final performance exceed to the top. <br/><br/>I enjoy this than the first one. It's funnier and the flow of the story is not only focus on Becca but also to the whole group. Rebel Wilson was the saviour of the movie. She acts as the clown and portrays her funny awkward character well. I enjoyed her with the new girl Flo, who will make you laugh with their punch lines."
"miscalainaeous","8","45","84","6 May 2015"," A-ca-believe they did it again.
","The original Pitch Perfect was like a unicorn. A fall release with a target audience of Gleeks. It didn't seem to have the legs to get anywhere, but those who saw it understood and spread the word. No one believed in it, yet it became an instant classic. I saw Pitch Perfect no less than 5 times in theaters (but I did work in a movie theater, so I did not pay 5 times to see it). I fell in love with the movie, and so did everyone I dragged along with me to see it.<br/><br/>And now we are in the day and age where any slightly successful movie gets more money thrown at it to make a slightly less entertaining sequel (that was never in the cards to begin with). When the sequel to Pitch Perfect 2 was announced, I was on the fence. PP was wrapped up in a neat tiny little box, and it didn't need anything else to come along and ruin it.<br/><br/>Then it got worse. They announced at some point that the Green Bay Packers were going to be in it. I went on a tirade. OK, maybe I wasn't throwing things and kicking puppies, but I was very vocal online and to my family about how they ruined any potential this movie had by putting the worst football team in the history of the world in this movie, with Clay Matthews being at the forefront of the group. (I tell everyone who will listen that if I had $10,000, I would pay someone much stronger than me to punch him in the face, while I sneak behind him and cut off his hair). <br/><br/>So all of my excitement for this sequel went from a somewhat decent flame to a dying ember. The movie was coming out during a summer of blockbusters that had me so excited I felt like I could vomit (seriously, before Avengers: Age of Ultron started I thought I could vomit while sitting there waiting for trailers to start because I was so excited). <br/><br/>But PP2 stayed on my mind, and last week I got the opportunity to sign up for a advance screening, and last night I got into that advance screening. Outside the theater they were giving away PP2 branded cups (ha) if you took a selfie with the poster and shared it. So obviously I did that. (cut to the next time someone is in my apartment, sees that cup, and i immediately start my horrible rendition of cups). PP2 has the same formula as the first one. This time the Bellas are a bit more successful, but they hit a snag at the beginning and have to rebuild their team. Beca is the leader of the group, but she is also worried about her future (cue future distance and drama in the group). The Bellas can't audition new members (and with their current ban from Collegiate Acapella), the group filled with graduating seniors (and super, super, super seniors) looks doomed. <br/><br/>The movie gets off to a slow start plot-wise. But that doesn't stop the jokes from coming hard and fast. I found myself laughing at almost every line in the movie. There isn't a single one that doesn't have a little hint of a zinger. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Bank's full-length film directorial debut proves that she knows comedy (as if we didn't already know that) and that the cast knows how to deliver that comedy. We have all of our favorites back and each story line does not disappoint. The few new additions are pretty great too. <br/><br/>Hailee Steinfeld as Bella legacy Emily proves that if they want to continue the franchise, they have some pretty good fresh meat in her. <br/><br/>And much like the first movie, the best lines and overall awesomeness comes from Rebel Wilson as the aca-amazing Fat Amy. She does not disappoint, and though some people may feel that Rebel plays the same character in everything she does, I really don't care because she makes me laugh. Every. Damn. Time. <br/><br/>This movie is full of surprises. And the damn Green Bay Packers made me laugh harder than I thought possible (but for good measure, in-between each laugh I did say 'F*** you, Clay Matthews). Also to note, I live in Chicago, saw the screening in Chicago, and I was not the only person who booed when the Packers were introduced.<br/><br/>I feel like if I were to go into anymore detail, I would spoil some of the best bits of the movie for you, so let me sum it up in this final little bit: PP2 is a good time. You need to be a fan of the first one, don't go in thinking that maybe you will like this even if you didn't like PP. You are wrong, you will hate it. But those of you that love or even mildly liked the first one will get a kick out of this. I laughed so hard at one point (that involved Fat Amy and Bumper (Adam Devine)) that I was unable to breath. It was brilliant.<br/><br/>Better than the original? Debatable. Worth seeing in theaters? 100% yes."
"oscaralbert","10","37","68","1 June 2015"," ""Your sweat smells like cinnamon . . . ""
",". . . may be stereotypical L Words, but PITCH PERFECT 2 tops its predecessor as the most harmonious A Cappella flick ever. The Germans shape up so well in the early going that their eventual showdown with the Barden Belles seems sure to be a David versus Goliath affair, fought entirely on a totally sandy shore this time. Put another way, it's the Nazi Blitzkrieg against France. At my showing, film goers were on the edge of their seats, fearing that the Na--oops, that the Germans would win, or, worse, that the Belles would be called the winners on some sort of technicality, when they had been clearly out-classed. However, due to clever writing and innovative thinking, this sequel produces a crowd-pleasing climax that seems not only plausible but well-earned. Though the life of these Belles beyond their competitions still seems a little too pat and Tinsel Townish, their Hollywood ending on the World Stage is 100% satisfying."
"Ramascreen","9","31","56","14 May 2015"," They're back, Pitches! And they're still awesome!!!
","They're back, pitches! The Barden Bellas, the Treblemakers, even that Cups song is back, if you're a huge fan of the first film, like I am, then you're going to have a blast with PITCH PERFECT 2, because it's just as fun, just as exciting, just as hilarious and those covered songs and their renditions are just as catchy, you can't help but like this movie. And I didn't know Oscar nominee Hailee Steinfeld could rock a tune, but she'll definitely leave you impressed.<br/><br/>I had my concerns at first, I thought that if the story would only be about the Bellas entering a world tournament and nothing more to it, then we would be in for a shallow unappealing sequel, but writer Kay Cannon and first time feature director Elizabeth Banks put the Bellas back in a place where they would have to relearn, regroup and find the sound again. What makes these ""Pitch Perfect"" movies loved by millions is that it's about this group of misfit girls working together as an underdog team. In this case, the goliath, the drago, if you will, is a German team called Das Sound Machine, they know their stuff, they seem to be perfect in both their physique and their choreography, and they're intimidating.<br/><br/>The sequel does its best to explore some of the key characters a bit further this time around. It explores the somewhat awkward romances between Bumper and Fat Amy, and between Benji and Hailee Steinfeld's character, Emily. And the Bellas have to also come to terms with the harsh reality that they're now seniors, it's time to not be afraid to move on and give the baton to the next generation. Which is why I can see how this franchise could go on forever, and I don't think you and I would mind at all if Universal Pictures made PITCH PERFECT 23, for example. Even the Bellas' fearless leader, Beca (Anna Kendrick) is distracted because she's trying to balance her commitment to her team and her new intern gig and her dream of becoming a music producer.<br/><br/>I gotta give mad respect to Elizabeth Banks for taking this on as her first feature directorial debut. She produced and championed the first ""Pitch Perfect"", she's one of the folks who fought to make the first film happen. And now, with this she's proved herself to be as talented a leader as she is an actress. PITCH PERFECT 2 really makes me look forward to many more great movies made by director Elizabeth Banks. And if you've come to theaters hoping to once again be laughing your ass off at whatever Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy does, o, you are in for a treat, my friend. One of the funniest women alive will not disappoint you. The things she says, she even gets to sing solo in this one, Rebel's got tricks up her sleeves, you will crack up, I guarantee it.<br/><br/>One of the many things that I like about this movie is its theme of mentorship. It's a scary thought to turn the page and enter the next chapter of your life. The pressure is heavy. Whether it be being a freshman at the same college that your parent went to or finding yourself having to do a job you don't like just to get to that one job you really want. Sometimes we think we can handle everything on our own but fact of the matter is, we will have to ask someone for advice and then we'll have to turn that advice into action, finding the right mentor is important and being a mentor to someone is equally important. So I'm glad that PITCH PERFECT 2 is not just about throwing the Bellas in a world competition, although it is fun to see a cappella groups from other countries, and see their different ethnic costumes and the songs they cover as well. But that world competition in Copenhagen is just a small part of this film. I think you're going to like the big chunk of it, and just like how you've watched the first ""Pitch Perfect"" film a thousand times over, I know I have, you're going to do the same to PITCH PERFECT 2 Read more at Ramascreen.Com"

","***This review may contain spoilers***<br/><br/>Disappointing sequel, I gave it 6 out of 10 for the actors that made an effort. The story line was poor, the jokes were not funny and its seemed more like the ""Fat Amy"" show than Beca's perspective. I thought Anna Kendrick and Skylar Astin had great chemistry in the prequel Pitch Perfect and here we did not get to see it again, their relationship seemed some what cold. There is less of Anna Kendrick and a lot less of Skylar Astin, which is disappointing, he's a great singer, dancer and actor. Even though all the characters returned, I would prefer to just remember the prequel Pitch Perfect and forget that I watched Pitch Perfect 2. Also the music was not as good as the prequel's."

If they're is any skeptics out there, anyone that thinks they couldn't top the first or that Pitch Perfect couldn't get any better .... It just did!<br/><br/>The songs are modern, with the odd 80's power ballads thrown in and the classic riff off half way through that includes everything from 90's hip- hop and club anthems.

","For a good all out can't stop laugh you must go watch this. I laughed so much I had stomach pains and tears in my eyes. It was a little bit longer than I was prepared for but well worth the time. Rebel Wilson was AMAZING!!! Her acting skills are on point and flawless. She is very funny and she's not afraid to try anything out of the norm. She will make you laugh and fall in love with her all at the same time. The plot and the ending was predictable because it follows the same patterns as the first movie but I still found it very tasteful and comforting. Often times sequels fall short but this one made me love it even more. I normally do not find movies with an all female cast funny but this time I was surprised! If you're wondering whether or not you should take your boyfriend, husband, brother or any other masculine man to go watch this because of hesitation that he might find it boring and nag about having to be dragged to watch this then you don't have to worry. There is a lot of male approved humor in this chick flick. I'm definitely going to buy the DVD when it comes out."

Basically, an eye candy.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack: The best thing about this movie is the non-stop flawless music. Das Sound Machine really rocked the movie and made it challenging for the Barden Bellas to win. Famous songs and a great track-list, thats all i can say.<br/><br/>The Pace: I have recently seen many movies this year that were good but there's always that moment in the movie where you feel bored. Gladly, Pitch Perfect 2 doesn't fall for that mistake and it never slows down, you actually never feel bored in the movie.<br/><br/>The Story: The usual story about the Bellas trying to win their competition. Except that this time, it's bigger, a World Wide Championship! And some side stories about each of the characters and what they're going to do after graduating.<br/><br/>Overall: As a huge fan of the first part, i found it very original to make a good movie about Acapella which is something new and could be a great advance in the music process of this generation,Pitch Perfect 2 doesn't disappoint at all.Everything we liked about the first part is doubled here.It's like they checked what part of the movie the fans liked and added more of it which means MORE SONGS,MORE FAT AMY,MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT,MORE CHALLENGES and Definitely MORE LAUGHS! <br/><br/>After reading the review and watching the trailer you probably know what you're getting from this movie.

","Hollywood has finally pulled off the greatest musical ever. The director of the pitch perfect franchise introduced a new element that is rarely found in movies.

This element elevated the movie to the top by combining basic human feelings such as love, fear and anger with unexpected reactions that seek to puzzle the audience unless they become acquainted with the technique. This is embedded in each and every character as they keep responding to ordeals with humorous complexity. This makes defining each character's role partly hard because they do not expose all their feelings to the audience. The sweetness element is present between the hero and the heroin but by no means do they act conventionally. The director here defies tradition and creates a new bond between the main characters making them doubly interesting to the audience. Along with the music , which is a sheer genius, everything keeps getting interesting in the movie until the end. In both movies I was moved to tears when I reached the ending. The first time this has ever happened to me. I fell in love with the main character Becca played by Anna Kendrick. I strongly recommend these two movies 'equally' as they both present a new type of comedy and even acting, which explains its immediate success."

No to mention, I bought the Pitch Perfect BluRay from store just so that I'm not behind with the Pitches while PP2 is still promoting, therefore I got a free ticket from Fandango to go watch PP2, again, and I can't believe that I laughed just as much as the first time!<br/><br/>*Off topic* I can't get over how adorable Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow is, whether on screen as Beca and Chloe, or off screen as Dork and Princess, they are just too lovely :)"
"Plezsno","8","25","47","16 May 2015"," Anchorman/High School Musical Lovechild?
","If Anchorman spawned a lovechild with High School Musical, it would abound with sophomoric one-liners between energetic musical numbers. And thusly, Pitch Perfect 2 feels like it was belched from that very birth canal. As the plot develops, it becomes more and more formulaic. Deeply meaningful, though, is not what this film wants to be when it grows up. Along side some jokes that would make 3rd graders giggle intensely, the Anchorman-esque humor takes shots at cultural and racial biases. This style of humor may give some of the more hoity-toity among us a reason to snub the film. I,on the other hand, laughed so hard I did some crop dusting of my own. (My apologies to those sitting near me.) When the plot or jokes stall, energetic High School Musical-esque song mash-ups flourish while some scenes are hilariously forced.<br/><br/>Yes, indeed, this movie is not for those searching for the meaning of life in the B-roll. Instead, it is the opportunity to be enveloped in entertainment purely for the sake of a good laugh at a stupid joke."

","I give this a 10 not because it was flawless. It was far from. But, because it surpassed my expectations AND was better than the first (IMO : I've heard differential opinions.) Usually I avoid giving 10's because usually I give 10's to films I believe everyone should see. Which is not this. If some horror fanatic asked for recommendations, I would not recommend this. But, this is different. This one is a film I honestly believe is the exception (I won't say only, because I've given 10's to films before) because : I was laughing through almost all of it. In my opinion this was bigger and better than the first. The beginning was HILARIOUS. Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins were even funnier in this one than the first! The script was more in touch with the characters rather than the first when it was super rushed. (Besides Stacie, Jessica, Ashley and Jesse who were in it notably less.) They introduced a new BELLA who is HYSTERICAL (Flo) And they had great music. (Including Jessie J's 'Flashlight.) Overall, if you're a fan of Pitch Perfect... Please see this.

If you haven't seen the first, I would recommend it as a good lead in for this film.<br/><br/>There was just enough sexual tension, character betrayal, comic relief, and background to really carry this over.

I love how Pitch perfect 2 features older better remix songs in their movie, which sounds so superb, that's why, I was quick to purchasing their original motion picture soundtracks, The dancing in the movie was amazing.

"prospectus_capricornium","8","28","54","12 May 2015"," Same old Tune, but hey, what's not to like in a song that puts you in a LSS mode?
","Pitch Perfect 2, strikes as a mere encore of a sold out performance. The effort is focused on reprising its previous success, rather than delivering something new, fresh, and original. Such retread tends to bore audience, but it works out well in favor of this film.<br/><br/>The story picks up three years after the events in the first installment. Bellas have already won three national titles, and now they're singing with the American president in the audience. This should should propel the group toward a bigger success, only it never happens. Because in the end, when a major wardrobe malfunction involving Fat Amy suddenly cleaves into the occasion, their career meets an abrupt shut off. Gravely humiliated, their only shot at redemption, rests on winning the world championships. This pits them against the brutally talented and ruthlessly mean German Group, Das Sound Machine. This load is more than enough for them to bear, but to make it even worse, Beca (Kendrick) is pulled away from the group by competing priorities, most striking is when an internship for a record label comes into view.<br/><br/>The sequel's efforts to make everything simple is evident as it fixes its spotlight on the same spots that made the first film both fun and moving. Pitch Perfect 2 is both mean and sweet as the first outing, and here, both attributes again are well-mixed and given with equal level of importance. From time to time, it throws double-meaning jokes, which may be mostly offensive, but it also places the emotional weight of the narrative on the other side of the bar, to keep the balance, and to make everything with brow-arching tendency, tolerable. The script is also smart to allow key characters to shine. Most notably, the sequel sheds more light on the franchise's probably goofiest character, Fat Amy, allowing her deliver a big part of the comic efforts of the movie. Strong supports like the mean commentators, Gail and John, can't be dismissed too, and those in German group, with their often display of ruthlessness and authority, that would rather send you to laughing, than shrugging. Where it's most emotional, Beca (Kendrick), is at its center. Anna Kendrick's character keeps the group altogether, and while she is torn between rival commitments and her personal issues, she once again manages to keep Bellas' morale intact. This doesn't make the movie more emotionally complex than it should be, but it's also good to get bits of drama and inspiration, when all you feel is exploding to endless laughter and brittle chuckles.<br/><br/>At some points, there is a sense of wanting for everything to be stronger. There are efforts to tell more with expositions that come into view here and there, but I'll be honest to tell that seldom do these subplots feel necessary, or properly presented. In the end, what makes this sequel equally a stand out, is a convincing power of women empowerment. Amidst of all its efforts to entertain and ignite bursts of laughter, there's a message here, and it imparts a thing or two about equality.<br/><br/>There's still a lot to negatively comment about PITCH PERFECT 2, I mean I get it, we all get it. Nothing is perfect, and certainly, this sequel is without flaw. PITCH PERFECT 2 may be singing the same tunes, but what is not to like in a song that puts you in an LSS mode? What sense does babbling about its shortcoming make, when we'll all end up humming the same songs they've sung in the movie, anyway?"

","Pitch Perfect 2 is an emotional thrill ride as it hits the audience with waves and waves of excitement! It is a reliever for the fans of the first movie, the first movie as good as it was had a "" the one"" feeling, but this one stands out as an individual and not suffering from that cause, it reunites the Bellas and make them stand together to face the Das sound machine. We expect great things from Universal and we got them. The only thing was its plot wasn't colourful enough. It was the same story as the one in pitch perfect. Embarrass Bellas, meet super strong team, train train train train, go to riff off(which I love), small competition in which they lose, train train train, then BAM! They win at the end, this movie although great lacked a main follow through of the plot, making it the same as the first one. But overall this was an awesome movie and I enjoyed it very much"
"elliotdyers","8","13","22","1 June 2015"," After a humiliating performance at the Lincoln Centre, the Barden Bellas have to battle for their rights to perform.
","Hilarious, wacky and smart are only some of the words that best describe Pitch Perfect 2. Taking place 3 years after the original, this film did have some high expectations to live up too. The humour as well as the strong female characters involved created something with little to complain about. Sexist jokes such as 'Woman are about as good at a coppella as they are at being doctors' said by John (John Michael Higgins) to then be put down by such comments like 'crack a Book, John' said by Gail (Elizabeth Banks), is displaying woman power. The film did a good job at not living up to the hype, with many critics dubbing the film to be better than the first. But like we all know, films with hype generally don't live up to expectations, turning a film from a success to a shamble in weeks. Thanks to many of the original cast reigniting their roles in this film, it meant for a quick and easy introduction, with all the characters already built and back stories set. <br/><br/>Beca (Anna Kendrick) has worked her way up from the first film, with her natural and powerful singing ability; we see her rise from the new comer in the original to the leader in Pitch Perfect 2. We see her leadership and her desire to achieving her real goal in life, whilst being the figurehead for all of the other girls to follow. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) has recreated her role from the original in a much more humorous and creative way, being the main supplier of laughs throughout the film, from her sexual antics to her denial of love she is always throwing laughs at us, giving us the feeling of 'I wish she was my friend'. Jason Moore didn't continue his role as director in the sequel, leaving the job to Elizabeth Bank to direct and act in this hilarious sequel. Although during the end performance, there is obvious and silly CGI green screens that even the least of film nerds would be able to reorganise, granted this isn't just down to the director, but the lack of a 'Perfect' special effect expert. However you can't take away the excellent choreography and excellent screen direction that she produced, with the breath taking dancing and the powerful voices, you are fully entertained throughout each performance, if it's the plot changing performance or if its when Amy decides to serenade the man of her dreams. The film doesn't change much from the first film, with a similar plot line and the use of the same scenes during the film, like the group showdown where they have to blurt out songs without compromise for them to lose only too their main competition, showing the lack of creativity by the writers.<br/><br/>Beca and Fat Amy both stealing the stage with their support acts Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Lilly (Hana Mea Lee) not far behind left little room for the new characters to grow, leaving characters such as Flo (Chrissie Fit) as a nameless character that you just remember as 'The New One'. Down too the fact that she wasn't a very fun character and didn't have the personality to out shines the outrageous Amy. <br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 starts 3 years after the original, meaning that many of the girls are in their final year of college. However Chloe (Brittany Snow) who was one of the main Barden Bella's in the first had actually been at college for 7 years, without no thought of what she was going to do after and knowing what she was even doing at college. This was a plot hole in the film that overall didn't have many, however the nature of her role in the film, you get past the fact that she is a bit of a sado who doesn't want to leave her life and go into real world.<br/><br/>The performances put on by the Barden Bella's where much better in this one, but it had to be because the competition was a lot better, although the plot was similar but on a larger level it still gave us lots of laughs throughout, weather it help the story or didn't. The story wasn't very strong and you could tell that the ideas where lacking throughout the film. You could always tell that they were going to bring out an amazing performance to try achieving their goal, making the film lack in excitement and emotion.<br/><br/>Where the film lacks in plot it makes up in humour, giving you laughs throughout the whole film, with there wacky yet clever jokes. The film has not moved on much from the original with the plot being basically the without the build-up to allow characters to grow. Although it has some flaws that with more creative writers could have been avoided, it is still a good watch to have a laugh with friends."

","I wouldn't call myself a fan of musicals, but I do love my ""pitches"" (term used by the characters of this movie just in case you were unaware of that). And I did miss them while they were gone. And it looks like this one was so successful, they will be back. And while most male actors here (even those who ""survived""/came back from the first movie) are nothing more than a filler (you could argue they are having cameos), the executive for whom Kendricks character is working is pure gold (you might have seen some comedy skits of his).<br/><br/>Other than that, we get a great mixture of female bonding together, fights in the family, a new member, a new ""villain"" (""ze Germans"" this time around) and a lot of Acapella. Well of course we do. One of the funniest skits is when towards the end we get that while trying to cross the street ... you'll either laugh or feel annoyed by it. For me it was the former. Same can be applied to the rest of the movie. And while I loved this one too (as I did the first one), I'm not sure a third one is/was necessary ... but I sure will Aca-watch it!"
"Robert_duder","8","10","16","4 June 2015"," A movie that didn't need a sequel gets a fortunately solid one
","The first Pitch Perfect came out of left field and bowled most of us over. It is one of the best and most fun comedy musicals ever and a modern day classic already in my opinion. Did it need a sequel? Absolutely not. But Hollywood can't ever say no to more potential money so a sequel was green lit. I was cautiously optimistic because as much as it didn't need a sequel, I wanted to have fun with the Bellas again and wanted it to be good! Pitch Perfect 2 isn't as good as the first one...there is no way around that...but it is a worthy sequel, a ton of fun, makes sense, good characters, new songs, new ideas and its well worth your time especially if you're a fan of the first one. You know what to expect because they were smart not to change the formula of the film. Pitch Perfect is what is has always been and that's a good thing. There aren't a lot of changes or surprises but if something ain't broke, don't fix it! There are plenty of laughs and ridiculous antics and they do sort of play on some of the same jokes but that is to be expected. A lot of negative reviews mention the crass ""racist"" and ""homophobic"" jokes and as always people are too sensitive but I get where they're coming from. The Hispanic character is almost too much to bear.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow return to lead the Bellas to the World Championships. The three of them are very good, Snow and Kendrick have great chemistry but its a little less obvious as it was in the first film because presumably the characters are already established. Wilson being Wilson there is always the danger of her being overused but both the first film and now this one, she is used just the right amount and very funny in a crass sort of way. Skylar Astin and Adam Devine also return in smaller roles this time around but they are meant to be supporting characters as are Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee and Ester Dean who are way in the background this time around. That's a wise choice though since they're funny schtick was really done in the first film. Anna Camp returns in a small but very good cameo. Ben Platt gets a slightly bigger role (and technically the romantic lead) than in the first film and he's very good and adorable in his role. The newcomer everyone is talking about is Hailee Steinfeld who I adore. I knew she would be an It-Girl from the first time she graced our screens in True Grit. This girl is a fantastic actress and a great singer as it turns out. She is a welcomed addition to the cast, has good chemistry with Kendrick and could lead the film series going forward. The romance with Platt is adorable and while they don't focus on it as much as they did in the first film with Kendrick and Astin it is still very good.<br/><br/>It is very easy to decide whether you will like this film. If you enjoyed the first one, this is more of the same in all the right ways. Elizabeth Banks gives her directorial debut with this film and she shows some talent for sure but the ground work had already been laid. I'm impressed that screenwriter Kay Cannon isn't someone who has been around in film for ages but clearly knows comedy and knows what works. Pitch Perfect 2 is fun!! It is a worthy sequel that builds on its characters but mostly just continues the story from the first. A perfect date night movie that anyone can enjoy. 8/10"
"Screen_Blitz","8","11","18","5 June 2015"," The Pitches return in this fun, energetic sequel

However, after an embarrassing incident during a show puts them in a negative spotlight, the girls attempt to regain their fame by competing in an international competition. I was very pleased by this film, it was funny, charming, energetic, and never disappointed me.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that this film was as good as the first one, but it pretty close. Like the first film, Pitch Perfect 2 brings out the laughter, charm, and heart that everyone enjoyed in the original. Rebel Wilson, who plays Fat Amy, is much funnier in this time around. Almost every one-liner she spits out had me laughing hysterically. The rest of the girls are very funny as well. I was quite intrigued by how Hailee Steinfield was cast as the new girl. I never expected to see her in a comedy. I was also surprised by some of the song they sing here. There were a lot of songs from the late 90s and early 2000s that many kids who grew in the 90s remember from their childhood as well as recent songs. Overall, this film was very satisfying. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed the 2012 original, I will surely enjoyed this film. While its not quite on the level of the first film, it is still worth watching."
"Darkhorse_Knight","8","11","18","1 June 2015"," DHKR: Pitch Perfect 2- ""A Great Film to Those Who Love Music and Who Hate Pentatonix""
","Pitch Perfect, the first film, was hashed by critics but slowly grew a cult following. For most, it's a big ""Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover"" film, and many people find a soft spot in their heart to enjoy it. <br/><br/>So, with that in mind, I entered Pitch Perfect 2 with that mindset. It's a sequel to a cult classic, so I secretly knew it wouldn't hold up to the original. However, in a twist of fate, the sequel itself manages to have that star power and imagination that made the original what it was, and also gives itself it's own kind of uniqueness. <br/><br/>Story wise, Pitch Perfect 2 is pretty much the Iron Man 2 of the Pitch Perfect Series, in that it's story is a little less tangible and riddled with subplots a plenty, many of which actually are pretty funny and dramatic in their own ways, even managing to pull off a successful romance subplot. No prizes for those who guessed it was about Fat Amy.<br/><br/>What really gives this film and the one before it a lot of its spontaneity was by the A Capella moments where each singer has to emote and build a beat only by using their vocal chords, and since this is Generation Y it has to be modern ""Pop"" songs. For those terrified if the film would just be a two and a half hour Pentatonix album, you can rejoice in hearing that the songs and ways they are sung are not only good, but also memorable in execution. Especially in the fact that the music actually SOUNDS like music and not a bunch of beat boxing cry babies whining out lyrical-like moans as if each of the singers just stubbed their toes after they came out of a screening of an American Sniper/Lone Survivor Double Feature Matinée. <br/><br/>Comedy, Music, and Drama go hand in hand in a Trinity in the storytelling, and it was a smart move in having the music to be a heavy part of the film. However, I would have seen a slight bit of development from our protagonists other than just ""Legacy"", Beca, and I guess Fat Amy. However, what little character Fat Amy has always felt just right in my opinion. The rest of the cast are just as flat and stereotypical as they were in Pitch Perfect, the worst being Ester Dean's Cynthia, but perhaps that's just me being too damn Hoosier about that kind of thing. <br/><br/>The film trips up a bit when the Bella's all go to what I can assume is ""Bella Boot Camp"". It's long, unfunny, and serves only for each character to try and tie up any kind of loose ends. A full Eighth of the film takes place here, and while that doesn't sound long, in a movie like this, it eats a good chunk of screen time that could be enjoyed on the singing. The only funny part in that whole scene was with a bear trap for obvious reasons. <br/><br/>The two best parts in the film involve both an A Capella music battle that has the Green Bay Packers, seriously, and the final A Capella competition in Copenhagen. Both involve Das Sound Machine, the obligatory all German villains who couldn't look anymore evil unless they were wearing Stahlhelms and driving around Panzers on the stage before singing. Well, both prove to be formidable by their stage presence and vocal superiority. Most of the songs by DSM are big. They sound big, and they make it look big as well. Granted, both couldn't be more stereotypically evil, but they do have a likability to those with an ear for that kind of thing.<br/><br/>The film ends on a positive note, and we reprise the song ""Flashlight"", which actually is more beautiful than it sounds. Well, kinda. OK not really. But it's still a good ending, nonetheless. If you haven't seen it yet, go give it a look.<br/><br/>4-Stars- A-Ranking"

","Any time there's a sequel audiences are divided. <br/><br/>Die-hard fans of the original will say anything but something critical about the film, casual fans will approach with apprehension, and anyone who doesn't fall into those two categories will trash it because something that started out small, as a cult like sleeper hit, is now popular and in the mainstream. So this is the battle facing everyone involved with Pitch Perfect 2, and thankfully it's a battle the cast and crew come out of as close to the top as possible. <br/><br/>It's impossible to make a perfect movie, even more impossible to make a perfect sequel. Any fault found in Pitch Perfect comes at the expense of trying to both honor the original film and outdo it. After a hilarious and effective opening scene, the film loses its momentum as it sets up new story and realizes how high its own stakes are.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the lagging doesn't last too long after the Bella's endure a mishap setting them back into their underdog status. As underdogs, this is when the characters shine, and a real positive to this movie is showing characters that are not just what they appear to be on the surface. Unusually for a sequel, Pitch Perfect 2 allows characters to grow and begins pushing them in different directions.<br/><br/>A key argument among fans seems to be the change in Beca's character. She is not as surly and sarcastic as she is in the first film, likely because the changes her character faces do not permit her to rely on what she has used to deal with her life before. <br/><br/>Like in the first, the film works best when all the Bellas come together. It's good to see a film full of multifaceted characters who fight, argue, deal with uncertainty, but ultimately support each other and find some success. Hailee Steinfeld is a pleasant surprise as the new legacy joining the Bellas, giving the film a breath of fresh air and letting the other characters grow up a little.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, giving all the press that surrounded the music chosen for the film, no song is a particular standout, aside from maybe ""Flashlight"". Some of the songs chosen have already been redone in television and movies recently, so it's a wonder why those songs were picked to feature in a movie about a group trying to find a competitive edge. Still, the songs lend themselves to inspired numbers in the movie, ending with a finale performance that is worth the movie ticket price alone.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 does not manage to escape some of the bloated-ness of stuffing a lot of material into a sequel to top the original (as well as obligatory product placement), but more than makes up with it from earnest performances from the entire cast. While the film skewers almost everyone with its humor, warm direction save it from being cruel, and no one in the film performs from a standpoint that they were contractually obligated to. Aca-applause to everyone involved."
"rgkarim","8","19","35","15 May 2015"," An Aca-Awesome Sequel, Though Lacking in Some Areas
","Hey there it's Robbie K, back with another movie review to help you get some insight into the latest movies. Today I throw my hat into the ring of the latest singing movie Pitch Perfect 2, a sequel that has been most anticipated for quite some time. With it's predecessor becoming an instant ""classic"" in the A capella world, going so far to inspire singing competitions, surely this sequel had some potential to rock the ear drum world. From the trailers, here is what you might expect:<br/><br/>1. Comedy 2. Toe Tapping Tunes 3. A cute story<br/><br/>However, in the world of sequels you never know what will come out of the woodwork, so here is what you get:<br/><br/>1. Comedy In terms of Comedy, Pitch Perfect 2's greatest strength is the ability to make you laugh. The trailer showing Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) showing off her lower anatomy is only the tip of the iceberg in this installment. You will be bombarded with one liners that are sure to be the next T-shirt or picture meme, including that famous use of Aca into vocabulary. The writers spared no expense to cram this movie with ridiculous quotes, often having our Barden Bellas go to extraordinary lengths to deliver their lines. What was the result? Most of the audience was rolling on the floor laughing, some even to tears at the comedy at hand. Wilson in particular takes the cake for the most laughs, using her weight and her blunt way of speaking to land well-timed, hilarious, dialogue. Even the slapstick comedy involving the setting is fun, especially when you see the responses of the other girls at what occurred. But perhaps the third factor that made the comedy so fun, was integrating some of the jokes into singing. Whether it was Fat Amy performing an act, or someone screwing up a lyric, Pitch Perfect 2 adds some quality comedy in their song numbers to give us a small break from the other comedy. But for all the good of the comedy, there are some limitations. For one thing they did too much of a good thing in the jokes, and for this reviewer some of the one-liners got stale. I mean how many weight jokes or sex references do we need in a two hour time frame? The second mistake was not balancing the comedy between the Bellas. Oh sure each of them got at least one line into the phrase, but this sequel focused heavily on Fat Amy and left some of the others in the dust. I always used to enjoy Becca's sarcasm as a joke, but even that got drowned by the simple slapstick of this movie. Finally the writers went a little too far with their racial/sexist jokes in both intensity and number. Some of the jokes are more insulting than funny, and the constant bashing throughout the movie had me shaking my heads and praying that no protests or boycotts would come underway. <br/><br/>2. Songs:<br/><br/>So if you saw the first movie, you know that covers are the other life force of this series. Pitch Perfect 2 does a great job bringing their versions of popular songs into the mix, and making you want to sing and dance the night away. Songs are mashed together in a recipe of success that covered all genres, somehow being spun in a direction that made me like a Taylor Swift song. They even did a better job integrating our girls into the mix, helping to expand the track horizon. Best of all, I didn't have to hear I Saw The Sign performed ten times in one movie, which was perhaps the most annoying part of Pitch Perfect 1. Throw in the filler songs that helped transition the scenes, and you have one soundtrack I'll be looking to buy down the line. However the music still pales compared to its predecessor. Despite Pitch Perfect 2 having some really good tunes, the numbers still weren't as impressive as I had hoped. The final battle in particular was rather lackluster and simple, though the Bellas number did rock, and I found myself bored with the performances of the other groups. <br/><br/>3. Story<br/><br/>We all know this movie isn't about the story, but take a look back at what we had in the first movie. Pitch Perfect brought college life to the screen, helping introduce a new world for Becca that included getting involved, music, friends, and love. It was simple and predictable, but done well that tied the other aspects together. Not the case in Pitch Perfect 2. This sequel sacrificed a lot of plot for extra laughs, essentially shredding the foundation to which I enjoyed in the first. Sure there was the establishment of a rival team to help spur the plot, and there was even a moral filled tale of embracing change. Heck there were even a few cutesy love stories thrown into the mix. But this movie really diluted their character development down into a rather basic mashup of half baked plot lines. I didn't feel quite as attached to the characters, my mind only wondering what the next stunt or joke would be. <br/><br/>So from my skewed review what can we take away? Pitch Perfect 2 is a really fun and enjoyable sequel that is sure to entertain a majority of the world. The comedy heavy theme and dialogue is going to make you laugh, and the soundtrack will have you tapping your toes away. Despite the lack of balance and weaker story, I have to recommend you go and see this film in theaters (like you actually wouldn't). <br/><br/>My scores overall are:<br/><br/>Comedy/Music: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0"

","The film starts with the Bardon Bellas at the top of their game until a wardrobe malfunction in front of the President makes them underdogs once more: their only chance of redemption is the World Acapella Championships, in which they will face uber-foes, the massively efficient Das Sound Machine. But Beca has other things on her mind...<br/><br/>If you saw Pitch Perfect – and you probably did if you're going to see this one – then you won't get many surprises. But you will get a similar amount of enjoyment, because this film doesn't try to do anything other than give you more of what worked the first time. Rebel Wilson's role is expanded, some of the Bellas are almost invisible, and Hailee Steinfeld gets to play the closest thing to an actual character.<br/><br/>And the musical numbers are all good fun, too. Music is a funny thing: it can deliver up moments which grip you by the throat and bring tears to your eyes. The last time I remember that happening was when Bruce Robinson appears on stage at the festival in Still Crazy, and there is a similar moment here, which I absolutely loved.<br/><br/>Incidentally film-makers, please learn about female anatomy: the TV announcers comment about what was visible referred to the internal bit, not the external bit."

","'PITCH PERFECT 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Sequel to the 2012 hit musical-comedy flick 'PITCH PERFECT'; which was based on the book 'Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory', by Mickey Rapkin. Actress Elizabeth Banks reprises her supporting role, from the original film, and she also makes her feature film directorial debut, with this movie (she served as a producer on both films as well). The movie was written by Kay Cannon, once again, and it has most of the original's cast, reprising their roles; including Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Ben Platt, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean and John Michael Higgins. Hailee Steinfeld, Katy Sagal and Keegan-Michael Key also join the cast, this time around. I really enjoyed the first movie, a lot, and I think this one is just as good. <br/><br/>The collegiate a cappella group 'The Barden Bellas', are performing for President Obama, at the Kennedy Center, when 'Fat Amy' (Wilson) has a wardrobe malfunction. They become a nationwide disgrace, due to the incident, and are banned from doing any shows, or competing in any challenges, ever again. The girls realize that they're only chance of continuing on, as an a cappella team, is to compete in the world tournament, and win. They must travel to Copenhagen, in order to do so. At the same time a freshman, named Emily Junk (Steinfeld), joins their team; and Becca (Kendrick) secretly pursues a career as a music producer, by starting an internship at a successful recording studio.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find out, just how good the first movie is; due to how popular it's become, with teen girls. Still I had doubts, about this sequel, because it's even more successful; with the kind of audience that (seems) to usually love movie like 'TWILIGHT'. Both films are really well made; the music is always likable, and performed well, and the comedy is brilliant. They're also both kind of moving, and inspiring, in a sappy way (but still, it's impressive). The cast is all great again, the script is really well written and Banks did an awesome job directing. I look forward to the third installment!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/N95IMM6Vork"
"Mandirenfroe","8","10","17","18 May 2015"," Funny, But Not Perfect
","First off, let me just say that Anna Kendrick never fails to impress me. Even if I don't think she's the perfect choice for a role, she does an amazing job no matter what. I loved Beca in the first movie. She was a very cool, sarcastic girl that did some self-discovery in the first movie and found out that she wasn't as closed up as appeared to be. However in the second film, I feel we see too big of a difference in this character. Losing all of her quips and cool, she becomes a bit of a nervous, insecure girl that I felt was a character flaw in the writing, and not in Anna Kendricks portrayal of Beca. <br/><br/>The beginning also started off a bit slow to me, even with the big Fat Amy entrance, and I felt a bit of disappointment in scenes that could've been really epic and funny, but ended up just passing by with no more than a corny joke here or there. Benji, the newest edition of the Treblemakers at the end of the first film, is now one of the leads of the a capella group, and I was really hoping that he would have a solo. However, instead of a solo they make him talk even less by making him super nervous and unable to talk to the girl of his dreams. <br/><br/>Then enters the German group, Das Sound Machine, who bring a whole new look to a capella groups, musically and performance wise. I was really impressed after their first performance. I also think that the riff-off scene at David Cross's house was what started to save the movie for me. <br/><br/>I also think they were trying WAY too hard to make the new song, Flashlight, into the next big-hit Cups song. However, what was great about Cups was that it didn't set out to be a huge hit. Just an original song, sung beautifully by Anna Kendrick. This time around, they were just trying to hard to make it big, and it didn't live up to the hype for me. <br/><br/>That being said, as the film progressed, there were more surprising funny scenes, funny lines coming from the beloved side characters from the first one, great mash-ups of classic songs, and lots of great Fat Amy scenes."
"aleksandar-todorovic-157-67954","8","6","9","21 September 2015"," Enjoyable, but the tensions between the German team and the Bellas is just unnecessary
","I watched first movie and the sequel in one night. Although I think that the second movie was enjoyable (although not as enjoyable as the first one), I really don't see the point of tensions between the German team and Bellas. It was completely unnecessary and it made the movie seem quite cheap. It's not like the first movie where the competition between Treblemakers and Bellas actually had sense. Here, the competition was just plain weird. Germans were like the bad guys and Bellas were (of course) the good guys (well, girls, of course). We could not hear the performance of any other country. On top of that, there was one Croatian flag that appeared in like every scene where they captured the audience, which let me feel like they had nothing else to shoot during those scenes."
"osj2507","7","6","9","14 August 2015"," Plenty of entertainment
","There is just something about the Barden Bellas, maybe it is the strange combination of weirdos, maybe it is because it is fun and serious at the same time, maybe it is just because it is all the songs you know in a cappella.<br/><br/>We know the characters for this movie, we just get to see more of them, their different and weird persona, their outbursts and strange behavior and much more. They are as I remember them from the first film and it is a joyful re-visit into this crowd of beautiful, strange, weird, loud, mousy, happy and funny people. <br/><br/>The scene is a bit different, for one the mean opposing a cappella group is German and the whole music competition is in Denmark, from a man who come from Denmark and live in Denmark that is not how it is here, a bit more fairytale a bit less weirdness and I have never heard of any a cappella competitions, maybe a few groups, but that is it :)<br/><br/>I was entertained, not as much as the first, they also had a bit to live up to, but this is still a good film, funny film and plenty of entertainment."

","I really love this movie since the first one released. It was a very good movie for me. It have musics and that is one of the thing that make me love this movie. The A Capella in this movie was very good, It is very enjoyable. The characters was well developed.It is too sad that Audrey didn't have any much appearance in this one. But,if I compare this to the first one I think the first one is better since they've sang more than this second one. I was a bit disappointed since there is not much singing in the second one because that is what I've anticipated about when I saw that they're going to make Pitch Perfect 2.But,this one is not bad either. The song in the final part was awesome. Fat Amy is awesome as always in this movie.I hope Pitch Perfect 3 was good as this two.I can't wait to see.<br/><br/>8/10 for this movie since I'm a bit disappointed.

After Fat Amy (Wilson) does something that embarrasses them, they are not only kicked off their tour, but also in danger of being forced to disband. Their only hope to remain a group is to win a world championship. I have to say that like most everyone the first movie took me by surprise. The movie seemed to come out of nowhere and combine hilarious comedy with a movie that is flat out fun to watch. That reasoning both helped and hurt this movie. The sequel could not sneak up on anyone and the expectations were higher for this one, for me anyway. That said I have to say that even though this wasn't as good as the first one this one was still very very funny and another really fun movie to watch. Higgins and Banks are amazing as the announcers and the movie is almost worth watching just for them. Since this is a sequel there isn't a whole lot to say to convince you to watch or not watch but I will say that if you haven't seen the first one I would check it out before this one. You may be surprised like I was. These movies are very funny and knowing that a lot of it is improved makes it that much funnier.

","It was a by-the-numbers story which we have all seen before. But that was not what disappointed me. <br/><br/>No, I was disappointed in that all these acappella groups have backing instrument tracks. Even the commentator had to comment about how in his day, it was done differently. Because what they were doing was not acappella music. It was pop hit medleys. <br/><br/>They have forgotten everything that was the magic of the first. Replacing strong vocals for circus skills, hula hoops, ribbon dancing and gymnastics. They were suppose to be an ACAPPELLA group! <br/><br/>Some of the racist and sexist jokes were funny, but borderline if you consider its target audience. Even suggesting Beca was into girls was getting awkward. Then they have the scene where there all sleeping together and one of them starts licking the others nose, and we cut away...

"benefaction-80731","4","21","44","16 July 2015"," Weak pitch
","Already first movie had several scenes that made viewer feel uncomfortable and ashamed on behalf of movie creators, yet it had something that made you watch it till the end (attractive actors, nice musical performances etc.). Classic story of rebellious, gifted girl that is required to fit in particular group with no wish to do so wrapped in candy cotton of college love story. Apart from too many vomit scenes, movie still managed to qualify as good movie for late teenagers.<br/><br/>Unfortunately second movie came with large disappointment - plot turned out lazy, scenes exceeding comedy awkwardness level, over-plaid German characters and many more. Most jokes in movie were overused and did not fit right in particular scenes. If first movie let you enjoy the musical performances, then this part made me wish for less musical performances as most were unpalatable.<br/><br/>Not clear which audience group movie creators tried to address with humor based on overweight, vomit, improper culture framing and top level awkwardness. This is the case of first movie being a lot better and maybe it would be even better if it stayed that way - one movie."
"paige-wilcox","7","13","25","5 May 2015"," ""The music is just as good as the first film.""
","""The music is just as good as the first film."" Those were the first words that I heard about Pitch Perfect 2 (immediately prior to the screening), and I was grateful for the lowered expectations. Not because the music in the film was terrible, but because whenever someone really tries to sell a film to me by talking it up, I end up feeling disappointed when I watch it for myself. I did not leave this film feeling disappointed.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Rebel Wilson tackle more screen time; her character Fat Amy was the cause of the majority of 'easy' laughs. I however preferred the deadpan social commentary of John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks), but seemed alone in either understanding or appreciating most of the scathing remarks. Other characters threw in a joke or two that got a lot of laughs, but they weren't so much for me.<br/><br/>Beca (Anna Kendrick) was a part of the plot in the same way I'm a part of Dungeons and Dragons when I play with my friends; I spend most of the game off by myself having my own little mini adventures, managing to re-join the group in time for the end. It was the way over-invested Chloe (Brittany Snow) who ultimately pushed the film forward due to her insecurities, aided by super cute newcomer Emily (Hailee Steinfeld).<br/><br/>Overall, this film delivers exactly what you want from this feel-good genre. It's funny, it's sweet, there's loads of music and it's a little bit crass."
"paul-allaer","8","12","23","17 May 2015"," ""aca-wedersehen, b*tches""... the gang is back and better than ever
","""Pitch Perfect 2"" opens with our beloved a cappella band the Bellas giving a performance at the Kennedy Center in the presence of President Obama, when Fat Amy encounters a 'costume malfunction' of epic proportions. As a result of this 'muffgate' incident, the Bellas are suspended but negotiate a loophole: win the a cappella world championships in Denmark, and they regain full standing. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie. Will the ladies be able to pull it off? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: first, this sequel is the full length feature directing debut of actress-producer Elizabeth Banks (she also reprises her role as Gail, the TV commentator), and Banks does a very capable job as director. The movie is paced perfectly, and even better, remains faithful to the spirit of the first Pitch Perfect. Let's face it, if you loved the first movie, all you want to see is the return of the original gang (mostly Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson, I suppose), and find excuses for them to sing and interact. This time around, the big rival for the girls is a German band called Das Sound Machine, and I have to admit, DSM sounds and performs impressively. We are also introduced to a new member of the Bellas, Emily (played by Hailee Steinfeld, the young girl in True Grit is now a young woman). Beware: there are plenty of fairly (c)rude jokes and lines in the movie (such as: Emily's last name is Junk-Hardon, no, really) so that even thought this movie is rated PG-13, frankly I wouldn't recommend taking young kids to this. Some of the better lines come from the TC commentators (played by Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins), but my favorite comes from Anna Kendrick's Beca character, when she hisses back to her DSM rivals ""aca-wedersehen, b*tches!"", ha! The music is aplenty in this, even more so than in the first Pitch Perfect, and that's just fine by me (they even find a way of brining ""Cups"" back again). Bottom line: despite the high expectations, Banks & Co. have managed to deliver exactly what the people wanted from this sequel, not a small feat. Not surprisingly, there is already talk of a Pitch perfect 3, with Rebel Wilson already signed on. For my money, if they can't find a way of keeping Anna Kendrick around, my interest in another sequel will nosedive.<br/><br/>I saw the first Pitch Perfect knowing next to nothing about the movie, taking a flyer when it showed on its opening weekend. That screening was not all that well attended but I vividly remember how immensely I enjoyed that movie. Flash forward 3 years: I was really looking forward to seeing PP2. The early evening screening where I saw this at today (Sunday) was PACKED, and then some. The crowd absolutely ate it up, laughing at all the right times, and giving an applause when the house lights turned on. Many of them left as the movie's end titles started to run. A shame for them as they missed a very funny bonus extra which I won't spoil here. Just stick around when the end titles start running! Meanwhile, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"nicolechan916","8","11","21","17 May 2015"," Great songs, good acting and funny.
","Pitch Perfect has itself become a brand, and the way the film is made is just so unique and personalized. A perfect example is the beginning, even before the first scene when the 'Universal Pictures' logo comes out, instead of the normal sound effects that follow it, there is – surprise, surprise, an acapella arrangement of it. Sung by John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks) the infamous hosts, their harmonies are on point and is such a perfect introduction to the film.<br/><br/>The opening scene right after is hilarious, and just puts the standard up there, setting the mood for the whole film to follow. I wouldn't say that this was on par with the first, but it was quite close. The jokes were pretty funny and quite a few had me clapping my hands and laughing quite loudly. However, some of the jokes though I know they are not serious, were either too random or too stereotypic or racist to be funny. One or two of those jokes taken in good light works well, but John has too many racist/sexist lines that it becomes tiresome after some time.<br/><br/>The acting was great, Rebel Wilson really steals the show, and her character is just so charismatic that you can't help but be drawn to her. I wasn't really feeling Anna Kendrick's and Hailee Steinfeld's characters so much. Steinfeld plays Emily, and she joins them to compete in their international competition. Their acting was good, but their lines were a bit random and especially Steinfeld's felt quite off at times. Random shouting lines are not my thing, on top of the issue that her character pops in kind of randomly. I think the movie could have done well even without the addition of a new main character.<br/><br/>The best part of the film though, would be the songs and the singing. Really well done, I love mashups and acapella, and the film does the arrangements superbly. Nice touch adding the choreography too, quite a lot of dancing in this and it looked cool.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championnangels.wordpress.com"

","Pitch Perfect 2 combines all the elements that made the first movie great (including a hilarious underground sing-off this time hosted by David Cross) - but director Elizabeth Banks injects even more sass and moxie in the sequel.<br/><br/>Now more rounded as a truly in-sync ensemble, the Bellas face their last semester at Barden. The group find themselves embroiled in a scandal at the start of the film, which offers some outrageous presidential cameos, and soon the Bellas realise that atonement comes in the form of winning an international acapella group competition.<br/><br/>The scene stealer from the last film, Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) shines even brighter here and is given a more rounded role opposite an equally on form Adam DeVine. I'm glad Rebel has been given more to play with. New addition Hailee Steinfield does her best with such a limited support role, but is solid as always. I was impressed with Elizabeth Banks' direction and look forward to seeing more of her directorial work.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 was an enjoyable experience at the movies, I recommend it."
"StevePulaski","7","10","19","15 May 2015"," Characters with personality encapsulated in a film that has enough of its own to effectively capture it
","The original ""Pitch Perfect"" was, by any definition, a surprise hit; I think it's fair to claim nobody expected a film about a group of female a capella singers to be a box office smash that left a cultural footprint on the new generation of teenage girls. It combined the wry relatability of a film like ""Mean Girls"" and etched in pop/music-influenced energy to create something that was decidedly unique and realized and wound up creating its own eclectic fanbase. On the contrary, I don't think anybody expected there not to be a sequel to the film, and for that film to try and mimic what made the first film so loved.<br/><br/>Aside from a few stumbling attempts to keep up with its own absurdity, and some seriously questionable cultural jokes, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" continues to exploit its own harmony and run with it to notable success. This time around, we are reacquainted with the Bellas, the renowned, award-winning a capella group led by Becca (Anna Kendrick) and Chloe (Brittany Snow). Following an incident involving the klutzy Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and an unforeseeable wardrobe malfunction in front of President Barack Obama and the First Lady, the Bellas are suspended from competing in any competition. In order to regain their domestic status, the group tries to perform on the international circuit, which has never seen an American a capella group compete in history.<br/><br/>A few years ago, this would've been little sweat for the barrage of talented ladies. However, most of the Bellas are graduating this year, quietly forgetting what has kept them together for so long. Moreover, the only one who appears worried about her future is Becca, who has been skipping out on many rehearsals and practices to advance her lowly status at a record company. She dreams of being a music producer, but has to work around her hard-headed (but hilarious) boss (Keegan-Michael Key), leaving the Bellas without a great deal of organization in the meantime. The group also welcomes a new face named Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who is known for her ""legacy"" status thanks to her extremely talented mother, who was a Bella during her days at Barden University. This massive competitive undertaking mixed with a serious group identity crisis leaves the Bellas without a lot of options in terms of getting their name back on top.<br/><br/>Before we can appreciate what ""Pitch Perfect 2"" does fairly well, we have to recognize a couple of glaring issues that few seem to be talking about, one of which is the obvious cultural and racial insensitivity on display. There is a Guatemalan character in the film known as Flo (Chrissie Fit), who is a character that is thrown in the Bellas to do nothing other than confirm the common prejudices and stereotypes of Hispanic/South American individuals. Every time she speaks, she attributes some sort of stereotype to her own life, whether it be being kidnapped or having to change her identity and flee the country. The jokes are abrupt tonal shifts from what is otherwise light-hearted fun. In addition, even the blatantly sexist John (John Michael Higgins), one-half of the two announcers in the film who cover the a cappella competitions, has transcended from being simple and effective comic relief to thoroughly mean-spirited and misogynistic. I speak not as an offended viewer, but more as one questioning why many are so quick to just brush off casual racism in comedies when they condemn the same actions in real life (the same question I had when I saw ""Get Hard"").<br/><br/>""Pitch Perfect 2"" is damn lucky to have an exceptional team of cinematographers, sound editors, sound mixers, costume designers, set decorators, and choreographers to assure that questionable humor and mean-spiritedness don't overtake the project's inherent charm. Despite all the distractions, one can't deny the theatrical power of both this film and its sequel. The glitz, glamor, and beautiful decor of the sets and stages are a feast for the eyes, and never does the a capella aspect get lost in the shuffle. These films are both incomparable collections of talent that simultaneously don't feel like any kind of marketing campaign for a capella organizations, which is a tricky dance to pull off in many cases.<br/><br/>The only other time ""Pitch Perfect 2"" sidesteps is when its coolness gets the best of it. Both films have consistently tried to be hip with the characters' lingo, mannerisms, and actions, and, most of the time, they because of how the talented actresses handle it, but it's silly scenes like Fat Amy ""rubbing her confidence (aka sweat)"" on Becca that work to derail such added charm. These kinds of scenes work paradoxically to the film, which tries to be more adult and less Disney (it comes with a PG-13 rating that should strongly be noted by parents of kids eleven and younger) most of the time, but can't help but throw in some element of childishness in the mix.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, first-time feature-film director Elizabeth Banks (who shows up alongside Higgins once again in the film) takes a lofty challenge with ""Pitch Perfect 2"" and succeeds in making it a visual spectacle and something of an emotional one to boot. By the end, we realize how much time we've spent with these characters, even if it doesn't seem like that much, and we recognize their talents and their personalities, and find ourselves falling in love with their attitudes, their singing, and their talent all over again. That's the beauty of these films, through the occasional bouts of nonsense and ridiculous jokes; these are characters with a great deal of personality encapsulated in a film that has enough of its own to effectively capture it."

","So i went to see this movie with my friends, four guys including me watching this movie in a cinema full with girls. Of course we're straight lol. This movie is bigger than the first one in every aspects which is good considering that the premise is now known worldwide. So they decided to make it grand, with high budget and it has everything but a good storyline compared to the first one.<br/><br/>No it's not a bad film. It's funnier, and you'll not find any dull moment throughout the movie. Fat Amy got more screening time in this film and just by knowing that you know what to expect cause she's so funny. The new face in Barden Bella also good. The only setback is the storyline. This time, i feel like watching a so cliché Hollywood popcorn movie storyline. They just 'do it' according to standard formula.<br/><br/>I don't know about how much the first pitch perfect collects in your country but here in Malaysia, its actually not a total hit in cinema. But, it became a must watch movie by teenagers when DVD and bluray release has came out as people starting to realized about how good this movie is and start to spread it mouth to mouth. All because it's a unique film, fresh musical film with a great storyline and talented anna kendrick in it. But in the second one, anna's role become smaller and at one time she doesn't seems capable to lead Barden Bella and looks clueless on what to do. That's so not Beca ! Its like she is a different person in this film. <br/><br/>But, like i said, one thing for sure is this film is totally funnier than the first one. The joke is everywhere and it depends on whether you got it or not. For example, one scene with Snoop Dogg in it, i find only me and my guy friends are laughing. I think most of the female didn't find it funny but for us, it was funny as hell watching Snoop Dogg singing a Christmas song. Okay lets not spoil it you better watch it yourself.<br/><br/>Oh ya, this film has after credit scene and you better wait for it."

Really funny with good music mash-ups, funny jokes and Hailee Steinfeld is her cute self as usual (who can also sing pretty well!).

There's so many little tiny things that bothered me that it overruled everything else like Fading fundamental role of Anna Kendrick or Complete disappearance of the Skylar Astin,Annoying role of Hailee Steinfeld Also the music was not as good as the prequels & something else like that. but i think the most worth thing about this movie is the story line same as the pitch perfect movie without any big differences like the same riff off or the film was started with Bella's screwing & many thing like this. but this movie has a good point like great performance of Rebel Wilson & Anna Kendrick or funny joke. Even though all the characters returned, I would prefer to just remember the prequel Pitch Perfect and forget that I watched Pitch Perfect 2."
"Seraphion","7","5","8","17 June 2015"," Retains the interesting parts from the original movie and added something new
","Well, at least the story quality is still about the same, considering that it's being as predictable as it was in the first movie. Yet as the first movie did, this second installment really knows what are it's plus points to retain and emphasize on and added more interesting stuff into the mix. I like how the movie retains the original a capella battles with the free styling, although this time it's quite not as grand as it was on the original movie. I also like the songs which are still able to do they task of keeping the movie's mood always up. The comedic inserts are also nicely placed, even in the middle of the supposedly dramatic finale. I absolutely like how the movie added cameos of great artists in the real industry like Snoop Dogg, and the judges from The Voice. The acting work in overall is just a bit above the standards. Anna Kendrick and Hailee Steinfeld, being the most prominent names in the cast list, should have done better, though. Rebel Wilson nicely keeps her character's as the anchor for the comedic points."
"ddoyle2017","7","8","15","26 May 2015"," Better than the first
","I have always loved the first movie, and when I saw that another one was coming, I was really excited. I saw the trailer and thought right then and there that this one will be much better than the first. I rarely say that sequels outmatch the original, but in this case, Pitch Perfect 2 takes the cake. It was very similar to the first movie. There were some new things don't get me wrong, but overall, the storyline was basically the same as the first one, just in a different place. It had the same big competition vibe like the original, but this time, they were competing on a global scale. Plus, the same arrangement with the characters was happening too. There was the new girl that doesn't fit in in the beginning but ends up being the hero/ co-hero at the end of the movie. Emily was a similar character to Becca in the first movie. I'm not saying that that's a bad thing. I just wished that they had done it a little differently. The humor was excellent. Fat Amy was by far the best character in the whole movie. She is really funny in some scenes, and I love the concept of all the boys loving her. It makes her feel special, which is funny in itself. Pitch Perfect 2 was a lot more focused on the humor, as opposed to focused on the teamwork and success of the Bellas. I laughed a lot more during this movie then the last movie. They were both really funny. Overall, this movie was really good. and I hope that they make a third installment."
"kianclarence","2","3","4","27 July 2016"," A shadow of the first movie
","The movie in question uses the same plot formula as the first, but executes it worse. I don't necessarily care about the comedy, but everything feels as the same as the first movie. From some random disaster that happens to the Bellas, a new girl coming into the group that ends up helping them, or some ""unexpected way"" to win in some competition. Along with the same direct plot formula, the main antagonist group, Das Sound Machine should have won the main competition, as the Bellas' performance is not even close to comparison. No part of the movie is redeemable from its repetition and generic character, but it's still tolerable to the point that I won't put a 1 star."
"tjgoalie13","7","3","4","22 August 2015"," Funny and Charming
","Pitch Perfect 2 is one of those sequels that isn't quite as good as it's predecessor, but uses the formula to remain entertaining. Much like the first film the cornerstones are the musical pieces and the humor, despite some racism/sexism. A good area of growth was the character development, as many characters are questioning their place on the team, and their futures which is interesting to watch. One problem I did have was with some of the jokes in the film, as they were a little repetitive, and at times too crude. In essence Pitch Perfect 2 is a fun, Glee Inspired, Musical with a few too many crude jokes, and clichés, but remains an entertaining sequel, that will please fans of the original."

","Whilst this is not a crisp or fresh as the original it has managed to maintain its innocence that so few sequels manage to do.<br/><br/>Fat Amy is still insulting people under her breathe, whilst Beca is still toiling with life!<br/><br/>The commentator duo are undoubtedly the stars of this second outing and they manage to keep things moving just when the film starts to drag.<br/><br/>If you liked the original, then you must see this movie as it is a tremendous follow up. If you haven't seen the original (where have you been) this movie is good in its own right and would work without knowledge of the first movie.<br/><br/>Catch up with the Bellas.....and get ready for a third installment!"
"lesleyharris30","8","7","13","3 June 2015"," Dosen't Hit Quite as Many High Notes as the First, but it's a Very Worthy Sequel,
","Pitch Perfect 2 is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It boasts just as much fun and laughs as the first one did, filled with tons of beautiful music from truly gifted singers, the battle between the accapella groups is my favourite part, it is beautifully filmed by Elizabeth Banks who made a superb first impression as a director (we won't count that brutal sketch from Movie 43). It's certainly weaker than the first one, not hugely, but it had a few things missing, giving Anna Camp a significantly smaller role was a huge disappointment for me as she was one of my favourite characters in the first, and the relationship between Beca and Jesse, which is one of the strongest aspects of the first movie, is rarely shown either, they definitely should improve on these two things particularly if they have plans on a third installment. The chemistry between the female cast is once again the highlight of the movie, you can tell they are all friends and enjoy working together, Rebel Wilson brings in the most laughs, and I also have a soft spot for Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow, two very talented and likable actresses. It may not have the same effect that its predecessor did, but Pitch Perfect 2 is a still a worthy sequel that keeps you wanting more, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or music film. <br/><br/>The Bellas enter an international tournament that Americans have never won, and they are faced with some major European rivals. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Anna Kendrick"

","Let me begin by saying; I loved the first Pitch Perfect, it was funny, smart, catchy and touching, as for the second, it's OK. Here's a pros and cons list of the sequel; Pros; Rebel Wilson is always funny, the songs picked for the movie, Hailee Steinfeld was a strong edition to the cast, and of course, Keegan Michael Key. Key from Key & Peele is arguably the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Cons- some offensive jokes that didn't hit the proper notes, I felt that Adam Devine wasn't as strong as he could've been in this one, and this is coming from someone who's a fan. Overall it is very enjoyable, but not as good as the original."
"CleveMan66","7","9","18","15 May 2015"," ""Pitch Perfect 2"" isn't perfect, but its pitch is every bit as good as the original.
","One of the really cool things about movies in the early 21st Century is the increasing diversity – in terms of the characters being written, the actors being hired, the points of view being expressed and the growing variety in the types of movies being made. Take ""Pitch Perfect 2"" (PG-13, 1:55) for example. It tells a story about (of all things) a college singing group, it shows ""nerdy"" characters as basically no different than anyone else – and the movie is a big hit! Would this have happened 10 or 20 years ago? And how about this: The movie is written by a woman (Kay Cannon), directed by another woman (Elizabeth Banks), co-produced by both of those women (and three men) and stars men and women representing different races, nationalities, ethnicities and sexual orientations. Diversity – AND progress! Sure, most of these groups' identities are fodder for humor, but hey, this IS a comedy – and everyone is made fun of equally. None of the jokes are mean-spirited, and you, the audience member, are laughing WITH these different groups even as you're laughing at them – and maybe even laughing at yourself a little. The real question is: are those jokes actually funny – and, is the movie, as a whole, worth seeing? ""Pitch Perfect 2"" picks up three years after its predecessor left off. The freshmen of the college a cappella singing group called the Bellas, at the fictional Barden University, are now seniors, to include aspiring music producer Beca (Anna Kendrick), who is now the Bella's leader, overly-confident Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), low-talking Lilly (Hanna Mae Lee) and the Bellas' one black member, Cynthia (Ester Dean), as well as Beca's boyfriend and male counterpart in the Barden Treblemakers, Jesse (Skylar Astin) and his best friend, the magic-loving and girl-fearing Benji (Ben Platt). Another one of the Bellas, Chloe (Brittany Snow), the one who recruited Beca in the first film, is also a senior – for the fourth year in a row (failing required classes on purpose), because she just can't let go of her involvement with the Bellas. Some of the singers from the previous movie have graduated, but still turn up in this one, including the former Treblemakers' leader, Bumper (Adam DeVine), who briefly worked for John Mayer, but is now a security guard at Barden, and former Bellas' co-leader, Aubrey (Anna Camp), who now runs a nature retreat where businesses send their employees for team-building activities. In addition, the Bellas have added Flo (Chrissie Fit), a hilariously pessimistic immigrant from Guatemala, and they also add a talented song-writing freshman named Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who the Bellas call ""Legacy"" because her mother (Katey Sagal) was a former leader of the Bellas. Returning to comment on the goings-on are Barden employees John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks). That's a lot of names but you gotta have a program, right? So, now that we have the performers straight, what of the performance(s)? Well, like the original, this movie starts with a disastrous show that sends the Bellas reeling. In a Kennedy Center command performance, Fat Amy goes commando, which becomes obvious to all in the audience – including the Obamas – when she has a major wardrobe malfunction while hanging above the stage in a silk swing. The university's embarrassment, and suspicions that Fat Amy exposed herself accidentally-on-purpose, lead to the Bellas being banned from all competitions, except one. As the reigning national champions, they still have to represent the U.S. at the quadrennial World A Cappella Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark. And Barden agrees to reinstate the Bellas if they win. No American group has ever won that title before, but that is just the beginning of the Bellas' challenges. Pursuing her dream of a career in music, Beca has accepted an internship at a record company. This has Beca distracted from producing the arrangements for the event in Denmark and she hasn't yet worked up the courage to tell the other Bellas about what she's doing. Two other Bellas have distractions of their own as they are being romantically pursued by male a cappella singers. All of the Bellas are concerned about the daunting challenge of beating the practically flawless German team, known as ""Das Sound Machine"", led by the arrogant and condescending Pieter (Flula Borg) and Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen), the latter of the two Beca, in particular, finds especially intimidating – and strangely attractive. Worst of all, the Bellas seem to have lost their musical identity. They fumble their way through an underground riff-off organized by the self-proclaimed ""greatest a cappella fan in the world"" (David Cross) and then, performing for a group of senior citizens with a routine that one commentator says is more like a circus act than an a cappella performance. The Bellas go to Aubrey's woodland retreat in an attempt to put aside their distractions, get past their personal issues, rebuild their team and recapture their mojo and their sound, so they can give themselves a fighting chance to win in Denmark, and then move on with their lives. It's a tall order, but the Bellas didn't get to where they are by folding under pressure.<br/><br/>""Pitch Perfect 2"" is a lot of fun, but it isn't perfect. Some of the gags are just awkward, but most are genuinely funny, even as un-PC as they are, and the large number of clever cameos throughout the movie really add to the fun. The musical numbers are enjoyable, though not spectacular, and Banks' direction is a little uneven. But, like its predecessor, this movie is humorous, on target musically and is filled with likable characters who you'll want to see succeed. As with the original, I liked this movie very much, but I can't say that I loved it. Both exemplify a diversity of spirit that is commendable, both are equally worth checking out and, while I'm comparing them, I feel that both films deserve the same grade: ""B+""."
"troyputland","7","6","11","30 May 2015"," The first is better, the second is funnier.
","Pitch Pertect 2 is actress Elizabeth Bank's first crack at directing, and she's settled in to the role very nicely. Her ability to make us laugh comes naturally; Becca (Kendrick) and the other Barden Bellas are on fine, funny form, starting with Fat Amy's (Wilson) blunder in front of the president. The Bellas' embarrassment has brought them back to square one, and the only way they can get back to the top is by winning the world championships. There's nothing much new on offer here; the music and the singing is just as good as the first, the Bardem Bellas and other competing groups bang out contemporary tunes with ease. In this respect it doesn't quite match its predecessor, but that hardly matters when there's so many memorable, amusing moments. Rebel Wilson steals every scene she's in (again), with help from The Treblemaker's Bumper (Adam DeVine). Other characters have little screen time, including Becca's boyfriend Skylar and the nerdy Benji. Some of the Bellas have become an in-joke (they're basically extras) but some solace can be found in newcomer Emily (Steinfeld). Banks reprises her commentating role alongside John Michael Higgins, only to abuse the Bellas and make a bunch of gags. Pitch Perfect 2 maybe not be as aca-perfect as 2013's outing, but it's sure to appease the fans."

They tried to use the same formula as the 1st movie, IMO it didn't work as well 2. None of the musical or singing sequences were particularly memorable 3. The commentary hosts (John Michael Higgins & Elizabeth Banks) were not as funny this time around 4. Anna Kendrick didn't get to perform a memorable solo (I love her voice) and her talents were quite under-utilized<br/><br/>Overall I still enjoyed this movie especially seeing all the girls back together again. It's not as good as the original and IMO the storyline (or lack thereof) plays a big part. If there is a Pitch Perfect 3, I hope they risk it for more originality and dare.

"gianlucamarzano16","7","8","16","17 May 2015"," A good sequel
","When the first Pitch perfect came out, it was a surprise hit. Most of time when there's a sequel to a comedy, it turns out to be very bad. Pitch perfect 2 was not that, it turned out to be a good sequel. It wasn't as great as the first one but they did manage to raise the stacks of acapella and everything. Pitch perfect 2 is about the Berden Bella's entering an international competition, a competition that no American group as ever won. The story is okay it's weak at times but it makes up for its great and funny characters. Everyone from the first movie is back and they add more people like Hailee Steinfeld, Katey Sagal, and much more people. The story is still focuses on Anna Kendrick character(Beca). Her character has a subplot in which she is dealing with what she's what's to do after college, the plot is actually very good and funny but they don't focus much on it. The jokes are very funny and had some laugh out loud moments but at other times they tried to hard on jokes, it turned out bad. Overall Pitch Perfect 2 was good sequel with a weak story that makes up in with its characters and funny moments. If your a fan of the first one, you won't be disappointed."
"condillon","Null","8","16","16 May 2015"," Same Old, Same Old but it most definitely brings in the fun
","Pitch Perfect 2 continues the story of the well known acapella group, The Barden Bellas as of now after a humiliating command performance at Lincoln Center, the Bellas enter an international competition that no American group has ever won in order to regain their status and right to perform. To start off, this was a average sequel with all the same techniques that made the first film so fun and spectacular. It still had all the same humor and music but one thing that bothered me in this is the plot was all over the place because like after the incident that caused them to go to the internationals, midway through the film, no one ever really mentions the incident again and it's like it never happened. There are a few plot holes that make up most parts of the film and are put into the mix as well like they go to a little sing off at a wealthy guys house and they go to a camp to try to find their tune again (yup, that actually happens). One person I really liked in this was Keegan Michael-Key, Anna Kendrick's character takes gets a new job at a music label and he plays the boss of her and wow, he was hilarious in each scene he was in, I wish they showed a lot more of him than they did. Some of the jokes were a bit dry at times but there was surely a lot of witty ones in there, they really did venture in a lot of humor in this because it was like joke after joke after joke which kind of got tiresome at times but I really did laugh at quite a few substantial moments in the film. They really did show quite a great deal on Rebel Wilson's character, she did bring in most of the humor but it also showed her connection with Adam DeVine's character and how they could handle their love for each other but she was really was a crucial part of the film. There was some of the old and some of the new characters in this, like Hailee Steinfeld's character, she did a considerable job in her role and also really was a charming character that you can come to yearn with and they did portray as the new Anna Kendrick with all the capabilities she had. I would say that the script had a few difficulties, like it did bring in some awkward laughs and was a bit rushed at times to move scenes along but a lot of it did work and did bring some heartfelt moments that the film really needed to involve. Elizabeth Banks did a fair job as the director, this is her second film as director, her first stand as director was having a short in the atrocious film, Movie 43. She did a much more of a considerable job in this and didn't fail to Impress. Overall, this was a passable sequel even though the plot had a lot going on at the same time but it still conducted the same terrific music and humor. Besides all the problems I said the film had, I did have a enjoyable time with the film and did share a substantial amount of laughs with it. So if you had such a pleasurable time with the first film, there's no doubt you wouldn't hate this Aca-mazing sequel that shares a similar note!"

Story lines are hopeless, predictable, song choice is lame, more product placement than Jurassic World.<br/><br/>The sub-plot of the recording studio job is pointless, goes nowhere & just ends with the boss saying 'I like your stuff'.

"cactus1305","6","10","22","10 May 2015"," Too Many Exaggerated Moments.
","There are so many ""Why Is This In This Movie!??"" moments in Pitch Perfect 2 that made it much less than it could be for me. I thought that potentially they ran out of things to say/times they could sing, so added in scenes for filler material which kept me wondering throughout, why is this scene in here, how does it add to this movie in the slightest, and what is the point of it at all?<br/><br/>There are some nice themes running through this movie as expected; how scary it is to leave college, how growing up kind of sucks, friendship and bonding and all that jazz. Humour wise, I continued to enjoy Rebel Wilson's quips; I thought she really carried the humour for the most part, but to all the other supposedly humorous parts - well I don't think mocking of racism and sexism is the same as simply perpetuating it. The lines just don't come off in the movie like satire at all, especially the comments at the final showdown about the other teams.<br/><br/>As an offside comment also, if a bunch of girls go to a party and some really creepy guy in a bathrobe opens the door and there is no one else inside the house, that probably means danger and you should probably leave before it turns into a horror slasher movie. <br/><br/>And again perhaps off topic, but did they explain how everyone managed to afford to fly all the way to Copenhagen? Or were we supposed to suspend disbelief with regards to that?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the singing in this movie is fantastic, and those are for the most part thoroughly enjoyable even when one is thinking err, why are they here, singing? And I'm not sure if I'm alone in this but if that German group decided to perform at a club here I would actually buy tickets to that show (which also made the ending kind of annoying for me because I didn't think that schmaltzy performance deserved to win, although OK, what did I expect, and OK, what do I know about judging acapella performances?!).<br/><br/>It was enjoyable, it was entertaining, it just didn't gel like I expected it to or quite live up to the first movie."
"3xHCCH","7","7","14","15 May 2015"," Punch-Packing Pitches
","I was late on the first ""Pitch Perfect"" bandwagon when it was first shown back in 2012 and became a sleeper hit. I did not rate it too highly when I wrote my review about it, giving it only a 6/10. I cited that I did not like the lead character of Beca as played by Anna Kendrick. I thought the singing scenes were hit and miss, with the climactic final number ruined by a pitchy solo by Kendrick. However, with repeated viewings with my kids, I confess that I eventually warmed up to the movie, and the Bellas. The whole family was very excited to watch this sequel the first chance we had.<br/><br/>In Part 2, we see the Barden Bellas on a roll after winning the Nationals three years in a row. However during a fateful command performance in front of the President of the USA at Lincoln Center, Fat Amy had a wild wardrobe malfunction disaster which plunged the Bellas into major shame and competition suspension. In order to redeem themselves, they enlist to join the formidable World Acapella Competitions, which no US team has ever won. This film shows how they try to recover the group harmony they lost, as they face graduation and welcome a talented new Bella in their midst. <br/><br/>Since we all know these girls very well already, it was really great to see them all again. Anna Kendrick's Beca Mitchell is again her dour self, but she is more tolerable now than in the first film. She secretly enters an internship in a recording company in pursuit of her dream to become a record producer. This gave her a chance to interact with a very funny Keegan-Michael Key as her boss. I liked the guesting stint of Snoop Dogg in the scene where Beca got to show her boss her mixing skills. <br/><br/>Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy is wilder than ever, even getting herself a big solo number and an official boyfriend in this one. Brittany Snow's obsessed Chloe is still my personal favorite, deliberately flunking a required subject just to remain a Bella. The rest of the girls, butch Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), sexy Stacie (Alexis Knapp) and mysterious Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), are all still there, though not as much as the first film. We meet a new Bella in the person of Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who has a knack for writing original songs. I was more excited to see ""Married with Children"" Katey Sagal as Emily's mother, but too bad her part was too short.<br/><br/>Their rival boy group the Treblemakers, including Jesse (Skylar Astin) and Benji (Ben Platt), were pretty much in the background only this time. Annoying former Treblemaker leader Bumper (Adam DeVine) returns to Bardem as a security guard, and gets a bigger part here as Fat Amy's love interest. The main antagonist in this film are the ruthless and joyless German team, Das Sound Machine, led by two towering Aryan bullies Pieter Krämer (Flula Borg) and Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen). <br/><br/>Getting much more exposure and more grating and potentially offensive racist and misogynistic remarks are the competition commentator duo of Gail Abernathy-McKadden-Feinberg (Elizabeth Banks) and John Smith (John Michael Higgins). Higgins in particular was really given very sharp and controversial lines to deliver, which could be very funny -- but only if you are not in the demographic he is dissing. <br/><br/>The best singing scenes in this sequel was still the Riff-Off part, just as this was my favorite part in the first film. The mash-ups were seamless and the singing was dope. The first such sing-off with the category of songs about butts was made even more hilarious by the guest appearance of buff and burly football players, the Green Bay Packers, singing ""Bootilicious"" of all songs! You have to see and hear it to believe it. In the international competition at the end, we see Pentatonix representing Canada and Fil-am group Filharmonic representing the Philippines, which were nice surprises.<br/><br/>If you liked the first Pitch Perfect film, I think you will like this one more. I thought the acapella song numbers were much better arranged and executed here than the first. I liked the throwback reference to ""When You're Gone"", the ""Cups Song"" which was a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for Anna Kendrick long after the film had left the cinemas. The original song featured in this one, ""Flashlight,"" is promising potential hit as well. <br/><br/>The story had the right balance of comedy and drama to delight and touch fans, told pretty well by first time director Elizabeth Banks, on triple duty here as producer and star as well. In spite the occasional shallow senseless jokes or race- and gender-insensitive comments, I'd call ""Pitch Perfect 2"" THE feel-good good-time film for this summer of 2015. 7/10."
"invernessmovieclub","7","7","14","11 May 2015"," Another Guilty Pleasure!
","When Pitch Perfect arrived back in 2012, it was considered a reasonable critical and commercial success - $65 million box office from a $17 million budget was nothing for Hollywood execs to be over-thrilled about but profitable enough to be thought of as a win. Then in the years following a combination of DVD rentals, sales and downloads as well as fantastic word of mouth turned Pitch Perfect into a guilty pleasure/cult classic – a chick flick that appeals to both sexes with a feel good factor, quotable dialogue and a soundtrack good enough to sing along to. Fans were crying out for a sequel and therefore in true Hollywood tradition, an encore has now arrived. Whilst Pitch Perfect 2 doesn't quite hit the same heights of the original, it doesn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Set three years later, the Bellas, led by Beca (Anna Kendrick) are at the top of their game. Three time national Champions and now performing in front of the President of the United States. After an ill-fated Miley Cyrus-like act by Fat Amy (Aussie actress Rebel Wilson) causes the whole world to see her private parts, the Bellas are humiliated and banned from performing in the National Championships. Seemingly back at square one, their only road to redemption is to win the World Championships – a tournament that no American a capella group has ever won. Faced against the terrifying but efficient German group Das Sound Machine, the odds are once again stacked against the Bellas and, just like before, they return to being underdogs. <br/><br/>Thankfully there is more plot for the audience to be involved with including Beca's internship at a recording studio as she follows her dream to become a music producer, although it's proving harder than she thought. Fat Amy gets her time in the spotlight in a will she/won't she love story. New character Emily, (Hailee Stanfield) is also a welcome addition as the newest member of the Bellas and contributes immensely as the group bond and are forced to re- discover who they are. <br/><br/>Although Pitch Perfect 2 is more or less a repeat of the first movie, there are plenty laughs to be had throughout and is equally as funny as the original. The majority of the comedy is centred around Kendrick, Wilson and Brittany Snow and, whilst the rest of the group are practically invisible at times, the one-liners are shared out amongst them. The supporting cast are also as reliable and as funny as ever. The inevitable musical climax is good enough for the audience to stand up and cheer in support of the Bellas. <br/><br/>It's a guarantee that Pitch Perfect 2 will be more successful than the original and talk of a three-quel will no doubt arise, however if this is to be the Bella's last performance, it's a worthwhile hit to finish on."

","In my memory, I didn't really enjoy Pitch Perfect and thought they it was way overrated than it is. It has a very predictable plot, unevenly balanced characters and the only thing I like is their acapella. In their sequel, though most people don't like it as much comparing to its predecessor, I enjoyed quite a bit.<br/><br/>First off, though the story is very predictable, there is still some twists and turns where the Bellas struggled, from both internal and external pressure, Beca's future, and so on. Unlike the first one, which goes through rounds of competitions then got the champion at the end. <br/><br/>I thought that the acting is okay, still a bit uneven which some girls in the Bellas have barely said anything and the others are only remembered for their race. There are only Fat Amy, the new girl, Amy and Beca who's under the spotlight. I also think that there are too much Fat Amy in the movie, though I know that it is the laughing stock, in this movie, she seems like the leader. <br/><br/>Other than that, the soundtrack is fabulous and the performances are speechless. I had a wonderful time seeing everyone perform. I personally like the riff off the most; it was tense and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>To sum up, I love the music but thought the movie shouldn't only be about the music, still should still be some deeper character developments. Even though most people might not agree with me, I think Pitch Perfect 2 is slightly better than its predecessor (there's gonna be a lot of hate)."

","I really enjoyed the first Pitch Perfect, the music was all great and it was just a very fun and enjoyable film to watch, so this film did have quite a bit to live up to, and although it may not have quite reached the level of its predecessor it was still a pretty fun film. This movie included everything you would expect Pitch Perfect 2 to include, great songs, aca-exciting music battles, pretty funny humour and all accompanied by a story that you can kinda get behind, so pretty much what you saw in the first film. And being similar to the first film kinda hurt the film a little bit but it also ensured that we got what we wanted from this sequel whilst also giving us some new additions. The songs in this film really are fun and great to sing along to but i do prefer the songs in the first film just a little more, maybe because i've heard them a lot since first seeing the film. Some song choices were..... interesting, but i understand they needed some variety in there. And a lot of that variety came from the German additions to the film who from the first moment you can tell are an A Capella powerhouse, unfortunately they didn't really factor in to the plot as much as i would have liked, instead they are more just there to perform and leave. And those big performances really are the highlight of the film just as they were in the original, not much changed in the setup from the first one with the always hilarious judges finding a way to make an appearance, but they really are the big wow moments. <br/><br/>The humour in this film worked almost just as well as the first film but i felt that quite a bit of it was slightly recycled, still focusing on the stereotypes introduced in the first film. Some was new and got me laughing but some was obviously rehashing what was already done. The low point of the film had to be the overall plot, it had the same problems the first one had, i again found myself not quite enjoying some parts then mack to enjoying it and then not enjoying it a little, it was just a tad inconsistent. Some of the subplots i felt were just thrown in there to bring back characters from the first film, but they did factor in to the plot sometimes so that was OK. <br/><br/>But in the end this is a musical, and the reason why i wanted to see this film and you want to see this film is for the music (and Anna Kendrick) and the music is aca-awesome and will make for a great soundtrack. - 7"

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>The a cappella group Barden Bellas fall from grace after a humiliating performance at the Lincoln Centre. As a result they are disqualified from participating in collegiate competitions. Now they must redeem themselves and regain their right to perform by winning the international a cappella competition. Pitch Perfect 2 like the first film brings back a lot of the colourful characters with great comedic chemistry. The sequel remains formulaic, story structure is practically the same as the first. Nevertheless, the movie delivers in the humour and the characters are so likable that you have fun with their antics. This is a worthy sequel for the fans and they will be thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>It took me a while to watch the first Pitch Perfect because admittedly I scoffed it off as some singing version of Step-Up. Afterwards due to all the good buzz and word-of-mouth I eventually gave it a shot and ended up really liking it. So I was looking forward to Pitch Perfect 2.<br/><br/>The great thing about the movie is the cast, mainly the chemistry between Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and Brittany Snow. Of course everyone has their funny moments but it is these three that are carrying the movie forward. Each of them have their own story arcs that led to some hilarious moments. For instance Anna Kendrick's character Beca is interning at a music studio run by one of my favourite comedians Keegan-Michael Key. His commitment to the role of a big time egotistical producer was hysterical. Rebel Wilson has a very unconventional love story in this film, which perfectly suits her sense of humour. Wilson was on fire with joke after joke, all of them had me laughing out loud or at the very least made me chuckle. The rest of the cast all have their unique funny quirks that could've gotten annoying if overused. Luckily that situation was prevented with a well- balanced use of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>What prevents Pitch Perfect 2 from being exceptional is that it has the same story structure of the first movie: embarrassing moment, risk of never being taken seriously, bad major performance, team building moment, and then the final competition. This is not a spoiler, you will realize this formula from numerous other competition driven plots. It doesn't ruin the movie but I would have liked to have seen the characters progress beyond their lives in college. They do attempt that with Kendrick's story arc but in the end it's rather inconsequential. Also there are segments in the middle that feel repetitious in conveying that the team isn't functioning as well as it used. So there were moments in the movie that could've been cut out to make it more concise.<br/><br/>It is easy to dismiss Pitch Perfect 2 as some random generic chick flick (I am pointing at you macho man who thinks this franchise is a waste of time). I even convinced two of my friends to check out the first film before going into watch Pitch Perfect 2. Sure we felt a little out of place as three guys in a cinema largely filled with a female audience, but we had a really good time. If you are fan of the first one, this is obviously a must-watch and deservedly so. However, if you aren't a fan then this movie will not convert you into one because it is more of the same.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"subxerogravity","7","6","12","17 May 2015"," The singing dancing and laughter was a great combo for this flick.
","Very funny movie. <br/><br/>Rebel Wilson was the funniest of all the crew, she takes center stage with the laughs while the rest of the group act as straight men. Kind of like they were all Dean Martian to Wilson's Jerry Lewis, (meaning Anna Kendrick's main role in the film was to have a plot line and sing, for you who don't get the Martian and Lewis reference).<br/><br/>Wilson gave the biggest and best laughs with Elisabeth banks coming in second with her banter as a commentator (no surprise, as she was the director), But everyone got a laugh that was noteworthy, which means the movie was non-stop laughs. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of musicals, but I like this one as much as I like the original. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that both movies are not just about singing but a signing competition, this time with the girls are going past other colleges and competing against the world in a rockapella face off. Most of the comedy comes from them preparing for this competition. <br/><br/>It's brilliant and it's a sequel you don't need to see the first to follow. Rare in this era of franchises that it stands alone.<br/><br/>Thumbs way up."

","Pitch Perfect 2 is racist, homophobic, fat-phobic trash - but you won't hear that from the reviews. Pitch Perfect 2 opened yesterday with 36 million dollars, and counting, effectively kicking Mad Max out of its number one spot. It currently holds a 68% vote on Rotten Tomatoes, a 66% on Metacritic, and a 7.4/10 in IMDb. <br/><br/>Quick Google searches about the reviews only highlight the cheesy jokes, how much better the first one was because it was ""fresh"" and ""no one ever asked for a second one"", but barely no one mentions (except a few sources) just how gross some of these jokes are. Below, some excerpts about the ""funny"" jokes, and how Pitch Perfect 2 really is a mess instead of the feminist masterpiece people hold it out to be.<br/><br/>On Fat Amy: Additionally, Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy's humor stems completely from her being overweight and buffoonish. I doubt making the obese girl the class clown is really the way to breakdown body biases.<br/><br/>Fat Amy's weight is still — still! — offered up for laughs; when she finally gets a big, romantic kiss, she and the lucky guy basically lick each other from ear to ear. Sure, it's a comedy and it's only a joke, but would a movie-ending kiss between Anna Kendrick and Skylar Astin look like that?<br/><br/>On the new Guatemalan character: For example, we're expected to find it hilarious that people south of the border might get diarrhea because of the poor water quality! Another new group member, a Guatemalan immigrant, is a transparent equal opportunity excuse to tell those indolent jokes, and given nothing to do beyond simply being in the frame.<br/><br/>Our commentators, Banks and John Michael Higgins, aren't supposed to be paragons of political correctness, but unfortunately the world competition gives them the platform to crack bigoted one-liners about people from all over the globe that are all about as mediocre as hoping a Latina girl should ""backflip right over the fence into Mexico.""<br/><br/>On the girls: What's baffling here for a film directed by a woman, Elizabeth Banks, and written by a woman (Cannon), is that each female character is reduced to a single stereotype. The Asian girl speaks very quietly. The black, semi-butch lesbian can hardly control her sexual urges. As for the Guatemalan lass, she sees her future as being deported after she graduates and then drowning when she tries to smuggle herself back on a boat. Told in a deadpan manner, this is supposed to be very funny"

","Pitch Perfect 2 is a sequel about a female collegiate a capella singing group, the Barden Bellas. They became national champions in the first movie and are now 3-time winners. While performing for the President, an epic fail occurs that embarrasses the college and the a capella association. As punishment, the Bellas are banned from competition and have their club suspended at the school. Additionally, their national tour is taken away and given to a foreign troop who become their nemesis. The only way to fix their reputation is to win an international a capella contest that pits them against the foreigners.<br/><br/>Almost all of the characters from the 1st movie are back. Even though some have graduated, their roles in the movie are explained, and work quite well. The familiar riff-off is the highlight of the movie, for me, with the Green Bay Packers doing a surprisingly good job doing ""Booty-licious"". Bonus cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg was a treat. A lot of songs were mashed together throughout the movie, but the most familiar ones were in the riff-off. The stories were good, The conflicts were good. The singing was good. The song choices are going to have to grow on me. I know I will go to see this movie again and may appreciate the plethora of songs more on the second viewing. The ""Cups"" song was reprised and done even better than the first time. A bonus scene during the credits is worth hanging around to watch. It includes cameo guest appearances by very familiar artists. I liked it, didn't love it."

","""Pitch Perfect"" is arguably the most overrated film franchise in the history of cinema. The films pander to teen girl demographics with auto-tuned ""hip"" pop songs, ""funny"" and ""edgy"" jokes, and an overall reliance on the fact that these films are given a pass by critics because ""films for teens shouldn't be good"", which makes this darned turd look better than it actually is.<br/><br/>There is NOTHING redeeming about the second film in this franchise. At least the first film had ONE decent line, which was ""I ate my twin in the womb."". All the songs are terrible. The singing is terrible. The humor is phoned-in. The writing makes me cringe.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","3","5","3 April 2016"," Uninspired and repetitive
","It only took 3 years until they came up with a sequel to the first ""Pitch Perfect"" movie. Let me start this review here by saying that I did not like the first film and I thought it was like 2.5 weaker Glee episodes added together. So I was very much surprised to see how well it was received. And I was even more surprised to see another director in charge here, namely actress Elizabeth Banks. I guess they even wanted to go with the entire girl power thingey also behind the camera. Unsurprisingly, this sequel got worse reception than the original, but still mostly positive. And also unsurprisingly, I also believe this film here does not deserve any of its praise. Banks' direction and Steinfeld's addition made me curious enough to give it a go, but I was disappointed again.<br/><br/>Let's start with the plot here. The Steinfeld story is basically a recycled version of Kendrick's story in the first film. And then they included some struggles about the direction the band is taking and some struggles between Kendrick's character and the other band members. At the beginning, the band really messes up, but predictably it all works out really well at the end again with their outdoor performance in Denmark in front of a huge crowd. The story is really really generic here and not creative at all. I don't think you can blame screenwriter Kay Cannon here. It's mostly Mickey Rapkin's fault because he delivered weak base material here.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film could have been kept a lot more essential and that way it would have run for 100 minutes max and that would have been fine. I personally believe that this was a missed opportunity here. The weak script lets talented actresses like Anna Kendrick and especially Hailee Steinfeld not show us the talent they possess. On a more negative note about the actresses, people need to stop trying to make Rebel Wilson happen. She is not funny and this has nothing to do with her physics. Actually she is the one whose approach to comedy is every single time entirely based on her clumsy chubby appearance and it gets repetitive so quickly. As a whole, this film was equally disappointing as the first, if not more. Still, in order to end the review on a more positive note, the singing performances and songs in here were fun to listen to I think. Some really catchy tunes and the ending with ""Flashlight"" was a thing of beauty. But it cannot make up for everything that went wrong before that. I do not recommend ""Pitch Perfect 2"". Thumbs down."
"Matflix","Null","8","20","25 June 2015"," Nothing to sing about.
","I'd like to think I give each movie a fair shot. I don't pay for a movie ticket to exercise some vindictive buzz against the Hollywood industry. Although, I've certainly been the victim of over-hype, but who hasn't? So, perhaps the better approach is to go to the theatre with indifference, a shroud of mystery that blinds any destructively high expectations and conceals any plaguing doubts. I was fortunate to have no such trouble while watching Pitch Perfect 2, expecting nothing more than a functional story that adds something to the first film. So what could go wrong? Well, I suppose the 4/10 speaks for itself doesn't it?<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 continues the hijinks of the Barden Bellas, a motley crew of acapella singers, roughly where the first film left off, on their aca-train to aca-success (And trust me, you don't have to see either movies to know how obnoxious that prefix can get). The sequel presents an interesting challenge for the Bellas: an international competition, which is exactly what I mean by adding 'something' to the first; taking things one step further, thus validating the continuation of the series. What's odd though is that as done to death as this plot line is, in a film series high on using every convenient plot device in the book, even that never reaches any development. 'Das Sound Machine', the Bella's foremost international opponents, the obvious antagonists, make it clear that they will be squaring off against them in the competition, yet after the first half of the movie, they never reappear. This group represents perfectionist harmonics that outdo the rest of the competition, yet this challenge never returns for the third act to test the Bellas' crumbling dynamic, the central 'conflict' of the film. <br/><br/>This is the first of several dead-end plot lines, either contributing little to the central storyline or going absolutely nowhere. Benji and Emily's romance, for example, takes four conflict-less scenes before they spontaneously decide they're head over heels for each other. How about Beca's new job? A possible detour from the Bellas and thus a compromise of time. That could be worth checking into, but no, she's actually pretty organized with her time and the ordeal has no lasting impact on her whatsoever. How about Fat Amy's romance with Bumper? Ummm, okay. I guess that could be interesting, if only it lasted more than three consequence-less scenes. Perhaps Emily's mom can bring some drama to the table. She is, after all, very intent on Emily being a Bella, which could lead to some crushing pressure on Emily's performance - you know what I'm going to say <br/><br/>The point is, this film has so many points, that ironically, it has no point at all. The film forgets to add any real drama to the mix and, to make a music analogy, it's like an entire choir competing for the same money note, resulting in a loud, unharmonious mess. I'm not going to say the first film was anything special, but at least it had a sense of what to focus on. This one jumbles so many undeveloped stories that it's hard to decide which one to care the least about.<br/><br/>It's like when you have a cool idea, but forget to write it down and then it fades away into your subconscious. That's really the best way to describe this movie, as a missed opportunity for something at least mediocrely entertaining. I'll admit a few moments got a chuckle, but really for no other reason than ""Oh hey, it's that joke they used in the first movie, only somehow more insensitive. What fun!"" For a franchise that seems so nostalgic for The Breakfast Club, it would have been nice to see the film take to heart how John Hughes took stereotypes and shaped them into three-dimensional characters, rather than racy punchlines. If you go to this movie for the cheap laughs and the soundtrack, you won't be disappointed, but if you're expecting any development in story or character, I'd suggest waiting till it comes to aca-Netflix.<br/><br/>Here's hoping I never have to use that prefix again."

","I don't know where to begin to describe how great this movie was. Second parts are usually just a shadow of the original, this one however took everything that was good in the first movie and made it better while leaving behind the not-so-good stuff (like the very USAish appeal to the grotesque like the vomiting scenes and such) The two obese women are still present but not in a way that disrupts the otherwise pleasant aesthetics of the film.<br/><br/>Music performances dominate most of the screen time and they're truly a joy to watch, not only those of the Bellas but all the other groups as well, especially ""Das Sound Machine"", their German antagonists. It's not a comedy with a touch of music, it's a musical masterpiece.
The humor is another strong point, it should be a given for a comedy yet I hadn't watched a comedy that was genuinely funny in a long time. And the commentators deserve a special mention, they were already funny in the first movie but here they're on a whole new level.<br/><br/>The movie advances at a beautifully smooth pacing, swinging between performances and all the subplots in a way that keeps you hooked up not wanting for it to ever end.
This is by far the best musical I've watched to this day. I'm not a huge fan of musicals but this one is different, I love the fact of having a lot of music in a movie in a way that is coherent to the real world instead of the somewhat cringy trope of having the characters spontaneously sing their emotions as if it was a totally normal thing to do.<br/><br/>But whether you like musicals or not, please give this movie a try, you'll be glad you did. It has such an upbeat feeling to it that you'll be a happier person after you watch this."

Other ladies are sweet and attractive, too. Well, that's it. As for the movie - million times you've seen this endless saga of past success-turned-fiasco-turned-newbie-turned- growing pains-turned-long way to the top-turned-in the end everything's gonna be alright. You will see nothing new here. What is really awful ( and I mean this - really really poor) is this absolutely low-level racial-cultural stereotyping of the worst kind. I was shocked and saw in utter amazement those shameful caricatures of certain peoples. Silly, in the weakest manner said. The rest is just a forgettable, passable, liquid junk of silliest kind.

"zkonedog","6","1","1","28 February 2017"," More Entertaining Than The First After Embracing Its Humor
","When I watched the original ""Pitch Perfect"" a number of years ago, I was disappointed in an experience that I felt wasn't sure of itself. That movie struggled to figure out whether to be grounded in semi-serious character development or fully embrace the comedy. In this sequel, however, they choose to fully embrace the comedy, and at least for me that was a decision that led to more entertaining experience.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" sees a return of the Borden Bellas...but only until they make themselves a national embarrassment after some ""exposure"" from Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Now, with the program about to be put on academic probation, it begins to fracture from within. Beca (Anna Kendrick) is spending just as much time on her own music career, while the routines just don't seem to be coming together like they used to. It takes freshman newcomer Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) to rally the troops and compete in the seemingly unwinnable ""Worlds"" competition featuring the dominant German squad.<br/><br/>Even though I am nowhere near the target audience of this movie (30 year-old male), I found this one to be a pretty entertaining experience because of its willingness to embrace its own silly humor throughout. Instead of trying to ground this movie in any sense of reality, it goes all-out for the jokes and music and I think it fits the style of director Elizabeth Banks better. Once you think of it as a pure comedy, it makes it a lot easier to get through.<br/><br/>Another great addition to the franchise was the Steinfeldt character, who breathes some new life and youthful exuberance into all proceedings. Without the new perspective given by her character, this could have been a pretty large repeat of the original. Steinfeldt can sing and act with equal measure (and both at a very high level), and is set up perfectly to be the star of subsequent sequels should Kendrick tire of the mantle.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" was more fun for me than the original. It doesn't try to sell itself as anything other than a comedy, the songs are catchy and fun (as usual), and the Steinfeld performance is mesmerizing. This genre will never be my favorite, but it didn't struggle to finish this film like I did the first one."

Seriously I couldn't believe what I was seeing because it was quite a step down from the first one, which I still like.<br/><br/>I find a few things to like in the movie, Anna Kendrick's storyline was quite interesting, it was actually one of the few that showed some sort of evolution of her character. The others were basically a spoof version of themselves - that's saying a lot because Pitch Perfect 2 is a comedy after all. The music was catchy, really OK for the most part, and the battle scene was arguably the best one in the movie, more so than the finale performance.

","Let me start this off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Pitch Perfect. The film is quirky, funny and has a great selection is music (I mean that remix of ""I would walk 500 miles""? Classic!). I loved the homage to the Breakfast Club, one of my all-time favourite films. Plus, it had a great story to tell about friendship and how being different is a good thing. I laughed so much when I saw for the first time and I actually had goosebumps during the final performances. Alas, none of that magic happened in Pitch Perfect 2. <br/><br/>The film is over the top, lackluster and horribly racist at times. Cringeworthy is an understatement. First of all, the story is all over the place. The Bellas have been the reigning champions for the past three years, but things go downhill quite quickly after an 'indecent exposure' and they must 'find their sound' again. Good premise, except that everything has to be funny and over the top. For example, Beca's internship at a record company. Great story line, but why add Snoop Dogg to the mix? And the whole Christmas album was an obvious rip- off of Pentatonix' success with their 2014 Christmas album! Same goes for the riff-off scene. Extremely awkward premise and why add the Packers? Amy and Bumper's romance was cute, but why do they have to lick each other's face instead of having a normal, romantic kiss? Just because it's the sequel doesn't mean that everything has to be twice as big and bold. Keep it simple. <br/><br/>Second of all, the humour is either not funny or horribly racist. The whole Flo character should have been cut - she doesn't add to the assemble and after the seventh immigrant joke I just wanted to hurl my popcorn at the screen. Plus, John Michael Higgins' character went way too far too many times with his commentary. Sexism is not that funny and Elizabeth Banks' character should have punched him the face - that would have been funny! <br/><br/>Then there is the music. I played the first soundtrack over and over again, but this time around I can't really be bothered. In the end I rooted for the Germans, just because DSM had the best songs and solid performances. The Bellas didn't wow me at all. I just didn't like the original song, 'you're my flashlight to get me through the night'? Nope. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film were the performances of the real a capella groups like Pentatonix during the World Championships. Unfortunately this scene was way too short to make up for the entire film. <br/><br/>So all in all, I'm really disappointed in this film. I hoped it would be better than this, because this is mostly a film for the fans. Because of its box office success I suspect there will be a PP3, maybe with the 'legacy' Emily at the helm (since everyone is graduating)? Or maybe they will come together at the reunion, Tone Hangers style. I for one, will not be watching."

There is nothing clever in the writing or the characters placed on the screen for us to witness. I cannot believe that any acting professional would want to be affiliated with this loser of a movie. It may be career stopping inanity for some of the actors here. Product placement is very visible. Any producer who was satisfied with the dailies and approved them for inclusion in to this bomb should find a new line of work. Don't waste your time with this monstrous and offensive follow up movie. It is that bad."

","All in all, I am truly disappointed by this movie. Loving the first movie, i saw this one and the second movie follows the same plot line. ( SPOILER ALERT!!!!) It starts with a new person joining the Bellas who wants to save the group being that no one seems to like their acts anymore. There's a different group who is better but the Bellas don't change their ways. The have a riff off in which they lose to the better group. But, ( of course) they change their ways in the biggest competition in which they beat the other group and the new Bella shows her talent. I'm disappointed that they didn't even change anything, its as if they didn't give any thought to this movie. :("

","Pitch Perfect 2 was a satisfactory sequel. The acting was fine for the slightly exaggerated roles each actress was assigned; however, the singing and performances were great, nothing less than expected from stars like Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, and Elizabeth Banks. The new girl Emily, played by Hailee Steinfield, was a breath of fresh air in the group of experienced collegiate acapella singers. Her original songwriting and generally awkward and innocent nature was a stark contrast to Beca (Anna Kendrick) who is generally angsty, outspoken, and witty. The jokes and digs and romance made its way onto the screen and was perceived to be all comedy; not a single line that the audience in the movie theater was meant to be really taken seriously, or if it was, the severity of the situation or dilemma was often broken by an awkward moment or by the hilarious character of Fat Amy/ Fat Patricia (Rebel Wilson). I'd rate it a seven out of ten because while although directed by a great actress and director and producer, it was too predictable that the Barden Bellas from America would win the International Acapella title because they went back to their old songs after sitting around a campfire bonding with their old leader, Aubrey (Anna Camp)."

They turned her into an awkward dork...lol Becca is a cool girl!!! Second...the lay out of the events was a little misconstrued to me...they could of played it out smarter...I did enjoy the focus on Fat Amy, but we could of had some focus on the other Bella's too, just for character development reasons...I feel they threw in a bit of fluff here and there and I could have done without it...<br/><br/>I was bored at times, and I should never be bored with my girls! On a positive note, the singing was phenomenal...The New Bella is adorable, and Benji became a man...no more skinny baby face boy...he buffed up...he is still awkward and magically inclined..but i found him even more adorable...and Amy and Bumper..just LOL..we all knew that was coming....All and All..worth a watch or 2....Just for that fabulous ending that had me in tears!

Seemed to be more about Fat Amy which I didn't mind because as we all know she is pure comedy ! I loved the end part that was a good touch with the performance I wasn't expecting that. a new Bella as well maybe in a few years another movie will be out and she will be the main actor ?? who knows. the singing in this movie is fantastic just need to mime in time , felt the making of the film was kinder rushed and some parts you say to yourself WHY IS THIS HAPPENING OR WHY IS THIS PART BEEN PUT IN. overall it was entertaining just didn't live up to the first movie"

","First, I want to say that I have never been more excited about a sequel than I was about Pitch Perfect 2. That being said, what a Big let down!! Definition of a cappella- music that is specifically group or solo singing without instrumental accompaniment. So why were all the vocals completely drowned out by background music? Another BIG question: Why wasn't Utkarsh Ambudkar in the sequel??? He played one of the most entertaining characters from the first movie. The creators took everything that was charming, funny and just plain great from the original movie and tried to do it again. The Problem: Not funny, at all."

","Beca (Anna Kendrick) and the rest of the Bellas, an acapella college troupe, are still singing up a storm. A new frosh, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) begs her way into the group as well, with her lovely voice. But, Beca has some secrets. As a senior, she has to plan for her future and takes a clandestine internship for a major recording company. Also, Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is being courted by a member of a male vocal group but doesn't give any indication that she is smitten with the gentleman. Then, horror arrives! The Bellas are kicked out of a national competition on a technicality. Their only chance at redemption is to win an INTERNATIONAL battle of singing, in Denmark. Their competition is very good, especially a German ensemble who has been touring the States. To help prepare, the gals go to a spa-type camp for meditation and focus. Will these Bellas regain their crowns? This is a sometimes silly flick, but the singing is tremendous while the gals are funny entertainers. Kendrick is extremely talented but she is getting a bit too old to play a college gal. Steinfeld will take over the star spot nicely in any sequels. Naturally, the costumes, sets, and photography are quite eye-catching. If you loved Pitch Perfect One, there is no reason you won't enjoy this sequel. Other viewers, who didn't catch the first round, will still laugh and cheer over this one, too. Just don't expect a perfect movie and you should be nicely entertained for a couple of hours."
"erichedlund1","3","15","51","23 May 2015"," Ridiculously boring
","I'm sorry, but this movie sucked. The first one was nothing special but this was a drag. The reviews were average to good on meta critic and rotten tomatoes but they were wrong. This movie is really predictable. Once you see the setup to the scene you can basically figure out the whole scene. The characters were more annoying and the plot was presented in an unfunny scene. The only source of comedy was racism and low brow humor. They just reused fat jokes. The new cast member was annoying and no one really developed as a character. The movie tried too hard to be funny and it failed to be funny. I was bored for that movie. The problem was resolved because they're the protagonists even though the Bella's weren't good enough. The rest of the people in the theater were young Tweens and they were the only ones laughing and enjoying it. I'm only 15 and I didn't enjoy it. Most of my gal friends thought it was hilarious but I don't see how. It's good if you're a tween. I'm sorry if you disagree but this movie could've been so much more"
"Irishchatter","3","13","44","29 May 2015"," This will not be remembered as the first movie will...
","To be perfectly honest with you, I think this film has missed a few things I would consider in changing.<br/><br/>Rebel Wilson's character: I love Rebel Wilson but this time, her ongoing jokes were getting way too boring as we have heard it all in the first Pitch Perfect movie. I felt it was always the same and didn't add her character more personality. However I really thought her singing was good though!<br/><br/>Emily and Benji's kiss: I think it was a little too fast for both characters to kiss in the middle of the movie. The reason is because I would've rather left it at the near end and of course, since Benji fell for her first, he should be the one to have given her that moment! <br/><br/>The ending: Why on earth were they electing Emily as the new member of the Bellas already? I mean, that scene should've really have been at the very beginning when she first met the group at the house. For god sakes like, she already joined the Bellas since the very beginning. Whoever organised the scenes should've done a better job then that like it's not well done really!<br/><br/>The first Pitch Perfect was better than this!"

","Pitch Perfect 2 surprised me. I was surprised how lacklustre I found this film was in comparison to its predecessor, and I was surprised just how disappointed I was that this was the case. Pitch Perfect hit me like a tonne of bricks, and despite my outspoken initial apprehension I was quickly charmed by the all-girl capella group The Bellas and was rooting for them on every step of their journey. I was left with egg on my face – my apprehension couldn't have been less warranted. The performances were funny, believable and the song renditions were catchy. It was so much fun.<br/><br/>Fast forwarded three years and the Bellas are in deep trouble after a disastrous performance to President Obama. Their only chance of reinstating the Bellas' legitimacy and reputation is to win the World championships. A simple enough premise, yet one which feels far too similar its precursor. Unfortunately, rival capella group The Treblemakers have a drastically reduced role in this film, with their role antagonist role replaced by German group Das Sound Machine who simply aren't as engaging. The group's leaders are written to be such cold individuals there's little time for laughing in their company. This is part of the problem. The self-aware tone of the first film is lost here, Das Sound Machine are written and played so orthodoxly it begs to return to the far less earnest tone of the first film. Sadly, the only two consistently funny characters are two capella commentators played by John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks. <br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the choices of song renditions in the film. The wide range of recognisable hits are genuinely performed as energetically as in its predecessor but when performed by characters who repeatedly struggle to land their jokes their company because tiresome."

"kieranbattams","7","5","14","20 May 2015"," Aca-fun time!
","Yes i used the cliché of giving this film an aca-pun in my summary.. But who can resist it? When i first saw Pitch Perfect i didn't think it was great and i didn't laugh all that much, saw it again and enjoyed it a lot more! I was actually kind of looking forward to this film and no it is not as good as the first, but i still had a lot of fun with it. The Barden Bellas all return in this sequel to the surprise hit and for the most part don't disappoint.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 starts out fairly similar to the first film, the Barden Bellas however are now better than ever and at the top of their game. After a humiliating wardrobe mishap from Fat Amy in front of the president of the United States though (Barack and Michelle Obama appear in what is probably reused footage) the Bellas must refind their sound and compete in the aca-pella world finals to keep the Barden Bellas together. I had a few more problems with this film than i did with the first film, thats not to say it is a bad film, but sometimes it is a bit clear that Elizabeth Banks didn't really know what direction she wanted to take it in. We have the initial plot, yet it doesn't really kick in until probably an hour into the film as a lot of it is either focused on Beca (Anna Kendrick) working for a job internship, which was funny and all and had good moments to it including a great cameo from Snoop Dogg, but it never really played into the film all that much. Then we had the bizarre romance story between Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy and Bumper, which is fine but sometimes took us away from the plot.<br/><br/>That being said, what we are really here for is the aca-pella and it was absolutely awesome! Skylar Astin returns and his groups aca-pella performance at the beginning was great but he sort of disappears halfway through and i wanted to see more of him singing. One scene in particular though i really did enjoy. We got a 5-way aca-pella battle including the Barden Bellas and it really was great to hear these different sounds combined. I really enjoyed the aca-pella from Das Sound Machine, and was even more surprised to see that the hilarious Flula, known for his bizarre song covers on youtube, was in the group. The last songs at the aca-pella finals from both Das Sound Machine and the Barden Bellas were also very good and had me smiling throughout.<br/><br/>So whilst the humour doesn't always fit, like some jokes do fall flat and the Asian girl was just weird in an uncomfortable way. And whilst i feel the film went on a little too long, the bootcamp scenes should have come a lot sooner and the whole story with the new member of the Bellas was completely unneeded. I still feel that when the humour hits it really hits (feel kind of bad for finding the commentators racist humour so funny). The performances were once again great and the songs were incredible. I would say fans of the original will love this and even if you didn't love the first and merely liked it you will still have fun with this film. I'll be singing these songs for days and suspect if you see it then you will too!"
"katarinamandic3","6","3","7","23 June 2015"," Disappointing
","I probably had high expectations from this sequel since I am highly disappointed by it. The movie is OK, but it lacks originality and forces some jokes that aren't even funny. For example, the character of Florencia, a senior student from Guatemala, is Barden Bella version of Sophia Vergara, only with bad jokes. Didn't laugh once. It also lacks romance. I feel like they put romantic story line between Emily and Benji just because, it's not even developed that much, and I miss more of Becca and Jesse, they literally kissed just once and that's it. I expected to see more of them in this sequel. Also, I read that they are planning to make PP3, which I think is really too much. The girls are finishing their colleges and are going to graduate, which means that Barden Bellas are over. I literally have no idea what the third part will be about, maybe Becca will tutor the next generations of Bella's, but I'm kind of skeptical about it. However, I really like songs and the finale of the film (even more than of the prequel). It gave me chills and it was really beautiful. All in all, the movie is nothing special, but it's watchable."

Unwilling to accept defeat, the Bellas seek out their only shot at redemption: enter and try to win the world a cappella championship. Despite a slew of returning characters, this is fairly monotonous up until the finale; tries to make up for a lack of lively musical numbers or interesting plot twists with an excess of crass humor and politically incorrect jokes, but that can only carry this so far.

","Crafting a follow-up to a surprise hit as beloved as ""Pitch Perfect"" represents a significant creative challenge, one that returning-star-turned-director Elizabeth Banks manages to tackle with aplomb. By shifting the focus away from the acapella challenges and onto the various dynamics among the film's characters, Bank successfully manages to keep the narrative moving forward and gives more leeway for the first film's established crowd-pleasers like Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy to take center stage. It's not as good as the first but it has its own charms, and ultimately it's pretty much a best-case scenario for a mainstream comedy sequel."

","By far, this is the weakest of the trilogy. The German opponents are silly, cartoonish and not even that good (unlike the villains in PP3--what great rendition of Zombie). The attempt to inject new blood and get younger flops miserably. Hailey Steinfeld is not up to the task in charisma, acting ability or singing ability. The supposedly great finale with Flashlight is actually kind of tepid because of Flashlight's arrangement. (Yes, it's a great song--just not as done here, with a limp performance that echoes the early PP1 scenes that showed why the pre-Kendrick Bellas were deemed to be so bad.) Every moment with Steinfeld on screen reminded me how many better performers were available. The rationales for the international competition are silly--the concept that Fat Amy is doing acrobatics is absurd.<br/><br/>In other words, there is no shortage of flaws here--yet, for all of that, it is still a fair bit of fun.

","'Pitch Perfect 2' (rare in the fact that it doesn't have a sub-title!) is a decent sequel to the surprise 2012 hit comedy about a university a capella group. This film is obviously aimed at females and is going after a younger audience, introducing 18-year-old Emily (Steinfeld) into the mix now - probably to allow a third film in the series. However, these don't make it a bad film - still plenty of enjoyable moments throughout.<br/><br/>There's probably less of a focus on the singing this time round, because - let's face it - a capella isn't really that exciting and can get old pretty quick. Especially with some of the rival teams - ""Das Sound Machine"" - and some of the terrible song choices (depending on your point-of-view, obviously). This is usually a good thing, as it gives Amy (Wilson) a chance to drop more quick-witted remarks and have more awkwardness with Bumper (DeVine) and even Becca (Kendrick) has some funny moments with her new boss (Keegan-Michael Key). But the best bits are still between the commentators - Elizabeth Banks (also her first time directing) & John Michael Higgins - plenty of hilarious lines and inappropriate comments. <br/><br/>It's a little too long (almost two hours), has a few redundant scenes and is very predictable, but you're going to get what you expect - lots of laughs, some young-adult-what-does-the-future-hold musing and plenty of extras in a Louisiana field pretending it's a Danish festival!

","The sequel disappointed and missed the reason why the first one was so likable. <br/><br/>I loved the first one! It was a refreshing musical (sort of) comedy with great characters, an interesting plot and an easy flow. The problem I have with the sequel is that it tried so hard to focus on every character and how they had developed over their college years, AND include new characters which fell flat (Hailee Steinfeld aka Emily). For one, Beca's story arc was that she was planning her future and that didn't exactly involve singing acapella for the rest of her life (unlike Brittany Snow aka Chloe). This really clashed with the main conflict of the film - redeeming their title and winning the main contest. If The main character feels indifferent to the main goal and the actions needed to be taken to achieve that goal, then the audience doesn't have much to root for and look forward to. Yes, Beca didn't like acapella in the first film as well, at First! But as the story progressed, so did her interest in acapella, her character development (from being judgmental towards the girls to becoming caring and loving, and the relationship with Jesse. The sequel just shows that it has become more of a habit than an actual pleasure, and Jesse is almost no where to be found! While we're on the main character, please just stick to the one instead of showcasing the life and struggles of every other. For example, it was unnecessary to follow Emily and her mom, as well as the relationship between Fat Amy and Bumper. Had they'd been toned down or just mentioned instead of showed for a lengthy few minutes it would've been far better.<br/><br/>In spite all criticism, I do have to say that it was genuinely funny. The comedic part of this film did not disappoint whatsoever. Das Sound Machine were also interesting to watch, so props to that too.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe this movie cannot compare to its prequel and I'm not sure what to expect from the third to follow, but I don't think I'll be buying a ticket to the cinema."

The internal conflicts and issues the cast faced were artificial, shallow and just plain silly. They couldn't figure out what they were doing and who they fancied and the audience couldn't care less.The opposition was also very unimpressive and not funny. A German group who were quite frankly terrible on their own. The first movie showed great covers of classics but this one showed terrible covers of mostly terrible songs. Sadly they have made yet another movie which could possibly be worse than this one."
"MaximumMadness","8","0","0","23 December 2016"," ""Pitch Perfect 2""- Though never quite as fresh as the outstanding original, the great cast shines and good humor continues in this very worthy sequel.
","Comedy sequels are always a hard sell. For some reason, there's a standard few issues that many seem to fall back on, whether it be undoing previously completed character development in order to retell similar character-arcs, rehashing common story-beats or just delivering the exact same plot all over again, many sequels to popular comedies just fall a bit flat for trying too hard to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle appeal of their superior originals. Thankfully, however, ""Pitch Perfect 2"", despite having some of these issues, is able to rise above the so-so quality of many other follow- ups thanks to the continued electrifying charm of the wonderful cast and the absolutely excellent good humor that made the original a modern comedic classic. While it may never quite be as fresh and satisfying as the first outing, it's definitely a very worthy sequel.<br/><br/>Several years after the events of the original, the Barden Bellas are now three-time ICCA champions and are beloved by A Capella fans all over the nation. However, a disastrous ""wardrobe malfunction"" at a celebration concert for US President Obama's birthday quickly erupts into a media-circus, with the Bellas now the butt of many a joke and suspended indefinitely from performing at future ICCA competitions. However, not all hope is lost, as a deal is made- if the Bellas can win the World Championship of A Capella, they will be re-instated. And so, the group will have to learn to work together again to train for the much more grueling world competition... but all the while leader Beca (Anna Kendrick), trying to plan for her future beyond the Bellas, begins a musical internship that may threaten her friendship with the rest of the group.<br/><br/>Co-star Elizabeth Banks takes over the director's chair in her feature film debut, with Kay Cannon returning to write the script. Together, the two build a very competent and stylish production that compliments the original quite well, while also having an identity of its own. Banks proves to be a more than capable visual storyteller with solid direction, and I very much admired her handling of the material. She's definitely got a good eye for flow and composition and I'd be very interested to see her continue to grow as a director in the future. Cannon's script is tight and there's never a dull moment. She seems to have ratcheted up the zaniness this time around with some particularly wild sequences, and while it doesn't always work 100%, I think she does a good job continuing the story started in the original.<br/><br/>The cast is as marvelous as ever this time around, and I appreciated that this movie gives a lot more business to the supporting characters. Kendrick is a joy as always and makes for a compelling lead, especially with her struggles in growing up, which many will identify with. Rebel Wilson's role is slightly expanded and I very much enjoyed her romantic sub-plot with former adversary Bumbper, who is played in a delightfully hammy performance by a returning Adam DeVine. Supporting roles by the likes of Ester Dean, Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee and Katey Sagal are very well played. And there's even some really nice cameos that pop up here and there that I won't spoil, but round out the cast rather nice. I also did enjoy the new villains played by Birgitte Hjort Sørensen and Flula Borg- the leaders of an evil German A Capella group. Though I do have to comment that I think the roles are written a bit flat and as a result, neither Sørensen or Borg are able to really shine. But they did a good job with the material provided.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed the film, however, there are a few big issues I had which is where it loses some points for me. To start, as I mentioned, the villainous roles are a bit flat and on-dimensional. The sort-of trope of the ""evil Germans"" has been done to death, and unlike Bumper's quirky and over-the-top villainous presence in the original, they feel very stock. I also do think the film's first act is a bit messy. Many supporting characters feel under-utilized until later in the film and the story moves a bit too quickly for its own good, lopping on new characters and plot developments at a slightly haphazard pace. And a few gags and set-pieces do fall flat, including a bizarre follow-up to the famous riff-off of the original that feels a bit too weird and disjointed and is a very obvious attempt to try and re- create a popular scene from the first film. It just comes off as inorganic.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film corrects course soon enough, and the rest of the film is an utter joy. I loved the musical numbers, appreciated some of the new developments made to the characters. (I adored the turn in Bumper from a doofus villain into a sort-of sympathetic goofball, for example, and that's not spoiling anything) The direction is sharp and exciting and the wonderful comedy is on full- display. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" might not quite measure up to the absolutely outstanding original. But it's a darned good sequel and has me all the more excited for the recently announced third film. I give ""Pitch Perfect 2"" a very good 8 out of 10."

","This doofuspoofus should be ignored strictly because of the name (seeing as it's more gay than Harry Potter!) This movie might not be as good as the first (nothing ever is) but it was sure close! It contains new and old songs so it's got something for all ages! I love the fact that they compete against all different groups in the riff-off because it shows that you don't have to be a certain age/race/strictly into music to have a good voice. Not sure if there are pillow fights in college but it did show they still knew how to have fun when they are NOT singing. Probably the most annoying part of the movie is the back and forth of Bumper and ""Fat Amy"" because it was overdone. My favorite part was the end performance when all the Bella alums came out and the part (as shown in the previews) where ""Fat Patricia/Amy"" slides down the stairs! Also, you have to love all the guest stars and cameos! For this to have an overall rating below all the Harry Potter movies is absurd! If you rate this movie anything below a 7, you have a bad taste in movies."

The sequel to Pitch Perfect is something I would usually look at and say ""Oh God, not another, I hate musicals with fancy and rap and pop songs."" But since I like the cast I decide to watch the first one on ABC family on Sunday, and much to my surprise I thought it was great and now the sequel is upon us, so how is it? The film takes place three years after the events of the first film and The Bellas are household popular names. They do a performance singing for the president when suddenly(much like in the first film) something embarrassing happens and they see Fat Amy's uterus. Their carriers as Bella's could be destroyed but they plan to win the world championships to restore their name. The film does achieve it's goal with being an entertaining sequel, and I dare say it's as good as the first not better just as good. They have a larger cast but a few bumps with an unfocused narrative. Theirs a story-line with Becca at an internship trying to prove some sense worth to the company, Fat Amy and Bumper have got a thing going and the side stories just don't flow that well. The film in itself does have a good enough plot though. The performances from our leading ladies is just as great as the first film, and they have a new added member in the form of Haliene Steinfield. who I adore in this movie, she was such a great addition to the film. Who knows if their going to make a third film but with great acting, good music, and fun beats Pitch Perfect soars with a pitch. I'm giving Pitch Perfect 2 a four out of five."

"manuelwinchester","5","0","0","16 August 2016"," Not What Expected
","First of all, I want to make clear that I really enjoyed the first movie. But, as many cinema fanatics are claiming, sequels always make the things worse. The comparison with the first attempt is inevitable. Pitch Perfect 2 simply doesn't have a plot. For one more time, I'll remind you that I'm not bothered of the uncountable cliché in such movies. And that's not the real problem here. The problem seems to be related to the lack of fancy and impulsion. The film is set in a way that we can easily discern how obviously none wants to give a maximum performance. Also, we're talking about a comedy film and it's really sad that humor is totally based on Rebel's Wilson lines, and to be honest joking about weight is not so funny anymore. The whole movie setup reminds me the ''Step Up'' saga, with the difference that the dancing saga mostly leans on the romantic element. Now, the only good element in this film is music. Yes, music is pretty pleasant and the songs I have to admit that they're very enjoyable. Especially, in the end, the singing performances will raise a smile, in contrast with the rest of the film. Maybe this happens due to poor cast's performance. Anna Kendrick all these years has set high standards, but in Pitch Perfect 2 she seems completely uninterested. Her unsatisfactory performance in conjunction with the zero chemistry she has with her partner (Skylar Astin), contribute to movie's failure. Also, about Hailee Steinfeld, is too early to censure her, even though I'd prefer to see her in different roles because her potentiality it's obvious. In conclusion, Pitch Perfect 2 is not what we're expecting and I hope it won't end up with a trilogy."

","Threee years may have passed, but ""Pitch Perfect 2"" feels more like a TV episode than a full-fledged movie. Which may or may not be a good thing, depending on what you're looking for, but as a sequel, it's a mixed bag. The Bellas' story was all over the place, and despite a varied singing group, all of their appeal lies in Rebel Wilson. I mean, yeah,you could say she's all fart jokes, but her ""I'm so fly"" persona is put to good use.<br/><br/>The real reason to watch this is the lineup of side players (John Michael Higgins, Elizabeth Banks, David Cross, Snoop Dogg). The focused humor and killer lines belong to these actors; chief among them Keegan-Michael Key, who flat-out owns this movie as a self-absorbed record producer. That guy is hilarious.<br/><br/>6/10"

This movie also has a funny part where those girls and other singing groups are in a competition hosted by David Cross. Also for some reason the Green Bay Packers are in the competition too. lol.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","0","0","12 April 2016"," The sequel isn't off key, but it's not exactly an original melody
","The surest way to ruin a great, original comedy is to give it a sequel. Fortunately, in all the ways that ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is pointless, it's equally harmless. The movie knows it's a studio cash-grab, and the effort behind it shows, but the care-free attitude from the onset also appropriately lowers expectations.<br/><br/>Writer Kay Cannon returns with producer/star Elizabeth Banks going behind the camera, and clearly neither have a problem with sticking to the 2012 film's formula and giving fans their fix of the Barden Bellas and all-vocal mash-ups. The movie opens as the first did, with another national moment-of-shame for the heroes, one that disqualifies them from national competition (phew, otherwise the plot would've been even more of the same) and gives them one shot at redemption: win at an international competition (and beat the immaculate group Das Sound Machine from Germany in the process) or end up being disbanded.<br/><br/>Surrounding this conventional plot are a couple handfuls of scenes that exist solely as a vehicle for the a cappella soundtrack, such as a freshman orientation concert from the Treblemakers, a ""scouting mission"" to a car show to see Das Sound Machine perform and a private a ca-battle between five groups (one being the Green Bay Packers). <br/><br/>Then there are the character subplots that float in and out. Anna Kendrick's Beca has the only one of substance: she starts an internship at a recording studio and is challenged by a stereotypically tough studio boss (Keegan-Michael Key) to find her identity as a music producer. It unfolds in predictable fashion, however, and doesn't get the time and attention that Beca got in the first film. Instead, Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy graduates into a co- leading role of sorts, and we get a flat love story between her and Bumper (Adam DeVine). New girl Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) also gets lots of screen time as a ""passing of the torch"" of sorts, and her character is so awkward it's impossible to tell if we're supposed to care about her or laugh at her.<br/><br/>Cannon's script is more hit-and-miss this time around, likely because of the number of recycled jokes and the fact that some of the character quirks have gotten stale. Because the plot doesn't really create many moments for situational humor, most of the laughs in ""Pitch Perfect 2"" have to come from the dialogue and performances. The humor remains awkward and brazen, but like with most comedy sequels, the lack of novelty is noticeable.<br/><br/>The music of ""Pitch Perfect 2"" plays a much bigger role, in the sense that songs get more screen time because the story doesn't demand as much attention. Although you could just listen to the soundtrack instead of watching the whole movie for them, the killer arrangements up the entertainment factor significantly. For example, we're supposed to hate Das Sound Machine, but even replacing all the ""theys"" with ""zay"" when they sing can't change the fact that their performances of ""Uprising"" by Muse and a mashup of Fall Out Boy's ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark"" and ""All I Do is Win"" by DJ Khaled are just flat-out cool (by music nerd standards).<br/><br/>An effort to make ""Pitch Perfect 2"" into something of substance (on par with the original) would've been appreciated, but it also would've run the risk of taking itself too seriously. Instead, we get an entire movie that could've been set to the song ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun."" It's a silly romp with familiar characters and a writer, director and producers who essentially do a victory lap granted them by the surprise success of their once original idea. <br/><br/>Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

(As she had the rights to the original book, she can do what she wants.)<br/><br/>Never underestimate the ego of an actress or actor. Banks' has pumped up her role and basically sucked the life out of the rest of the film by cutting performances in favor of a ponderous plot (recording studio, weird scene when some guy holds an acapella contest in his house,) and unbelievable ""love story""between Bumper and Fat Amy that wasn't even hinted at in ""PP."" Even the songs that are featured aren't on the same level as those in the original. <br/><br/>It's horrible. Don't waste your time.

"Philipe14","2","12","50","19 May 2015"," ""Musical"" genre under attack.....
","PP2 is not quite as bad as the original flick, at least they refrained from ""vomit humor"" this time. Still relying on teen/college raunchy comedy, mostly based on character stereotypes. Rebel Wilson is still doing ""Fat Girls Are Funny"" material, far below the standards currently being set by Melissa McCarthy, a comedic genius who just happens to be, um, a Large Girl. Brittany Snow is still doing her Naïve Blonde from the ""American Dreams"" TV series (but at least she wises up to reality by the end of the show and actually Dares To Graduate...). And, they've added two more stereotypes to the mix: the black lesbian chick and the Hispanic/Latino immigrant. The vast majority of the laugh-lines are based on these stereotypes. As for it being a ""musical,"" that is a misnomer. Musicals feature original music written for the show, including songs the characters sing instead of doing dialog as the story moves along. This is a movie about music groups, so there are scenes with music, but it's always the groups rehearsing or doing their competitions. None of the characters are seen singing their way through a scene, as in ""Into the Woods,"" except when the Fat Girl is singing to her boy friend as she rows across a pond in a canoe. But the scene isn't about her singing, it's about the ""tension"" in the audience, waiting to see if she does a Fat Girl Pratfall into the pond. The movie's ""comedy"" is capped by a scene near the end, featuring physical/slapstick material, starring.....the Fat Girl, of course. All the music in this flick is re-hashed and re-mixed, which is what the choirs do for their competitions. Real musicals generate hit records that get added to radio station airplay lists. PP uses music that's already been on the hit charts, and now we're hearing it done up in A Capella style. No way does the PP franchise meet the standards set by such masterworks as South Pacific, Sound of Music, Oklahoma, or the Music Man."

","Although I'm a ""man man man man manly man"" I must confess to really liking the original ""Pitch Perfect"". Tuneful, funny, quirky and with a knock-out cup routine (that took me ages to perfect).<br/><br/>On the back of those high expectations, Pitch Perfect 2 is not Aca-awful but it is a big disappointment.<br/><br/>The college acapella group the ""Barden Bellas"" are riding high following their national championship win in the first film. They are performing to POTUS and the first lady when tragedy strikes in the form of a wardrobe malfunction of the worst kind by Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). As a result of ""Muffgate"", the Bellas are personae non gratae on the singing circuit, and their only way back is to win the worldwide championships in Copenhagen – something no American group has ever done because ""they all hate us"" (LOL). Besides anything else, standing in their way is the brilliant but bombastic Das Sound Machine whose militaristic take on Acapella makes them formidable opponents. And priorities for Beca (Anna Kendrick) are elsewhere as she is trying to impress her way into the music business as an intern for a professional recording studio.<br/><br/>Amy is also somewhat distracted by the love interest of Bumper (Adam DeVine) – mysteriously back on campus as a security guard (who said a degree couldn't land you a great job??).<br/><br/>New to the scene is Emily (Hailee Steinfeld of ""True Grit"" fame) whose mother used to be a Bella in her day and who is desperate to get into the group. She's a good singer, which is a good job since as all the other Bellas are graduating she may be singing solo in Pitch Perfect 3! (As this film made nearly three times its budget in its opening weekend that – unfortunately – seems assured).<br/><br/>The film launches with an hilarious opening (featuring Barrack and Michelle Obama in shot: one can only assume their kids are rabid PP fans in order to get that permission) and ends with a triumphant and feel-good performance at the end. It's the filling of this sandwich that really doesn't satisfy.<br/><br/>The ponderous and multi-threaded plot (by Kay Cannon and Mickey Rapkin) is all over the place and relies on randomly engineered recreations of the things that worked well in the first film. This includes a sing-off competition that tries hard but fails to live up to the 'playground' original. (It is hosted by an unnamed ""Rip-Off host"" who, before the film launched, was falsely reported as being Billy Joel; although similar in appearance he is actually musician/actor David Cross).<br/><br/>A lack-lustre story could be forgiven if the script was tight and hilarious. Unfortunately, many of the jokes fall completely flat; for me there were only a handful of laugh-out loud moments in the film. The love story between Fat Amy and Bumper is wildly unconvincing and the comic potential of the Kraftwerk-styled German group – led by Aryan-like duo of Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen) and Krämer (Flula Borg) – is left un-mined.<br/><br/>John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks return as competition commentators John and Gail, and whilst some of their shtick is funny, other comments (particularly those from John) step over the line into racism and xenophobia.<br/><br/>Another gripe is the music used. In the first film, nearly all the acapella songs were staple classics and instantly recognisable. Whilst this theme recurs in the 'Rip off' contest, the rest of the songs are (to me anyway) unrecognisable. Much is made of the 'new song' (""Flashlight"", now a single by Jessie J) but most of the other songs in the film might as well have been new! <br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks (Gail in the film) directs, and what with this and a segment of ""Movie 43″ on her resume perhaps she should stick to acting as the day job. By the way, watch out for the most unconvincing backdrop of Copenhagen you have ever seen, before the action swiftly moves back to an anonymous 'field' in 'Denmark' for the finale! <br/><br/>In summary: a tired re-tread of a much-loved original, which without the feel-good finale would be subject to a much lower rating.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address for future reviews.

Among the veteran Bellas in the concluding sequence was ""Good Morning America"" host Robin Roberts who originally hailed from New Orleans. Oh, and one of the food products showcased in the movie, as in the previous one, was some stuff from a local hangout named Zippy's (which I finally sampled about a year ago, having not done that when the original movie came out). With that out of the way, I'll just say this was quite enjoyable both musically and comedy-wise, if not as believable.

"SophieSlut","5","3","8","19 May 2015"," Hilarious film with great musical numbers but underdeveloped characters
","First, the good: This film was WAY better than the trailers. I was very wary of this film after seeing its promotional material. A lot of the 'jokes' from the trailers don't even make it into the film.<br/><br/>In fact, this is probably the funniest actual comedy I've seen from this year. It's provides more laughs than Paul Blart, Kingsman, Get Hard, Hot Pursuit, and Home and it provides less cringe-worthy failed attempts at humor than Spongebob. However, it's hard to compare its comedy to the surprisingly funny non-comedies Age of Ultron and Furious 7.<br/><br/>As for the musical performances, you either like them or you don't. I liked them a lot, but music, being as subjective as it its, is hard to adequately defend or criticize. But I will say, that the performances are much much better than previewed from the trailers. It makes me wonder why they chose to market this film the way that they did.<br/><br/>Now for the bad: 4 of the 8 main Bellas were completely one dimensional and static characters. What makes it worse, despite Fat Amy proudly championing how ethnically diverse their 5/8 Caucasian group was, the non-flat half of the group were all white.<br/><br/>The other half of the characters could all be summed up in less than 5 words: pretty and promiscuous, weird and creepy, black butch lesbian, Hispanic from dangerous country. This is something I noticed early on in the film. I asked myself if any of these 4 characters would show a personality outside of these one-note traits. The only bits of dialogue from them that didn't fit neatly into the single trait characterization was filler exposition like ""Why are we here again?"" or ""Who is that over there?"" which could be said by any character. This is the kind of thing I would overlook in a tongue-in-cheek camp-type film like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, but the attempted sentimentality in Pitch Perfect 2 should have required more developed characters.<br/><br/>Overall I give it 3.5/5 or 7/10."

","Anna Kendrick is one of the most talented and energetic stars out there. She's a phenomenon, with her role in the first ""Pitch Perfect"" and ""Into the Woods"" bringing light to her singing voice. Films like Up in the Air, Scott Pilgrim, and End of Watch are all great, independent choices. She's left her twilight days behind and cares about her career. She needs to stop doing films like this. Don't get me wrong, she's still really funny, and her story(working at a Record Label with Key from Key and Peele) is by far the best part of this generic slog, but that doesn't save it. It just made me wish that I was watching Anna Kendrick in another movie. Pitch Perfect 2 tries to repeat the catchy musical numbers, and slapstick gags of the first movie, while raising the stakes. What stakes? Who cares? This time the group is going up against the German Accapella group, Das Sound Machine, the best in the world. Meanwhile, they're becoming a mess, losing their creative voice, and dividing more and more as it's members prepare for life outside of college. I say: Good for Them. If I were Becca(Anna Kendrick's character), I would have left the group for a real life a long time ago. How great would it have been if the above record label storyline became the full movie? My score would be way higher. Also, the ""You just didn't like the first one"" argument doesn't work on me. I didn't love the first one, but I certainly thought it was good. It introduced a funny cast of original characters and put them in funny social situations. ""The Stakes"" didn't matter. Oh all these characters are still here, but because the film fails to do anything new with them, they become grating and annoying instead of fresh and funny. I was making a checklist by the halfway point, mentally checking off a point whenever a character made the same joke again. And by the three quarters point...I was considering sneaking out to see Mad Max again. I suppose most of this must fall on Director Elizabeth Banks. I love her as an actress, and she is a high point in this film as well...but she fails to do anything new or exciting with this installment. Well how's the soundtrack? The true answer is great. I was praying for a musical number more and more, as a flashy and funny break from the mediocrity that was being put before me. There's no point in seeing Pitch Perfect 2, just buy the album. Here's a pun to leave you with: Pitch Perfect 2 is pretty off-key."
"billy-moir","2","8","35","31 May 2015"," The Death of Cinema
","The title to this review may put you off from reading it but I will explain why I chose this title later on. First of all I would like to point out I did enjoy the first Pitch Perfect, I thought the story was well done and it had many funny quotes and scenes, however I believe this film completely destroys it, to me it seems like the director just placed the actors where they wanted, gave them no script and told them just to go with it and yelled action and this is what came out. I felt the comedy was extremely awkward and some awkward comedy is funny in small amounts, by awkward comedy I mean in a film where a character does or says something awkward and the characters are stood there awkwardly silent pondering what to do next etc. And this can be funny, however I feel that the majority of where people believe is comedy is coming from is this awkwardness and it got very repetitive and did the exact opposite desired effect. At points I felt the only redeeming factor was everything 'Fat Amy' said as I did find myself laughing at the way she would say things however I felt this was used way too much and became bland and forced. I also despised the character from the first film who would whisper everything she said at inappropriate times that had nothing to do with the story, I can understand why people see this as funny as it's just random and doesn't make sense but I felt they forced it here too and not only did they bring that character back they added another character who everything she said was a stereotype of her nationality and i found it extremely unfunny and irrelevant. I also found there was a huge amount of racial comedy coming from the 'John Smith' character that I didn't find remotely funny, not the fact it was racist but the jokes were not even jokes it just blatantly pointed out extreme stereotypes and didn't even attempt to make jokes of them. Back on to the point of improvisation and no script, I do believe improvisation can be very funny, look at Joe Pesci's 'funny guy' speech in Goodfellas for example, but I just believe that it was the only attempted humour in the film and it just didn't work. The story of the film is also extremely cliché and is actually basically the story of the first film repeated on a larger scale and I found it very predictable and boring. Finally my point about the title 'The Death of Cinema', I made this point because as I left the cinema after watching this film I overheard someone say how they hadn't seen a film so funny that made them laugh like that in ages, this made me sad to the think a mediocre, poorly shot, awkward film like this could be the funniest someone has seen, of course this is a matter of opinion you would say and I am obliged to agree that yes everyone has their own opinion, however to then back up my point of the death of cinema, this film grossed more at the box office than Avengers: Age of Ultron and Mad Max: Fury Road combined, I am not saying that these are perfect films but when films that have just been handed money to make a sequel and do a half-arsed attempt are making more money than ones who genuinely believe in the craft of film and attempt to make the best film they could have made it does make me question for the state of cinema and film. I do believe comedy is becoming increasingly more difficult in film nowadays to pick out the good ones from the bad ones as many movies made nowadays are simply improvised and poorly shot so if you're looking for a recommendation in what I believe the definitive guide to comedy that is not only funny in dialogue but gives you the dying art of visual comedy I will send you no further than the work of Edgar Wright and his Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy as a point of comparison for what I believe comedy should aim towards."

","The Bellas are back! The only problem? The lacking plot line is also back... In yet another epic rendering in the art of singing, the movie falls short to impress with a slightly boring plot that plods along to a very predictable finale. Must see for all ages, but prepare for some epic slow downs at times...<br/><br/>The singing during the entire movie is on point, the sets are quite bedazzling, the same actors and actresses quite splendid but the movie slowly drags the viewer down into the pool of boredom, as the plot revolves around constant Bella embarrassment, crude inappropriate jokes and boring love stories. Viewers be warned."
"ThomasDrufke","4","8","36","26 May 2015"," Won't Miss This When It's Gone
","Considering I went into this film with low expectations after strongly disliking the first film, I didn't think this Pitch Perfect could be as weak as the first, well I was wrong. Where the first one struggled with taking itself way too seriously and up and down tone issues, this film veered off in too many directions and ended up being too goofy and uninteresting. I understand comedy sequels are difficult. But look at 22 Jump Street, that film took the exact same premise of the first and what people liked and executed the same movie with new jokes. Perhaps I'm just not the target audience here. I know a lot of people love these movies and good for them. I'm just unable to see the appeal.<br/><br/>This time around the Bella's are touring when an incident occurs that prevents them from continuing their singing. But if they can win the world competition their school will reinstate the group. Almost everyone is back from the first along with a few newcomers, such as Hailee Steinfeld. She plays a new Bella and daughter of a former Bella. She's a good actress (checkout True Grit) but she isn't given enough to do here besides act childlike in comparison to the rest of the team. There's also enough offensive jokes to go around the group just like the last one. And the jokes do hit sometimes, particularly with John and Gail. Fat Amy also has a few laughs but her jokes fall flat more often than not. It's unfortunate, because her character was pretty funny in small doses in the first film. Here, we get far too exposed to her character (in more than one way) and it hurts the fun of it. The film also dives into a romance with her and Devine's character that really took me out of the movie. I just feel like the film wanted to go in far too many directions to make one cohesive picture. With first time director Elizabeth Banks, that's not a good sign.<br/><br/>Key from Key & Peele makes a glorified cameo, which improves the comedy, but doesn't do much to further the actual film. He plays Kendrick's boss and famous musical producer for Snoop Dogg and has several funny gags. But none of it seemed to matter in the long haul. Once again the film has several contrived parts to an uneven picture. Why did Aubrey need to be in the film? No real reason other than to make the Bellas go through 'boot camp' to find their sound........ what?? The performances were cool but nothing mind-blowing. The film tackles an underground a cappella competition for a near 15-20 minutes when the final performance and competition turn out to be 5 minutes or so. This film isn't for me and I probably wont be checking out the inevitable 3rd film, I just don't understand the appeal. Especially when you have a character like David Cross' goofy and out of place rip off host, not to mention the Green Bay Packers whose jokes fell completely flat. Along with a contrived filled plot and an unfocused story.<br/><br/>+Performances <br/><br/>+Key <br/><br/>-Contrived moments <br/><br/>-Plot confuses itself<br/><br/>-Unnecessary characters and arcs <br/><br/>-Focused too much on some scenes and not the finale <br/><br/>4.6/10"
"cnickels13","3","9","42","26 May 2015"," Phony ""Singers"" and the Green Bay Packers?
","This movie was nothing but annoying. Let's first start out with the worst part about it: the opening scene. Was that really necessary? Did we really need to visualize Fat Amy's...well...never-mind. We don't need to go into detail. Some of us want to keep our lunch down. Moving on.<br/><br/>The fact that no one was really singing, beat-boxing, or producing the bass sound was too much to handle. It was all fake. You could tell at many times that the actors weren't really beat-boxing, and lip syncing was too obvious throughout the whole movie. It was a movie about people pretending to sing and beat-box. <br/><br/>Let's not forget the annoying announcers that follow the acapella groups around. Their cheesy jokes became, well, too cheesy.<br/><br/>This movie went from being a semi-chick flick to 100% chick flick with no possibility of recovering from how fake it became. At least in the first movie the actors looked like they were singing. Please don't make a third one, even though the ending already alludes to that possibility. Maybe the new girl will change things? Maybe they'll become a coed group and get real talent to sing, dance, and beat- box.<br/><br/>Note: Maybe the best part was the appearance by the Green Bay Packers. Though that whole scene was weird from the get-go, just seeing them sing and dance was enough to get one laugh out of me at this movie."

","The first Pitch Perfect was a pleasant surprise. It didn't do the big box office numbers this one is making. It seemed like they tried way too hard with a plot that wasn't necessary. This was your typical Hollywood sequel that they made purely for money purposes. While I did laugh more often than not, it didn't have the the spark of the first film.<br/><br/>The plot is put into motion because ""Fat Amy"" has a wardrobe malfunction performing in front of the President. The Barden Bellas are suspended because of it and the only way to get reinstated is if they win the ""World Championships"". Other than that, there's not much conflict besides a little debacle between the group. There was a character of Latino decent in which she only said things terrible about the race. Sure some of them were funny, but I found most of her performance annoying.<br/><br/>Another thing is, while talented, Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) shouldn't be on screen as much as she should. The reason she was so good in the first one was because she had the right amount of screen time. She was essentially the second lead this time around and it was too much for me.<br/><br/>The 2 commentators in the film are back and really are just there to make terrible jokes about women, race and anything else. I enjoyed it, but because it doesn't come close to the original I can't really recommend it. It's just an OK film."
"ja-160","5","6","25","24 May 2015"," Really, really disappointing.
","I absolutely loved the first movie. It was laugh out loud funny, the music was great, and the story line was good. I was really excited to hear that they were making a sequel and couldn't wait to see it. Oh was I disappointed. I hate to say it, but the music didn't move me (other than the last couple songs), I hated the story, and other than a couple chuckles, I certainly didn't find most of it very funny. The attempts at humor were so bad that I really question if they used the same writers or for budgeting reasons, hired some kids from a high school. Not only were these ""jokes"" not funny, but there were many times when I cringed at the dialog and felt sorry for the actors having to deliver the lines... especially for Becca in those awkward scenes with the woman from the German group. That was just stupid.<br/><br/>I really wanted to love this movie but ended up just wanting my money back. To me the only redeeming parts of the movie were the final scenes with the 2 rival groups performing. Those were really the only musical numbers that look like someone spent some time on the music and choreography. The rest were just thrown together and certainly nothing special."
"alimac2","4","5","20","14 June 2015"," aca-scuse me, where did all the fun go?
","The things I love about the first pitch perfect became the things that fell flat in this movie: the snappy/witty dialogue and the music choices. There are so many amazing songs to choose from and so much heart could have been put into this, but it just...didn't work for me. At all. Which as an avid musical fan and a choir member of almost a decade is just really upsetting.<br/><br/>First of all WHAT HAPPENED with the harmony and the tone/volume?! For a team that was supposed to be a ""family"" or ""sisterhood"", I certainly didn't feel it,even at the world competition. Everything was boring. There wasn't as much passion put into any part of the way they preformed or acted.....I actually found myself wishing I could skip ahead most of the time, or waiting for the pace to pick up. <br/><br/>As for the dialogue, a lot of the lines that were supposed to be ""funny"" and ""snappy"" were just taken as flat out racism/sexism in my book. I know they weren't SUPPOSED to be, but they were. It was just not a good touch. The coupling in the movie was also unnecessary. It left me thinking ""When did they even start liking each other?"". I didn't see progression in the relationships that led me to want it to happen, it just felt rushed/put in there for romantic purposes.<br/><br/>There were nice moments, and the new girl could potentially be a nice touch in some ways, but really...just not great. Nothing that leaves me wanting to re watch it. <br/><br/>The only part I felt really moved on was the the ending with their original song. That's it.

","Stop me if you think you've heard this one before. A perky group of college a cappella singers suffers an embarrassing on-stage mishap, then fights to redeem itself and regain its former glory. Along the way, there's a little romance, a lot of trash talk, an impromptu sing-off with rival groups, some bawdy moments from a brash supporting player and plenty of clueless commentary courtesy of an announcing duo that also serves as the film's Greek chorus. Yes, ""Pitch Perfect 2″ is pretty much the exact same movie as ""Pitch Perfect."" In theory, this is great if you loved the original film, which became a sleeper hit in 2012. I loved the first ""Pitch Perfect"" so much, I gave it three and a half stars out of four, but much of what I loved about it was how refreshing it felt. It was cheeky and snarky and it pulled off the tricky feat of making us fall in love with the very thing it was making fun of. Its earnestness and exuberance were infectious in equal measure. There is no single moment here that matches the ingenuity of Anna Kendrick's ""Cups"" audition, no song that brings you to the verge of tears with its sheer beauty like her spontaneous shower duet with Brittany Snow to David Guetta and Sia's ""Titanium."" The best scene in the entire movie is a rip-off of the best scene from the first movie: a riff-off with various other singing groups, filled with inspired cameos and organized by a delightfully odd David Cross. ""Pitch Perfect 2″ has plenty of laughs scattered throughout, but it also struggles to regain that balance and that sense of breeziness. It runs out of steam somewhere in the middle and probably could have been a good, solid 20 minutes shorter. Making her feature directing debut, co-star and producer Elizabeth Banks stages the production numbers in brisk and entertaining fashion — it's just the actual, cohesive story in between that tends to bog things down. (As in the first film, Kay Cannon wrote the script; mercifully, there seem to be fewer made-up words with aca- in front of them.) One of the main problems with ""Pitch Perfect 2″ is that it marginalizes its star, the infinitely talented and adorable Kendrick. Beca's arc from reluctant performer to driving creative force gave the first film momentum, and her romance with the charismatic Skylar Astin from the all-male a cappella group the Treblemakers provided a nice spark. She had attitude. She had an edge about her, which was a great change of pace for Kendrick compared to the good-girl, Type-A characters she'd mostly played. Here, she's reduced to a supporting figure, and Astin is an afterthought in just a handful of scenes. Rebel Wilson is the film's star this time. Granted, ""Pitch Perfect 2″ remains an ensemble — and an ever-expanding one, at that — but Wilson was such a scene stealer last time as a brassy Aussie who nicknamed herself Fat Amy that she's been given even more room to work her inappropriate comic shtick. As enjoyable as Wilson can be, she's also rather one-note, and a little of her goes a long way. Speaking of notes, the songs that the Barden Bellas and their competitors sing are even more polished and overproduced than ever, to the point that there's an emotional disconnect. But things don't go so well off the top. As reigning national a cappella champs, the Bellas have the honor of performing for President Obama and the first lady. But a wardrobe malfunction during a complicated maneuver by Fat Amy — which comes to be known as Muffgate, in an unfortunate bit of female body shaming — makes the ladies a laughingstock and costs them their title. (Once again, Banks and John Michael Higgins crop up as a Christopher Guest mockumentary-style broadcasting team to provide perspective through satirically sexist and racist remarks. Some of these are hilarious; others land with a thud.) But! Through a loophole, the Bellas are still allowed to represent the United States at the world championships in Copenhagen. There, they will face a juggernaut German group called Das Sound Machine, which essentially consists of about 20 people doing that ""Sprockets"" bit from ""Saturday Night Live"" as they sing songs like ""Insane in Ze Membrane."" Their leader is a gorgeous, blonde Teutonic stereotype (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) who repeatedly gets Beca giddy and tongue-tied. Insecurity and skittishness, however, are not what this character is about. And so it's also odd to see Beca scurrying off to a secret internship at a record company because she's afraid to tell the Bellas and let them down — even though, you know, she and the other ladies are seniors now and should be thinking about their futures. (Then again, Bella co-leader Chloe, played once again by an enthusiastic Snow, has stayed in college for seven years because she's so afraid of the real world.) The presence of comedian Keegan-Michael Key as Beca's demanding but ultimately enlightening boss significantly improves this subplot, though. But wait, there's more. As part of Wilson's larger role here, she also gets a more significant romance with Adam DeVine as the Treblemakers' cocky former leader, including a bombastic duet which is pretty amusing. All the other supporting players from the first ""Pitch Perfect"" are back, including Hana Mae Lee with her absurd and nearly silent asides (a bit that was funnier the first time). And there's a new recruit in freshman Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), a singer-songwriter and legacy whose mother (Katey Sagal in a barely-there part) was a legendary Bella more than 30 years ago. Clearly, the stage is being set for ""Pitch Perfect 3″ — whether the world needs it or not."
"BillSims28","6","3","10","21 May 2015"," 5-word review: Ear-pleasing, frequently witty, predictably empty
","Following the surprise success of 2012's Pitch Perfect, a sequel was inevitable. Re-uniting fan favourites Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson with actor-turned-actor/director Elizabeth Banks, Pitch Perfect 2 follows the Barden Bellas encountering trouble threatening their aca-mplishments along the way. Adding Oscar nominee Hailee Steinfeld to the ensemble cast, Pitch Perfect 2 also sees Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp and Adam DeVine reprise their roles from the original. <br/><br/>Pitch Perfect was quite a refreshing surprise. Though it will never inspire quite the same reaction in me as it would a 14-year-old girl, it's decently made and doesn't descend too much into tired, Gleek-ridden clichés. This sequel is determined to do everything bigger and bolder. The music sets are still impressive and sure to evoke taps from the toe, most notably a German group's fantastic rendition of Muse's Uprising (a song which this film helped me get back into) and the ever-popular ""riff-off"". This is better than it was the first time around, probably due to Arrested Development's wonderful David Cross hosting the event. Also done bigger is the comedy. Less subtle, perhaps, than the 2012 original but certainly more frequent. In fact, it seems to be the case that Banks is so determined to include something funny in every scene that there is a distinct lack of 'real' scenes - that is to say, scenes featuring characters interacting without self-deprecating humour. It does sometimes come off as a little desperate - the one-note characters played by Hana Mae Lee (the odd, soft- spoken, Korean girl) and Chrissie Fit (Guatemalan girl with the rough upbringing.) They're usually funny, but it does become a tad wearing eventually. And there is, overall, luckily more funny moments of humour than the irritating and awkward moments.<br/><br/>Kendrick and Wilson, however, are as effectively likable as ever, and it's always nice to see Hailee Steinfeld acting (even if she is just playing a Disney Channel character.) John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks once again display wonderful chemistry as the a capella commentators. They have more scenes than before, and like with the rest of the film the comedy is more obvious. It's still funny though. Admittedly a little disjointed, Pitch Perfect 2 won't be as execrable as you might have thought a sequel like this could be. It really is an enjoyable watch, and you'll probably come out of it feeling like it wasn't amazing or awful, but certainly with a tune or two stuck in your head, and having chuckled a decent amount. Watch out for Pentatonix as well.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 stands just a mite under a full 7.0 at 6.8/10."

","This is a near-perfect example of what I like to call the ""lesser sequel syndrome. I think that it's safe to say that this has existed ever since the very first sequel hit the big screen. With a few exceptions (Toy Story 2 & 3 most notably), you'd be hard-pressed to find a sequel that actually surpasses the original in terms of quality. And Pitch Perfect 2 exemplifies this theory almost to a fault. The charm and quirkiness of the first film is almost entirely missing. It's as if the screenwriter decided to see how many clichés and stereotypes they could fit into the film. There's the dimwitted but lovable boyfriend, the hip, to-cool-for-you boss, no shortage of racial jokes that very much miss the mark, and the eclectic group of friends (in this case, the Barden Bellas, who are pretty much the focal point of the movie) that manage to pull together in order to beat the odds. That wouldn't be a huge problem if the story that had been crafted around them was good. But it's not - it's lazy, in idea and execution. Not only that, but the pacing is some of the worst I've seen on the big screen. The film manages to become more boring as it progresses towards the climax. All that being said, there are a few redeeming factors. Elizabeth Banks and John Micheal Higgins are a riot as the hosts of the podcast ""Let's Talk-Apella"", and Rebel Wilson is able to provide some great comic relief. In fact, most of the cast is solid (except Hailee Steinfeld, frankly, it looks like she didn't put an ounce of effort into her role).<br/><br/>So, while Pitch Perfect 2 isn't a truly awful film, in all honesty, it's pretty close to being one. 5/10, would not recommend."

The plot aren't as solid and some of the movie parts are chunky, it doesn't has a smooth transition to it. <br/><br/>Some characters are not themselves anymore. A prime example would be Beca, she isn't the first Beca whom we knew, she seemed like she has lost her attitude & personality. Not the cool and independent Beca that we saw in the first movie. Also, Fat Amy's persona is exaggerated. Yes, I know people like her in the first movie, I do too, in fact, she is one of my favourite but in this sequel, she appears unintelligent somehow. <br/><br/>I feel like Emily's role doesn't really contribute much impact to the movie. They should have give her more screen time/more development for her character. <br/><br/>Lastly, some jokes on other nationalities are quite insensitive. Especially the part where John introduces the Indian acapellas?

","Fine for a sequel but missing that special 'it factor' spark<br/><br/>The Barden Bellas are back to reclaim their Aca-glory and redeem themselves by clinching the international Worlds A Cappella championship title in Pitch Perfect 2.<br/><br/>Second verse, same as the first! After an embarrassing performance by the collegiate singing group of Barden University, they must revamp themselves to defeat their rivals.<br/><br/>Sigh, unfortunately fans are not delivered a worthy successor despite the world wind success of the original Pitch Perfect. Unfortunately for the minds behind the Bellas' sequel though, we fans know it is possible, thanks to the amazing 22 Jump Street's success in innovation.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect is a worn out sequel, nothing more nothing less. The jokes are less funny, the story is less compelling, and we even get the token celebrity cameos! Speaking most to the film's inability to re-energize the narrative is the lackluster performance of those that made the first film great, Anna Kendrick and Skylar Astin.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 has too much missing, it features the least entertaining actors the most and prematurely upgrades JV roles to varsity; primarily new characters and Fat Amy. I guess the magic of the film was in the story created by the novel written by Mickey Rapkin. Screenwriter Kay Cannon can not stay afloat without Rapkin as the ideas man and her lack of creativity and talent shows. Cannon's screenplay uses the comedy of the first film in a completely exhausted manner to the point of being utterly unfunny.<br/><br/>The direction by Elizabeth Banks is completely fine and seamless to the first's director Jason Moore. Her subtlety for incorporating corporate sponsors into scenes needs some work, we are looking at you Volkswagen and CoverGirl. My only complaint being she holds shots on herself a beat too long, where the scene begins to feel overacted and awkward.<br/><br/>The original Pitch Perfect had a fire and fun to it, a group of misfits coming together and kicking aca-ass. I urged my boyfriend to watch it, promising that it was hilarious and not your average 'chick-flick' and he wasn't disappointed. This film however, will not be suggested, to anyone, unless they already plan on watching it.<br/><br/>Please check out the website for Archon Cinema Reviews to read full reviews of all the recent releases."
"abbiefrancessmith","5","4","21","20 May 2015"," Personally, I was disappointed.
","Okay, so let me just start by saying that I LOVED Pitch Perfect and have been dying to see this sequel but, for me, it just didn't live up to the first one. <br/><br/>One of the weaknesses for me was the storyline, or more accurately, the lack of storyline. I saw the first one as being about a girl whose a little unusual, finding herself at university at her father's request and bizarrely feeling completely at home around a group of girls who are all equally strange and different from each other, with a backdrop of some killer tunes and quirky comedy. However, this film didn't really seem to know what it was focusing on. They seemed to be trying to bring in a new Beca with the Emily character, yet didn't develop her or her personality at all so the audience was left thoroughly uninterested about what became of her. Beca's loyalty to the group is being questioned with a job opportunity, which would be fair enough except again, it doesn't really get enough screen time to properly develop as a plot point. Finally, I know sequels are supposed to go bigger and better, and whilst I can buy the international a cappella competition, I don't understand how the Bellas got international fame in between the two films, as the main story line seems to be the group falling from grace at the beginning and trying to redeem themselves. All three of these stories are equally valid, but none of them seem to be well thought out and for me they just didn't mix together.<br/><br/>Another problem I had was the portrayal of fat Amy's character. In the first one, she chimed in with some funny one-liners and provided a laugh or two, but I always considered Beca to be the star and thought the comedy was woven evenly throughout the film, not resting on Fat Amy's shoulders. It seems the writers disagreed though as her role in this movie seemed to level pegging, if not at times taking over (as she is the only Bella with a solo), Beca's. Again, this just felt like another storyline that had been half thought out and then just thrown into the mix without being properly finished like the others. <br/><br/>Finally, Jesse. Jesse and Beca were one of my favourite thing about Pitch Perfect. They had great chemistry, they were funny together, he as a character is just adorable, and I was so looking forward to seeing how they were as a proper couple. Sadly, as he is in the film it's for about 10 minutes at random intervals and his presence is rarely used to advance the plot or add to the scene in any way. Major disappoint for me. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is definitely watchable but I don't think it's anywhere near as good as the first one. If the rumours prove to be true and there is a third one in the pipeline I really hope they go back to basics and everything that made this such a great story in the first place."

","I really do enjoy the first movie and anticipated this movie to be a musical quality to match. So I am warning you not to expect the witty, surprising, great sounding, awesome remake of the first. Nope, not this time around!<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 is not as bad as George of the Jungle II. I can't say it was ACA-AWFUL it was just really, really disappointing.....not smart, not funny, not cute, not edgy and the music was not memorable.....not like the first.<br/><br/>The sad thing is there was hope for just a moment then you knew this movie lacked intelligent story and was pandering to us thru the 'FAT GIRL ONE LINERS' Rebel Wilson seems to force out. All of the Bellas act 'UN-Bella' like and you can even hear what Lilly actually says (I liked it better when I couldn't). <br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 lacked quality and originality of music, set, dance, costume, photography, directing and creativity for the entire show. I didn't care about these characters because it was obvious they didn't either. Costumes looked like Fredrick's of Hollywood knock offs! <br/><br/>I wasn't alone as some members of the audience were overheard rooting for the BAD GUYS as they walked out of the movie. Really? ME and my family as well!<br/><br/>It was not a total loss, I got to spend some time with my family, refill the popcorn and rest my eyes for a moment. In the end, the day wasn't wasted. I got home in time to mow the grass.<br/><br/>Can't say I wouldn't recommend you watch it when it comes out on Netflix, just wouldn't recommend paying to see it now....."

","This is about an a capella group that suffered a humiliating incident that was televised nationally. To regain their reputation, they join the World A Capella contest representing the USA. It's a nice idea to have a musical about a capella singers joining the World A Capella Singing contest. Funny thing is, everybody sings with musical instruments accompanying the songs. Do they know what a capella means?<br/><br/>There are funny moments. Anna Kendrick and Hailee Steinfeld are beautiful. That's it!<br/><br/>The girls seem too old for college, aren't they? Except for Hailee Steinfeld, who really looks like a college freshman (freshwoman)?

"jolene791","3","5","29","31 May 2015"," Unfunny and Generally Boring with a Poorly Executed Plot
","The sequel to the popular 2012 musical comedy fails to live up to it's predecessor and disappoints. The film opens with a blunder involving the much loved character, Fat Amy (tiredly played by Rebel Wilson), exposing her nether regions in the middle of a performance at the Kennedy Centre causing great embarrassment to the Bellas and the a cappella world. This causes the group to be suspended from participating in any collegiate a cappella competitions and going on a showcase tour. Of course, the only way they can return back to the a cappella world is to win the world a cappella competition (which they just so happen to not be banned from). The main plot of the film revolves around this goal, with the conflict being the more interesting a cappella group, Das Sound Machine (DSM) , being better than them and the Bellas trying to find their sound again. This plot, while not the most interesting or new, is an okay premise. What fails the film is the execution of this plot.<br/><br/>The first hour is littered with scenes that have no great significance in advancing the plot, but are simply there to be there. This is not necessarily a problem: In comedy these scenes when used effectively, can house funny gags that add to the overall enjoyment of the film. However, it poses an issue when those scenes happen to be boring and repetitive and simply allusions of better scenes from the first movie. An example would be the riff off, which was awkwardly put together, with five a cappella groups, and with each group getting ""cut off"" for incredibly dumb reasons such as Distraction From Pretty Girl or Oops I Got Nervous So I Sang A Song I Wrote Instead until DSM was left, causing them to win. It was clumsily placed into the movie with songs that were not that interesting. Pointless party scenes at the Treblemakers' house are also included in this bland hour.<br/><br/>Skip to the next fifty minutes or so and that's when the plot really starts to progress. The Bellas go to a camp run by Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) who along with Bumper Allen (Adam DeVine) are two of the characters that bring the most humour and fun to the movie. In the retreat, conflict occurs between Beca (Anna Kendrick) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) over Beca not telling Chloe about her internship at a recording studio (a passable subplot that brings some laughs) which is then solved within the next couple of minutes by a booby trap and a couple of jokes. The Bellas sit around the campfire and find their sound again and all is well. They go forth and enter the world a cappella competition and to no one's surprise, they win. With the help of the new addition to the Bellas, Emily Junk (Hailee Steinfeld), the Bellas sing an original song, thus allowing them to beat the far more superior Das Sound Machine and a cappella groups across the globe, none of them having thought of the groundbreaking fresh new idea of song composition before.<br/><br/>Aside from the weak resolution and execution of plot, other factors contribute to the overall quality of the film. Being a musical comedy, the jokes play an important part. The commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks) pollute the film once again with awkward unfunny jokes about race and gender that are either offensive, unintelligent or both. Any attempt to subvert the sexism/racism/general stupidity of her co host from Gail feels like a painfully unfunny afterthought. The movie also relies too much on it's jokes from the first film, like Lilly's lack of a voice or the mid performance mishap. The gags from the minority characters tire quickly due to the formulaic way of writing and soon become very forced. <br/><br/>Lastly, the film contains too many montages. There are about three within just the first hour and the film has not done enough within that time to deserve those montages for the plot yet. They are used way too often than necessary and only once or twice for good effect.<br/><br/>There are a few good moments in the movie. For example, the Bumper/Fat Amy song where Fat Amy sings in an attempt to win back the heart of Bumper in a funny solo which later turns into a duet is probably one of the movie's only charming tunes. Another good moment would be the scene reminiscent of the first film where the Bellas' shared something personal about themselves only this time, the girls talk about their future after college instead. It was a scene that offered a glimpse of maturity and honesty about confronting one's future.<br/><br/>These moments, however, are not enough to make up for the lack of interesting plot and jokes as subtle as a firework display that generally cause the film to fall flat. Fans of the first movie might just get by enjoying this movie through the various throwbacks to its predecessor, however it is especially hard for newcomers to find anything worth remembering about this film."

I'm not going to spoil anything but I think hinting that an over weight girl is showing her vagina is not funny. My friend Nikoli from Cod 4 really enjoyed it though and said he would like to take Anna Kendrick out on a date. My other friend Mason who keeps being asked what the numbers mean still doesn't know what they mean but thats not the point, he rates this film 9 out of 10 because unlike the numbers he could read this film.

","Pitch Perfect 2 is a music film sequel to Pitch Perfect (2012). It portrays the Barden Bellas, an all female acapella group, who must redeem themselves in the world championship after a performance gone wrong.<br/><br/>I entered the theater with low expectations. Still, I was disappointed by this movie. The story was so so, nothing extraordinary. Some of the characters were underdeveloped. I can't even remember some of the girls of this small acapella group as their presence does not contribute to the betterment of this film whatsoever.<br/><br/>Even worse is that the comedy aspect of this film is just bad. Most of the time they try too hard to be funny. <br/><br/>And lastly, what I dislike most about this film is that they did not even try to make it look like acapella. Everyone in their group is singing. One has to wonder where the background music comes from. They could have used non vocal music and make someone perform lip-sync. That's not too much to ask, is it?<br/><br/>Although this film is mediocre at best, I have to say that it's still cool to see all those people that made their cameo appearances."

","I'm only giving it a four out of ten because of the vocal performances, and the party at the eccentric guy's house--the best scene in the movie. The rest was a profane, clichéd, mind-numbing, IQ point-shaving paean to college life for singers. This movie was the show choir equivalent of Drumline--all about the show and the hijinks, and almost none of the work involved (I didn't care for Drumline either). Maybe PP3 will get it right, but I'm not holding my breath.<br/><br/>In case those of you about to call me a ""hater"" (which will give away your youth) are curious, I've spent my life teaching and performing, both as a singer and an instrumentalist.

"leonblackwood","4","2","10","27 September 2015"," Much preferred the first movie. 4/10
","Review: I know that I'm most probably the only person on earth that thinks this but I actually thought that this movie was corny and pretty poor compared to the original. The storyline was also pretty poor but I liked the A Capella battles between the various bands. Anyway, the movie is about A Capella band, the Barden Bellas who are riding high as the 3 time champions. After an embarrassing mishap whilst performing in front of President Obama and his wife, they become a national joke so they come together to battle at the world championships, to redeem there name. Beca (Anna Kendrick) becomes an intern for a Grammy award winning producer and battles to show off her skills whilst trying to keep her group together. When they go to Copenhagen to see there competition they realise that they have to step up there game to compete against the fearless A Capella groups and they go on a team bonding course to try and boost there morale. With a new singer on board, they put together a performance which will put them back at the top of there game. Sounds impressive but it really wasn't that entertaining! Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) had a couple of amusing scenes but I found some of the music quite corny and no way as good as the first movie. I also liked the big-headed producer who kept on forgetting everybody's name and the two competition broadcasters played by John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks, who also directed the movie but it felt more like a chick movie this time around. With all that aside, it's still a fun, upbeat movie with a couple of touching scenes but after all of the hype, I was expecting better. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Anna Kendrick, 30, believe it or not, shot to fame after her performance in Up in the Air with George Clooney and her role in the Twilight franchise and she also had a small role in the great Scott Pilgrim movie. Other titles to her name are 50/50 with Joseph Gordon- Levitt, What to Expect When Your Expecting, the great End of Watch, the strange Life After Beth and the Voices, Cake and Into the Woods, so she's been a busy little bee since her small role in a movie called Camp in 2003. Rebel Wilson, 35, has also been busy since her 2011 performance in Bridesmaids with roles in Bacherlorette with Isla Fisher, What to Expect When Your Expecting, the funny Pain & Gain and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb so she must be happy with her career so far. With another movie in the Pitch Perfect franchise due to come out and a role as the lead in a Private Benjamin remake, her outspoken personality and shocking one-liners have definitely paid off. Anyway, the movie was directed by Elizabeth Banks, 41, who wasn't the original director of the franchise, so that's why you can tell a difference between the first and second movie. The first movie was directed by a man, Jason Moore, so it didn't really feel too much like a chic flick but this one really does. With all that aside, this movie has made a healthy profit at the box office so I'm not surprised that they have a third movie in the pipeline. I must admit, it is an original concept that has never been addressed before and it has started a bit of a craze around the world but some of the corny songs made me cringe.<br/><br/>Budget: $29million Worldwide Gross: $285million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their music/comedy movies about a A Capella group who are fighting to redeem there name, after an embarrassing moment in front of the president, by entering the world championships. 4/10"
"rebeccajanecraig","4","2","10","7 August 2015"," Wow
","I am a big fan of the movie Pitch Perfect. After having a free night, I decided to watch this film because hey, what harm could it do? I was very disappointed.The jokes are stale and sometimes even irrelevant. Characters have undergone transformations that simply doesn't seem right. Beca is no longer moody and independent with aspirations of becoming a DJ and slowly finding her place; she is fumbling and awkward, making bad jokes and given the role of a rambler. We do not see her relationship with Jesse, or even with other cast members. This is fine, she has a job and she's busy, but it was executed poorly.<br/><br/>Amy, who had been very entertaining in the first movie, has been given a bigger part. Mistake. Amy is amusing but she is not enough to carryon her own dramatic story. She is given a romance with anothercharacter, which at some points were amusing until it got ""serious"". <br/><br/>My biggest fear coming in was that it was going to be the same situation on a bigger scale and that there would be no new characters. But there are, two the stood out that is. Emily and a stereotypical and offensive Latina woman. Now the Latina woman is thrown racist comments (oh so many racist and sexist comments to everyone) and she does this awful thing where she says horrible irrelevant things like ""my brother tried to sell me for a chicken"" or ""I had diarrhea for seven years"". No, Pitch Perfect, you do not have to stoop to this.<br/><br/>Emily is my least favorite character of the year, and mind you I have recently watched Daredevil and I'm not happy with Wilson. She is given the role of a ""legacy"". Her mother was a Bella, which granted her special auditioning privileges? She could have been a quirky and awkward character, which I believe she was meant to be, but her actor did not pull this off. Her character was short of embarrassing. Ben, an endearingly adorable character from the first movie, is suddenly a man who cannot speak English while seeing this girl? He is reduced to her love interest and it is almost sickening. I don't know the purpose of Emily's character, nor the importance. But she was a bad character, unnecessary if not to prove a point of a character maybe feeling left out in the group? <br/><br/>Jesse get about three minuets of screen time (I wasn't even aware he'd be making an appearance). Honestly, this movie was not good. It was just looking for a cheap spin-off for some money, and it worked. I recommend the first movie instead."

"AngusH","5","3","20","18 May 2015"," Lacking a lot - MANY spoilers
","Its hard to write about a movie with so many flaws. So ill start with the run time.<br/><br/>The movie runs for about 1 hour and 55 minutes. about 25 minutes too long. There were scenes that were not required for the progression of the movie.<br/><br/>I know that the Acapela battle off was something that everyone loved in the first film. However the weird, out of the blue invitation, to David Cross' under ground Acapela arena in order to bring it back, offered nothing to the plot. It had no significance to their movement towards the world championships and was something that could've been easily left out.<br/><br/>The movie left a lot of loose ends. This could be due to a third movie however I felt that they needed to be addressed. For example, Beca (Anna Kendrick) and her attempt to enter the music industry through an internship at a high end record label company ended at Keegan Michael enjoying the song she produced and nothing more. I was stunned to find out that this didn't progress further. Rather it was left at that with nothing more to be added.<br/><br/>Finally the actual world championships themselves! We got to enjoy the different Acapela groups from all over the world perform and watched the Germans do essentially the same dance they had been doing all movie, which for some reason was deemed to be a good act. Then out of nowhere, the past Bella's coming back to perform with the current group ending with a cut back to the US showing the trophy with world champions written on it, making us just presume they won overall. I just thought it was a vague and weak ending to the movie. We didn't see any of the emotion that was involved with being the best in the world at something or even that they don't have to discontinue their group anymore. If the scenes that were not required for the story of the movie were cut and more effort was put into the ending of the movie, I would have rated this much higher.<br/><br/>Overall the comedy was quite good, acting was what you would expect. Rebel Wilson was very funny as always and there were many moments that I couldn't resist laughing. If the plot was stronger and the ending was improved, I feel that I could have put this up with some of the better comedies out there. I guess there isn't much more you can expect with a sequel. 5 out of 10"
"RforFilm","6","2","11","21 May 2015"," Acha-entertaining, but Pitch Perfect 2's story is very acha-familiar
","Singing is only for the brave! As a drama kid in high school, it was clear that if you were at least a passable singer, then you were one of the cool kids of the group. I myself was not talented enough to achieve the high notes of something like Donny Osmond, but I knew of several kids who voices were so good, that I had hoped that I might see them signing along side a big celebrity or at least move up to a high level on American Idol or The Voice. Besides simply singing, the cool kids were able to a capella sing in unison.<br/><br/>Now seems to be the high point of a capella singers with the sleeper hit Pitch Perfect. Ever since that movie came out, almost every teenager, boy or girl, seems to go nuts for that movies or anything related to a capella song related (like the current hit band Pentatonix). While I agree that the movie was fun to watch, I just never thought it was the comedic masterpiece that everyone says it was. It had some good performances, though the story was predictable in my book. Pitch Perfect 2 now has the chance to redeem itself with a second outing with the bella singers.<br/><br/>It has been 3 years since the girls had won the national competition from the last movie and most of the women including Beca (played by Anna Kendrick), Chloe (played by Brittney Snow) and Fat Amy (played by Rebel Wilson) are both juggling being seniors in college and going on their national tours as the acclaimed group. During one concert with president Obama in attendance, Fat Amy has a wardrobe malfunction that humiliates and disgraces the group, ruling them suspended from competing in the national competition again. <br/><br/>Chloe rounds up the girls to move on to the international competition to restore their status as the best. As told from a capella experts Gail (played by Elizabeth Banks) and John Smith (played by John Michael Higgins), no one has ever been able to beat the German team, Das Sound Machine. The team seems so focused on winning the contest that they don't know that Beca has taken an internship with a record label, hoping to push her career aspirations forward. This causes a revelation that none of the girls seem ready to move on from college and away from their close group of friends. With the new addition of freshman Emily Junk (played by Haliee Steinfeld), the Bellas will need to find their voice again and figure what's important after college.<br/><br/>Pitch Perfect 2 has a lot of the same humor from the first movie; maybe not all great jokes but enough to get a couple of laughs out of me. This movie also borrows a lot of plot elements from the first movie; a mistake that causes the team to be humiliated, a leader whose too focuses on winning rather then the groups own singing and learning the value of friendship.<br/><br/>In a way, I felt like that I was watching the first movie again, though I guess it is different enough that it will please fans of the original. Fat Amy is still a character favorite of mine and the singing is still entertaining. I'm guessing that despite the fact that it ends with the Bellas graduating, this won't be the end. I'll bet a million dollars that Pitch Perfect 3 or Pitch Perfect: The Next Generation will continue the same story but at least contain different song sequences that make the franchise a popular one. <br/><br/>I'll give this six microphones out of ten. I liked this as much as I liked the first, which I still only see as okay movies. I doubt my opinion will change it's hardcore fan base, so take it for what it is and enjoy the voices."
"LiquidEcho","4","4","32","17 May 2015"," A derivative Pitch Perfect without the heart of the original
","I am a BIG fan of the original Pitch Perfect. I ask everybody if they have watched it and force them to sit down and watch it with me right there and then if they haven't. I have introduced a great many people to the awesomeness that is Pitch Perfect 1. I am even the cause of a few Anna Kendrick crushes on account of the film.<br/><br/>This sequel feels like the awkward cousin of the original. It has some of the same features, but it is not nearly as charismatic as the original. It feels like the writers took what they figured people liked about the original (e.g. Fat Amy, the sexist banter between the podcasters) then exaggerated it beyond recognition without retaining the depth that made everything so funny in the first place. For instance, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins said some pretty hilariously inappropriate things in the original, but it took a second to realise how funny it was because the writers did a great job inserting wit subtly. In this instalment, their humour is blatant and not as funny. Overall, the sequel feels like a superficial attempt at copying the original without any heart.<br/><br/>Mostly what bothered me is that Brittany Snow's character, Anna Kendrick's character and others seem to have lost their original personalities. Snow seems more like the original uptight Bella leader (Anna Camp), which is puzzling since Brittany Snow was the moral centre of the group in the original.<br/><br/>I think the new girl is great, great voice and character. I also liked the German crew. The film definitely had good moments, I burst out laughing several times. But it doesn't make up for the fact that it lost the spirit of the original somewhere along the way."

","I was really looking forward to this film - i won't lie, having been a fan of the previous and musical theatre and glee etc. I have to say i felt let down by this film. While I can criticise and say this: 1. A Sia or more pop culture soundtrack would have kept the ""flow"" going 2. Glee failed in introducing original songs into its show and in my opinion as people watched Pitch Perfect and Glee expecting covers and to to see great covers- I think PP2 failed in this as did Glee. 3. I hate to sound judgemental but for the intended audience, the stars had aged and ""grown"" more ways vocally and physically to make it a sequel, it took too long, should have been done quicker. 4. Becca's career introduction should and could have been more detailed and interesting instead of shoving a ""rap"" singer in for 5 minutes --- maybe an opportunity missed. 5. Environment was great. 6. Costumes of SDM DSM BDM, BDSM- funny that- seems aimed at a gay audience, costumes included for these performers and a poor attempt at it. Fat Amy - a national from my hometown- was struggling in pulling the film together as she was probably the most reminiscent of the previous film because Becca's character and that of her girls (missing miss Blondie until later- who FYI whose voice had changed dramatically) were playing nearly different characters- noting Becca's submission of ""your armpits smell like Cinnamon"" this really was not a plus in the comedy department as it wasn't within her character from the first film.

"andradatomoni","6","1","4","9 August 2015"," Hearbreakingly Disappointing
","I had high hopes for this, especially after the first film, which I thoroughly enjoyed. This one was, however, much less enjoyable.<br/><br/>It seems like the screenwriters focused on about 3 characters this season and forgot everyone else were there to act, not as extras. Kendrick and Wilson got most of the lines and every other actor was lucky if they had a total of 5 sentences to say. There was so much chemistry between Beca and Jesse in Pitch Perfect that was nowhere to be found this time around. As for Fat Amy and Bumper... I don't see it. It would have made more sense in the previous film where there was actually some character development for Bumper, but since there was none whatsoever in the current screening, the whole scene seemed forced. Rebel Wilson also seemed less funny to me - I just got the impression that she was under too much pressure to be funny, so she felt like she had to go a little too over the top. Did you love Stacey, Chloe, Lilly (silent girl), Cynthia Rose? Good for you! Go watch Pitch Perfect again then, 'cause you won't be seeing much of them in this film.<br/><br/>Naturally, some newbies had to be put in, but I for one found Hailee Steinfeld to be incredibly unlikable for some reason or another. Her character was very lazily written in my opinion. And I also seem to be the only person that truly despises their 'original' Flashlight song. The whole tune gets on my nerves.<br/><br/>However, not all of it was that bad... DSM made a nice addition to the acapella scene, with some quite awesome mash-ups, and although some of the jokes were being way too exaggerated by the cast for the sake of coming across as funny, there were a few good ones in there. Enough to make my ticket worth the money though? Unfortunately, I'm afraid not."

","It deeply saddens me to write this but I was so disappointed with Pitch Perfect 2 I had really high hopes for this film and personally I think it fell flat. Over all it just never had that vibe that the first film had everything about the film was sort of just thrown together and random the story line was all over the place and actually to be brutally honest I found it abit boring. the humour was exaggerated so much to the point were it was being so forced I just couldn't laugh. The characters yes are good and the acting is good you can't doubt that but really compared to the first one this film is amateur I feel like they were desperate to make a sequel and made it as quick as possible with as little effort. Even the song choices in this film disappointed me the only thing I really liked was the ending apart from the fact I was getting to leave the actual scene was probably the best part it was cute without revealing to much.

","Pitch Perfect 2 (2015): Dir: Elizabeth Banks / Cast: Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Adam DeVine: Recycled sequel to the surprise hit of 2012. This time out instead of the Bella leader puking all over the front row, it is Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy suspended in midair in full view of the president, and an accident occurs that has them suspended. Their coveted title is given to a Russian group. Elizabeth Banks returns as one half of the witty commentators plus she takes the directing chair. She succeeds in presenting viewers with high energy musical numbers that fans of the first film will enjoy. While these segments are innovative, the screenplay is a recycled dud. As with the first film we have another sing off between five groups. We know how this ends and thankfully the music still rings true with a decent ensemble payoff. Anna Kendrick returns as Beca Mitchell who has taken over as leader of the Bellas. She conceals the fact that she has accepted an internship that could threaten her devotion to the group. Rebel Wilson provides many laughs as Fat Amy while also being given a worthy romantic subplot when previous film antagonist Bumper attempts to romance her. Hailee Steinfeld is in the Beca newcomer position here. She writes her own songs and desires to be a Bella because her mother is a legacy member. Brittany Snow reminds viewers of John Belushi in National Lampoon's Animal House when she cannot pull away after seven years of college. Adam DeVine again steals scenes as the now love lorn Bumper. While the screenplay here is far from pitch perfect, the musical numbers are explosive. Score: 6 / 10"

","Not as good as Pitch Perfect 1. It was too rushed and so, consequently, most of the characters lacked depth or story to them.

The songs were mediocre and the only song that I can kinda remember is ""Flashlight."" Hailey Steinfield is awkward in this movie, but not annoying and she is a moderately okay singer. However, there doesn't seem to be as much intimacy as the characters had in the first movie. Additionally, You don't see a lot of Skylar Austin, which was really disappointing. The treblemakers only sang a few forgettable songs. Rebel Wilson's jokes weren't funny. The only thing going for this movie was the modern connection the movie had to the world.

"tomhashes","6","1","4","11 June 2015"," I like it better than the first one
","Having watched ""Pitch Perfect 1"" a day prior to my visit to cinema for ""Pitch Perfect 2"", I did a side-to-side comparison of the two movies. Even though the second movie doesn't improve a lot in terms of plot, I think it's slightly better than the first one. (No spoilers needed, just read the IMDb synopsis of the movie and you already know the whole plot.) A lot of irrelevant subplot got cut out, they focus more on actual acapella, and important stuffs like school and career are touched on in the movie. At least they listened to what the critics said about the first movie. <br/><br/>Am I the only one who DOESN'T LIKE the jokes at all? Many of those are utterly tasteless! The movie has taken a step further: now they have to make fun of Central America, Korea, Germany and Denmark too. Adding insult to injury, transgenders are also being made fun of in the movie. I swear if there is another sequel, Muslims will be their next target. Bookmark me. <br/><br/>The whole movie is filled with those shameful humour, which I find very offensive. I simply DON'T GET why the screenwriter would include such tasteless jokes. They aren't that funny, and they don't serve a purpose. For example, the male commentator is just sexist, but his jokes exist for no reason! He isn't really made to be disagreeable, and he just walks away with his horrible jokes. What does this movie try to prove then? Make offensive jokes and there will be no consequences?<br/><br/>Luckily, the male lead Skylar Astin does not appear too often in the movie. His character is too perfect and blameless there's nothing interesting in him. His character is as two-dimensional as a flat surface. <br/><br/>What makes this movie enjoyable for me is Rebel Wilson and Flula Borg's performance. Rebel single-handedly saved this movie with her innate humour and lovable movie lines. Flula's performance is even more impressive. Perhaps his example will show Hollywood that people from Youtube aren't necessarily wacky and some of them actually have talents! <br/><br/>I was kind of surprised that Obama would agree to appear in this movie, given that this movie isn't that good to begin with. I hope there will not be a ""Pitch Perfect 3"", because enough is enough."

You kind of guess what will happen in the end from the beginning, so there's no surprise there. The story is weak, as it seems to follow too many characters and ends up covering non of them. New faces are added, but the result is the same. Now that I think about it, Pitch Perfect one was kind of better than this one; at least the story was more original. The racist jokes were not funny, the constant joking of the Latin girls situation was pathetic, and the sexist comments were unbearable at some point. So 2 out of 10 for Pitch Perfect two."

","It was just over 18 months ago that we saw 'Pitch Perfect', a movie I enjoyed on several levels. I like good a capella singing, I myself sang in Barbershop chorus and quartets. And much of the movie was filmed in Baton Rouge and the LSU campus, places my wife and I got to know very well during the 1960s and 1970s. <br/><br/>Likewise this installment, 'Pitch Perfect 2.' This one is different because the college girls group had won 3 national championships, and at the start of this movie they get in trouble because that overweight girl (Fat Amy) hanging in silks from the ceiling during a performance for the President of the US has her pants split open as she is upside down and, not wearing underwear gives a sight to the world that no one really wanted to see.<br/><br/>So this movie has them trying to recuperate from that indignity, and being suspended from competition in the US colleges, by deciding to prepare for the international competition in Denmark.<br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is back as Beca and Rebel Wilson, who was my favorite in the first one, is back as Fat Amy. She is just perfect for this role. The new girl is Hailee Steinfeld, who was so good as a 13 year old in 'True Grit"" is the Emily, ""legacy"" freshman who wants to follow in her mom's footsteps. Also back is Brittany Snow as Chloe, plus a host of other I will not attempt to list.<br/><br/>Let's be frank, this is not a high-quality movie. It has rude humor, some toilet humor, and some very silly situations. But none of that keeps it from being a totally fun movie for those who like this genre.

I can't believe the name judge says ""This is what you get when girls go to college"". Fortunately, given the fact that the director is female this time, she is there to save the female species from further insults. Though the offensive and insulting elements in the first film are toned down in this film, the script is still full of cringe worthy lines that make my eyes roll like there's no tomorrow. <br/><br/>I would rather ""Pitch Perfect 2"" be an inspiring and positive film, rather than a comedy that relies on crude humour."

There are a few decent laughs, but the musical numbers are overproduced and bombastic, and the script is simple minded and simply bad. I was embarrassed for the actors.

If you did not like Pitch Perfect, you will not like this film either. If you never saw Pitch Perfect, go watch it and forget this film.

Too bad the comedy world has been infested by idiots who think that being gross and indecent is fun. They made the fat actress, and she accepted it gladly, to be in disgusting situations and say disgusting lines. The tent scene almost makes you puke. Thus the 3 of them made a shameless mockery of the fat ladies. Other actresses too accepted gross lines. Good for Anna Kendrick, she didn't fall for that. The finale was plain stupid. We expected some sort of a stunt to make Bellas be on top, but these film-makers' solution makes no sense. Who in Europe could have been impressed by the history of the group?"
"rocketrider231","4","1","9","1 November 2015"," Completely Lacks the Magic of the First One
","Let me make something clear: I flat out loved the first Pitch Perfect movie with an insane passion. I saw it seven times in theaters, and listened to the soundtrack nonstop. Even today, I give that movie a 9.5/10. After they announced they were making a sequel, I was beyond excited and followed all the news. I was pumped to finally see it, so it really makes me sad to say this, but Pitch Perfect 2 is just....really not a good movie<br/><br/>First of all, I want to point out: Pitch Perfect 2 assumes that the audience has seen the first film, as there is no introduction to any of the characters and they expect you to already be familiar with the characters and events of the first. Therefore, I do believe it is fair to compare it to the first movie, and look at this movie as a sequel rather than its own movie. On a related note, I will also assume everyone is familiar with the names from the first movie throughout the review.<br/><br/>Now, what is Pitch Perfect 2 about? Along with A LOT of subplots, one of the Bellas' performances goes embarrassingly wrong, and because of it they are banned from performing in any competitions, and a deal is made where if the Bellas win the world championship, they will be fully reinstated as an active acapella group. More or less, this is the main plot of the film.<br/><br/>Before getting into any negatives, let's talk about what was good about the movie. The first Pitch Perfect made Anna Kendrick my celebrity crush, and she isn't any less adorable in this than she was in the first. I enjoyed her character's arc much more than anything else about this movie. Then of course, I can't review this movie without talking about the music. Most of the music in this movie is enjoyable and fun to listen to, and the surprising ""song cameos"" are really fun, as they were in the first. Now, this makes me very sad to say, but....that's it for the positives of Pitch Perfect 2.<br/><br/>I think the biggest thing that makes Pitch Perfect 2 suffer is the writing. Aside from all the jokes that fall flat, all of the supporting characters from the first are completely glossed over and are underused. For example, the sex-crazed girl from the first has less than 10 lines throughout the entire film. Of these lines, only one of them is about her sex obsession, which was such a big part of her character. Then Chloe has an exaggerated version of the character arc that Aubrey had in the first: she needs to realize that the Bellas isn't her life and she needs to move on. Then the character who gets the most focus is the newcomer, Emily (played by Hailee Steinfeld). I honestly found her presence to have no point other than to give the movie another subplot to fill in the runtime.<br/><br/>Speaking of subplots, this movie is FULL of them. At least five of the characters have their own arc, all while the main plot is going on. Then there is an extremely underdeveloped ""everyone needs to grow up"" type of arc that involved all the characters and went on and off throughout the movie. Honestly, I felt this arc should have been the main plot movie, or at least the overall tone/message of it. With all the subplots, it almost felt as if the writers wished the first Pitch Perfect was a TV show and tried to condense a season's worth of development and arcs into one movie. Then it also felt like the writers tried to capitalize on the small stuff in the first one that everyone really liked. Everyone liked the ambiguous relationship between Fat Amy and Bumper, so they gave it its own subplot. Everyone loved the acapella announcer who was implied to be a misogynist, so they made him say a sexist comment almost every time he was on screen. Everyone loved the weird remarks that the quiet, Asian girl made, so they completely amped up her weirdness.<br/><br/>As for the directing, I do like Elizabeth Banks as an actress, but I was really not fond of her as a director. The directing with the dancing was a lot more sexualized and less focused than the first one, and there were a handful of slow-motion sequences of the girls partying that served no purpose to the plot and brought the film to a screeching halt.<br/><br/>However, the BIGGEST problem I had with Pitch Perfect 2 was the music. Even though I did mentioned the music as one of my positives, I felt no need to listen to the soundtrack after the movie ended. Even now, I can't remember 4/5ths of the songs that were sung in the movie off the top of my head. That was one of the things that made the first Pitch Perfect so special. After I saw the first one, I bought the soundtrack and could not stop listening to it. With the sequel, there were only two songs throughout the entire movie that I was remotely interested in listening to again. The music does not have the magic that the music in the previous movie did, and because of this, the music can't carry the movie on its own, which would have been possible if it had the charm of the first.<br/><br/>In the end, Pitch Perfect 2 almost made me forget how much I loved the first Pitch Perfect, and is probably my biggest disappointment of 2015. As I watched this movie, my rating went down from a 6/10, to a 5/10, and then finally to a 4/10. I do not see myself re- watching this any time in the future, and I highly recommend just skipping this one entirely and sticking with the first film."

That is as much of a compliment I can give to this silly and dumb sequel. The film again brings the world of a cappella center stage and has non-stop vocal mash-ups that are suppose to entertain, but don't. ￼ Most of the actors reprise their roles to a lesser effect, especially Rebel Wilson playing Fat Amy, who is totally unfunny and unappealing this time around. Anna Kendrick and Hallie Steinfeld bring their individual charm to their parts as the main duo of the Barden College's Bellas. But it is only Elizabeth Banks, the film's director, and John Michael Higgins that bring real laughs and some major wit to their minor parts. Other actors in minor roles may have earned their paycheck but not the laughs from Kay Cannon's desperate screenplay. ￼ Perfect Pitch 2 lacks harmony and tries to celebrate woman's empowerment without much power.

"estreet-eva","6","1","10","17 May 2015"," There's a very good 90 minute movie spread throughout the 115 minute runtime
","While this sequel entertains nearly to the same extent as the original, the film suffers from a surfeit of ambition. Director Elizabeth Banks builds several plots over the nearly 2 hour run time when the audience for the film is more so looking to hear the hits: women referring to each other with a certain 5 letter word starting with the letter ""b"", some dirty talk but not too much dirty action, some singing and a whole lot of snark on top of an ""A"" plot of an underdog singing group besting their betters. Instead we get a little too much soul-searching about graduation and adjusting to change. <br/><br/>A second major problematic decision can be summed by saying ""too much Rebel Wilson and not enough Anna Kendrick"". Much like ""Mater"" in Pixar's cars, Wilson's ""Fat Amy"" character worked well as a seasoning in the original but gets too be a little to much as an more integral part of the plot in the sequel. We get a modestly serious subplot involving her on-again / off-again romance with Adam Devine's ""Bumper"". Much like her character's struggle, Kendrick seems somewhat checked out and the direction doesn't allow her to drive the film as strongly as her lead actress chops allow. <br/><br/>The strength of the film lies in a cornucopia of cameos. In particular Michael Key's turn as Kendrick's music producer brings a host of laughs and a level of gravitas to the film. When does he get to be a lead? Not soon enough if he's this good on film. Other cameos particularly from players from NFL's Green Bay Packers and an un-credited appearance from Parker Posey, makes for a good time. <br/><br/>In short, an entertaining if not stellar sequel to the surprise 2012 hit."

Beyond the lack of logic; we never see of this people study; even when they are about to graduate.

","I was quite shocked when I saw and enjoyed ""Pitch Perfect"". After all, I am in my 50s and not exactly the demographic they were going for in the film. So, because of this, I then decided to try ""Pitch Perfect II""...and I did enjoy the film, though not quite as much as the first film. Much of it was due to Jessica Kendrick's character...who just didn't seem anything like the sweet lady from the first movie.<br/><br/>The film begins with the a capella group at the very top of the world. They are performing on television at the Kennedy Center for the President! However, due to a horrific wardrobe malfunction, the group goes from the darlings of America to hated jerks. The film is about how the girls somehow manage to overcome this AND take on the dreaded German group, DSM at the international championship in Copenhagen.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film was also a big plus in the first movie--the inane commentary by the two announcers (Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgens)...especially Higgens. As for Banks, it wasn't like she was a slouch, as she also directed and co-produced the movie! I also enjoyed seeing many of the familiar characters from the other films...aside from Kendricks', who seemed inexplicably self-centered and grouchy. For this reason alone, I think the original is a tad better....but they are both still very watchable."

","It's been roughly three years since the first Pitch Perfect debuted in theaters, and it's tough to name another comedy released since that can match its quirkiness and originality. Thus, when a sequel was green-lit, the bar was set about as high as a soprano's vocal range. My dilemma was this: how do you recreate such an original concept and differ it enough from the original to not appear redundant? How many weird Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) one-liners can an audience really laugh at until it becomes jaded? Most importantly, will another movie focusing on acapella music appeal to a global audience for the second time in five years? The short answer is, ""yes;"" the long answer is, ""yes, because when you can make acapella music sound this good, anything is possible.""

","The three-time champs Barden Bellas has an embarrassing incident when Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) flashes the audience during a performance for the President. They face punishment and replaced on the tour by the German Das Sound Machine. Beca (Anna Kendrick) starts an internship with a record producer (Keegan-Michael Key) keeping it a secret from the Bellas. Chloe (Brittany Snow) is more driven than ever before. Emily Junk (Hailee Steinfeld) is a legacy and joins the group. They vow to win the World Championship to regain their standing.<br/><br/>I really like the first movie. The girls are lovable. Their friendship is charming. There is just the right amount of humor. This one has made a few changes. Adding Hailee Steinfeld is nice. Elizabeth Banks' directing skills are functional. The girls remain charming. I personally like Rebel Wilson although there may be too much of her in this one. The problem is that the humor seems dumber. I don't mean it's simply broader and more coarse. I mean it seems stupider and less well written. The whole movie feels like a step down."
"chantalroxanne","7","0","1","28 August 2015"," A bit disappointing
","I've rated this 7 out of 10 because there was a lot of effort in this movie and the actors did a great job but I've rated Pitch Perfect 9 out of 10, because the movie was really awesome. The sequel was just not that great. I missed the chemistry between some actors that was definitely there in the first movie. I also thought the storyline was a little blank and Beca, who we all love and who we all want to see more of appeared to be a supporting character. I loved the music and choreography, but even that wasn't nearly as good as it was in Pitch Perfect. I enjoyed the movie and it wasn't a waste of time, but it was a bit disappointing after how brilliant Pitch Perfect was."

","Pitch Perfect 2 is a 2015 American musical comedy film produced and directed by Elizabeth Banks and written by Kay Cannon. It is a sequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect, which was loosely adapted from Mickey Rapkin's non-fiction book, titled Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Chrissie Fit, Kelley Jakle, and Shelley Regner as The Bellas.<br/><br/>It's been three years since the Barden Bellas (Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson) became the first all-female group to win a national title. All seems well until a botched Lincoln Center performance for the president leads to a scandal that strips them of their performing duties, causing internal tension and strife. With the world championships on the horizon in Copenhagen, Denmark, the women must get their act together for their one and only shot at redemption."

","""This could very well be the greatest conflict between America and Germany in our nation's history!""<br/><br/>This sequel to the 2012 surprise hit, Pitch Perfect, marks Elizabeth Bank's feature directorial debut where she reprises her role as Gail, one of the announcers during the a Capella competitions. I was a huge fan and defender of the original film, which I found hilarious and entertaining. It was directed by Jason Moore, who decided to pass on this sequel to direct Sisters, a film coming out later this year starring Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. Screenwriter, Kay Cannon, is back however giving the female characters a strong and independent voice. The original film was a huge vehicle for Rebel Wilson who stole almost every scene she was in and it proved that Anna Kendrick was a solidified star who could be a lead in a comedy. No one really knew she could sing so well and after her success with the Barden Bellas she went on to star in several musicals (Into the Woods and The Last Five Years). She had always delivered strong supporting performances (Up in the Air being my favorite), but after Pitch Perfect her value has sky rocketed. It was an interesting choice to allow the incredibly gifted Elizabeth Banks to direct this sequel because it only adds to the female empowerment in this film. Like most sequels it fails in trying to out perform the original by making the stakes bigger, but it does manage to do some things right to at least make it worthwhile. <br/><br/>Anna Kendrick is back as Beca, one of the leaders of the female a Capella group, Barden Bellas, along with Chloe (Brittany Snow). For the past three years they've been the national champions and have been invited to many events along with the rest of the female members: Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), Stacie (Alexis Knapp), Cynthia (Ester Dean), Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), Jessica (Kelley Jakle), and Flo (Chrissie Fit). During one of those events in which they are invited to sing in front of President Obama and his wife, Fat Amy has a wardrobe malfunction and the Bellas are expelled from the circuit. They are replaced by the extremely talented and flawless German group known as Das Sound Machine (DSM) led by Kommissar (Birgitte Hjorth Sorensen) and Pieter Kramer (Flula Borg). In order to reclaim their status and be invited back into the circuit they find a convenient loophole which allows them to compete in the a Cappella World Cup being held in Denmark. If they want a chance to save the Bellas they will have to do what no other American group has done before: bring home the title. Emily (Hailee Seinfeld), the daughter of a legend from the 80's Bellas, is the latest addition to the group. Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Ben Platt and Anna Camp are also back from the original film playing supporting roles as well as John Michael Higgins who is Gail's co-anchor again. <br/><br/>The formula from the first film is repeated once again, although this time with much higher stakes. Some of the recycled jokes work well, for instance the politically incorrect commentaries from John and Gail, some of Fat Amy's lines (although it isn't as nearly as fresh as the first time we saw her), and the fantastic Riff-Off hosted by David Cross with some great cameos from the Green Bay Packers. I think the riff- off in both films are probably my favorite scenes in each movie, but this one really stood out for me thanks in most part to how great the DSM group sounded. As long as the film centered on the rehearsals, riff-offs, and competitions it was a lot of fun, but what didn't work this time around were the individual filler scenes involving Beca's internship, Fat Amy and Bumper's relationship, Emily and Benji's embarrassing flirtation, and so on. The music was the highlight of the film and it did end on a high note, but the narrative wasn't very appealing. The film could've benefited from a little more DSM.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
